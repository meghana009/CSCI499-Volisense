it has been more than 80 years since the beginning of the keynesian revolution in economics with the publication of john maynard keynes the general theory of employment interest and money in 1936 during those eight decades many defenses and criticisms restatements and refutations have appeared some by many of the most prominent economists of the last century yet untouched it seems is the continuing presumption that there is a macro economy that can be easily inflated or deflated like a balloon through government monetary and fiscal policy bradford delong a professor of economics at the university of california berkeley once more expressed this keynesian view of the economy in a recent article titled debt derangement syndrome he argues that all the hue and cry over the growing u s national debt is misplaced as long as interest rates are low so the cost of government borrowing is relatively cheap and as long as there are willing buyers of government bonds so debt is easily floated there is really no need for policy makers economists or voters to be concerned with the national debt now going above 22 trillion having low interest rates in the present means that interest payments on the debt in the future will not seriously absorb a large amount of tax revenues collected at that time having willing borrowers means that lending to the government seems more profitable and secure than loans to borrowers in the private sector so it must represent worthwhile uses of loanable funds in no way harmful to the economic health of the economy see my articles why government deficits and debt do matter and debts and deficits are out of control but why would the government want to float that debt in the first place here we go back to the keynesian old time religion the economy goes through periods of growth and periods of recession and the recessions mean economic waste in the form of idle production capacity and unemployed workers plus the market economy the keynesian refrain insists is not always easily self correcting leaving the economy with levels of output below full employment capacity which could only be reached through government stimulating private sector spending or through money creation professor delong finds it very hard to believe that anyone would take exception to government doing its job of keeping the economy on a full employment even keel whenever the private sector stops spending enough to keep unemployment low and jobs easy to find the public sector needs to fill the gap in aggregate demand the normal way to do this is for the central bank to buy bonds for cash inducing those who then have the extra cash to boost their spending but if and when interest rates approach rock bottom the private sector s desire to spend extra cash rather than hold it ebbs in that situation monetary stimulus should be aided by fiscal stimulus in other words the government directly buys stuff the superficiality of aggregate demand and supply the fundamental flaw in professor delong s view as in john maynard keynes 1936 book is the idea that there exists a macro economy the two sides of which are composed of aggregate demand and aggregate supply if employment is less than full and output less than its maximum potential then people in the aggregate are spending too little on goods and services in the aggregate increase aggregate demand and you can bring about the desired increase in aggregate supply until full employment is restored even at the time that keynes book first appeared there were critics who challenged the very premises of keynes framework of aggregate demand and aggregate supply for instance in his review of the general theory in late 1936 the austrian born economist joseph a schumpeter said mr keynes speaks of aggregate demand in the one case and aggregate supply in the other and makes them yield a unique point of intersection but there is little justification for this extension of the marshallian cross to an analytical dimension to which it does not apply the university of minnesota economist arthur w marget who in the period between the two world wars was considered the most knowledgeable scholar on the history of monetary theories and policies over the centuries and in all the leading western languages insisted in his detailed book the theory of prices vol 2 1942 it is a fundamental methodological proposition of modern versions of the general theory of value that all categories with respect to supply and demand must be unequivocally related to categories which present themselves to the minds of those economizing individuals or individual business firms whose calculations make the supplies and demands realized in the market what they are the type of problem raised by the necessity for establishing a relation between these microeconomic decisions and these macroeconomic processes is not solved by the arbitrary introduction of an aggregate supply function and an aggregate demand function for industry as a whole in defiance of the fact that neither of these functions deals with elements which enter directly into the calculations of the individual entrepreneurs whose microeconomic decisions and actions make macroeconomic processes what they are on the contrary it must be said of such an attempt at solution that it misconceives entirely the true nature of the relation between microeconomic analysis and macroeconomic analysis the misplaced construction of aggregate demand and supply indeed it can be argued that the very notion of an aggregate demand or an aggregate supply is inconsistent with the very definitions of demand for and supply of a good supply is usually understood to mean units of a good that are viewed as perfectly interchangeable for desired purposes by a decision maker it is this perfect interchangeability from the market actor s point of view that distinguishes one good from another and on the basis of which the economic analyst then distinguishes between and elaborates on the relationships connecting complement and substitute goods through which the various direct and indirect ramifications of changes in market conditions and prices may be theoretically analyzed and understood now for analytical purposes of course it seems equally relevant and conceptually legitimate to distinguish between categories of goods between which market actors may and must choose because of the inescapable scarcity of these goods or the factors of production with which these competing goods may be produced at the marginal cost of forgoing some quantity or use of the other thus it seems reasonable for various theoretical purposes to refer to the relative demands for and supplies of consumer goods versus producer goods capital or between the competing uses applications and trade offs in production between capital and labor but it is also the case that there are many instances in which even these more generalized categorizations of goods are too aggregated such as when it becomes useful or essential to distinguish between skilled and unskilled labor or various different types of skilled labor among which market participants make distinctions for purposes of their production and employment decisions the same applies to different types of qualities of or uses for land or different types of and uses for more narrowly defined forms of capital since in all these instances there may exist choice relevant relationships of complementarity and substitutability between the uses of various capital goods that both market actors and economic analysts should recognize for greater logical and factual completeness at the microeconomic level therefore it is possible to distinguish between the demands for and supplies of say hats and shoes horses and cows bottling machines and cookie making equipment these demands and supplies appear to be and for choice purposes are independent from each other precisely because the chooser considers them different from each other for alternative goals or ends in mind and the supplies appear to be and for choice purposes are independent from each other since they compete for some of the same scarce means through which one supply is increased or decreased relative to another but when the level of aggregation is taken to the demand for all goods as a whole in relation to the supply of all goods as a whole one has aggregated away most if not virtually all of the choice theoretic relationships in the context of which real decisions and actions are made in the market in fact aggregate demand and aggregate supply become conceptually meaningless and factually nonexistent the statistical illusion of an objective price level the same applies to the undue attention to the aggregate approach to the general price level here too there is a conceptual misdirection an instance of what is sometimes called the fallacy of misplaced concreteness the fallacy of treating a concept as if it represented something real or objective in the social or economic world the price level is merely a statistical creation resulting from a selection summing and averaging of a series of actual prices of specific goods in particular markets at a moment in time the price level does not really exist the structure of relative prices that has emerged from the interactions of individual demanders for and suppliers of specific goods bought and sold do exist they are the basis upon and the context in which individuals in the marketplace make their consumption and production decisions as american economist benjamin anderson noted already back in the 1920s the general price level is after all merely a statistician s tool of thought businessmen and bankers often look at index s as indicating price trends but no businessman makes use of index numbers in his bookkeeping his bookkeeping runs in terms of the particular prices and cost that his business is concerned with satisfactory business conditions are dependent upon proper relations among groups of prices not upon an average of prices it should be fairly clear that all the real economic relationships in the market the actual structure of relative prices and wages and all the multitude of distinct and interconnected patterns of actual demands and supplies are submerged and lost in the macroeconomic aggregates see my article benjamin anderson and the false goal of price level stabilization balanced markets ensure full employment balanced production and sustainable employments in the economy as a whole require coordination and balance between the demands for and supplies of all the particular goods and services in each of the specific markets in which they are bought and sold and parallel to this there must be comparable coordination and balance between the business demands for resources capital equipment and different types of labor in each production sector of the market and those supplying them such coordination balance and sustainable employment require adaptation to the ever changing circumstances of market conditions through adjustment of prices and wages and to shifts in supplies and demands in and between the various parts of the economy in other words it is these rightly balanced and coordinated patterns between supplies and demands and their accompanying structures of relative prices and wages that ensure full employment and efficient and effective use of available resources and capital meaning entrepreneurs and businesspersons are constantly tending to produce the goods we the consumers want and desire and at prices that cover competitive costs of production all this is lost from view when reduced to that handful of macro aggregates of total demand and total supply and a statistical average price level for all goods relative to a statistical average wage level for all workers in the economy see my article macro aggregates hide the real market processes at work the keynesian aggregate big spender unbalances markets in this simplified and indeed simplistic keynesian type view of things all that needs to be done from the government s policy perspective is to run budget deficits or create money through the banking system to push up aggregate demand to ensure a targeted rise in the general price level so profit margins in general are widened relative to the general wage level so employment in general will be expanded we can think of a keynesian inspired government as a big spender who comes into a town and proceeds to increase aggregate demand in this community by buying goods prices of final outputs rise profit margins widen relative to the general wage level and the prices of other general costs private businesses in general employ more workers and purchase or hire other inputs and aggregate supply expands to a point of desired full employment an additional core error and misconception in the macro aggregate approach is its failure to appreciate and focus on the real impact of changes in the money supply and government spending that by necessity result in an unsustainable deviation of prices profits and resources and labor uses from a properly balanced coordination the end result of which is more of the very unemployment that the monetary and spending stimulus was meant to cure let s return to our example of the big spender who comes into a town the townspeople discover that our big spender introduces a greater demand into the community but not for goods in general instead he announces his intention of building a new factory on the outskirts of the town he leases a particular piece of land and pays for the first few months rent he hires a particular construction company to build the factory and the construction company in turn not only increases its demand for workers but orders new equipment which in turn results in the equipment manufacturers adding to their workforce to fulfill the new demand for construction machinery our big spender trumpeting the wonders for the community resulting from his new spending starts hiring clerical staff and sales personnel in anticipation of fulfilling orders once the factory is completed and producing its new output the new and higher incomes earned by the construction and machinery workers as well as the newly employed clerical and sales workers raise the demand for various and specific consumer and other goods upon which these people want to spend their new and increased wages the businesses in the town catering to these particular increased consumer demands now attempt to expand their supplies and perhaps hire more retail store employees over time the prices of all of these goods and services will start to rise but not at the same time or to the same degree they will go up in a temporal sequence that more or less tends to match the sequence of the changed demands for those goods and services resulting from the new money injected by the big spender into this community aggregate spending needs to continue and increase now whether some of the individual workers drawn into this specific pattern of new employments were previously unemployed or whether they had to be attracted away from existing jobs they already held in other parts of the market their continued employments in these particular jobs depend on the big spender continuing to spend his new money time period after time period in the same way and in sufficient amounts to ensure that the workers he has drawn into his factory project are not attracted to other employments because of the rise in all of these alternative demands if the interdependent patterns of demands and supplies and the structure of interconnected relative prices and wages generated by the big spender s spending are to be maintained his injection of new money into the community must continue and at an increasing rate an alternative imagery might be the dropping of a pebble into a pond from the epicenter where the stone has hit the surface a sequence of ripples will be sent out that will be reversed when the ripples finally hit the surrounding shore and will then finally cease when there are no longer any new disturbances affecting the surface but new pebbles must be continuously dropped into the pond and with increasing force if the resulting waves coming back from the shore are not to disrupt the ripple pattern the austrian analysis of inflationary processes there is no doubt that this way of analyzing the dynamics of how monetary expansion affects market activities is more complex than the simplistic keynesian style of macro aggregate analysis but as joseph a schumpeter highlighted in his posthumous history of economic analysis 1954 the austrian way of emphasizing the behavior or decisions of individuals and of defining the exchange value of money with respect to individual commodities rather than with respect to a price level of one kind or another has its merits particularly in the analysis of an inflationary process it tends to replace a simple but inadequate picture by one which is less clear cut but more realistic and richer in results and indeed it is this austrian analysis of monetary expansion with its resulting impact on prices employment and production especially as developed in the 20th century by ludwig von mises and friedrich a hayek that explains why the keynesian originated macro aggregate approach is fundamentally flawed hayek once explained the logic of the process of monetary inflation the influx of the additional money into the system always takes place at some particular points there will always be some people who have more money to spend before the others who these people are will depend on the particular manner in which the increase in the money stream is being brought about it may be spent in the first instance by government on public works or increased salaries or it may be first spent by investors mobilizing cash balances for borrowing for that purpose it may be spent in the first instance on securities or investment goods on wages or on consumers goods the process will take very different forms according to the initial source or sources of the additional money stream but one thing all these different forms of the process will have in common that the different prices will rise not at the same time but in succession and that so long as the process continues some prices will always be ahead of others and the whole structure of relative prices therefore will be very different from what the pure theorist describes as an equilibrium position an inflationary process in other words brings about distortions mismatches and imbalanced relationships between different supplies and demands and the accompanying artificial relationships between the structure of relative prices and wages only last for as long as the inflationary process continues and often only at an accelerating rate or as hayek expressed it any attempt to create full employment by drawing labor into occupations where they will remain employed only so long as the credit expansion continues creates the dilemma that either credit expansion must continue indefinitely which means inflation or that when it stops unemployment will be greater than it would be if the temporary increase in employment had never taken place the stimulus cure creates more market problems once the inflationary monetary expansion ends or slows down market participants discover that the artificially created supply and demand patterns and relative price and wage structure are inconsistent with noninflationary market conditions in our example of the big spender one day the townsfolk discover that he was really a con artist who had only phony counterfeit money to spend and whose deceptive promises and temporary spending drew them into all of those particular activities and employments they now find out that the construction projects begun cannot be completed the employments created cannot be maintained and the investments started in response to the phony money the big spender injected cannot be completed many of the townspeople now have to stop what they had been doing and try to discover other demanders other employers and other possible investment opportunities in the face of the truth of the big spender s false incentives for them to do things they should not have been doing from the start the unemployment and underutilization of resources that activist monetary policy by governments are supposed to reduce in fact set the stage for an inescapable readjustment period of more unemployment and temporary idle resources when many of the affected supplies and demands have to be rebalanced at newly established market based prices if employments and productions are to be sustainable and consistent with actual consumer demands and the availability of scarce resources in the post inflationary environment thus recessions are the inevitable result of prior and unsustainable inflationary booms and even the claimed modest and controlled rate of 2 percent annual price inflation that has become the new panacea for economic stability and growth in the minds of central bankers can bring in its wake a wrong twist to many of the microeconomic and price wage relationships that are the substance of the real economy beneath the superficial macro aggregates but as long as the keynesian and general macroeconomic way of looking at the market in terms of economy wide aggregates continues to prevail it will be difficult to put economic policy back on the right track a track that will lead to the understanding that it is government deficit spending and monetary creation that cause the unsustainable booms that result in the economic downturns bringing about the rising unemployment that economists like bradford delong are so concerned about only by rejecting the type of policy prescriptions proposed by professor delong and those who think like him can economy wide fluctuations be reduced or maybe even eliminated in their occurrence
in the last few weeks i ve been seeing a lot of buzz about modern monetary theory aka mmt and most of what i m seeing is reductionist to the point of absurdity when i see critics of mmt talking about it they re mostly using mmt as a shorthand for saying unbridled fiscal expansion without any concern for deficits i think this has been a very poor and uninformed debate my guess is that it s been sparked by the public policy views of people like alexandria ocasio cortez given the objections some people have to her as a political figure i could be wrong but as someone who s been following this evolving conversation for several years i thought i d tell you how i see it my introduction to mmt before i start in let me tell you where i m coming at this from i have a lot of friends in the mmt community and i have great respect for the leading economists but i am on the outside looking in about a decade ago my friend marshall auerback introduced me to the mmt crowd the first economist he introduced me to was randy wray and the way i remember it i was pretty rude to randy about what he was saying i ve told randy this subsequently and he s told me he didn t think i was rude at all which i appreciate but in my mind what he was saying was a shock and i was rude it s only when i looked at what he was saying with an open mind that i began to process it and critique it objectively and i ended up liking a lot of what i heard while i would never call myself an mmt adherent i do think mmt does a pretty good job of outlining the various pieces of the macroeconomy and the constraints on fiat currency issuing governments my biggest criticisms of mmt are three fold i don t think mmt takes enough into account the political and legislative realities of using fiscal policy to control inflation i know the trauma of the 1970s is long gone but 15 8 or even 5 inflation can really hurt people especially if wages lag mmt s adherents often sell mmt as a prescriptive school of thought rather than a descriptive one they come out of the gate with all sorts of big spending policy proposals they say are based on mmt well that loses half of the audience right from the start even me people need to understand how the economics fits together first then they can buy into the prescriptions and even then they may not buy the policy prescriptions mmt adherents hawk for me mmt is not about policy prescriptions it s about a description of how an advanced economy works for a fiat currency issuer finally its acolytes can be pretty rabid in an almost cult like way it s disconcerting because if you criticize mmt a whole swarm of what almost seem like mmt groupies comes and attacks you new keynesians say they hate engaging with mmt economists even though they share a keynesian kinship because the economists online followers are often aggressive and mean spirited so that s my beef here s my dummies guide mmt s forefathers let me start here randy wrote a piece last january whose introduction started like this in recent years an approach to macroeconomics called modern money theory mmt has been developed in my view it is a synthesis of several strands of heterodox largely post keynesian thought it draws heavily on the work of georg friedrich knapp a mitchell innes john maynard keynes abba lerner hyman minsky and wynne godley to integrate the state theory of money endogenous money functional finance financial instability hypothesis and sectoral balance approaches i would characterize it the way that minsky 1977 characterized his own attempt at a synthesis it stands on the shoulders of giants l randall wray a comparison of the evolution of the positions of hyman minsky and abba lerner jan 2018 so in terms of mmt for dummies we can stop right there all i m going to use is knapp for state money or chartalism innes for the credit theory of money keynes for macro lerner for functional finance minsky for private credit and godley to describe how the sectors of the economy interact basically one can boil it down to those six economists and those six areas let s see how quickly i can do that john maynard keynes macro on a macro level mmt is keynesian or better yet post keynesian to distinguish it from new keynesians the name comes from john maynard keynes the 20th century british economist who has probably the most famous economist name in the world keynesian economics can be described as a macroeconomic school in which aggregate demand for goods and services plays a predominant role importantly according to keynes the economy can get into a depressed state where only the government has the purchasing power and wherewithal to boost aggregate demand durably his advice during the great depression was increased government spending to boost total spending economy wide and today keynesians often advocate similar policies so when certain public spending programs advocated by mmt adherents are called keynesian on steroids that s where it s coming from that s all i m going to say about keynes since he s a known figure i want to get into the other five mmt forefathers instead to show you how mmt differs abba lerner functional finance abba lerner was a 20th century russian born british economist who studied at the lse under friedrich von hayek he is the father of functional finance and i see his views as augmenting or even replacing keynes views for mmt here s how stephanie kelton described his view in 1999 what lerner advocated was the maintenance of true full employment i e employment for all who want to work which he believed could be attained without setting off inflation while his views regarding the conditions under which inflationary pressures might begin to emerge initially differed from keynes lerner in his economics of employment appears to have moved closer to keynes on this matter in keynes view inflation was not to be associated with price increases taking place before full employment i e zero involuntary unemployment had been reached indeed expansionary policy was considered inflationary only if it spent itself entirely on an increase in prices with no further stimulus to output translation lerner was saying that getting to full employment is the key until you get there you shouldn t worry about government spending causing inflation this is the reason that you hear mmt economists like pavlina tcherneva touting a job guarantee it gets you to full employment and keeps you there the controversy with a job guarantee is that it would prove disruptive to the existing relationship between capital and labor especially for lower salaried workers but there s a more controversial part to lerner here s stephanie again the first law of functional finance is designed to eliminate a shortfall in total spending while the second decrees the specific manner in which the deficiency is to be funded specifically the second law calls for the sale of interest bearing government debt only in the event that private spending would otherwise generate excessive aggregate demand under ordinary circumstances lerner argued it is expected that capitalist economies will suffer from insufficient rather than excessive aggregate demand so that it would not be necessary to offer bonds in exchange for money as a means of tempering inflationary pressures instead lerner believed that bonds should be sold to the central bank or to private banks on conditions which permit the banks to issue new credit money based on their additional holdings of government securities must be considered for our purposes as printing money translation you don t have to sell treasury bonds at all just print money credit accounts directly that s a pretty controversial view and i think this is the one that is most pilloried here s stephanie again keynesians blinder and solow 1973 1976 buiter 1977 tobin 1961 generally agree that the economic consequences of borrowing and printing money can differ substantially from those obtained when government spending is financed solely by contemporaneous taxation inspired by christ 1967 1968 blinder and solow 1973 investigated the optimal method by which to finance government deficit spending concluding that the expansionary effects from borrowing would outweigh the stimulative effects of financing by creating new money although keynesians recognize that there will be different macroeconomic consequences depending on the manner in which the shortfall is made up they do not generally share lerner s preference for printing money to finance the deficit post keynesians and institutionalists however tend to be more amenable to lerner s position translation if the government is spending money to boost aggregate demand it is doing so by deficit spending you can deficit spend by creating lots of government debt or in lerner s view you could credit accounts directly with government ious this is where our third economist georg knapp comes into play knapp state money georg friedrich knapp was a late 19th to early 20th century german economist in 1905 he published the state theory of money unlike in the metalist view where gold and silver are money in knapp s world money is simply a token that has no real value what gives it value to buy things in the mmt world t is the decision of the state to accept at state pay offices and not legal tender laws that creates a chartal money as randy put it in 2014 basically according to mmt your pound notes your dollar bills your euro coins have no intrinsic value they re tokens they only acquire value because the government says so the government says you owe me taxes and you must pay these taxes using the money we create and that proclamation alone makes state money valuable mmt says legal tender laws only entrench state money s use in effect you are paying government with your hard work via the currency you work then receive currency for your goods and services and then pay a portion of that money to the government as tax in the currency the government dictates or face the penalty of law notice that if the government is using tokens it creates out of thin air as money with no intrinsic value any debt the government has in that currency is effectively just an iou treasury bonds for example are simply us government ious since the us government can manufacture infinite amounts of dollars if it so chooses this is why proponents of mmt say a sovereign currency issuing government has an unlimited ability to repay any and all debts in its own currency most people get this the debate is what the consequences of manufacturing too much money are is it inflation currency depreciation or are there almost no consequences until you hit full employment an increasing number of people are saying there are minimal short term consequences including warren buffett but where these people take issue with mmt is they think mmt downplays the longer term inflation and currency risks as a side note if you accept that fiat money is an iou then the interest that government pays on bonds is like a gift to so called rentiers bonds real purpose then is to serve as a means of helping the central bank hit an interest rate target more than anything else if you drop rates to zero where they are in japan the rentier subsidy falls away i think warren mosler makes this assertion most amongst mmters the caricatured quip is that mmt says deficits don t matter a nuanced back and forth goes like this federal reserve chairman jerome powell took a shot this week at the philosophy known as modern monetary theory in a senate hearing i have heard pretty extreme claims attributed to that framework and i don t know whether that s fair or not said powell the idea that deficits don t matter for countries that can borrow in their own currency is just wrong i think u s debt is fairly high at a level of gdp and much more importantly than not it s growing faster than gdp one leading advocate of mmt stephanie kelton the former economics adviser to the 2016 bernie sanders presidential campaign and professor at stony brook university told cnbc on thursday that he s looking at it wrong what chairman powell is saying when he says i don t believe that it s true that deficits don t matter well neither do i deficits do matter but they don t matter in the ways we ve conventionally been thinking about them she said the way we usually think about a deficit is that it is evidence of excessive spending and that s just wrong evidence of excessive spending is inflation so i would argue you don t have a deficit problem or debt problem unless you have an inflation problem translation mmt says the deficit results from an accounting identity it s a measure an outcome that shouldn t even be the target of policy the real problem is inflation and that comes from spending even when all real resources capital and labour have been exhausted innes credit theory of money here s our fourth mmt forefather alfred mitchell innes he was a 19th century british economist and a leading proponent of the view that money and credit or money and debt were effectively the same thing here s how he put it the credit theory is this that a sale and purchase is the exchange of a commodity for credit from this main theory springs the sub theory that the value of credit or money does not depend on the value of any metal or metals but on the right which the creditor acquires to payment that is to say to satisfaction for the credit and on the obligation of the debtor to pay his debt and conversely on the right of the debtor to release himself from his debt by the tender of an equivalent debt owed by the creditor and the obligation of the creditor to accept this tender in satisfaction of his credit so like knapp he rejected the concept that gold and silver are money but whereas knapp was focused on where money got its value innes was focused on the broad definition of money after all as soon as the bank grants me a loan it creates a deposit for me i can withdraw from that account immediately that s money but it s also debt that i have to pay back the more loans banks grant the more deposits those debtors have to spend or invest but the more they have to repay as well mmt holds this view minsky private credit the fact that debt is effectively money creates an inherent instability the more credit that gets created the more people can invest and spend and so the economy grows faster but this can only go on for so long more credit in the economy also means more debt must be repaid and so at some point someone will run short of money and be unable to repay when enough people fail to repay banks are forced to cut back on new credit supply and the economy slows or contracts but according to the late american economist hyman minsky this business cycle is exacerbated by animal spirits randy wrote about minsky s view bold added for emphasis by me with his 1975 book minsky distinguishes between a price system for current output and one for asset prices current output prices can be taken as determined by cost plus mark up set at a level that will generate profits there is a second price system that for assets that can be held through time except for money the most liquid asset these assets are expected to generate a stream of income and possibly capital gains the important point is that the prospective income stream cannot be known with certainty thus is subject to subjective expectations minsky argued that the amount one is willing to pay depends on the amount of external finance required greater borrowing exposes the buyer to higher risk of insolvency this is why borrower s risk must also be incorporated into demand prices investment can proceed only if the demand price exceeds supply price of capital assets because these prices include margins of safety they are affected by expectations concerning unknowable outcomes in a recovery from a severe downturn margins are large as expectations are muted over time if an expansion exceeds pessimistic projections these margins prove to be larger than necessary thus margins will be reduced to the degree that projects are generally successful here we can insert minsky s famous distinction among financing profiles hedge prospective income flows cover interest and principle speculative near term income flows will cover only interest and ponzi near term receipts are insufficient to cover interest payments so that debt increases over the course of an expansion these financial stances evolve from largely hedge to include ever rising proportions of speculative and even ponzi positions translation stability breeds instability the longer any business cycle continues the more risks we take the more risks we take the more likely the whole thing falls apart as someone who likes ludwig von mises malinvestment dictum minsky rings true mmt looks at this as the core way to view private credit dynamics wynne godley sectoral balances one way to tell that private credit dynamics have got out of whack is the sectoral balances for example look back to the 1990s a lot of people say us budget surpluses led to low interest rates that fuelled a boom and they say that was a good thing mmt would say the causality goes the other way i e the clinton surpluses were due largely to a booming economy fuelled by a capital spending binge in the telecom sector and business more generally mixed with an unsustainable decrease in household savings that s a bad thing a perfect example of stability breeding instability and mmt got the idea of looking at things this way from the late british economist wynne godley the ft s martin wolf explained godley s insight this way in 2012 in a now deleted blog post i look at this through the lens of sectoral financial balances an analytical framework learned from the work of the late wynne godley the essential idea is that since income has to equal expenditure for the economy as a whole which is the same thing as saying that savings equals investment so the sums of the difference between income and expenditures of each of the sectors of the economy must also be zero these differences can also be described as financial balances thus if a sector is spending less than its income it must be accumulating net claims on other sectors the crucial point is that since sectoral balances must sum to zero a rise in the deficit of one sector must be matched by an offsetting change in the others it follows that if the fiscal deficit is increasing the sum of the surpluses of the other sectors of the economy must be increasing in a precisely offsetting manner these are tautologies but the virtue of this framework is that it forces us to ask what drives what are for example fiscal deficits in the us or uk driving the surpluses in other sectors or are the surpluses in the other sectors driving the fiscal deficit we can obtain answers by examining what behaviour is changing translation when the private sector needs money to pay down debts it moves aggressively toward a net savings position and that likely means bigger government deficits in addition to wolf and the mmt economists goldman sachs economist jan hatzius also uses the wynne godley sectoral balances approach my take i think most of this is within the mainstream the part that stands out like a sore thumb is the part from abba lerner where he says governments should simply print money when boosting aggregate demand if you combine that with knapp s theory of state money anything is affordable in money terms every single controversy involving mmt revolves around this one concept boosting demand with new spending or by cutting taxes and thus ballooning the deficit and doing so without seeming to worry about the deficit consequences even keynesians say you have to worry about the consequences of deficits less now than at other times but you still have to worry i reckon mmt folks would respond that money is a token as a result they would say financial resources are infinite for the state it s the deployment of real resources labor and machines that matter in that view so until you near full employment and inflation begins to pick up it s full steam ahead moreover mmt folks might also say there isn t a requirement to advance fund any major investment when you buy a house you get a mortgage when tesla builds a factory in china it gets a loan from the chinese government mmters would say its no different here for the government also in terms of what s happening with the excess reserves that quantitative easing produced right now scott fullwiler has a very important paper on this it shows the strength of mmt economists on central bank operational issues in that same vein of excellence on central banks operational issues the mmt folks have been very good in predicting that supply demand issues have almost no bearing on interest rates for me this is the most market relevant part of the school of thought they say that in a fiat currency world where the currency floats freely so called bond vigilantes have very limited power domestically state money is the safe asset because there s no default risk and so yields there are always the lowest for any fixed income asset and bond vigilantes have basically been powerless to bid those prices down too far because the prices and yields reflect consensus estimates of what the central bank will do with base rates going back to japan if bond investors understand that there is no inflation that would force the central bank to lift rates for ten years then 10 year rates will be near zero and in japan they are investors that don t like that can simply get out of japan and sell yen and the currency adjusts accordingly that s how it will work in the us too finally many of the constraints that mmters get called out on are legal and institutional in nature if you change the law you change what constraints government is under ostensibly those legal and institutional constraints exist for a reason like fear of inflation or currency depreciation in the end i think it s better to look at the real constraints inflation and currency depreciation rather than fight over artificial operational constraints i m a leveraged finance guy so i think it s sort of like what a private equity company does with a company s balance sheet with its debt ebitda ratio not looking at the company as it is today but how it could be when refinanced so that s my stab at describing mmt i m not sure what the mmters will think of my description but i m sure i ll find out soon if you leave out the part about not worrying about how to pay for deficit spending keynesians would be 100 onboard with mmt people like paul krugman say this all the time libertarians and conservatives simply dismiss keynes view of boosting aggregate demand with government deficit spending the closest they get is with supply side economics where tax cuts increase investment as opposed to consumption in terms of who i find most compelling of mmt s economist forefathers this is my rank order at least for now minsky innes godley knapp keynes lerner let me know if that was useful
with u s government deficits increasing again and big spending plans coming from potential democratic candidates for president we thought it would be prudent to have a conversation with stephanie kelton she s a proponent of modern monetary theory mmt the economic rational cited by rising political stars like rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y kelton currently works as a professor of public policy and economics at stony brook university previously she served as chief economist for the democrats on the u s senate budget committee and was a senior economic advisor to bernie sanders 2016 presidential campaign below is the q a with kelton edited for time and clarity she was being interviewed for a cnbc digital video jordan malter cnbc you wrote an article in the new york times it was titled how we think about the deficit is mostly wrong what s the conventional thinking and why is it wrong stephanie kelton so the conventional thinking about budget deficits i think tends to be that people look at a deficit and they think that it s evidence of overspending they think it s evidence the government is mismanaging its books that it s done something wrong evidence of overspending is inflation so what is the budget deficit i like to do this by using an example i think it helps people if you think of the government deficit as the difference between what the government spends into the economy and what it taxes back out then imagine a government that spends 100 into the u s economy but it only taxes 90 back out we label that a government deficit and we record that on the government s books but what we forget to do is pay attention to the fact that there s now 10 somewhere in the economy that wouldn t have been there otherwise that is put there by the government s deficit in other words their deficits become our surpluses so when we talk about the government having all this red ink we have to remind ourselves that their red ink becomes our black ink and their deficits are our surpluses malter so do deficits and aggregate debt matter at all at some point can a country have too much debt kelton so the deficit definitely matters it s just that it matters in ways that we re not normally taught to understand normally i think people tend to hear deficit and think it s something that we should strive to eliminate that we shouldn t be running budget deficits that they re evidence of fiscal irresponsibility and the truth is the deficit can be too big evidence of a deficit that s too big would be inflation but the deficit can also be too small it can be too small to support demand in the economy and evidence of a deficit that is too small is unemployment so deficits can be too big but they can also be too small and the right level of the deficit is the one that gets you a balanced overall economy the one that allows you to achieve high levels of employment and low inflation malter where does growth play into this you re saying high unemployment means that the deficit might be too small is low growth also a sign of the deficit being too small kelton well it depends because you ve got to balance the potential benefits from higher growth against the risks of higher inflation and so you may see a slow growing economy that has close to full employment and inflation at about 2 percent the question is then should you expand fiscal policy should you run bigger budget deficits in order to boost growth so what is the objective what is the proper policy goal i think the right policy goal is to maintain a balanced economy where you re at full employment and you re guarding against an acceleration in inflation risk economists tend to understand that the kinds of things that you can do to boost longer term growth are investments in things like education infrastructure r d those are the sorts of things that tend to accelerate productivity growth so that longer term real gdp growth can be higher so there are ways in which the government can make investments today that increase deficits today that produce higher growth tomorrow and build in the extra capacity to absorb those higher deficits malter i want to talk a little bit more about the policy proposals a little bit later but before that modern monetary theory mmt can you explain that kelton mmt starts with a really simple observation and that is that the u s dollar is a simple public monopoly in other words the united states currency comes from the united states government it can t come from anywhere else and therefore it can never run out of money it cannot face a solvency problem bills coming due that it can t afford to pay it never has to worry about finding the money in order to be able to spend it doesn t need to go and raise taxes or borrow money before it is able to spend so what that means is that the federal government is nothing like a household in order for households or private businesses to be able to spend they ve got to come up with the money right and the federal government doesn t have to behave like a household in fact it becomes really destructive for the economy if the government tries to behave like a household you and i are using the u s dollar states and municipalities the state of kansas or detroit they re also using the u s dollar private businesses are using the dollar the federal government of the united states is issuing our currency and so we have a very different relationship to the currency that means that in order to spend the government doesn t have to do what a household or a private business has to do find the money the government can simply spend the money into the economy and when it does the rest of us end up receiving that spending as part of our income malter how much is too much the cbo estimates that if things remain unchanged the debt will be 152 percent of gdp in 2048 that will be the highest in the nation s history is that too much kelton let s remember what the national debt is the national debt is nothing more than a historical record of all of the dollars that the government spent into the economy and didn t tax back that are currently being held in the form of safe u s treasurys that s what the national debt is so the question about whether the debt is too big or too small or whether it might get too big at some point in the future is really a question about whether that s too many safe assets for people to hold 10 20 50 years from now if you think about what happened after world war ii when the u s national debt went in excess of 100 percent close to 125 percent of gdp if we were talking about it the way we talk about it today as burdening future generations as posing a grave national security risk we would have to scratch our heads and say wait a minute do we think that our grandparents burdened the next generation with all of those bonds that were sold during world war ii to win the war build the strongest middle class produce the longest period of peacetime prosperity the golden age of capitalism all of that followed in the wake of fighting world war ii increasing deficits massively increasing the size of the national debt and of course the next generation inherits those bonds they don t become burdens to the next generation they become their assets so it s impossible really to put a number nobody can how much debt is too much debt if you look at japan today you see a country where the debt to gdp ratio is something like 240 percent well above orders of magnitude above where the u s is today or even where the u s is forecast to be in the future and so the question is how is japan able to sustain a debt of that size wouldn t it have an inflation problem wouldn t it lead to rising interest rates wouldn t this be destructive in some way and the answer to all of those questions as japan has demonstrated now for years is simply no japan s debt is close to 240 percent of gdp almost a quadrillion that s a very big number yen long term interest rates are very close to zero there s no inflation problem and so despite the size of the debt there are no negative consequences as a result and i think japan teaches us a really important lesson really the only potential risk with the national debt increasing over time is inflation and to the extent that you don t believe the u s has a long term inflation problem you shouldn t believe that the u s is facing a long term debt problem watch next recession global slowdown real but u s economy resilient says stephanie kelton watch now malter isn t it a valid concern that printing more money to pay for spending especially when we re not in a recession will result in inflation and destroy the spending power of regular people kelton if congress got together and wrote a budget and decided they were going to put trillions of additional dollars into something like infrastructure investment noting that our national infrastructure is approaching kind of third world standards and they said let s put several trillion dollars in and not offset any of that new spending they just said let s spend 3 trillion more into the u s economy would that be problematic the answer is almost certainly yes because we have an economy that has approached full employment i don t believe we re there but the question is always how much capacity does the economy have to absorb any new spending without prices beginning to rise so look the republicans passed the tax cuts and we now know that that added about 1 9 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years there were people at the time who said the u s economy cannot take 1 9 trillion in fiscal stimulus we re at full employment if we do this it s going to create all kinds of problems interest rates will spike inflation will accelerate growth will slow none of those things happened and the answer to the question why is because the economy had the capacity to absorb it malter from my understanding one way to fight inflation if we do get to that point of inflation under mmt is to raise taxes so my question there is isn t it the wrong time to raise taxes when people are having trouble paying for basic goods and is that even politically feasible it seems like it would be easier to have the fed raise rates or something like that kelton so the best defense against inflation is a good offense and what mmt does is to try to be i think kind of hypersensitive to the risks of inflation i don t see any other macro school of thought pay as careful attention as we do to the inflation risk question and so what we would say is look if you are congress and if you are considering a new spending bill instead of thinking about the ways in which that new spending will add to the deficit or add to the debt you should be thinking about the ways in which that new spending has the risk of accelerating inflation and then avoid doing that so instead of going to the congressional budget office and saying would you take a look at this piece of legislation and give us feedback we d like to know what this bill will do to the debt and the deficit over time instead go to the congressional budget office or other government agencies and say we re considering passing this trillion dollar investment in infrastructure this is our bill would you look at it and we plan to do this spending over the course of the next five years tell us if that would create problems in the real economy evaluate the inflation risk and come back to us and give us some feedback and if that feedback comes back and they say five years is too fast we don t have enough slack in the u s economy you should spread it over seven or 10 that s the kind of responsible budgeting that i think that i would like to see congress begin to move toward so there is always the risk of inflation with any additional spending once you get close to full employment not just from government but if the rest of the world increase their appetite suddenly for the goods and services that we produce here in the u s and we re already at full employment then foreign demand carries inflation risk if consumers got very optimistic if we had a housing bubble and people were leveraging up using the equity in their homes to finance new spending that spending would carry inflation risk so there s always the risk of inflation if you spend too much what mmt tries to do is to maintain the level of spending in the aggregate at the level that is just compatible with full employment and price stability the question about what to do if inflation becomes a problem is a different one and i think the first thing you have to do is say what is driving the inflation what s the source of the inflationary pressure because to think that the inflation that is going to be become important at some future date is likely to be the result of an overheating economy of too much aggregate spending is really hard to believe i mean the u s economy hasn t experienced what we might call demand pull inflation for almost a century the types of inflation episodes that have been important in the u s have almost always come on the cost side what we call cost push inflation they come about because of things like oil price shocks you might see increases in headline inflation rates because the housing component or health care energy is the more likely these tend to be the more important drivers of inflation and so when you think about how to fight inflation i think the first question is to understand what the source of the inflationary pressure is and then to move forward with a policy tool that you think is going to help you get at that inflation if you ve got inflation resulting from energy price increases it s probably not going to do much to have the fed raise interest rates or even to have congress raise taxes you ve got to do something else that s going to work i reject the idea that mmt is about using taxes to fight inflation that s a mischaracterization of pretty much everything we ve written but people say it all the time malter from your perspective what is it ok to spend on versus what do you think is sort of a waste of deficit spending kelton so it s a great thing to think about how close are we to having an economy that is already using its resources so fully that if the government were to try to come in or if any additional spending were to happen that we would see an acceleration of inflation to levels that we find intolerable so are there things the government could safely spend money on today even though we may have an economy that s very close to approaching full employment and i think the answer is yes because there are things the government can spend money on today that actually create more room in the economy to produce more so that we can absorb that additional spending the kinds of investments that would allow you to do that would be things like infrastructure investment like r d things that lead to breakthroughs technological innovation that allow the economy to be more productive that raise productivity education is another good example malter there s a lot of chatter about debt and deficits but i feel like there s not a lot of action so in some ways haven t politicians already taken your advice and they ve just kept cutting taxes and kept spending kelton i think that in a sense the republican tax cuts have given us a really good lesson in mmt the risks are always on the inflation side and so again many economists were warning that the tax cuts would be risky and irresponsible and have all kinds of negative effects according to traditional modeling and traditional approaches and now the evidence is in and once again we have engaged in deficit spending without any of the fallout the textbooks and the conventional narratives have warned about so i think it s a pretty good lesson in mmt watch stephanie kelton on 2020 and trump watch now

and october 2018 policy makers left the benchmark rate unchanged at meetings in december and january maybe only a few hikes would have sufficed to keep a lid on inflation consumer spending grew at the weakest rate in a decade and output related to housing plunged at an annual rate of almost 15 per cent the most since the financial crisis before you blame the central bank for the slowdown keep in mind that the policy rate was a ridiculously low 0 5 per cent in early 2017 and the current rate is only 1 75 per cent poloz is no john crow the former bank of canada governor known for putting low inflation ahead of economic growth the current head of the central bank said all along that he knew households would be sensitive to higher interest rates if only because borrowing costs had been so

one of the most striking things about the blossoming 2020 democratic primary campaign is how much the candidates have broken with the party s defensive neoliberal posture of the past quarter century a period of time in which republicans have only won the popular vote for president once but have nonetheless dominated the parameters of debate now all that has changed in 2016 bernie sanders advocacy of medicare for all was read as a fringe position by a fringe candidate heading into 2020 it has polled as high as 70 percent support and is now a mainstream candidate position embraced by his senate colleagues kirsten gillibrand elizabeth warren and kamala harris as well as former hud secretary julián castro and rep tulsi gabbard the dramatic health care shift is just one facet of a much broader transformation that a younger increasingly diverse electorate is demanding a transformation leading away from the democrats decades long infatuation with neoliberalism with a similar expansion of support for ideas like a 15 minimum wage debt free college education taxing the wealthy a federal jobs guarantee and a green new deal up until 2016 leading democrats had accepted the basic premises of conservatives the era of big government is over bill clinton famously proclaimed while still claiming continuity with traditions they had largely abandoned typically as exemplified by welfare reform my 2010 critique here means testing would replace universal programs with success defined by reducing costs and the number of people served rather than by improving people s lives clinton s presidency followed a path laid out by charles peters founder and editor of the washington monthly in his influential 1983 essay a neoliberal s manifesto where he put it thus we still believe in liberty and justice for all in mercy for the afflicted and help for the down and out but we no longer automatically favor unions and big government or oppose the military and big business indeed in our search for solutions that work we have to distrust all automatic responses liberal or conservative in short neoliberals argued they shared liberal left values but favored more practical solutions but time has shown them not to be more practical after all as democratic activists and base voters have increasingly come to realize the question in 2020 is how the party as a whole evolves how it honestly comes to terms with its past it s a question that all the presidential hopefuls must grapple with and their supporters as well economic policies like nafta and wall street deregulation represent core neoliberal failures in the economic realm that stretch back long before peters as described by economic historian philip mirowski never let a serious crisis go to waste and colleagues the road from mont pelerin the making of the neoliberal thought collective but the economic vision has profound social consequences as mirowski elsewhere notes while neoliberal think tanks are busy riling up the groundlings with debt clocks and boogeyman statistics of ratios of government expenditure to gdp neoliberal politicians organize to extravagantly increase incarceration and policing of those whom they deem unfit for the marketplace a whole host of such offshoot policies incubated by peters his colleagues and funders mass incarceration school privatization welfare reform etc have likewise been discredited as well with profound impacts on the unfolding 2020 presidential primary race a growing awareness of how these failures are linked and what s required to replace them ought to play a significant part in that race if it does not democrats risk needlessly repeating past failures and handing republicans yet another chance to make things dramatically worse republicans are doing that right now imposing work requirements to roll back medicaid expansion even as new research shows welfare reform had significant negative impacts on children the intergenerational effects of welfare reform on adolescent behaviors were unfavorable particularly for boys and do not support longstanding arguments that limiting cash assistance leads to responsible behavior in the next generation in sharp contrast a recent new york times magazine article documents how much the living wage delivers a living wage is an antidepressant it is a sleep aid a diet a stress reliever it is a contraceptive preventing teenage pregnancy it prevents premature death it shields children from neglect the choice couldn t be more clear between what works and what doesn t but the need to break decisively with past failures poses challenges for potential 2020 candidates as a former chair of the senate judiciary committee joe biden faces a difficult task explaining his key role in helping to expand federal mass incarceration policies just one of several now dormant topics that may play a role in keeping him out of the race so far similarly as former prosecutors sens amy klobuchar and kamala harris perfectly fit the neoliberal formula for combating conservative attacks against soft on crime bleeding heart liberals but that creates significant tension with the growing momentum of criminal justice reformers whose bipartisan appeal is reflected in the recently passed first step act even as democratic aligned activists black lives matter and others push for much more klobuchar and harris aren t alone every potential 2020 candidate has undergone or is undergoing some sort of evolution elizabeth warren was a republican for most of her life for example sen cory booker has strong wall street ties including a long affiliation with the hedge fund group democrats for education reform dfer described by justin miller in 2016 as established with a mission to break the teacher unions stranglehold over the democratic party as miller noted early on dfer identified then senator barack obama and then newark mayor cory booker as promising politicians willing to break with teachers unions dfer was instrumental in convincing obama to appoint charter friendly chicago superintendent arne duncan as secretary of education and it spent a lot of time and money lobbying the administration to pursue reformist education policies like race to the top and common core this style of top down education reform supported by elites in both parties has angered parents students teachers and whole communities across the political spectrum not least because it s served to both help fuel and distract from massive disinvestments in public education this in turn helped fuel last year s wave of red state teacher walkouts which clearly fed into midterm victories this is part of a larger pattern of anti privatization victories described by jeff bryant of the independent media institute booker s record including his past ties to betsy devos could be a problem for him chalkbeat noted sure to draw a skeptical eye from unions and public school advocates my purpose here is not to single out any candidates for their past positions every candidate could be attacked for some aspect of their past which would only serve to make donald trump s day what voters care most about is the future what candidates promise to do and why and the past matters most for making sense of what they say for showing they saw things in the past how they came to change and how they see us all moving forward in the future evolution learning from our past mistakes is good we need to encourage more of it not endlessly get mired down in refighting old battles at the same time we need an honest accounting of the past in order to have confidence in politicians pledges for the future and we also need a much more broadly shared sense of what was wrong in the neoliberal agenda and how that plays out in a multitude of different forms to do that it helps to take a step back from looking at specific issues in order to see more clearly how they all fit together recognizing three main mistakes around neoliberalism can help go a long way toward helping to make sense of the way forward the first mistaken belief about neoliberalism is that there s nothing neo about it it s just plain old fashioned lockean liberalism jonathan chait has made this mistake most loudly how neoliberalism became the left s favorite insult of liberals but mirowski makes it clear how mistaken that is in a nutshell classical liberalism imagined a night watchman state that would set the boundaries for the natural growth of the market like a shepherd tending his flock markets were born not made and they existed to serve human society the neoliberals were having none of that mirowski wrote markets were to be the master far from trying to preserve society against the unintended consequences of the operations of markets neoliberal doctrine instead set out actively to reshape it in the market s image in short neoliberalism is a technocratic perversion of classical liberalism rather than an evolutionary advancement of it a second mistake is to conflate neoliberalism with the mask of economics that it wears neoliberalism or market fetishism is not the consistent application of modern economics but its primitive simplistic perversion as economists suresh naidu dani rodrik and gabriel zucman recently wrote at the boston review their article economics after neoliberalism introduced the work of a new group the economics for inclusive prosperity efip network as they explain the tools of economics are critical to developing a policy framework for what we call inclusive prosperity while prosperity is the traditional concern of economists the inclusive modifier demands both that we consider the whole distribution of outcomes not simply the average the middle class and that we consider human prosperity broadly including non pecuniary sources of well being from health to climate change to political rights to bring things down to earth one of the policy briefs they introduce is an expanded view of government s role in providing social insurance and investing in children by sandra e black and jesse rothstein the summary explains while private provision of goods often yields the efficient outcome there are a number of goods that are not efficiently provided in the private market here we outline two such situations investments in child care and education and insurance against risks created by business cycles poor health and old age because private markets work poorly for these goods and the costs of market failure are large standard economic reasoning implies a significant role for government provision we first discuss childhood investments including expenses relating to child care and early education as well as post secondary education they go on to discuss specific reasons that illuminate why the neoliberal argument for charter schools and other forms of privatization are profoundly flawed not just from an egalitarian justice perspective but in straightforward economic terms as well similar kinds of arguments could surely be made around issues of criminal justice reform as for example the purported rationality of the private prison industrial complex could hardly withstand such an analysis what s more this broader framework of inclusive prosperity not only serves to clarify the arbitrary constricted nature of the neoliberal outlook it fits into an broader framework that elucidates a third mistake failing to distinguish how neoliberalism fits into a larger political context which produces different incarnations as described by new school professor nancy fraser in the article from progressive neoliberalism to trump and beyond which i cited last year fraser speaks in terms of hegemonic blocs a term developed by the italian marxist antonio gramsci which she develops further as involving two aspects the distributive aspect conveys a view about how society should allocate divisible goods especially income this aspect speaks to the economic structure of society and however obliquely to its class divisions the recognition aspect expresses a sense of how society should apportion respect and esteem the moral marks of membership and belonging focused on the status order of society this aspect refers to its status hierarchies progressive neoliberalism might sound self contradictory she notes but it combined an expropriative plutocratic economic program with a liberal meritocratic politics of recognition such that protecting the environment meant carbon trading promoting home ownership meant subprime loans bundled together and resold as mortgage backed securities equality meant meritocracy in contrast progressive populism calls for something different combining egalitarian redistribution with nonhierarchical recognition this option has at least a fighting chance of uniting the whole working class more than that it could position that class understood expansively as the leading force in an alliance that also includes substantial segments of youth the middle class and the professional managerial stratum the two aspects recognition and redistribution can be viewed as more complementary frameworks for developing the full meaning of the inclusive modifier that naidu rodrik and zucman introduced ideally the democrats 2020 primary campaign could and should involve a full throated debate about the best ways to realize the full meaning of inclusive growth including all the non economic dimensions of recognition as well it should flesh out specific aspects of what progressive populism means and how to achieve its goals it should promote sound policies to advance inclusive growth and it should reclaim the once commonsense idea that while the market can be a good servant it makes a terrible tyrannical master
co written by gary null and richard gale the recent release of the proposed green new deal is a template an outline identifying some of the most crucial issues facing the nation regarding climate change and a wish list of measures to address those issues it contains a variety of inspired agenda items many of which have been voiced by the green party and environmental fringe groups in washington for over a decade according to the deal s fact sheet 92 percent of democrats and 64 percent of republicans support the deal almost every democrat throwing their hat into the 2020 presidential race backs it and the deal has gained wide approval in the climatology and atmospheric science communities among hundreds of conservation environmental renewable energy and social activist organizations and within the younger generation it has been a long time coming and the question is whether it is too late it is optimistic to think that we can reverse accelerating global warming trends and mitigate their impact by keeping the planet below the international panel on climate change s ipcc 1 5 degree c warming mark for the next 12 years and it is even more optimistic to think that congress will be able to enact legislation like this without prioritizing the interests of the multinational corporations and lobbies that contribute to their re election campaigns over the people who elected them it took no time for the deal s co authors rep ocasio cortez and democrat senator ed markey to be broadsided with disparaging criticisms by corporate leaders and political opponents including old rank and file democrats the critics include the president of the laborers international union of north america fossil fuel backer terry o sullivan who labeled the report a fantasy manifesto that will create divisions and inequality billionaire michael bloomberg called it pie in the sky and pelosi and her multi million dollar corporate colleagues are simply clueless about the green dream or whatever they call it as pelosi dismissed it but there are plenty of legitimate criticisms too and progressives would be wise not to let their desire to see pro environmental legislation enacted at last blind them to the very real problems with ocasio cortez and a legislative blueprint that could very easily become as much of a giveaway to multinational corporations as the affordable care act was to insurance companies the green new deal largely relies for precedent upon the idealism behind great accomplishments in the us history when the nation succeeded in mobilizing to tackle difficult challenges that critics argued could never be accomplished examples include fdr s transformation of the private auto and manufacturing industries to meet military needs during world war 2 eisenhower s interstate highway system and the achievement of jfk s promise to reach the moon before the end of the 1960s although washington remains strait jacked by the interests of the finance and energy lobbies at the local level constructive change is happening over one hundred cities across the country have issued statements pledging to transition to 100 percent renewable energy 1 unfortunately their dateline targets are far off track and the best case hawaii is looking at reaching 100 percent clean energy efficiency in another 26 years farmers are forgoing energy intensive chemical agriculture and transitioning to organic and the public is becoming increasingly more aware and educated about their energy usage and slowly changing its consumption habits nevertheless compared to other developed nations the us lags far behind in reaching realistic targets to address the ipcc s 1 5 degree prediction which is overly conservative absent the ipcc s statistical limitations the actual time frame according to most independent climate scientists is more dire we may have only 7 years to get off fossil fuels however reaching the deal s goal is potentially doable if the country s industries and finance giants get behind it sweden already gets over half of its energy from renewables in 2015 denmark s wind farm industry reached 140 percent of energy demands in 2016 portugal reached a milestone by operating for four days without any fossil fuels 2 due to its favorable clean energy geothermal resources iceland generates the most clean energy per capita in the world almost 90 percent of its total energy needs are satisfied by non fossil fuel sources costa rica has managed to run for over two months on 100 percent renewables in 10 years uruguay s unique public and private sector partnerships now supply 95 percent of its national energy needs with renewables 3 many other nations are also making aggressive efforts to power themselves exclusively with clean energy and where does the us stand according to the us energy information administration for 2017 non fossil fuel sources only accounted for a dismal 20 percent of energy consumption and still 34 percent of fuel for our electric power sector relies on coal 4 while getting off fossil fuel dependency is absolutely critical the us s electricity production only accounts for 28 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions ghes while switching to renewable energy for electrical power needs is very likely achievable the obstacles to reach the ipcc target are enormous in our estimation several stumbling blocks may make it impossible for the us to eliminate fossil fuels during the next dozen years aside from opposition within with the democratic party by corporatists such as nancy pelosi chuck schumer and steny hoyer the cost to overhaul all industry manufacturing and current and new technological developments would be astronomical a republican aligned think tank the american action forum recently published a report estimating the green new deal would cost between 51 trillion and 93 trillion over ten years though the lion s share of that sum relates to the deal s provision of jobs and healthcare for all rather than its environmental measures eliminating carbon emissions from the power and transportation sector the group said would only cost between 8 3 and 12 3 trillion over a decade the national debt is already almost 22 trillion and growing since trump took office the debt has increased 2 trillion and there is no indication it will shrink increasingly extreme weather and its aftereffects will only further raise the debt a closer examination of these numbers is required the official price tag of the war on terror which has laid waste to the middle east over the last 20 years creating an endless supply of future enemies by slaughtering entire villages full of civilians via depersonalized drone warfare recently climbed north of 6 trillion 5 and an investigation last year turned up an eye popping 21 trillion in fraudulent budgeting by the pentagon and the department of housing and urban development 6 thousands of whistleblowers are swept under the rug by the defense department s inspector general every year in their efforts to call attention to waste and fraud within the wealthiest military in the world the first ever attempt to audit the pentagon performed last year was an embarrassing failure revealing 6 5 trillion had simply vanished 7 the us spends nearly 1 trillion a year on defense 8 and while no one would suggest dismantling the american military there are thousands of bases sprinkled around the world in countries the us does not belong with undeclared conflicts raging in 134 countries 9 surely some of this largesse could be repurposed to save the planet there is always money in the budget for war which currently eats up more than half of every dollar spent by the us government despite the fact that the us is not facing any credible military threats from state actors despite the evidence free charges it meddled in the 2016 election russia does not pose a threat to the us indeed russian president vladimir putin in a recent speech expressed frustration that russia was banging on a locked door regarding friendship between the two nations rendered all but impossible with every round of draconian sanctions imposed as a form of legislative virtue signaling by congressmen eager to demonstrate their allegiance in cold war part 2 10 even china prefers to flex its muscles economically rather than militarily spending trillions to build its belt and road throughout the developing world and amassing allies by funding large infrastructure projects where the us has historically bullied poorer nations into submissions through military force the green new deal would merely take roughly the yearly expenditure on the war on terror and use it for constructive rather than destructive purposes troops returning from costly and destructive foreign wars could even be put to work planting trees or building infrastructure much as environmental projects are undertaken in less wealthy nations because that scary 12 3 trillion figure is the cost if the green new deal were undertaken in the typical american fashion of rolling out grand legislation if environmental reforms were enacted the way other countries work the figure would shrink dramatically unfortunately ocasio cortez is open about her wish to work with business interests to get the job done just as barack obama was willing to work with the insurance companies to pass the affordable care act resulting in a ruinously expensive and flawed plan that forced americans to buy health insurance they could not afford while subsidizing a tiny sliver of the population healthcare costs did not go down they skyrocketed and healthcare quality certainly did not improve involving corporations with their profit above all value system guarantees the green new deal will enrich wealthy conglomerates like bechtel and halliburton these will receive the big contracts for building renewable infrastructure repurposing existing infrastructure etc but will contract the work out to other smaller companies while keeping most of the money as profit the smaller companies will then outsource the jobs constructing solar panels in the desert say or planting a hardy forest on now barren disused farmland to poorly paid local firms while keeping most of the remaining money as profit the poorly paid local firms will then do the jobs with the cheapest materials and shoddiest standards in the hope of retaining whatever funds are left for their ceos and investors this is the american way and it is why any grand infrastructure or rebuilding project costs so much if enacted along the lines of past grand projects like the affordable care act the green new deal will essentially be a giveaway to the big corporations ocasio cortez claims to oppose with her champagne socialism neoliberal economics degree and unhealthy affection for the trappings of wealth and power it is no secret that the very real climate catastrophe we all face has been weaponized by multinational interests interested in pushing global governance measures as the only solution to the climate change problem too often this has made those rightly suspicious of the motives of government and the ruling class also doubt the existence of climate change in a form of guilt by association but taking action on a grand scale need not be ruinously expensive or involve an authoritarian clampdown on the rights of the individual china assigned 60 000 soldiers to plant enough trees to cover an area the size of ireland last year 11 with an aim toward eventually upping their forest coverage from 21 percent to 26 percent by 2035 even bangladesh one of the poorest countries in the world began planting one million trees in 2017 after rural deforestation had so denuded the countryside that farmers were dying from lightning strikes at high rates copying a similar program in thailand 12 india set a world record twice using millions of volunteers to plant trees in order to bring its forests in line with the commitments it made under the paris agreement with modern technology like seed bombing a single airplane or drone can plant 900 000 trees in a day dropping seeds encased in ready to grow soil bundles this technology is already used in africa and it has advanced significantly beyond simply dropping seeds indiscriminately modern seed bombing drones are equipped with imaging capability to ensure the seeds go where they are most likely to thrive none of this requires outsourcing subcontracting slicing and dicing profit margins or any of the typically american approaches to the problem and it will save billions relying on the government to do the right thing almost invariably leaves one disappointed if it was not ocasio cortez pushing cooperation with the business community as an integral part of the deal it would be another congressperson when all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail and the us chamber of commerce the business lobby is so massive it s difficult for lawmakers to see outside its edges add in the size of the energy lobby and it s easy to see how lawmakers find it difficult to conceive of taking large scale action in a way that does not primarily benefit large corporations the voice of the people has not been heard in washington in decades and it s doubtful it would be recognized if it was heard moreover although the us is the world s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases 15 percent of global total emissions china far surpasses us at 30 percent together with the european union 10 percent and india 6 percent these four regions account for over half of all ghes the bottom 100 countries combined only contribute to 3 5 percent launching a universal global environmental marshall plan may well be beyond humanity s means if we consider that china is currently constructing a single sprawling megapolis that will cover over 83 000 square miles larger than great britain or new england it is impossible to imagine how such a humongous urban operation could not be unsustainable and fossil fuel dependent the booming city of jing jin ji will be the heaviest concentration of human beings on the planet housing upwards of 130 million people or the equivalent of the combined populations of the world s four largest cities tokyo new delhi shanghai and sao paulo and all of these residents will want the conveniences of a modern western lifestyle more cars more meat on their tables and more energy consuming luxuries surprisingly surveys seem to indicate that the chinese are better educated about climate change than the average american after last year s record breaking heatwaves droughts deadly flash floods and a category 5 typhoon 94 percent of chinese polled said they believe climate change is happening now and 66 percent believe it is anthropocentric seventy three percent are willing to pay extra for climate friendly products yet similar to average americans the chinese are not changing their consumption habits to adapt to the new climate reality likewise similar to the us the chinese government is eager to press forward with unsustainable growth projects that will increase rather than decrease emissions 13 among the other stumbling blocks the green new deal faces is that washington has unfortunately almost reached its goal of being totally energy independent while we produce the most energy in the world we also consume the most per capita the us has also risen to the third largest fossil fuel exporter after saudi arabia and russia together these three nations account for 38 percent of the world s total oil 14 at the same time the us still needs to import petroleum predominantly for our auto and transportation demands although the us now produces about 11 million barrels per day it consumes almost 20 million barrels daily 15 for natural gas production the us is king and is expected to reach over 90 billion cubic feet per day of production according to the eia 16 trump s abhorrent policies have revitalized the coal industry and escalated production worse the oil and coal industries are the recipients of monstrous corporate welfare to the tune of 20 billion in annual government subsidies 17 jeremy brecher properly notes that global warming has rightly been called history s greatest market failure correcting it cannot be left to the market 18 unlike the faux urgency for building a silly wall on the border climate change is the national emergency it is a planetary emergency therefore when thousands of large and small coal gas oil related companies reap enormous windfalls employ almost 1 1 million workers compared to under 374 000 working full or part time in solar and 102 000 at wind firms there is zero incentive for any of these major greenhouse gas emitters to leap off the gravy train and shift to cleaner renewable forms of energy 19 a second major obstacle to the green new deal is that all of our leading institutions politicians legislative policymakers and opinion leaders think tanks and foundations and the mainstream media that is controlled by these institutions are not going to truthfully challenge the paradigm of free market capitalism and the myth that constant economic growth and expansion will better society this means we only have more toxic pollution urban sprawl destruction of the environment and habitats and depletion of natural resources to look forward to and with it warmer seasons and more extreme weather events such as superstorms droughts wildfires and floods this may be the 3 000 pound gorilla in the room we are caught in the perpetual cycle of earning more in order to buy more and accumulate more debt the transition of weaning ourselves off of fossil fuels to increase investment in renewables and the new technologies necessary to meet the ipcc benchmark means a tradeoff for a much slower or no growth economy in order to reach a more sustainable and livable future it may require up to 10 trillion to re engineer entire industries and infrastructures in order to reach anything close to zero emissions yet with america s new wealthy class of 11 million millionaires governing private industries investments and policy making to keep the capitalist engine churning enactment of the kind of green agenda proposed and demanded today is unlikely again there is no incentive for the ruling elite to cut back on consumption the legions of lobbyists in washington will make every effort to scuttle the green new deal and ensure it is dead on arrival the ruling class has no allegiance to nationality it is the most unpatriotic class in the nation when the stresses of climate change get tough or their personal security and assets are threatened the ruling class have the means to pick up and move elsewhere furthermore the ruling class and the conservative populace even those educated enough to agree on anthropocentric climate change lean heavily upon libertarian values which means smaller government and more freedom for the free market looking at the green new deal from any angle it is clear this plan will require handing over enormous power to washington trust in all branches of government has already eroded to a level where even true progressives doubt anything good can come out of the duopoly in washington therefore a sizable percentage of the public will be deeply suspicious of the government s will and competence in executing any legislation that emerges from the deal s current outline the free market economy is polluting everything creating seas of plastic landfills of toxic junk and stores of computers and electronic equipment forests and ecosystems are being leveled to expand growth there is little to no time to dramatically change our steel auto and high tech industries and private industries and the population s collective consumption behaviors will not change overnight while we commend the green new deal s authors and the progressive caucus that backs it we encourage the public not to become passive with high expectations that washington is willing or capable of solving the climate crisis there are no saviors blind faith should not be directed towards the compliance of washington nor to new technologies developed to pull us through we live in remarkably tense times but drastic times require drastic measures in fact the deal may not be radical enough gutting our military expenditure the largest fossil fuel consumer as well as the top recipient of our tax dollars and the washington consensus cowboy adventurism to instigate regime changes as the world burns is absent from its wish list are there any solutions that are doable without the body politic of government standing in the way reducing ghes can no longer be regarded as solely a challenge for government and private industry it is a responsibility of every individual first the public must become deeply and consciously aware of the climate problem and how our lives and culture contribute to global warming we must also become deeply and consciously aware of how our lives will change as the world deteriorates our education system has been a complete failure in teaching people about the basic science of climate change and the immediate and long term impacts of global warming nothing we can do will efficaciously change the melting of the arctic ice the warming oceans and environmental dead zones multi gigaton methane burps from the thawing permafrost the decimation of insect populations that will contribute to national food crises rising coastal waters and the next season of record setting wildfires in the western states the next category 5 super hurricane could be the final straw for many floridians and residents living along the gulf industrial over consumption is depleting our aquifers there are in fact hundreds of canaries in the coal mine not just one second every person and family can begin to gradually transition to eating a plant based diet this does not need to be an abrupt change we can start by going meatless for a single day every week and then increase the days the agriculture industry generates anywhere between 10 and 40 percent of ghes primarily methane and nitrous oxide depending upon which metrics are being used in the equations the united nation s food and agriculture organization estimates that livestock production accounts for about 14 5 percent of all human caused emissions 20 in the us 42 percent of agricultural emissions come from the raising of livestock and globally it accounts for approximately 16 percent of all human induced ghes 21 when storage transportation and distribution of meat and produce are added the co2 footprint rises substantially imagine the footprint of a single bushel of tomatoes traveling from a california farm to a maine supermarket if a sufficient number of people also purchase more locally grown food this too would have an impact these are two efforts a meatless diet and buying locally that every american can adopt in order to be part of the solution rather than the problem third our consumption behaviors are traveling on a high speed rail off a cliff we have the will to make conscientious choices about our buying habits there is only one solution to this and that is to downsize purchase only what is essential for our needs and find other ways to increase the quality of our lives before making a purchase consider the item s carbon footprint before it reaches your hands as the world gets warmer and the economic and social stresses of life increase inevitably a time will arrive when people will be forced to downsize it will no longer be a matter of choice finally if it is within your financial means find ways to increase your reliance on renewable clean energy sources if you can install solar panels to get off the grid and become energy self sufficient it will pay off in the long term although there remains considerable debate on whether or not our global civilization has reached a peak oil moment oil prices will unquestionably increase steadily in the future what the nation can do collectively is adequately if vaguely summarized in the green new deal during a press conference following the report s release sen markey and rep ocasio cortez were clear that the plan at this time does not include any individual prescriptions for the issues outlined the details and following legislation will be developed following congressional vote and approval and the creation of a congressional committee to develop the solutions however the deal is clearly defined as a national industrial economic mobilization plan it will take years for the us to become greenhouse gas emission neutral the report notes that it will require massive investment to reduce existing and future greenhouse gases it acknowledges it is crucial to develop and install a national energy efficient smart grid upgrade our entire infrastructure residential and industrial base for state of the art energy efficiency and eliminate ghe from the agricultural industry the report also includes the need for expanding education and training for such a nationwide mobilization effort the report also finally acknowledges that america s energy grid is a disaster the majority of people and even most politicians are unaware our energy and power infrastructures are sorely inefficient in an analysis conducted by lawrence livermore national laboratories to evaluate us energy consumption 59 1 percent of electricity generation was rejected energy energy lost due to inefficiencies in power plants engines buildings etc 22 almost all of this rejected energy is generated from coal natural gas and petroleum in the livermore report renewable energy sources such as solar wind and geothermal barely contributed to any infrastructural energy loss 23 and yet washington and the trump administration in particular find it economically feasible to subsidize these fossil fuel industries for their ineptitude negligence towards energy efficiency and exorbitant waste even ocasio cortez seems to believe progress can be achieved by working with these monuments to inefficiency this is naïve at best and disingenuous at worst in a true capitalist system such as our president pays lip service to at every opportunity the best performers come out on top why then does the government continually prop up failed systems from energy to banking this money would be better invested in funding sustainable alternatives a simple fact that opponents of the deal in private industry wall street and climate change deniers fail to understand as a rule is that the enormous costs for implementing a new deal are already here and they have been increasing annually due to rising frequency and damages from extreme weather events due to humanity s messing with the atmosphere and environment nasa conservatively reported 91 billion lost in damages due to climate change episodes in 2018 alone 24 and the federal government s most recent national climate assessment warns we will rapidly reach 500 billion per year in economic losses due to sea level rise and worsening weather droughts storms floods and fires 25 next it is sheer negligence that the federal and state governments have failed to upgrade our public transportation system the us falls far behind even banana republics in its inefficient rail system compared to high speed 200 plus mph rails in china france japan and elsewhere creating a new high speed rail system across america may be too optimistic at this time nevertheless upgrading our trains between major urban hubs is perfectly doable immediately this would mean high speed rails between boston new york washington chicago dallas and houston and los angeles san francisco and las vegas for starters high speed trains between these city hubs would significantly reduce the carbon footprint of transportation and could even be faster than airlines after considering time spent at airports it could also be accomplished at the state level through public private partnerships in addition a tax incentive could be added for those who use public transportation finally the nation needs to act immediately upon a national reforestation program and roll back the trump s regressive orders to further devastate public land and ecosystems to increase corporate profits forests and trees are recognized as perhaps the most important natural resource to offset carbon emissions china and india are making huge advances in reforesting their nations china has reserved an area four times the size of the united kingdom for reforestation there are few areas on the planet with large swathes of forest canopies most are located in northern canada the latin american countries in the amazon basin scandinavia and russia therefore we would recommend a national conservation corps to start an aggressive reforestation campaign if india can hold the world record in planting 66 million trees within a 12 hour period in 2017 and a single 53 year old new delhi resident can plant 1 100 000 trees in a single year the us could reforest ourselves easily in a short period of time for all the deal s good points it will go nowhere if the legislation that results is larded with giveaways to the same industries and corporations that led us to environmental and economic ruin in the first place ocasio cortez s desire to liaise with these actors may be born out of a genuine desire for cooperation but it is more likely her democratic socialism is being used as a more palatable face for the same rapacious neoliberalism that has created all the problems the deal purports to solve while we wait for government to get its act together and legislate its way out of this mess we would be wise to begin solving as many problems as we can ourselves even as we hold our government representatives feet to the fire gary

because the company recorded 187 1 million of impairment expense in 2017 but none in 2018 cash from operating activities and project adjusted ebitda declined in 2018 primarily because of power

as used in this news release to project income loss the most directly comparable measure on a gaap basis and net income loss financial results for the three months ended december 31 2018 key drivers the most significant drivers of fourth quarter results were the expirations of the ppas at kapuskasing and north bay in ontario at year end 2017 the early terminations of the ppas for the three san diego projects effective march 1 2018 the short term contract extension at williams lake less favorable economics effective april 2 2018 and higher maintenance expense at oxnard due to gas turbine repairs the impact of ppa expirations was expected on the positive side curtis palmer benefited from stronger water flows and tunis returned to service under a new ppa in october 2018 net income loss project income loss and project adjusted ebitda net income attributable to atlantic power corporation for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 24 7 million compared to a net loss of 41 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the 65 8 million swing from loss to income was primarily attributable to 72 2 million of impairment expense recorded in 2017 that did not recur 10 4 million lower project interest expense due to the repayment of piedmont project debt in october 2017 the 2017 period included a 9 4 million swap termination cost and a 12 3 million increase in unrealized foreign exchange gain which was related to the revaluation of debt denominated in canadian dollars the canadian dollar depreciated during the quarter these positive factors were partially offset by lower gross margins resulting from the ppa expirations previously discussed the non recurrence of the oefc settlement revenues a 9 2 million unfavorable change in the fair value of derivative instruments and a 12 2 million reduction in income tax benefit project income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 20 1 million as compared to a project loss of 39 7 million in the year ago period the most significant drivers of the 59 8 million improvement were the non recurrence of impairment expense recorded at curtis palmer williams lake and frederickson in the 2017 period and lower project interest expense due primarily to the repayment of piedmont project debt in full in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the non recurrence of a related swap termination cost these positive factors were partially offset by lower gross margins resulting from the ppa expirations previously discussed the non recurrence of the oefc settlement revenues and an unfavorable change in the fair value of derivative instruments project adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of 2018 declined to 46 6 million from 62 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the 15 5 million decrease was primarily attributable to the expiration of contracts at kapuskasing and north bay at year end 2017 17 1 million the early termination of the ppas for the three san diego projects effective march 1 2018 2 3 million a less favorable short term ppa at williams lake 1 6 million and gas turbine repairs at oxnard 1 2 million these decreases were partially offset by higher water flows at curtis palmer 3 6 million and the return of tunis to commercial operation under the new ppa and the absence of start up expenses incurred in 2017 1 8 million cash flow cash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased to 39 7 million from 30 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 results were positively affected by a 16 8 million reduction in cash interest payments due primarily to the piedmont swap termination expense in the 2017 period the timing of payments on the new series e convertible debentures one in july 2018 and two annually going forward in january and july the reduction in debt levels and the reduced spread on the company s credit facilities distributions from unconsolidated affiliates increased 7 9 million but this was partly a timing issue as the september distribution from orlando was not received until october 1 3 6 million chambers had an increase of 4 2 million due to lower operation and maintenance expenditures and a release of working capital these factors which positively affected cash flow were partially offset by lower project adjusted ebitda for the quarter as previously discussed cash used in investing activities for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 0 1 million compared to a 1 4 million source of funds in the fourth quarter of 2017 cash used in financing activities for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 27 1 million as compared to 82 1 million in the year ago period the company repaid 20 8 million of term loan and project debt repurchased 4 3 million of common shares and paid 2 0 million of preferred dividends in the comparable 2017 period the company repaid 79 6 million of term loan and project debt including piedmont in full and paid 2 2 million of preferred dividends during the fourth quarter the company had a 12 5 million net increase in cash restricted cash and cash equivalents financial results for the year ended december 31 2018 key drivers the most significant drivers of full year results were the expirations early terminations and short term extensions of the ppas at kapuskasing and north bay the san diego projects and williams lake and as previously described maintenance costs associated with the tunis re start in the first six months of 2018 and the manchief gas turbine overhaul in the second quarter of 2018 and lower water flows at curtis palmer than in 2017 though they were very close to average these declines were partially offset by increases at morris mamquam frederickson orlando and nipigon net income loss project income loss and project adjusted ebitda net income attributable to atlantic power corporation for 2018 was 36 8 million compared to a net loss of 98 6 million in 2017 the 135 4 million improvement was primarily attributable to a 135 6 million increase in project income discussed below a 39 1 million increase in unrealized foreign exchange gain 22 8 million gain versus a 16 3 million loss which was related to the revaluation of debt denominated in canadian dollars due to the depreciation of the canadian dollar during the year compared to an appreciation in 2017 and to higher canadian debt instruments due to the issuance of the series e convertible debenture in january 2018 an 11 5 million reduction in corporate interest expense as a result of debt repayment and re pricing of the company s credit facilities and a 3 2 million unrealized gain on the fair value of the conversion option of the series e debentures these positive factors were partially offset by a 58 3 million reduction in income tax benefit project income for 2018 increased to 88 2 million from a project loss of 47 4 million in 2017 the 135 6 million improvement was primarily attributable to the non recurrence of 187 1 million of impairment expense recorded in 2017 a 15 7 million reduction in interest expense due to lower debt balances and the reduced spread on the company s credit facilities in addition the company recorded a purchase accounting gain of 7 2 million on the acquisition of the remaining ownership interests in koma kulshan also morris orlando and other projects had increases in project income these positive variances were partially offset by lower gross margins resulting from the ppa expirations previously discussed the non recurrence of the oefc settlement revenues and maintenance expense associated with the tunis re start and the manchief gas turbine overhaul project adjusted ebitda for 2018 declined to 185 1 million from 288 8 million in 2017 the 103 7 million decrease was primarily attributable to the expiration of contracts at kapuskasing and north bay at year end 2017 71 3 million the early termination of the ppas for the three san diego projects effective march 1 2018 24 0 million maintenance expenses incurred at tunis in preparation for re start incurred in 2018 and the non recurrence of oefc settlement revenues recorded in 2017 9 0 million a less favorable short term ppa at williams lake partially offset by cost reductions 8 4 million maintenance expenses associated with the manchief gas turbine overhaul in the second quarter of 2018 5 5 million and lower water flows at curtis palmer 2 8 million partially offsetting these decreases were increases at morris 7 4 million due to a higher capacity price realized in the pjm capacity auction for this year higher steam and ancillary services revenues higher merchant dispatch and lower expenses mamquam 3 3 million due to higher water flows and lower maintenance expense frederickson 3 0 million due to maintenance expense in 2017 and orlando 2 9 million due to higher availability and higher contractual capacity rates cash flow cash provided by operating activities declined 31 7 million to 137 5 million in 2018 from 169 2 million in 2017 results were negatively affected by the 103 7 million reduction in project adjusted ebitda however this impact was partially offset by 39 3 million of net favorable changes in working capital particularly a 20 6 million decrease in working capital at kapuskasing north bay and the three san diego projects as they were not in operation at year end 2018 in addition cash interest payments were 30 7 million lower in 2018 than in 2017 as a result of debt repayment and a lower spread on the company s credit facilities and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates increased 14 3 million mostly at chambers and orlando cash used in investing activities in 2018 was 17 0 million compared to 4 3 million in 2017 in 2018 the company used 12 8 million of cash net of cash received to acquire additional ownership interests in koma kulshan and buy out the operation and maintenance contract and 2 6 million for the deposit required under the agreement to acquire the two south carolina biomass plants capital expenditures in the 2018 period were 1 8 million as compared to 5 3 million in 2017 cash used in financing activities in 2018 was 135 0 million as compared to 178 9 million in 2017 in 2018 the company issued 92 2 million

million at september 30 2018 cash increased 10 7 million while revolver availability was nearly unchanged the increase in cash was attributable to discretionary cash flow generated during the quarter

guidance the company has not provided guidance for project income or net income because of the difficulty of making accurate forecasts and projections without unreasonable efforts with respect to certain highly variable components of these comparable gaap metrics including changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and foreign exchange gains or losses these factors which generally do not affect cash flow are not included in project adjusted ebitda the company has initiated guidance for 2019 project adjusted ebitda in the range of 175 million to 190 million the midpoint of this guidance range is in line with the 2018 actual result of 185 1 million the most significant factor negatively affecting 2019 results is the short term contract extension at williams lake which became effective in april 2018 and is scheduled to expire in june or possibly as late as september of this year in 2018 williams lake had project adjusted ebitda of 8 0 million but this included three months under the previous contract results in 2019 are expected to be significantly lower project adjusted ebitda for tunis and manchief is expected to be significantly higher this year due to start up and

highlights canadian economic growth has decelerated markedly and a repeat of the fourth quarter s near zero pace is expected in 2019q1 this growth slump has led clients to question whether canada can contract or stagnate alongside an otherwise healthy u s counterpart it is rare but the answer is yes the typical escape valve of an improving external trade balance is less impactful than in the past the present situation echoes 2015 but with slightly different drivers at work the term recession is thrown around a lot without appropriate qualifiers absent a severe external shock the risk we see is at most a technical recession with the more likely outcome a short period of stagnation any throttling back in activity is likely to lack the required combination of breadth depth and duration to mark a true recession labour markets and credit growth are the key areas to watch in assessing the risk of a downturn canada is in the midst of a growth slump weaker than expected near term economic momentum has emerged at the same time that energy sector production curtailments are sending growth temporarily lower today s weak gdp report 0 4 q q saar is likely to be followed with another near zero out turn in 2019q1 such a modest forecast means that it would not take too much of a miss versus expectations to send first quarter growth into negative territory this has led clients to question the possibility of canada entering a recession independent of a downturn in the united states a true recession that hits all the economic markers is highly unlikely but a technical recession is a possibility a technical recession is defined as lacking the combination of depth breadth and duration this is where gdp may contract or stagnate for two or more quarters in the absence of a parallel broad labour market stress this is also where the bar is set for a true recession that comes with widespread industry output contractions and significant employment losses across much of the nation we need only look back to 2015 to find evidence that canada can indeed experience a technical recession while the u s continues to expand although this is not common historically we believe it s possible that canada may experience more of these temporary de couplings from u s dynamics in the future the escape route for canada has often been the external sector where depreciation of the canadian dollar and healthy u s demand help to offset weakness elsewhere in the economy this dynamic however has become more muted over the years and other growth drivers lack pent up demand to offer a large cushion i e the housing sector and consumer spending within the current cycle the risk of a technical recession cannot be dismissed but the data does not point to a downturn at present indeed an assessment of key leading indicators points to a growth slump not a contraction getting our definitions right discussions of recession risks can often get bogged down in definitional distinctions so it is important to distinguish between three types of economic performances before delving into the analysis the first is a growth slump where the economy manages to eke out growth but just barely this is in effect our near term forecast the second is a technical recession sometimes called a statutory recession as it meets the definition included in the since repealed federal balanced budget act of 2015 this requires at least two consecutive quarters of economic contraction and little else a true recession has a much higher bar not only an economic contraction but one that comes with breadth and depth compare for instance the 2008 2009 recession which saw the national unemployment rate rise 2 5 percentage points and rise in all provinces with the 2015 statutory recession where the increase was a more modest 0 5 percentage points driven by a narrow set of provinces with exposure to the energy sector alberta saskatchewan and newfoundland and labrador the focus of this analysis is on the risk of a technical recession which cannot be ruled out simply because of strong u s economic dynamics the risk of a true recession is quite low at present and has effectively never occurred in history without a matching contraction south of the border weakened external channels heighten canadian risks history shows that a u s recession is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a canadian downturn chart 1 indeed not since the government policy induced recession of the korean war era has canada entered a true recession without the u s also in the same predicament this 1950s incident is not even captured in statistics canada s current historical series for quarterly gdp and given the unique situation and cause bears little informative value for the current context 1 thus even though there is a precedent a canada only true recession is effectively unheard of but as the well known disclaimer says past returns are not necessarily an indicator of future performance one potential reason not to dismiss this risk is that the escape valve provided by a floating currency and the external sector may not be functioning as strongly as it once was it was a softer currency and rising exports that helped canada remain in positive territory during the 1998 asian debt crisis as well as the 2001 u s dot com implosion even as domestic demand softened markedly this brings us to the core message of this report it is unlikely for canada to enter a true recession without the u s but a statutory or technical recession is a different story 2015 is a helpful example of this over the 2015q1 to 2016q3 canada saw three quarters of economic contraction two back to back and effectively no growth traction in between those periods this ticked the box on the downturn having duration but importantly the weakness was not widespread across industries or labour markets among the provinces thus not qualifying as a true recession 2 the 2015 episode marks a technical recession in our books this was a rare occurrence considering that three other periods of weak economic momentum 1986 1995 and 2001 failed to meet the two quarter contraction bar of a technical recession this is true even in instances where the u s economic cycle was formally characterized as a true recession 2001 by the national bureau of economic research nber although the 2015 experience is rare it would not surprise us to see more of these experiences in the future for a couple of reasons to begin with simple rolling regression results indicate that the relationship between the currency and exports has weakened materially particularly since the late 1990s chart 2 to be sure the evidence still shows that a weaker loonie should give a short term boost to exports but the effect is nowhere nearly as pronounced as it has been in the past further analysis suggests that even the rolling regression results for foreign largely u s demand may be overstating the case or at least oversimplifying drilling into canadian export performance post crisis we ve seen a tendency for exports to underperform their historic relationship with foreign demand to the order of about 1 percentage point on average chart 3 3 slicing observations into smaller and smaller pieces is getting into data mining territory so a grain of salt is need but there does appear to be evidence that past macroeconomic relationships have weakened with evidence that the external sector escape valve may not be operating quite as strong as it once has it would seem short sighted to ignore the risk of a downturn simply because the u s economy appears healthy 4 again we should remember our definitions the foreign demand channel is weaker but it hasn t vanished the trade and currency dynamic within in a true recession as unlikely as that occurring in canada alone is would still place a floor under the canadian economy thus we are again talking about the risk of only a statutory recession importantly the data and trends don t even support this outcome at the moment canada broadening its horizons although canadian goods exports ex energy to the u s have been stagnant shipments to other regions are showing some promise geography and other factors mean that the u s will always be a key factor behind the strength of canadian investment and exports but other markets have become a little more important recently over the last two years canadian exporters have enjoyed increased access first to europe via ceta and from january 2019 many pacific rim south american nations via cp tpp the near term signals suggest more help may be on the way a slowdown in china has been having direct knock on impacts to asian and european economies with indirect impacts on canada via reduced overall foreign demand however in recent months chinese authorities have made significant efforts to re invigorate their economy this has come in the form of eased reserve requirements for banks and an increase in overall financing flows even larger in scope than the stimulus introduced during the global financial crisis chart 4 the surge of financing should make its way through the chinese economy in the next two to three quarters and by extension help support overall world exports through a virtuous cycle canada would benefit as demand throughout the chinese supply chain rises supporting global growth and lubricating the export flows with canada s new trade pacts in place this comes in addition to the direct impacts of chinese imports from canada which have been quite healthy of late chart 5 inventories piling up however the key risk to canada entering a technical recession or prolonged economic slump doesn t stem from the external trade sector but from domestic drivers standing out as a clear risk is the sharp inventory build up in the latter part of last year chart 6 wholesale inventories in particular are concerning popping up to an all time high in december 2018 while not quite as dramatic the manufacturing sector has also seen a rapid rise as sales fell in each of october november and december diving a bit further into the data reveals a handful of sectors that are on the bubble most notably wood product manufacturers have seen inventory levels climb rapidly likely due to softness in both canadian and u s housing markets and ongoing trade issues early data suggests some upside to activity in these markets but for canada in particular the path forward is far from certain elsewhere the ratio is elevated at present among plastics and rubber product manufacturers as well as primary metal manufacturers further demand weakness could lead to an adjustment on the production side sapping economic output clearly the risks to the sales side are tilted to the downside so the signal coming from this data is clear with increases concentrated in a few industries the risk looks more like a statutory recession not a true one domestic challenges significant as inventories have built up final domestic demand has been slowing decelerating markedly over 2018 following a strong 2017 chart 7 domestic demand has now contracted for two straight quarters the first time since 2015 and with business investment stubbornly weak however domestic demand is dominated by consumer spending which is in large part of function of the credit cycle this cycle has already turned into a decelerating phase both consumer and mortgage credit have been trending lower with the latter impacted by changes to mortgage underwriting rules that sapped borrowing demand last year chart 8 consumer credit actually contracted on a month on month basis for the first time since 2011 in december 2018 monthly noise aside all the signs are in place for a soft deleveraging cycle in which credit growth remains in positive territory but trends below household incomes the result has so far been what we expected a generalized slowing in consumer spending particularly in spending on interest rate sensitive categories such as autos and those categories linked to housing such as furnishings chart 9 5 retail sales don t capture the complete spending picture service spending takes the lion s share of consumer dollars but it can be a swing factor and serves as an early bellweather of consumer activity this is sending a clear softening signal reducing the economic cushion in the event of a shock if there s an area where late cycle dynamics have not taken hold it is within consumer insolvencies a much discussed rise in consumer insolvency activity in late 2018 looks more like a blip once it is put into perspective chart 10 our analysis suggests that it takes a deterioration of labour markets to get a meaningful increase in insolvencies and even then the impact comes with about half a year s lag meaning this data is not a leading indicator of a cycle labour market still a bright spot turning back to the insolvency picture the reason chart 10 doesn t look worse is likely because in aggregate canadian labour markets have remained solid see report roughly 195k net jobs were added over 2018 with a further 67k to kick off 2019 according to the labour force survey the less timely payrolls survey paints an even rosier picture indicating that more than 320k net payroll positions were added in 2018 even including december s modest pull back 6 the result is an unemployment rate near 40 year lows alongside record high participation rates as strong as labour markets have been there are nevertheless two flies in the ointment first wages have been decelerating a somewhat perplexing development at least part of this appears due to weakness in alberta where past oil sector shocks were still reverberating in labour markets even before late last year s heavy oil pricing crunch as such this should reverse and we have seen some very tentative evidence of this in the january data the second fly is recent weakness in aggregate hours worked which fell in both december and january this data can be useful as an early indicator of economic weakness in contrast the unemployment rate tends to be a coincident to slightly lagging indicator but the fortunate news is that this data can also be quite volatile with a few months of weakness hardly atypical even during robust expansions indeed the current reading remains well within historic norms chart 11 again we should not be dismissive of the risks but scale matters and current readings are well shy of any recessionary territory real estate set for a slog falling somewhere in between the credit cycle and still healthy labour markets are canadian real estate markets regional divergence remains the theme with markets in the west still soft quebec hot and ontario gta falling somewhere in between this is reflected in the most recent data which saw home sales rise 3 6 in january 2019 m m sa as discussed in our december housing outlook we don t expect january s performance which came after several months of falling sales to be repeated more likely is a gradual slog upwards with activity and price growth held back by still stretched affordability rising borrowing costs and in the case of prices a relatively full supply pipeline in vancouver and to a lesser extent toronto so why not a worse outlook or even an outright crash two reasons first fundamental demand is still strong particularly in key markets canadian population growth hit a record in 2018 and government targets will see continued strong inflows with many new canadians supporting demand in the landing pad cities of toronto and vancouver where populations rose at least 130k and 40k respectively last year 7 second the change in tone from both the bank of canada and the u s federal reserve in light of late 2018 developments market volatility energy sector challenges global growth deceleration etc provides some additional market sentiment support in the form of lower than previously expected borrowing costs ultimately the theme of this note is echoed in this sector the outlook is for modest activity that leaves less of a growth cushion in the event of a negative shock but growth nonetheless less buffer alone does not a downturn make and as it stands the situation in housing markets points to elevated risks not to a downturn don t rule out psychology if there is a core message to this analysis it is that yes risks to the canadian economy are elevated right now and the risk of a near term contraction in activity cannot be ruled out given that our low growth outlook allows little room for error but importantly we do not see a strong enough signal to call a downturn and even if we do get negative prints on gdp growth the most likely outcome is a shallow technical recession not a true downturn if there is a caveat however it is that we cannot ignore risks related to consumer and market psychology as discussed previously by our chief economist beata caranci negative sentiment can result in a feedback loop manifesting itself in a beetlejuice recession where growth turns negative simply because people expect it to and act accordingly for canada in particular the risk is probably greatest around household debt and the potential for deleveraging for an individual household it may make sense to reduce spending and focus on saving but if many households take the same approach the result is on aggregate a contraction in economic activity this is called the paradox of thrift where individually rational behavior is irrational in aggregate a key question is thus how likely is such an outcome or put differently are negative narratives whether media or otherwise sufficient to spur action while the labour market is doing a lot of heavy lifting in this analysis it nevertheless appears to be the linchpin for this behavior as well so long as labour markets remain healthy across most of the country and importantly the recent softness in aggregate hours worked proves temporary it is challenging to envision a sentiment led retrenchment in consumer spending that said the risk cannot be dismissed and this channel would likely work as an intensifier as the experience of the u s over 2009 2010 shows consumer deleveraging led recessions tend to be longer and more pronounced even absent a downturn slower growth deleveraging periods can be quite lengthy lasting about five years on average 8 however context matters in the unprecedented event that canada experiences this downturn on its own adjustment channels even in their diminished state should help reduce the burden it would likely take a simultaneous u s downturn to get to the worst case scenario canadian risk intensity idiosyncratic the current situation in canada has echoes of 2015 but with a few important differences for one the current shock to the energy sector is clearly temporary and price dynamics have so far exceeded expectations to the upside secondly the energy sector has as a result of past shocks declined in overall importance to the canadian economy and at the same time and more encouragingly driven efficiency gains over this time reducing the cost of production conversely the economy received 50bp of policy interest rate cuts in response to the 2014 2015 oil price shock reducing the impact by spurring growth in other sectors notably housing the result was two consecutive quarters of economic contraction and about a year and a half of stagnation but without enough breadth and leakage into the labour market to qualify as a full recession nationally 9 in contrast part of the current growth slump this time is by design on two fronts first curtailments in oil production shaved an estimated 0 5 percentage points off gdp growth in 2018q4 with a 1 1 percentage point drag expected in 2019q1 if not for this we probably wouldn t be having this discussion in the first place because growth would otherwise hang closer to the 1 0 1 5 range below trend but not dramatically so second the impact of past interest rate increases was combined with macroprudential policy on household finances either of these levers can be altered in the event of a large disappointment in the data to mitigate the downside as was the case in 2015 bank of canada willing to adjust course as one of the key stewards of the economy central banks are constantly monitoring developments and adjusting monetary policy accordingly the bank of canada is no exception as the current growth slump became evident the bank s relatively hawkish tone of communication gave way to a more dovish bent and the january monetary policy report saw their 2019q1 growth tracking marked down to 0 8 q q only modestly above our current tracking governor poloz and company are seeing the same signals that we all are and has shown willingness to adjust course for now the central bank is in wait and see mode with communications still emphasizing an eventual return to neutral currently defined as a policy interest rate within the 2 50 to 3 50 range see poloz s recent speech for instance and our commentary even this may be too lofty a goal we expect the policy rate to gradually move towards the 2 00 2 25 range reflecting our relatively more modest assumptions on trend productivity growth as well as the impact of b 20 mortgage regulations see commentary the b 20 changes have in effect already tightened policy by 200bps for a sizeable segment of the population taking the relative size of the mortgage credit market into account suggests that even today at 1 75 the policy interest rate is already within the bank s neutral range once the mortgage stress test is taken into account with all of the evidence that canada is facing its own pressures at present narratives that see the bank of canada sending the economy into recession by following the federal reserve don t make any sense all forecasts are conditional and our bank of canada outlook is no different with preconditions to action discussed in our recent dollars and sense a return to normal economic growth is a key precondition for higher rates the bank of canada s mandate is to set monetary policy appropriately to achieve its canadian inflation target not to maintain some spread to a foreign interest rate we expect the bank of canada to react to canadian economic developments positive or negative appropriately even if canadian conditions diverge from our peers and major trading partners bottom line there is no denying that canada is facing a perfect storm at present a more intense than expected moderation of economic growth came just as north american commodity markets sent canadian heavy oil prices lower resulting in an additional near term growth shock as producers curtailed output all of this is taking place against a backdrop of still highly levered households facing rising borrowing costs for the first time in a generation however a growth slump is not a recession and there are marked differences between a slump a technical recession and a true recession that said the risks are nevertheless significant canada s unique position tells us that we can have negative growth without the u s needing to also be in contraction the current growth slump means that we have less buffer room in the event of a shock thus we believe that canada is currently at a greater risk of a period of weakness than the u s a situation that echoes the 2015 experience it remains most likely that the current slump will give way to a modest growth recovery in the second half of 2019 helped by the end of major energy sector curtailments getting from here to there will be no easy feat and if current weakness in household credit growth is joined by labour markets a technical or statutory recession would be on deck however a true recession would probably still require a u s downturn an unlikely event at least in the near term end notes
these days virtually everyone agrees that economies are a mess in the united states europe and much of the rest of the world on october 25 the conference board reported that sentiment among u s consumers had sunk to lows not seen since the height of the recession a super committee of 12 members of congress is at loggerheads with only weeks to find ways to slash u s budget deficits before draconian cuts kick in automatically and in europe governments are wrestling over how to deal with the debt crisis in greece and other countries are things as bad as they seem unfortunately they are say three wharton faculty members who study economics and financial markets at a recent presentation before wharton board members franklin allen richard marston and kent smetters warned that a true recovery could be some time off and that conditions could get worse before they get better for more about the challenges facing the eurozone check out this video interview with allen and wharton management professor mauro guillen but is the u s already in a recession technically no said smetters a professor of business and public policy citing 4 annualized growth in gross domestic product in the second quarter and signs from the futures market indicating investors think there is a 75 chance that growth will continue that doesn t mean conditions are good however much of the growth is being devoured by rising inflation with real after inflation growth at only 1 3 smetters noted gdp remains far below where it would have been had it stayed on its pre recession trajectory he added although some u s corporations are reporting handsome profits others are not including the major banks after rebounding from the spring of 2009 through the spring of 2011 the stock market has turned jittery as investors worry about what will come next the financial market turbulence is likely to continue worldwide smetters predicted costs of options contracts which are used to insure against investment losses have soared indicating many investors agree the price has more than doubled in the past year and half two years smetters said the market itself is basically saying yes there a lot of volatility while the u s is technically in recovery this one has some unusual features added marston a finance professor basically we re in a classic recovery in terms of the markets and in terms of consumption in addition exports are 10 higher than they were before the start of the recession gdp while below its long term trend is as high as it was before the recession while consumption is actually higher than it was before the recession marston said what then is the problem normally consumption skyrockets after a recession ends this time it has recovered but not accelerated marston noted household balance sheets remain severely impaired largely because of losses from the collapse in home prices the typical home is worth 20 to 30 less than before the recession and about a quarter of homeowners with mortgages owe more than their homes are worth millions of americans face foreclosure in addition labor demand remains far below normal marston noted high unemployment which remains stalled around 9 1 means millions of people are not spending as they normally would and many of those who are working have tightened spending because they feel insecure unemployment is lasting longer than usual causing workers skills to erode and thus hurting the chances for earning as much in new positions as they did in their old jobs the employment prospects are particularly bleak for people without college degrees unemployment for those with college degrees is only about 4 2 most importantly business investment remains depressed marston stated firms increased their investments by about 20 from the beginning of 2005 through the end of 2007 but the figure has since dropped and is currently only about 5 above the 2005 level some large corporations are sitting on enormous reserves that could fund hiring or other expansion but they do not spend because with demand low they don t need to expand in a normal recovery companies spend money on office buildings factories and other facilities boosting the economy this time we have a legacy of a real estate boom with little need for more space marston pointed out in addition companies that do want to expand but don t have enough cash on hand to pay for those projects are having trouble obtaining loans although many lenders have the money to offer financing they are nervous about whether they will be paid back if economic conditions do not improve marston noted commercial and industrial loans remain far below their peak levels at the start of 2009 though cash assets at commercial banks are approaching 2 trillion double the early 2009 level banks are conserving money to meet new regulatory requirements many of which are still taking shape marston said financial institutions also need reserves on hand in case they have to pay large settlements in lawsuits brought by many states over the the banks role in selling mortgage securities that collapsed in value fearing a domino effect the debt crisis in europe causes further difficulties for the u s according to marston the u s banks are interconnected with europe the problems in europe are the key cause of increased talk about the possibility of another recession here he added noting that before the european debt crisis flared up this summer stock markets were on a roll now they are stalled if europe blows up we will all go into a deep recession he warned today many u s corporations are heavily dependent on markets in europe and other regions smetters said in 2008 for example nearly 48 of revenue for companies in the standard poor s 500 came from foreign operations up from less than 42 in 2003 twenty five years ago that number was in the teens business interconnection means trouble in one region is more likely to affect another that can be seen in the behavior of stock markets in the united states and europe which now usually march in lockstep the ups and downs of the two markets correlate or move in tandem nearly 85 of the time compared to less than 50 in the 1990s smetters stated the debt crisis in greece poses the most serious immediate problem for europe and the collapse in prices on greek bonds have driven their yields through the roof from less than 6 a year ago to more than 18 today such high yields indicate that the bond market expects greece to default on its government bonds according to marston soaring yields on irish and portuguese bonds show investors are worried about those countries as well although leaders in france germany and other european countries are working to address the greek problem they cannot bring themselves to back a rescue similar to the troubled asset relief program used in the united states northern europeans don t believe fiscal transfers are fair marston said noting that german leaders have long argued that such transfers should not be a feature of the unified european economy northern european leaders also worry that greece will follow a bailout by getting into trouble again at the same time northern europeans are fearful of simply cutting greece loose and allowing it to default citing worries of a domino effect in portugal ireland and perhaps italy and spain french and german banks hold large amounts of debt from those countries and would be badly damaged by defaults marston pointed out some experts argue that it would be best to let greece default and suffer economic catastrophe forcing the country to deal with the problem quickly rather than dragging it out but a european sense of solidarity makes leaders reluctant to do that said allen a finance professor many believe the punitive treaty of versailles destroyed the german middle class after world war i making it easier for the nazis to gain power problems also ensued when france was forced to pay crushing reparations after the franco prussian war when people use this word solidarity that s what they are talking about we don t want to go back to what happened in the late 19th century and early 20th century allen noted in contrast germany and japan flourished under the comparatively magnanimous treaties ending world war ii an almost impossible situation according to allen there are five possible outcomes for the current debt crisis all with relatively equal probabilities in one investors would take partial losses on greek bonds and the other troubled governments would somehow avoid default or the need for bailouts a second scenario involves some kind of fudge perhaps allowing more money to be printed and rolling debts over for 20 or 30 years with very low interest rates allen said a third possibility would involve much bigger losses on debts while a fourth would have greece leave the euro zone and return to using the drachma as its currency the fifth scenario something completely unforeseen which is always possible with multiple governments involved it s a very complicated problem allen noted there are some benign outcomes but there are some very scary ones as well have a little patience with these politicians marston added they are facing an almost impossible situation this is also the case in the united states where government debt threatens to soak up a growing portion of economic output smetters stated according to figures from the congressional budget office federal tax revenues as a percentage of gross domestic product have remained relatively steady at 19 in 1970 and 18 5 in 2007 with the level expected to rise slightly to 20 8 in 2021 but government outlays are expected to soar from 19 3 of gdp in 1970 and 19 6 in 2007 to a projected 24 in 2021 the main culprit is the growth of spending for social security medicare medicaid and other health programs as the baby boomers age people live longer and medical costs keep rising spending on these programs equaled 3 8 of gdp in 1970 and 8 2 in 2007 and is expected to reach 12 in 2021 even if other spending falls as a portion of gdp heaver entitlement spending will cause the annual budget deficit to rise to 3 2 of gdp in 2021 from 1 2 in 2007 and 0 3 in 1970 in august congress created the joint select committee on deficit reduction composed of 12 members of congress equally divided between the senate and house democrats and republicans the group is to come up with 1 5 trillion in deficit cuts over 10 years if the committee fails to agree on a package or congress fails to approve one by december 23 cuts totaling 1 2 trillion will automatically be triggered including severe cuts in defense as of late october it is unclear whether the committee will succeed with republicans opposing tax increases and democrats resisting large cuts in entitlements like social security and medicare but even if the committee does hammer out a proposal that is approved by congress the u s will still face tough problems even if they can come up with a couple of trillion dollars in deficit cuts says smetters it s puny compared to what s needed the views expressed in this article are the author s own and do

update and correction is neoliberalism killing russia by paul craig roberts and michael hudson march 01 2019 information clearing house i have learned from andrei martyanov that southfront org s report misinterprets the russian vciom poll the poll asked who is the most trusted politician in russia putin was first according to 32 6 of respondents shoigu with 15 6 of respondents and lavrov with 13 2 of respondents these percentages are not approval ratings of the individuals the percentages represent the share of the respondents who chose them as the most trusted politician if you add these percentages it shows that overall the three most trusted politicians account for 61 4 of the respondants as these three individuals are the most visible members of the russian government obviously there is high confidence in the government although putin s approval rating has been hurt by the pension reform and value added tax his approval rating has declined but is still high with this correction we have decided to leave the article up for now as the article is about the damage done to russia by neoliberal economics our title is is neoliberalism killing russia and not is putin s approval rating killing russia we might edit the article and repost it in order to correct the southfront misinterpretation of the poll is neoliberlism killing russia by paul craig roberts and michael hudson s outhfront org reports that according to polls by vciom a state pollster the russian public s confidence in putin prime minister dmitry medvedev and the russian cabinet has dramatically declined over the past year the decline is related to domestic not foreign policy apparently the public perceives recent kremlin economic policy as a continuation of the disastrous policies that washington imposed on russia in the 1990s when russia was loaded up with foreign debt while state assets were privatized and plundered by oligarchs sponsored by the west who cashed out by selling the assets to foreigners are you tired of the lies and non stop propaganda get your free daily newsletter russia s stock market became the darling of the west in the mid 1990s as underpriced mining oil and infrastructure were sold for a fraction of their value to foreigners thus transferring russian income streams abroad instead of leaving the income to be invested in russia in effect russians were told that the way for their country to get rich was to let kleptocrats oligarchs and their u s and british stock brokers make hundreds of billions of dollars by privatizing russia s public domain washington took advantage of the gullible and trusting yeltsin government to do as much political and economic damage as possible to russia the country was torn apart historic parts of russia such as ukraine were split off into separate countries washington even insisted that crimera long a part of russia and the country s warm water port was retained by ukraine when the soviet union was dismembered the approval rating of putin and the medvedev government dropped sharply in response to the recent increases in the retirement age and value added tax the former raised concerns about pension security and reminded russians of the collapse of soviet pensions the latter reduced consumer disposable income and lowered consumer demand and the economic growth rate these policies represent austerity imposed on the domestic population instead of on foreign creditors and reflect the neoliberal view that austerity leads to prosperity the us sanctions give russians every reason not to repay their foreign loans yet russians continue to enable their own exploitation by foreigners as neoliberal economists have told them that there is no alternative russia is experiencing capital outflows due to the russian private sector s repayment of loans to western creditors russia has experienced over 25 billion a year of capital outflows since the early 1990s accumulating to over a trillion dollars this money could have been invested in russia itself to raise the productivity and living standards of its citizens the outflow puts the ruble under pressure and the interest payments draw money out of the country away from russian uses if it were not for these outflows the value of the ruble and russian wages would be higher russia s economic problems are due to the looting of the country during the yeltsin years to the imposition of neoliberal economics by the americans and to financialization as a result of the privatizations people s savings called the overhang were wiped out with hyperinflation privatization was not accompanied by new investment the economy was not industrialized but financialized the proceeds from privatization were deposited by the russian government in private banks where the money was used to privatize more russian assets the banking system thus served to finance the transfer of ownership not to fund new investment and the proceeds were transferred abroad russia was turned into a financial colony in which proconsuls created wealth at the top today privatization continues in the de facto privatization of public assets such as charging fees for use of federal highways as the russian economic profession has been brainwashed by the americans the country is devoid of economic leadership we have pointed out on more than one occasion that it is nonsensical for russia to indebt itself by borrowing abroad in order to finance investments the russians were sold a bill of goods that the central bank cannot issue rubles unless the rubles are backed by dollars this advice served to prevent russia from using its own central bank to fund public infrastructure and private investment projects by issuing rubles in other words russia might as well not have a central bank apparently russian economists do not understand that russia does not spend borrowed foreign currencies inside russia if russia takes a foreign loan the borrowed money goes into central bank reserves the central bank then issues the ruble equivalent to be spent on the project and the cost of the project goes up by the pointless interest paid to the foreign lender as far as we can tell the institute of economics of the russian academy of sciences is so brainwashed by neoliberal economics that their minds are closed to correct policies the failure of russian economic leadership imposes far more costs on the russian economy than do washington s sanctions southfront s report says that the russian government has failed to explain its economic policy to the public perhaps the reason is that the public unlike the economists has not been brainwashed and will see through the nonsensical explanations apparently there is also no intellectual leadership although putin is a leader and has a sense of russian purpose many officials use their office not in service to russia but in service to their own wealth much of which is held abroad corruption and embezzlement seem to be the purpose of many office holders scandals abound among members of government and reflect badly on putin and medvedev the russian government s popularity was at a peak when the government showed it had the intelligence and will to reincorporate crimea into russia however the russian government hoping to reassure washington and europe refused the requests of the luhansk and donetsk republics to be reincorporated into russia russian nationalists the majority of the population saw this as kowtowing to the west moreover this mistake by the russian government has resulted in ukraine s ongoing military assault on the breakaway republics and to the arming of ukraine by the west instead of acting decisively the russian government enabled the continuation of conflict that can be exploited by washington the russian people understand this even if the government does not by failing to show firmness the russian government encourages the crony system of oligarchs who want a government that they can use for their narrow interests their interests include participating in the system of western plunder known as globalism these client elites of the west oppose a powerful russian state that could assert itself on the world stage and offer an alternative policy to the west s policy of plunder the influence of this narrow interest group on government policy indicates that the russian government is compromised putin is trying to break free of the west s grip by directing russia s economic orientation to the east his effort is helped by the american sanctions but russia remains sufficiently mired in the western system to be vulnerable to sanctions and is only slowly extracting itself to be part of the west has been an important goal since peter the first and catherine the great and the russian atlanticist integrationists cannot let go of the ancient goal this goal no longer makes sense not only does it imply russian vassalage but also europe is no longer the center of power the east is rising and china is the center and will be until the chinese destroy themselves by copying the western neoliberal policy of financializing the economy various aspects of russia s difficulties and transformation into a power with a foot in both west and east are discussed by commentators what goes unacknowledged is that russian economic policy is constrained indeed crippled by the neoliberal brainwashing given to russian economists by the americans in the 1990s consequently russia is enfeebled by an economic policy that encourages privatization and foreign ownership and by financialization of economic rents that is of income streams that do not result from productive investment but from such factors as location and rise in value due to public infrastructure development such as a road built across a property in a financialized economy credit is used to transfer property ownership instead of to finance new plant and equipment and construction of infrastructure the russian government and central bank have been blinded to the fact that russian infrastructure projects and private investment are not dependent on borrowing dollars abroad or by acquiring dollars by selling russian assets to foreigners such projects can be financed by ruble creation by the russian central bank money that flows into productive projects that raise output is not inflationary generally speaking such projects lower costs for russia to succeed russia needs an economic re education and a government that finds its footing in russian nationalism and discourages western provocations with firmer responses it is our view that the western world indeed all of life has an interest in a russia too strong to be attacked or provoked as a strong russia is the only way to curtail the western aggression that is leading to nuclear war dr paul craig roberts was assistant secretary of the treasury for economic policy and associate editor of the wall street journal he was columnist for business week scripps howard news service and creators syndicate he has had many university appointments his internet columns have

u s review drawing the curtain on 2018 economic data out the gate this week provided some clarity on how the economy fared through the end of 2018 real gdp in the united states grew at an annualized rate of 2 6 in the fourth quarter this marked a deceleration from the breakneck pace seen in the prior two quarters but was above the market expectation of a 2 2 gain q4 gdp data and housing starts and personal income and spending data now available through december confirmed our expectation of a slowdown in growth to end 2018 drawing the curtain on 2018 economic data out the gate this week provided some clarity on how the economy fared through the remainder of 2018 the partial government shutdown which began in december and lasted well into january had continued to delay important data releases clouding analysts assessments of the economy s performance data on q4 gdp and housing starts and personal income and spending data now available through december confirmed our expectation of a slowdown in growth to end 2018 the u s commerce department released data on thursday which showed that real gdp grew at an annualized rate of 2 6 in the fourth quarter while this pace of growth still represents a step down from the strong growth rates experienced earlier last year at 2 6 growth was above the market expectation of 2 2 real personal consumption expenditures pce grew only 2 8 in the fourth quarter leading much of the deceleration in gdp growth the weakness can be traced to the weak spending environment in december with both personal spending and retail sales experiencing their largest declines since the recession year of 2009 real pce was in part boosted earlier last year by personal tax cuts but these real income boosting effects will likely fade this year personal income rose 1 0 in december but fell 0 1 in january income growth should regain some strength this year due to the robust labor market consumer confidence data for february suggested consumers have regained some optimism the present situation component of the index improved to a cycle high of 173 5 while the expectations component jumped 14 points expectations of job prospects and improvements in income have propelled the outlook but fewer purchasing plans of autos homes and major appliances weighed on overall optimism taking this anecdotal indication with recent hard data on durable goods orders suggests that growth in capital spending will likely be anemic in the first half of 2019 after a slow pace of growth in the third quarter business fixed investment bfi spending rebounded at a rate of 6 4 in the fourth quarter but the construction components of bfi remained weak non residential construction fell 4 2 while the residential side declined for the fourth consecutive quarter a separate press release from the commerce department revealed that housing starts plunged 11 2 in december mortgage rates were up to a near 5 last year which threatened to worsen the affordability crisis that has been dragging home sales and new home construction lower since march of last year rising home prices had only exacerbated weakness in residential construction last year but with mortgage rates now lower and building permits having risen in january there may be some upside pressure to housing starts in 2019 despite the slowdown in the fourth quarter the stronger thanexpected gdp outturn should alleviate some concern that the economy is in serious trouble as we look further ahead to 2019 our current forecast looks for a further deceleration in the first quarter but for a modest rebound starting in the second quarter u s outlook ism non manufacturing tuesday the ism non manufacturing index fell 1 3 points in january at 56 7 the index remains consistent with the economy expanding at a decent rate but the pullback added to the evidence that the u s economy has lost some momentum since the second half of 2018 part of the drop in january may have been attributable to the government shutdown as a number of survey respondents noted its negative effect in their comments with the shutdown over we expect to see a modest bounce back in the february ism nonmanufacturing index consistent with the service sector pmis from the federal reserve system rebounding another near 60 reading would suggest that the u s economy is handling recent crosscurrents without much issue and therefore raise the prospect of the fomc increasing the fed funds rate again this year a downside miss however would support the fomc remaining in its current holding pattern on rates previous 56 7 wells fargo 57 2 consensus 57 3 employment friday hiring got off to a robust start to the year with employers adding 304 000 new jobs in january we suspect job growth moderated in february however jobless claims have drifted up over the past month pmi employment readings have softened since late last year and hiring of temporary help has slowed in addition the partial government shutdown that stretched nearly all of january and was only tentatively resolved through the first half of february likely delayed some federal sector and private contractor hiring with furloughed workers back on the job in february however the jobless rate should resume its downward trend and fall to 3 9 another blowout report would raise questions about how long the fomc may remain patient before lifting rates further this year a surprisingly soft number however is unlikely to sway the fed s nearterm policy stance given that a broad array of data still point to a strong jobs market overall previous 304 000 wells fargo 195 000 consensus 188 000 housing starts friday housing starts tumbled at the end of 2018 dropping 11 2 that was the third decline in four months as builder confidence late in the year was sapped by higher mortgage rates we expect to see a modest rebound in housing starts for january and further improvements in the following months since nearly reaching 5 00 in november mortgage rates have fallen roughly 60 bps fueling some improvement in homebuilder sentiment at the same time multifamily permits have been running ahead of starts housing data this time of year must be interpreted with caution given that low levels of activity in the winter can lead to exaggerated readings after seasonal adjustment with that caveat in mind another surprisingly soft print in january would suggest that the housing sector remains in a somewhat perilous position while a stronger than expected rebound would suggest that the fed s softer stance is already feeding through to the economy previous 1 08m wells fargo 1 20m consensus 1 17m global review global uncertainty remains elevated for the time being geopolitical developments dominated headlines for the majority of the week highlighted by president trump s second meeting with kim jung un a delay in additional tariffs on chinese exports as well as military engagement between india and pakistan while each of these situations presents its own risks in aggregate they have the ability to result in heightened levels of global uncertainty while we do not expect any major escalations in these geopolitical events at this time it is worth noting these potential event risks still exist and can potentially have lasting impacts on market sentiment geopolitics remain in focus many of the headlines we witnessed this week were dominated by geopolitical developments around the world highlighted by president trump s second meeting with north korean leader kim jung un as well as president trump s decision to delay additional tariffs on chinese exports to the united states as expected the second meeting between president trump and kim jung un did not yield too many tangible results towards the de nuclearization of north korea in fact media reports suggest the meeting ended rather abruptly with neither side willing to make sufficient concessions at this time while tensions in 2017 2018 have receded the north korean leaders unwillingness to completely destroy missile test sites and abandon the country s nuclear capabilities along with president trump s cautious approach towards removing economic sanctions on north korea may add to additional uncertainty going forward in contrast some progress has been made over the past few months in regard to the united states ongoing trade negotiations with china while a long term deal has yet to be made president trump s decision to delay additional tariffs on chinese exports was greeted with optimism suggesting a deal may be made in the near future as of now china has agreed to purchase additional u s goods particularly as it relates to agricultural products however differences still exist over issues of technology transfers and intellectual property theft these differences culminated in u s trade representative robert lighthizer commenting that the two countries are still far apart on making a trade deal however markets seem to be relatively optimistic for the prospects of a deal evidenced by the recent strength of the chinese renminbi arguably the most sensitive asset to tariffs and trade discussions the persistent trade tensions also appear to be having a more notable impact on china s economy as well while a deceleration in chinese economic activity has been underway for some time the imposition of tariffs has likely exacerbated a slowdown in china s growth recent data continue to suggest a further slowdown in the chinese economy with february s manufacturing pmis falling further while the non manufacturing pmis slowed as well outside of geopolitical developments directly involving the u s india and pakistan engaged in military activity with each other this week the ongoing skirmish originated from a pakistani terrorist attack in india which prompted retaliation from india s military at the current juncture pakistan is holding an indian pilot captive although recent comments from the prime minister of pakistan suggest his willingness to release him in an effort to de escalate the situation should this escalate any further it could result in a slowdown of foreign capital flowing into india which may have an impact on the country s growth outlook gdp growth in india has recently underperformed expectations with q4 growth of 6 6 yoy missing estimates and indicating a further slowdown in the economy these developments could also have implications for india s upcoming general election where current prime minister narendra modi has already lost some of his support global outlook australia gdp tuesday australian economic data have been quite weak over the past few months highlighted by a notable gdp slowdown in q3 2018 that sluggishness may have carried over into q4 as well with leading indicators suggesting another subdued quarter of gdp growth domestic imbalances have likely contributed to the weak data however we expect china s slowdown has played a sizeable role in australia s softening economy as well economic ties between the two asia pacific countries are significant with about 35 of australia s total exports going to china as china s economy continued to show signs of slowing down towards the end of last year we expect this to impact australia s q4 gdp release next week the slowdown in australia s economy has caught the attention of the reserve bank of australia rba as well the rba recently shifted to a more neutral monetary policy stance moving away from a slightly hawkish bias citing concerns over the country s outlook previous 0 3 consensus 0 5 quarter over quarter central bank of turkey wednesday the central bank of turkey will announce its decision on its main policy rate next week with consensus forecasts suggesting a hold is likely however we believe the likelihood for a policy rate cut at the march 6 meeting is higher than consensus forecasts currently anticipate with cpi inflation softening more than expected and a lira that has been relatively stable since its significant depreciation in 2018 this could provide the central bank with scope to prematurely cut policy rates concerns regarding the independence of the central bank still exist as well and with local elections coming up at the end of march the turkish administration may choose to put pressure on the central bank to prioritize growth and reduce policy rates markets may be taking that view as well as they are currently pricing in 150 bps of rate cuts over the next three months and also imply about 900 bps of cumulative rate cuts over the next 12 months may be coming as well previous 24 00 consensus 24 00 european central bank thursday with economic data indicating a further deceleration in the broader european economy markets will likely be paying close attention to next week s ecb meeting while a policy rate move is not expected market participants are likely to be focused on ecb president mario draghi s comments as well as any revised growth and inflation targets while we expect some additional downward revisions to the ecb s growth and inflation forecasts we will also be looking for any shift in commentary surrounding the balance of risks to the european economy a further acknowledgement of downside risks could potentially be accompanied by an additional round of stimulus measures particularly in the form of targeted long term refinancing operations tltros in addition we believe markets will also look for hints that the ecb may delay policy rate hikes longer than expected and continue to keep accommodative monetary policy in place through the end of the year previous 0 40 wells fargo 0 40 consensus 0 40 point of view interest rate watch powell reiterates patience federal reserve chairman powell presented the fed s semi annual monetary policy report to two congressional committees this week in general powell presented a fairly upbeat assessment of the u s economy he said that the federal open market committee fomc views current economic conditions as healthy and the economic outlook as favorable and he characterized the job market as strong that said powell also acknowledged some crosscurrents and conflicting signals powell mentioned the volatility that hit financial markets late last year and signs of slower growth in some major foreign economies both factors if prolonged could cause the u s economy to decelerate even more than it already has during the q a session powell continued to stress that the fomc could be patient regarding its next policy steps although the economy has decelerated somewhat the overall pace of economic activity appears to remain solid furthermore consumer price inflation is currently running more or less at the fed s target of 2 thus there is no need for the fomc to rush into further rate hikes nor does growth appear weak enough that the fomc needs to start easing policy fed policymakers have the luxury of being able to see what incoming economic data over the next few months portend for the economic outlook in that regard we continue to forecast that the fomc will judge it necessary to tap on the brakes again with another 25 bps rate hike later this year for starters overall financial market conditions are less tight today than they were at the end of last year in addition the drag from the housing market on real gdp growth should lessen due to the recent decline in mortgage rates investment spending should also strengthen somewhat if as we expect uncertainties related to trade policy begin to dissipate although we look for real gdp growth to slow in q1 from the 2 6 rate that it registered in q4 2018 we forecast that growth will strengthen again in q2 if as we forecast the labor market tightens further in coming months then the fomc should conclude that another rate hike is needed credit market insights shock and spend when consumers receive a sudden boost to their income they are most likely to save or pay down debt and when their income unexpectedly drops they are most likely to reduce spending according to the new york fed s survey of consumers marginal propensity to spend upon receiving an unexpected windfall consumers report that they would spend only 17 while saving or paying down debt with the remainder more than a year after the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act which reduced taxes on average by 1 600 per household according to the tax policy center we can attempt to look at how consumers behaved the household sector has certainly deleveraged over the past decade with the debt todisposable income ratio currently sitting at the lowest level since 2001 and down almost a third since its peak in 2007 domestic demand for safe assets has also been quite strong at the same time personal consumption grew quite strongly over 2018 fueled by the aforementioned fiscal stimulus as well as a robust labor market that is finally generating some higher wage growth the survey suggests an asymmetric response to income shocks when income unexpectedly drops 75 is covered by reduced spending the possibility of smaller tax refunds to start this year provides another interesting case study of how consumers respond to external shocks to their income still we do not expect lower refunds to significantly reduce consumer spending this year read more here topic of the week december chill in consumer spending the year 2018 ended with a thud stock markets nosedived into the final days of the year to mark one of the biggest year end selloffs in memory congress was also unable to reach agreement on an appropriations bill and was thus forced to shut down the government on december 22 it is fair to say that some consumers were simply not in the holiday spirit after peaking in october measures of consumer confidence slipped for three straight months and some retailers reported lighter activity in the final month of the year another cost of the government shutdown beyond adding to consumer anxieties was that it delayed the release of the december retail sales report when those numbers finally became available they raised more than a few eyebrows control group retail sales which serve as a proxy for consumer spending as it is reported in the gdp accounts plunged 1 7 the biggest sequential decline in almost 20 years and larger than any single month drop during the 2007 2009 recession are things really that bad the quick answer is no that was more or less confirmed this week with the gdp report which revealed a respectable 2 8 growth rate for real pce in the fourth quarter but on friday the picture came a bit more into focus with the release of the combined december and january personal income and spending report the shadow of the shutdown still hangs over us and the report offered only personal income figures for january and the usual full report for december yes spending slipped in december but it was revised higher for november a scant decline in income for january may reflect payback after an upwardly revised surge in december consumer confidence is rebounding as evident in the university of michigan s survey of consumer sentiment which improved in february consumers face some headwinds and we see scope for a moderation in growth but this is not the beginning of a steep retrenchment in our view
as u s china trade talks continue with the march 1 tariff freeze deadline being extended president donald trump is right when he calls china s trade policy unfair because it undermines a reciprocal free trade relationship trump should be commended for being the first president in recent history to push for trade reform that could lead to more overall free trade sign up for our daily newsletter sign up thank you for signing up by clicking submit you agree to our terms of service and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails product samples and promotions on this website and other properties you can opt out anytime see all of our newsletters while chinese policymakers are concerned about slowing gdp growth in china continued chinese protectionist economic policy is not the answer to helping their own people subscribe to observer s business newsletter free markets have done more than any other system to help lift individuals out of poverty which is especially true in china in many respects the chinese opening up reforms which former chinese president deng xiaoping implemented in china just over 40 years ago to liberalize china s agricultural industrial and financial sectors were one of the greatest victories in human history for free market capitalism according to the world bank deng xiaoping s economic reforms have since helped lift more than 500 million people out of poverty in 40 years and were instrumental in creating the chinese middle class around the time china s economic reforms were first introduced 81 percent of china s population was living in poverty as measured by the percentage of people living on 1 90 usd or less per day in 2011 purchasing price parity terms whereas in 2012 this number stood at only 6 5 percent u2 frontman bono was right when he recently said that capitalism has taken more people out of poverty than any other ism today as china may be on the verge of an economic slowdown these same free market insights exemplified by deng xiaoping s market reforms in china should be remembered by today s chinese trade negotiators china s high tariffs barriers preventing global market access and intellectual property theft are very substantial anti growth economic policies which largely work to raise prices on chinese consumers and lower economic growth globally first with respect to tariffs chinese tariffs are demonstrably higher than u s tariffs for instance a car sold from the u s into china has a 25 percent tariff whereas a car sold from china into the u s receives a 2 5 percent tariff gains from trade could be made on both country s parts by moving toward trump s zero tariff vision a recent study by the peterson institute for international economics found that a u s china bilateral free trade agreement would increase chinese national income by 300 billion primarily achieved through a boost to foreign direct investment the study also found that such an agreement would increase u s exports by almost 400 billion annually increase u s national income by more than 100 billion annually and add 1 7 million jobs to the u s economy over 10 years second regarding market access china remains essentially completely closed to foreign investment in its education telecommunications and cultural sectors china also can place quotas as it pleases on various imports for instance in the month of october 2018 china had a complete ban on u s soybean imports and instead redirected its domestic soybean demand to be met by imports from brazil finally with respect to intellectual property theft a report by the commission on the theft of american intellectual property estimated that china alone is behind 50 to 80 percent of ip theft cases globally costing the u s economy 300 billion every year and millions of jobs that being said there may be some encouraging signs that china is already moving in a positive direction to adopt further market reforms china s president xi jinping has signaled that the country is willing to reduce china s 25 percent tariff on auto imports and there is evidence that in recent years china has increasingly allowed it s yuan u s dollar exchange rate to become more flexible according to a recent new york fed study of course actions speak louder than words and the u s must trust but verify to use ronald reagan s words in negotiating with china

open this photo in gallery despite what mr trump seen here on november 2018 likes to point to as an economic miracle in the country voters remain divided on the state of the economy kevin lamarque reuters if there is anything u s voters should be able to agree about these days it s that the economy is doing pretty well unemployment fell below 4 per cent in 2018 the lowest in 49 years gross domestic product a broad measure of economic activity grew by 2 9 per cent last year was among the best for the u s economy in the past decade as consumers and businesses boosted their spending yet two years into his presidency u s president donald trump remains as deeply unpopular as before his approval rating has averaged just 40 per cent during his presidency only 44 per cent of voters said they approved of the president in february roughly the same as when he took office in january 2017 as the least popular incoming president in 72 years despite what mr trump likes to point to as an economic miracle in the country voters remain divided on the state of the economy more than 80 per cent of republicans told gallup last month that the economy was getting better just 31 per cent of democrats agreed mr trump s struggles to translate a strong economy into rising popularity upend conventional wisdom about how voters are supposed to behave for much of modern history presidents could count on being rewarded for presiding over an economic recovery and punished during a downturn for a long time research has found a strong link between the economy and presidential approval pepperdine university political scientist brian newman says that link may be broken entirely or it may be more nuanced and harder to see now the trump presidency is helping to confirm new ideas about how voters actually make up their minds on the health of the economy with significant implications for things like consumer spending a deeply partisan lens voters have become increasingly polarized in how they see presidents a trend political scientists say started in the late 1990s and has reached record levels under mr trump nearly 90 per cent of republicans said they approved of the president last year compared with just 8 per cent of democrats it is the biggest partisan gap recorded and points to why mr trump s approval rating has barely budged since he took office if the president s partisans are willing to defend him or excuse anything then his approval rating can only drop so far said john sides a political scientist at george washington university if the opposite party s voters won t give him credit for anything then his approval rating can only rise so far that growing political polarization helps explain why voters now tend to interpret what should be objective measures of the economy such as job growth or stock market gains through a deeply partisan lens republican optimism about the economy soared in the months after mr trump took office despite little actual change meanwhile democrats today are as pessimistic about the economy as republicans were in 2009 when barack obama took office amid a deep recession mr trump has faced another conundrum the better the economy performs the less voters tend to focus on it during the early years of the obama administration nearly 80 per cent of americans told pollsters the economy was the most important issue today that number is closer to 12 per cent mr trump himself has helped shift attention away from the economy by focusing on issues dr newman says are most likely to polarize voters such as immigration and a border wall researchers are also starting to dispel the popular narrative of 2016 election campaign that the economic anxieties of the white working class fuelled racial fears about immigration and global trade instead they argue that long standing racial tensions influence voters ideas about the economy dr sides says the strongest indicator that people voted for mr trump was not personal finances but whether they told public opinion polls as far back as 2011 that they believed non white workers were getting ahead at the expense of white workers the important factor was not whether you thought you might lose your job but whether you thought whites were losing jobs to minorities he says those racialized ideas on economic fairness helped underpin support for mr trump s signature campaign pledges to rip up free trade agreements and build a wall with mexico the spending gap at the same time new research indicates a president s popularity actually affects how consumers spend money studying decades of data academics ellen key and kathleen donovan found that a slight decline in a president s approval caused a significant drop in consumer spending that lasted for several months over time steady changes in a president s approval rating can add up to billions of dollars in added or lost economic growth increasing political polarization also makes it more likely a sizeable share of voters will always disapprove of a president and curb their spending because of it not only does approval affect how we think the economy is doing but it also affects how we spend our money says dr key a political scientist at appalachian state university with consumer spending being such a big component of gdp this means how we feel about the president could actually end up affecting objective economic conditions economists have seen signs of this under mr trump consumer confidence increased sharply after the 2016 election but actual consumer spending has not responded as quickly some political scientists chalk this disconnect up to fears among democrats and many independent voters about what mr trump could do to the economy confidence historically was a good guide to actual consumer spending says andrew hunter senior u s economist with capital economics but since the election confidence shot up but consumption growth didn t there s potentially been this big gap over the past two or three years that hasn t really showed any signs of closing while data are scant on how national politics affects the ways republicans and democrats spend their money there is some evidence partisan voters respond to different economic signals democrats are more sensitive to the unemployment rate republicans to inflation dr key says microsoft research found that republican neighbourhoods in new york registered more new vehicles after mr trump s election than democratic neighbourhoods during mr trump s presidency republicans have tended to point to soaring stock market returns and business investment as signs of the country s economic resurgence democrats point to stagnant wages amid a rising cost of living soaring health care costs and student debt as proof the economy is not working for everyone adding to mr trump s challenge in selling his message of an economic renaissance the u s economy is widely expected to slow this year thanks partly to u s federal reserve interest rate hikes that have helped curb home sales and the end to the temporary spending boost from republican tax cuts while that will keep the u s economy from overheating it could be bad for mr trump heading into a 2020 presidential election lesser growth creates its own political risks only because the president and his economists said that we could grow by 3 per cent for the next decade or more says joel naroff president of naroff economic advisors that will likely make it harder for the president to convince voters of his economic miracle and give republicans and democrats even more reason to disagree about the state of the u s economy

private prisons and detention centers no more profiteering from locking people up no more war on drugs no more keeping people in jail because they re too poor to afford cash bail and by the way when

donald trump wants to divide us up by the color of our skin our country of origin our gender our religion and our sexual orientation we are going to do exactly the opposite we are going to bring our people together black white latino native american asian american gay and straight young and old men and women native born and immigrant we are going to bring our people together for an unprecedented grassroots effort which i am happy to tell you already has over one million people signed up as volunteers if i might as i return here to brooklyn let me take a moment to become personal as we launch this campaign for president you deserve to know where i come from because family history heavily influences the values that we adopt as adults i was born and raised a few miles away from here in a three and a half room rent controlled apartment my father was a paint salesman who worked hard his entire life but never made much money my mother raised my brother and me i learned a great deal about immigration as a child because my father came to this country from poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket he came to escape the crushing poverty that existed in his community and to escape widespread anti semitism and it was a good thing that he left poland when he did because virtually his entire family there was wiped out by nazi barbarism i am not going to tell you that i grew up in a home of desperate poverty that would not be true but what i will tell you is that coming from a lower middle class family i will never forget how money or really lack of money was always a point of stress in our home my mother s dream was that someday our family would move out of that rent controlled apartment to a home of our own that dream was never fulfilled she died young while we were still living in that rent controlled apartment my experience as a kid living in a family that struggled economically powerfully influenced my life and my values unlike donald trump who shut down the government and left 800 000 federal employees without income to pay the bills i know what it s like to be in a family that lives paycheck to paycheck now it s true i did not have a father who gave me millions of dollars to build luxury skyscrapers casinos and country clubs i did not come from a family that gave me a 200 000 allowance every year beginning at the age of 3 as i recall my allowance was 25 cents a week but i had something more valuable i had the role model of a father who had unbelievable courage in journeying across an ocean with no money in his pocket to start a new and better life i did not come from a family of privilege that prepared me to entertain people on television by telling workers you re fired i came from a family who knew all too well the frightening power employers can have over everyday workers i did not come from a politically connected family whose multinational corporation got special tax breaks and subsidies i came from a family where my parents paid their taxes and understood the important role that government plays in a democracy i did not come from a family that could afford to send my brother and me to an elite boarding school in fact i was educated in high quality public schools here in brooklyn and began the first year of my college life on this very campus i should also mention that my brother graduated from brooklyn college having attended an excellent public college that was then virtually tuition free and living in a rent controlled apartment i can assure you that my family believed that government in a democratic society had a very important role to play in protecting working families i did not come from a family that taught me to build a corporate empire through housing discrimination i protested housing discrimination was arrested for protesting school segregation and attended reverend dr martin luther king s march on washington for jobs and freedom brothers and sisters over the last two years and before you and i and millions of americans have stood up and fought for justice in every part of our society and we ve had some successes together as billionaires and large corporations have attacked unions destroyed pensions deregulated the banks and slashed wages we have succeeded in raising the minimum wage to 15 in states and cities across the country and forced large corporations like amazon and disney to do the same and we have supported teachers who successfully stood up for their kids in strike after strike after strike together as the forces of militarism have kept us engaged in unending wars we have stood arm in arm to fight back for the first time in 45 years we have utilized the war powers act to move us forward in ending the horrific saudi led war in yemen together as so many of our young people have received criminal records for nonviolent offenses we have fought to end the war on drugs and have seen state after state decriminalize marijuana and have seen communities expunge the criminal records of those arrested on these charges let s be honest while we have won some victories our struggles have not always been successful but i am here to tell you that because of all the work we have done we are now on the brink of winning not just an election but transforming our country and let me tell you what that means when we are in the white house we will enact a federal jobs guarantee to ensure that everyone is guaranteed a stable job there is more than enough work to be done in this country let s do it when we are in the white house we will attack the problem of urban gentrification and build the affordable housing our nation desperately needs when we are in he white house we will end the decline of rural america reopen those rural hospitals that have been closed and make sure that our young people have decent jobs so they do not have to leave the towns they grew up in and love when we are in he white house we will move aggressively to end the epidemic of gun violence in this country and pass the common sense gun safety legislation that the overwhelming majority of americans want people who should not have guns will not have guns when we are in the white house we are going to address not only the disparities of wealth and income that exist overall in our nation but we will address the racial disparities of wealth and income we are going to root out institutional racism wherever it exists not only will we end voter suppression we are going to make it easier for people to vote not harder when we are in the white house we are going to protect a woman s right to control her own body that is her decision not the government s make no mistake about it this struggle is not just about defeating donald trump this struggle is about taking on the incredibly powerful institutions that control the economic and political life of this country and i m talking about wall street the insurance companies the drug companies the military industrial complex the prison industrial complex the fossil fuel industry and a corrupt campaign finance system that enables billionaires to buy elections brothers and sisters we have an enormous amount of work in front of us and this what i believe if we stand together if we don t allow trump and his friends to divide us up there is nothing we cannot accomplish this country has an

the u s chamber of commerce a corporate member of the world government promoting council on foreign relations cfr has launched a massive new lobbying effort called the usmca coalition to garner congressional and public support for the united states mexico canada agreement integration scheme over the coming weeks and months the usmca coalition will make the case for expeditious passage of the agreement to members of congress and it will work to educate the american public about the benefits of the new deal the chamber of commerce stated in its february 26 press release announcing the launch of the new coalition the effort will harness the advocacy strength of a broad membership of companies trade associations and chambers of commerce including many that operate outside of washington d c the usmca coalition is composed over 200 companies and associations representing farmers and ranchers manufacturers service providers and technology companies led by the chamber of commerce however on the usmca coalition s website only 84 company members were listed of those 84 company members listed the following 14 are also corporate members of the cfr amgen inc at t chubb limited citigroup citi general electric google ibm corporation johnson johnson jpmorgan chase co mastercard metlife microsoft pfizer inc toyota motor company the press release also quoted devry boughner vorwerk the corporate vice president of cargill incorporated and co chair of the usmca coalition saying the united states mexico and canada have been transformed by nearly 25 years of open agricultural trade creating a level of economic integration that has made north america one of the world s most competitive and successful trading blocs emphasis added and that is exactly what the usmca is all about trading blocs vorwerk s comments underscore the usmca s importance to the cfr and other promoters of global government who seek economic integration of north america into a trading bloc similar to the european union rather than 195 countries as they presently exist each having its own government and economy the goal is for there to be only a handful of regional and in some cases overlapping supranational union states these can best be observed today in forms of such regional trading blocs as the eu african economic community mercosur eurasian economic union asean china free trade area comprehensive agreement on trans pacific partnership cptpp and nafta north america and world order in fact nafta s true place in this proposed world arrangement was admitted by former secretary of state henry kissinger a leading globalist and member of the cfr s board of directors in an op ed piece published in both the los angeles times and the washington post on july 20 1993 about the then proposed nafta kissinger wrote the revolution sweeping the western hemisphere can point the way to an international order based on cooperation it is this revolution that is at stake in the ratification of nafta what congress will soon have before it is not a conventional trade agreement but the hopeful architecture of a new international system defining what he meant by new international system kissinger further wrote a regional western hemisphere organization dedicated to democracy and free trade would be a first step toward the new world order that is so frequently cited but so rarely implemented emphasis added this new world order as advocated by kissinger and many in the cfr is one in which national sovereignty and nation states would be replaced with a new international system made up of competing yet interconnected trading blocs or regional unions like plasma it is a transitory state toward the solidification of one world government by default it is the end of nationhood patriotism and americanism organizations dedicated to the preservation of american sovereignty such as the john birch society the parent organization of the new american are not opposed to trade and commerce in their classical liberal sense nor do they advocate a policy of isolationism america has never been an isolationist country even during eras of high tariffs in america s past such as during the 1830s when u s tariffs on imported goods reached their highest at 62 percent on dutiable imports between the 1860s and 1900s when the average tariff was about 45 percent and between 1920 and 1932 when tariffs reached as high as 59 percent in 1932 america still traded with other countries this is not to suggest that the average tariffs on imported goods should be subject to over 45 percent instead congress should embrace a smart tariff one that is flexible and adjusts to satisfy the demands of both domestic consumers and manufactures while also not impairing our domestic access to extracting strategic raw minerals and metals that would be vital during a time of war tariffs are also far less intrusive than a progressive individual income tax a world without tariffs the perpetual drive toward zero tariffs commenced with the trade agreements act of 1934 and was followed by america s subsequent entry into both the general agreements on tariffs and trade gatt by executive decree in 1947 and then to the world trade organization in 1995 this drive has placed a greater reliance on domestic income taxes or debt either to the federal reserve which loans the money that it creates to the u s government on interest or to foreign countries such as communist china to whom the united states currently owes 1 12 trillion in order to finance the federal government and its ever growing laundry list of unconstitutional big spending projects and programs zero tariffs as desired by the advocates of world trade and world government would harm small businesses unable to compete with large multinational corporations that largely benefit from wto approved free trade agreements and that are also cfr corporate members such as exxonmobil chevron goldman sachs pepsico boeing walmart and johnson johnson just to name a few no tariffs would also compromise u s national security with cheap foreign made steel aluminum and other vital metals the modern international relations theory of free trade breeding world peace is predicated on the notion of interdependence the very cornerstone for the establishment of a one world economy and government or new world order this is why the usmca is so crucial to both the chamber of commerce and the council on foreign relations not only does the usmca reafirm the importance of the economic integration of north america as then mexican president enrique peña nieto touted at the usmca signing ceremony in buenos aires argentina it s also a stepping stone and pillar for their emerging new world order cfr for usmca richard n haass the president of the cfr and author of the book a world in disarray which unabashedly promotes the new world order or world order 2 0 as he dubbed it tweeted his enthusiasm for the usmca following the initial release of the text the usmca looks to be the trade pact formerly known as nafta plus 10 20 haass said on twitter the next day haass followed up with another glowing endorsement usmca is nafta plus tpp plus a few tweaks whatever if realdonaldtrump and the congress are now prepared to embrace a pro trade agenda it is all to the good haass tweeted ideally us participation in tpp by another name would be next failing that a us japan fta would be second best the chamber of commerce s press release also quoted candi wolff the executive vice president for global government affairs at citi and also a co chair for the usmca coalition usmca has key improvements for the services sector including a modernized financial services chapter that for the first time prohibits data localization requirements in the region wolff said further stating it s critical that new trade agreements account for the fact that 75 of jobs in the private sector in the u s are now in services and usmca does that citi is the largest bank in the united states and is one of the big four banks which also include jp morgan chase bank of america and wells fargo all four of which are corporate members of the cfr building a north american community in may 2005 the cfr in conjunction with the canadian council of chief executives and the consejo mexicano de asuntos internacionales mexican council on international affairs published a report entitled building a north american community the controversial 175 page report was produced by a self styled independent task force chaired by the late robert pastor regarded as the father of the north american union and a former professor of international relations at american university pastor wrote extensively about the need to integrate north america even more than what nafta could offer of this proposed north american community page 3 of the report stated its boundaries will be defined by a common external tariff and an outer security perimeter within which the movement of people products and capital will be legal orderly and safe its goal will be to guarantee a free secure just and prosperous north america in other words replace nafta with a kind of eu lite its other recommendations included the harmonization of visa requirements the development of a north american border pass with biometric identifiers which is observable today in the form of the western hemisphere travel initiative compliant passport card and enhanced driver licenses for land and sea travel within north america not yet approved for air travel sharing data about the entry and exit of foreign nationals harmonizing entry screening and tracking procedures for people goods and vessels law enforcement cooperation across all three countries enhancing the current north american development bank and the establishment of a north american investment fund to encourage private capital flow into mexico before passing away pastor credited the john birch society for having killed his globalist ambitions for an eu style north america prior to pastor s death the john birch society had led successful campaigns exposing and stopping both president bill clinton s proposed free trade area of the americas ftaa which would have extended nafta beyond north america to the entire western hemisphere except cuba and president george w bush s proposed security and prosperity partnership of north america spp which would have included many of the recommendations proposed in the cfr s task force report the same globalists who pushed for the ftaa and spp are the same ones now backing the usmca and they do not want a repeat of those results this is why the chamber of commerce has created the usmca coalition its main objective is to serve as a propaganda drive for the usmca the usmca coalition is their biggest lobbying effort meanwhile congress is currently waiting on a report from the u s international trade commission itc about the usmca s expected impact on the economy before formally introducing a usmca implementation act the itc s report was originally expected to be completed in march however the deadline was extended due to the temporary partial government shutdown the itc report is now slated to come in around april 20 2019 the chamber of commerce s usmca coalition and other efforts by the cfr to promote this new north american integration scheme underscore the urgency for patriotic americans who love their country and are zealous for its national sovereignty and independence to urge congress to both withdraw from nafta and to stop the usmca in fact the john birch society has launched an action project called get us out of nafta stop the usmca which as its title suggests is intended to accomplish just that and in turn eliminating the blueprint and framework for a north american community as proposed by the cfr concerned citizens should consider joining the john birch society and taking part in its action project to help save american liberty and independence graphic evgeny gromov istock getty images plus

presentations section of our ir website which support our comments today i would like to turn the call over to mr claude leblanc claude leblanc chief executive officer thank you lisa and welcome to everyone joining today s call for the year ended december 31 2018 ambac reported net income of 267 million and net income to common shareholders of 186 million or 3 99 per diluted share adjusted earnings were 301 million or 6 47 per diluted share these results were driven by a very successful 2018 during which we meaningfully progressed our strategic priorities we started the year with the exit from rehabilitation of aacs segregated account through a holistic transformational restructuring transaction this transaction created a book value increase of approximately 7 per share or a 25 increase to our fourth quarter 2017 book value per share as a result of the execution of this transaction we streamlined our capital structure reduced our regulatory oversight lowered our operating expenses and unified our governance structure another major accomplishment in 2018 that further streamlined our capital structure was the execution of an exchange offer for the aac preferred shares or amps which closed in august of 2018 this exchange transaction resulted in a discount capture of approximately 250 million or 45 on 557 million of amps exchanged it also further delivered our capital structure reduce certain financial and other risks and further improve the quality of the book value and adjusted book value of ambac financial group we also took additional steps to further streamline our capital and liability structure including the full redemption of an rmbs secured debt obligation and pay down of a portion of the ambac senior note moving on now to our key business priority the active derisking of our insured portfolio 2018 was our risk management group s first full year operating under an enhanced risk management approach and operating structure their risk group s mandate is the active pursuit of various targeted derisking activities focused on remediation and loss mitigation of our adversely classified and watch list credits this expanded approach and protocol was developed to reduce the volatility of aacs insured portfolio and thereby directly improve the overall quality of our book value the success of this enhanced approach and our active derisking activities are evident in our overall results during 2018 the insured portfolio was reduced by 25 from 62 7 billion net par outstanding to 46 9 billion adversely classified credits were reduced by 23 or 3 2 billion to 10 9 billion and watch list credits were reduced by 19 or 2 1 billion to 9 billion i ve highlighted some of the more significant derisking transactions over the year i would like to emphasize two material transactions that closed during the fourth quarter which were one a 100 quota share reinsurance transaction on certain public finance exposures totaling 1 5 billion of performing par exposure with principle and interest of 3 4 billion mostly comprised of capital appreciation bonds and including 232 million of adversely classified and watch list credits and two the refinancing as a result of our derisking efforts of a key watch list public finance sector exposure that was also one of our largest single risk exposures reducing outstanding par by approximately 850 million in addition to the significant transactions executed in 2018 exactly one year after aacs segregated account exit from rehabilitation another key ambac objective was achieved when the cofina plan of adjustment went effective on february 12 2019 ambac was actively involved in crafting the terms of the consensual agreement which became the basis of the cofina plan of adjustment it connection with the plan of adjustment 75 of ambac s insured cofina bondholders that elected to commute ambac s insurance policies in exchange for cash and new cofina bonds we believe that cofina plan of adjustment along with the associated commutations and collateralized trust structure is a tremendous achievement for ambac in managing its overall portfolio risk exposure through the execution of the cofina plan of adjustment ambac fully addressed and significantly reduced its largest single risk exposures which represented approximately 78 of ambac s total puerto rico exposure after months of intense negotiations ambac and other senior cofina creditors received a 93 notional recovery important protections clarifying that the share of the sales in used tax earmark for cofina are not available resources for the commonwealth and dismissals of challenges to the cofina structure as a result ambac s insured cofina exposure and our overall insured puerto rico debt service exposure decreased by 5 5 billion the 25 holders who elected not to commute their policies received units issued by trust this trust holds a ratable distribution of cash and new cofina bonds which will significantly offset ambac s remaining cofina insurance liability david will elaborate on the financial impact of this transaction in a few minutes as a result of the successful cofina transaction the government of puerto rico will receive per an aafaf press release access to 425 million annually for the next 40 years ambac believes that socially responsive and fiscally responsible government spending of this new source of unencumbered funds as well as cooperation between the oversight board and the local government are all necessary conditions to the long term financial success of puerto rico to that end ambac was recently surprised and disappointed that almost immediately after the first circuit court of appeals issue of its ruling on the appointment of the oversight board members governor rosselló as the commonwealth cfo raúl maldonado and aafaf executive director christian sobrino to start authorizing budget reapportionments without oversight board approval in direct contravention to promesa for this reason ambac believes president trump and the u s senate need to act quickly to nominate and confirm members of the oversight board in accordance with applicable law swift federal government action will be critical to ensuring proper oversight of the commonwealth s fiscal framework furthermore ambac is fully supportive of resident commissioner gonzález efforts to advance the concept of a federal recovery for puerto rico which we believe will help ensure a long term high level of transparency accountability and efficacy with regards to local government spending of federal disaster aid among other things in light of the progress made to date ambac also hopes the momentum from the cofina debt restructuring will help accelerate consensual favorable outcomes for ambac s remaining insured puerto rico exposures the cofina debt restructuring demonstrates that negotiated solutions can be found and disagreements between desperate stakeholders can be resolved turning now to our loss recovery efforts tied to our active litigation management our rmbs litigations continue to progress through 2018 and in the primary countrywide case we begin 2019 with a positive development the trial court issued decisions on all of the pretrial motions that were briefed and argued last year and ruled in ambac s favor on each one while we are pleased with the decision we were not able to proceed to trial as previously scheduled for february 25 given that bank of america countrywide filed an appeal on all of these decisions and a trial has been put out pending resolution of these appeals our legal team remains focused on progressing this case to trial as soon as possible moving on to our ongoing review of the effectiveness and efficiency of our operating platform during the year we took further steps to streamline our operating platform including additional headcount reductions of approximately 9 which when combined with the 19 headcount reduction we made in the second half of 2017 results in a material reduction in baseline compensation costs we also benefited from lower regulatory cost following the segregated account exit from rehabilitation and other decreases in expenses we will continue to evaluate areas of realignment within the company in 2019 as we progress our runoff and consider new business strategies finally we ramped up our efforts in evaluating potential opportunities in certain business sectors that meet criteria that we believe will generate long term shareholder value with attractive risk adjusted returns our activities have intensified in the past few months and we have made significant progress in identifying some target opportunities as noted on prior calls we have been evaluating opportunities in insurance credit asset management and other financial service businesses for select business transactions that are complementary to ambac and where we can leverage our core competencies as we have stated previously we are following a disciplined approach evaluating various types of strategic transactions of different magnitudes as we pursue potential opportunities to deploy our capital with the goal of creating sustainable long term shareholder value now i would like to turn the call over to david trick to discuss our financial results in greater detail david david trick chief financial officer thank you claude and good morning everyone during the fourth quarter of 2018 ambac incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders of 20 5 million 0 45 per diluted share compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of 104 million with 2 27 per diluted share in the third quarter third quarter results included an 82 million charge related to the amps transaction fourth quarter adjusted earnings were 11 million or 0 24 per diluted share compared to an adjusted loss of 76 million or 1 66 per diluted share in the third quarter relative to the third quarter our fourth quarter results reflect favorable loss development lower operating expenses in the higher net premiums earned offset by macro hedge mark to market losses and lower investment income more specifically premiums earned to a 29 million during the fourth quarter versus 26 million during the third quarter normal earned premiums decreased by about 2 million to 17 million or 13 due to the continued runoff of the portfolio and the reinsurance of 1 5 billion of net par exposure accelerated premium increased by 5 million or 82 to 12 million this increase was due to derisking activity in the public finance sector the performance of the investment portfolio in the fourth quarter reflected the volatility we observed in the capital markets in which we expect from time to time for a portfolio managed with a long term outlook volatility in the equity and credit markets impacted our trading portfolio closing a 19 million swing in investment income this negative variance was almost entirely allocable to ambac u k s portfolio in total investment income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 37 million a 21 million reduction from 58 million for the third quarter other than trading book volatility a reduction in the size of the portfolio and the end in the allocation to higher yielding ambac insured rmbs resulted in a modest reduction in investment income however the volatility also provided us some opportunity to relocate some cash and short term investments to higher spread assets including additional aac insured prifa bonds this reallocation effort will continue in the future as we have the opportunity to selectively monetize our investment in 946 million in face value of newly issued cofina bonds at december 31 2018 we owned 58 of our insured cofina bonds and 37 of our insured prifa bonds net realized gain for the fourth quarter totaled 29 million as compared to 30 million in the third quarter the principal source of the fourth quarter gains was a 27 million recovery from a financial crisis in our class action rmbs litigation related to securities we ve previously held in our investment portfolio with regards to loss and loss expense reserves we produced a benefit of 42 million for the fourth quarter compared to an expense of 34 million for the third quarter the fourth quarter benefit was mostly driven by positive development in the rmbs portfolio resulting from the impact of lower interest rates on excess spread and continued credit improvements we also produce an incurred benefit in the public finance portfolio driven by the cofina restructuring while the plan of adjustment closed on february 12 2019 the cofina transaction which claude described produced a 42 million incurred loss and loss expense benefit during the fourth quarter this benefit was mostly offset by strengthening of reserves on other transactions and the impact of a lower discount rate used for reserving resulting in a net 5 million incurred benefit for the quarter including the benefit recognized in the third quarter as part of our probability weighted reserving method the cofina restructuring produced a total incurred loss and loss expense benefit of 120 million over the last two quarters in terms of the remainder of the insured portfolio we produced a benefit in student loans driven by lower interest rates in marginally improved credit and incurred additional losses at ambac u k and elsewhere of approximately 16 million mostly due to foreign exchange movements and a lower discount rate net losses on derivative contracts were 45 million including a 4 million counter party credit adjustment for the fourth quarter compared to net gains on derivative contracts of 18 million for the third quarter resulting from forward significant forward interest rate declines during the fourth quarter compared to rising interest rates during the third quarter fourth quarter operating expenses were 21 million a decrease of 7 million or 25 from the third quarter the decrease was due to lower compensation costs driven by headcount reductions lower performance based compensation and lower severance charges non compensation expenses declined 4 5 million mostly due to the absence of 5 9 million of professional fees related to the third quarter amps exchange transaction partially offset by various additional professional fees and some cost related to the consolidation and upcoming move of our new york headquarters we should note that as a result of this move we will begin to experience higher rent expense in the second and third quarters of 2019 despite materially lower economic or actual rent payments this is partially a function of a short term overlap of the new and existing leases but primarily as a result of a fact that since 2016 our new york rent expense has been mostly offset by reductions to a junior surplus note issued to our landlord in connection with our bankruptcy settlement we remain focused on reducing all of our core operating expenses but similar to the third and fourth quarters of 2018 which reflected costs associated with various strategic initiatives we expect to experience volatility quarter to quarter associated with normal cost operations and various other initiatives interest expense for the fourth quarter was unchanged from the third quarter of 2018 at 66 million higher interest expense from the issuance of surplus notes related to the amps exchange transaction in the third quarter was offset by lower interest expense due to principal pay downs of the ambac note since issuance 214 million or approximately 10 of the principle of the ambac note has been paid down interest on debt backed by representation and warranty litigation accounted for 42 5 million or 64 of fourth quarter interest expense turning to the balance sheet shareholders equity declined 3 65 to 35 12 per share at december 31 2018 due mostly to unrealized investment portfolio losses of 129 million related to credit spread widening on the available for sale investment portfolio adjusted book value declined 0 92 per share to 27 58 per share at december 31 2018 due to the impact of the previously announced reinsurance of 1 5 billion of exposure and the depreciation of the british pound partially offset by adjusted earnings for the 3 months ended december 31 2018 on a stand alone basis as of the end of 2018 afg held cash investments and receivables of approximately 455 million or 10 03 per share that concludes my formal remarks i will now turn the call back to claude for some brief closing remarks claude leblanc chief executive officer thank you david we are pleased with our achievements this year and the momentum we have developed going into the 2019 i would like to thank my colleagues and our board of directors for their dedication and hard work throughout the year and helping us meet and in many cases exceed our goals i would also like to thank our shareholders for your continued support we appreciate your feedback during the year and we look forward to continuing to progress our strategic priorities to further create material long term value for our shareholders this concludes our prepared remarks operator please open the call for questions thank you questions and answers operator first question comes from the line of andrew gadlin with odeon please proceed with your questions andrew gadlin odeon capital group llc analyst good morning claude you walked through some cost reduction initiatives that i believe are starting again this year could you talk about how that affects the run rate on sg a going forward as well as what the impact from the move to the new office space will be claude leblanc chief executive officer i ll may be i ll pass that over to david david trick chief financial officer sure thanks claude so andrew just touching on the real estate for a moment from a as i mentioned in the prepared remarks from an economic standpoint what we re doing is basically collapsing four floors here at current headquarters into one at our new location and we re cutting our square footage that represents our footprints by more than half and as a result of that we re going to reduce our annual spend as we look at it from a sort of cash out the door standpoint but just more than half so we re spending over about 6 million a year currently in rent for our current office space we ll be spending just over 3 million when we move to the new location so in terms of this general expenses we continue to look at every opportunity to manage expenses as claude had mentioned we ve made some significant headcount reductions in the last two years that s had an impact on our baseline compensation costs and in addition to that from a non compensation standpoint and in addition to the real estate move we continually look at different opportunities internally ranging from changes to certain systems and operating platforms which one of which is going to be occurring the first quarter that will save us about 1 million a year in run rate so we re taking a hard look at every expense and continue to do so so we hope and expect that trend in expenses to continue to move downward and that being said and again as i note every quarter in my comments there are things that happen quarter to quarter whether related to strategic initiatives or just the nature of how the business operates that will cause and does cause quarter to quarter movements up and down in our expenses including just frankly just timing of how certain expenses are recorded so we re trending toward something as more in line with and hopefully below what the fourth quarter looked like this year on a run rate basis andrew gadlin odeon capital group llc analyst so i can just sort of use that as sort of a trend through 2019 david trick chief financial officer yes that s a reasonable basis yes andrew gadlin odeon capital group llc analyst got it ok and then just strategically as you think about puerto rico and the delay or the potential delay to the process because of turnover in the oversight board how do you think about that in terms of managing liquidity and thinking about the processes you re running for let s say hta and prifa which were your next two largest exposures claude leblanc chief executive officer so i think at this stage we re obviously evaluating the situation and the decision by the first circuit on the appointments clause we heard yesterday that there was an appeal made to the supreme court which could result in a further stay beyond the 90 day period yet to be determined i think from our perspective i think this is a good opportunity to revisit in a fresh way the directors on the board and we hope that the president and the senate act quickly to appoint someone in near term as i mentioned and in the meantime we do believe and have seen with empirical evidence that the commonwealth continues to improve economically quarter after quarter so we do believe that in the passage of time that there is a momentum that s building in puerto rico with economic reform that s taking place in recovery in addition to increasing fund balances i think that they have over 12 billion of funds in banks accounts in puerto rico that certainly support a meaningful repayment of creditors if not a full repayment of creditors to the commonwealth so i think time is probably not a good thing if it extends into years but i think a repositioning and refocusing and the proper appointment of a new oversight board we think will be likely something that will be favorable to the outcome of promesa andrew gadlin odeon capital group llc analyst thank you very much operator thank you the next question comes from the line of charles post with sterling grace please proceed with your questions charles post sterling grace municipal securities analyst good morning guys my question is on the cofina transaction we saw a benefit in reserves in the third quarter and fourth quarter transaction closed in the first quarter of 19 will there be any more benefit in the first quarter or are we done there david trick chief financial officer from the insurance side charles of the balance sheet no there ll be no additional benefits in the first quarter on a net basis due to how we reserve our transactions on a probability weighted basis we recognize the benefit from the liability side of the balance sheet during the third and fourth quarters which totaled about 120 million and in the first quarter we ll see a little other movements around in the income statement but on a net basis we won t see any material change on a adjusted earnings basis in the first quarter what we will see is the result of the fact that we owned 58 of the cofina bonds in our balance sheet so there will be some impact to be determined on the basis that those bonds converted on february 12 and there ll be some realized gains or losses in the first quarter depending on where the pricing of those bonds fall out claude leblanc chief executive officer there could be some additional changes to reserving in the event that we were to engage in further transactions with the trust certificate holders in the trust but that those will be separate transactions post the plan exit charles post sterling grace municipal securities analyst ok right david why d you mentioned that because i was going to follow up about the holdings of the cofina bonds that you guys have i m assume that we re gonna see a benefit given looking back to when you guys were buying those bonds versus we own cofina ourselves so there were upside i believe you guys are up nice too so i hope to see a nice benefit in the first quarter from that hopefully david trick chief financial officer yes what we ve been getting about that charles post sterling grace municipal securities analyst get the book value going the right way david trick chief financial officer right we ve been what we ve been saying about that is we just are not we re being cautious about not giving any guidances to what we anticipate there the bounds obviously settled on february 12 and we did have a big position which of course has been accreting up and subject to fair value our estimates of fair value and ultimately what we do in terms of selectively selling the bonds will generally determine our the ultimate outcome in terms of any results there in the first quarter charles post sterling grace municipal securities analyst ok is there any the case says the city settlement could pay out in the first quarter is there any update on the timing on that david trick chief financial officer we don t have any official update i think the guidance we had gotten and we published in our last q and k was that we anticipated that a filing would be made by the distribution agent in the first quarter and payout would be made in the first quarter which is what the distribution agent reported we have yet to see any filing with the court and given that it s now march 1 i would anticipate that there may be some delay and it would be hopefully more of a second quarter event but we don t have any official guidance on that as of now charles post sterling grace municipal securities analyst ok and my last question is on domestic public finance reserves we had some really good stuff this quarter in terms of burn off and getting rid of some bad credits and they re down a little bit but it s not down that much and on a percentage basis compared to your peers your reserves are way above those guys so it seems like that line item is sort of sticky i m just trying to get a better sense for it it s a material number in terms of your reserve level compared to everybody elses so that d be a huge benefit to book value too so if you could give me any more color there i d appreciate it david trick chief financial officer yes i think there s a couple of things going on one is we certainly reevaluate reserves every quarter and we do so on a very detailed and thoughtful way and as i think we have commented on before we have well we certainly have released some reserves as we just noted on cofina transaction but we have been we have strengthened reserves in other areas including other areas of puerto rico and we ve also in more recent quarters and in the fourth quarter in particular we ve seen a significant decline in discount rates in terms of how we account for our reserves so there was approximately a 30 i believe 8 million increase in reserves on the public finance book this past quarter just because of the lower discount rate and as you know many of our public finance reserves and exposures are much longer dated so lower discount rates have a disproportional impact on public finance reserves then they do in other parts of the book charles post sterling grace municipal securities analyst ok thanks guys operator the next question comes from the line of john mchugh with raymond james please proceed with your questions john mchugh raymond james analyst yes there s been a delay with the law suit between bank of america and ambac and is there any way you guys can say or bring down the deadline on that is there when is the next law the next court date claude leblanc chief executive officer thanks john so yes there i think coming into the year we were obviously very pleased with the decisions that came down by the supreme court which all ruled in favor of ambac but understandably and expectedly that be of a filed appeals on all of those decisions which we expected they would and the new judge just assure would elect it to defer the trial date pending resolution of these appeals what i would say is i think we are very pleased with just assure what s approached to the process i think as a new judge to our case this case i think he understands that we ve been at this litigation for 8 5 years and i think his messaging during the scheduling hearings was that he wanted to ensure that there was prompt filings of the appeals perfected appeals suggesting that he wants this to be moved along and not delayed any further in order to get to a trial so again i think we re generally very pleased with the process but we believe it s something that will likely as a result of the appeal process mean that the earliest that we envision although it s reasonable to expect that we could be in front of a a trial would be some time later in the year john mchugh raymond james analyst well are you guys negotiating outside the court i mean because from what i understand 1 of all lawsuits go to trial and you guys are you in negotiations to settle outside claude leblanc chief executive officer we don t comment on the nature and existence of settlement discussions as you can appreciate but we obviously we re a commercial enterprise as well as bank of america and we exercise prudent judgment on evaluations of outcomes on an ongoing basis so they would just leave it at that we do understand there s a heavy debt burden also associated with the litigation recoveries but at the same time there s also a saturated default interest rate of 9 that accretes on our claims that we don t record every quarter in our financial statements that increases our recoveries every quarter so we re mindful of the timing and we i can tell you as well are very frustrated with the delay it s taken to get to this point in time on this case but we are optimistic that we will be in front of a judge or a jury later this year operator thank you at this time there this will conclude today s teleconference duration 38 minutes call participants lisa kampf head of investor relations claude

file photo traders work on the floor of the new york stock exchange nyse in new york u s february 25 2019 reuters brendan mcdermid by lewis krauskopf new york reuters u s stock prices are outpacing those in most other regions to start 2019 but the gap is narrow and some investors are eyeing potential catalysts to tip the scales to the rest of the world investors say several factors could sway performance in favor of other developed or emerging markets including slowing u s profit growth a weaker u s dollar improving economies in china and europe and resolution of global trade tensions the 11 percent gain this year for the s p 500 is helping the u s benchmark index expand its global edge since the u s equities bull run began a decade ago u s stocks are near 70 year highs relative to other global developed markets according to bank of america merrill lynch for the most part it has been a pretty consistent trend that u s outperforms non u s said nathan thooft head of asset allocation for manulife asset management in boston the reality is though it can t go on forever u s corporate earnings are expected to climb 5 3 percent this year after rising 24 4 percent in 2018 according to global markets research at ftse russell european companies excluding the uk are expected to see profits rise 9 1 percent this year while profits for emerging market companies are projected to rise 13 9 percent moreover the s p 500 is trading at 16 4 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months more expensive than the 13 4 times for europe s stoxx and 11 5 times for the msci emerging markets index according to refinitiv data moreover the s p 500 s valuation gap over those indexes is wider than it has been historically people are willing to pay a very hefty premium for the u s stock market said lance humphrey a portfolio manager with usaa asset management it s our view that the fundamentals in the u s don t necessarily justify the degree of that premium that valuation difference has been one attraction in particular for emerging markets which was the most crowded trade in a baml fund manager survey last month the strength of the u s dollar is another factor for emerging markets many of which have debt denominated in the greenback for u s investors a strong dollar also requires a costly currency translation for investments in international funds investors say the dollar has held up surprisingly well this year given the more dovish stance by the federal reserve but any weakening in the u s currency could be a boon for stocks outside the country resolution of the trade dispute between the united states and china could provide another boost as investors have become optimistic about a deal between the world s two largest economies if china and the u s can reach a good agreement that will actually propel emerging markets and have a bigger impact on emerging markets than on the u s market said chris gaffney president of world markets at tiaa bank all the emerging markets are somewhat dependent on china because that s their largest trading partner for the most part the potential for a positive trade resolution has helped fuel the 22 percent run this year for china s shanghai composite index which has outperformed both u s and other major world indices europe s stoxx has climbed 10 percent this year a weak economic outlook the euro zone economy is expected to expand 1 3 percent this year just over half the u s rate along with political uncertainty in britain and elsewhere have pressured equities lisa shalett chief investment officer at morgan stanley wealth management last week issued a report saying european equities should top u s equities noting that modest economic growth forecasts look achievable the best thing going for europe right now is no one has expectations said keith lerner chief market strategist at suntrust advisory services in atlanta what that means is a little bit of good news could go a long way one factor driving u s outperformance this year is the heavy weight of technology stocks in the country s indexes nearly one quarter of msci s u s index is tech companies compared with 15 percent in financials by contrast msci s european union index has a 19 percent weighting in financials and 6 percent in tech tech and other high growth stocks have been in favor but some investors anticipate a shift toward financials and other value stocks so europe could see a relative boost of course not everyone agrees nicholas colas co founder of datatrek research doubts that financials will lead this year which is one reason he prefers the s p 500 over indexes for other global regions indeed willie delwiche investment strategist at baird says geographic diversification away from the u s market has hurt returns so

comment malaysia has once again been given the chance to re make itself the first re making of its policy framework was the 1970 new economic policy nep and the ketuanan melayu policies in the socio political spheres the best outcome from nep was the quick emergence of a large malay middle class that is informed about the world and competent in the modern professions middle class malays have however become increasingly cognizant that nep and ketuanan melayu policies are not capable of bringing malaysia into the rank of the us uk and japan the economic stagnation and the continual ratcheting up of social division caused 15 20 percent of malays to switch their vote to pakatan harapan on may 9 2018 for a second re making of the country this article focuses on four economic areas where urgent reforms are needed administrative structure government linked corporations glcs financial sector education system while each problem has a specific reform package the decentralisation of decision making is the common component in them administrative structure the imbalance between the federal government and state governments is exemplified in transportation management every aspect of the bus system is controlled from putrajaya for example the number of buses that could operate in the state and the route for each bus line this attitude of putrajaya knows best is reflected in a the federal government having sole legal authority to impose income and sales taxes with the state governments getting their independent revenue mainly from land related transactions and b the provision of public services like health education and public safety being mostly done through branches of federal ministries operating in the states given the proclivity of the federal ministries to hog development projects in their areas the federal government is not only biased toward minimal budgetary allocation to the states but also bans borrowing by the states the states never had the revenue to build critical infrastructure to support local industries for example the penang government in 2008 had a smaller budget than universiti sains malaysia did this over centralisation of decision making power caused highly unequal regional development the klang valley where the federal government sits is the recipient of the bulk of infrastructure projects which makes it continually draw human talent and capital from poorer states like kelantan and pahang malaysia needs to learn from china that sustained overall growth requires that state governments be empowered to formulate and implement their own development strategies economic growth will be enhanced because a local governments understand the growth barriers in their local economies better than putrajaya and b the state governments will learn the best practices from each other s experiments and from foreign experiences instead of having to blindly obey orders from putrajaya effective administrative and budgetary decentralisation will require that a the states have their own state civil service b the states receive greatly increased shares of tax revenue according to a transparent formula that prioritises the developmental stage of the state and its contribution to tax revenue and c significant responsibilities of the federal ministries be transferred to state agencies furthermore the states must be allowed to borrow to finance local infrastructure investment subject to no bailouts by the federal government dire need for glc reform glcs can perform well in theory but not in practice because governments inevitably find it convenient to use them for political patronage and personal corruption the large scale rock concert in which top managers of the largest glcs sang hebatkan malaysia the election slogan of bn just before ge14 reveals clearly the nature of the incentives which glc managers operate under glcs are harmful to overall growth because no matter how inefficient they are they would be bailed out by taxes the government would levy on their private sector competitors glcs also stunt the development of the bumiputra business community pulling capable bumiputera entrepreneurs away from starting private businesses into lifetime cozy glc jobs downsizing of the glc sector is necessary for growth equity and political accountability a well prepared transparent privatisation process for the glcs is the top priority and not their speedy privatisation diversification and expansion of the banking system the 1997 asian financial crisis convinced the malaysian government that prudential oversight of banks would be improved by the forced consolidation of the banks into 10 big banks to enable easier management this bank consolidation resulted in state investment companies becoming the controlling shareholders in most of the commercial banks and hence in a state bank monopoly famous for its shoddy treatment of small customers and biased lending toward glcs with the bank consolidation in 2000 smes began experiencing great difficulties in getting working capital and investment capital because large banks all over the world prefer to make one big loan rather than a bunch of small loans as the cost of processing each loan is about the same the government responded to the financing difficulties of the smes by establishing a state owned sme bank in 2005 this sme bank has not succeeded in meeting the capital needs of the sme sector despite having the highest non performing loan ratio in the banking industry the retarded growth of the sme sector has reduced the formation of new bumiputera businesses the international experience is that small and medium banks constitute the primary funding source for smes reform will mean 1 issuing licences to private small and medium sized banks 2 reducing the government s holding of bank shares and 3 removing restrictions on the operations of foreign banks education system malaysia s education system is the fourth area in need of radical reform to generate sustained dynamic growth that is socially inclusive it is unnaturally low in quality according to oecd cross country surveys on the scores of primary and secondary school students in mathematics reading and science in the 2012 oecd sample of 65 countries malaysia s rank for mathematics reading and science was 52 59 and 53 respectively malaysia s scores were comparable to those of thailand 50 48 49 chile 51 48 47 and mexico 53 51 and 55 the government expenditure on education per capita in 2011 measured in ppp 2011 international was 1 307 for malaysia 701 for thailand 860 for chile and 832 for mexico this huge gap in spending indicates some severe problems in malaysia s education system there are the problems of a accountability and competence of teachers in the malaysian education system because of the absence of performance based pay and the guarantee of lifelong employment b the low academic standards in the school curriculum imposed by the central government on government aided schools resulting in an upward trend in the number of students receiving perfect scores in the annual national examinations and c many courses that cater to political demands resulting in inadequate time and resources to teach mathematics reading and science well for example the students in some schools are required to learn three languages receive religious instruction and study many courses on malaysian history and society that are designed to promote acceptance of the bn narrative of ketuanan melayu successful school reform must acknowledge that different parents have different objectives they want the schools to achieve for their children malaysia must therefore have diversity in the curriculum of publicly funded schools and this necessitates decentralisation in three areas first all publicly funded schools must share a common academic core that is allocated enough time and resources to be taught well and each school is allowed choice on what subjects it could offer in the rest of its curriculum for example the education ministry requires the teaching of a common core curriculum of bahasa malaysia mathematics reading literature and science and each school in consultation with the local community decides on the relative proportion of courses on subjects like malaysian history world history religion civics and geography second the oversight of schools should be transferred to the state governments which can introduce incentive pay for teachers allow a diversified range of public schools and conduct experiments on different pedagogical approaches third the funding of public education should also be decentralised every school going age child will receive an education voucher from the government annually and the parents of the child can redeem the voucher at the school with the curriculum they think is best for their child decentralisation to depoliticise the school curriculum increase accountability and meet diverse parent demands is only one of the fundamental reforms to be implemented other fundamental reforms include a a pay and promotion structure that rewards good teaching and innovative management of schools b boarding schools for poor children from remote areas c meal programmes for poor students and c easing the establishment of private schools which will also provide a natural benchmark to assess the public schools in summary decentralisation of decision making in the economic sphere takes different forms in different economic activities a empowerment of the 13 states in initiating local economic development b institutionalisation of more equal competition between glcs and private firm c diversification of banks in size and ownership and d decentralisation of decision making on school curriculum oversight of school operation and funding of students in every case economic growth will be enhanced and more of it going to the poorer people and the poorer regions woo wing thye is president of the jeffrey cheah institute on southeast asia and director of the jeffrey sachs centre on sustainable development at sunway university he also holds academic

provide some updates on our business and financial performance for the three months ended december 31 2018 q2 fiscal year 19 was another record quarter for endava with revenue of â 71 8 million a strong growth of 43 6 year over year from â 50 million in the same quarter in the previous fiscal year and 8 2 growth sequentially over q1 our revenue growth rate at constant currency was 42 4 year on year this remarkable revenue growth was driven by the expansion of our existing customers particularly our larger ones as well as the acquisition of new customers we now have 60 clients who spend over â 1 million on a rolling 12 month period from 42 a year ago and of these the number spending over â 5 million more than doubled from 6 to 13 during the same rolling 12 month period we also expanded the overall number of customers seeding the business with new customers who will be the future engines for growth we ended the quarter with 271 active clients compared to 262 at the end of september 2018 and 197 at the end of the same quarter in the previous fiscal year we continue to expand in all three of our industry verticals and see acceleration in our newer verticals underpinning our belief that the next gen technology is reaching more industries and driving deeper levels of disruption and we are at the center of an ongoing technology and business revolution that shows no sign of slowing down for instance gartner projects that by 2022 two thirds of all customer experience projects will make use of it automation and by 2021 70 of organizations will integrate ai to assist employees productivity from the very beginning endava has been set up to accelerate this revolution basing our strategy led user centric approach around the multidisciplinary teams that drive the cycle of ideation to production but doing so focused on solving core business problems not just blindly providing capabilities the combination of this approach our expertise in next gen technologies and our responsible focus on the human impact of the technology we create has allowed us to help our customers become dynamic and reliable digital experience driven organizations facilitating their journey from idea generation to the ongoing development deployment and production of new products platforms and solutions our strong and sustained revenue growth shows that endava continues to demonstrate that we re the right partner to help our customers drive that transformations this quarter i want to highlight a couple of areas where significant progress illustrates how endava wins firstly our progress in north america and secondly the payment area where we continue to see strong expansion so our business in north america is expanding nicely it grew 161 year on year in the second quarter of fiscal year 19 and accounted for 27 of our revenue in the quarter up from 15 in the same quarter last year whilst velocity partners has contributed significantly to this step up north america also demonstrated the highest organic growth of our 3 regions aligned with our investment there in tmt and other verticals in north america we re expanding the scope of work we provide clients and are renewing larger multiyear deals in various sectors such as health care media and consumer product goods in the payments and financial services verticals in the u s we re winning significant new logos and announcing the expansion pattern experienced in europe so turning more specifically to payments our payment vertical remains an area of strength and growth as our customers see us as thought leaders in this space we continue to leverage our know how to expand our client base and our footprint with existing clients revenue from payments grew by 35 all organic over the last 12 months based on our consistent software engineering excellence we continue to win innovative and strategic delivery programs helping our payments clients provide value add to their customers through a variety of products and experiences let me give some examples we provide a fast and simplified activation processes for merchants for example endava has been working with elavon a leading global payment processor on creating plug ins for e commerce platforms which helps merchants link their web store with the payment company much more quickly than custom development in the u s we re also working with western union on the transformation of their online bill payment platform modernizing and enhancing the product offering for their clients we leverage service based architectural patents and devops to streamline the onboarding process taking it from months to a matter of days additionally we re working with a large european payments company to bring new merchants on board through salesforce with a completely self served platform without the need for sales agent support we build merchant portals that significantly improve the value add of the payment platform merchants of all sizes are seeking increased business information from their payments reports and we re working with many payments companies to create attractive and easy to use business dashboards in many cases utilizing machine learning tools we ve built and implemented seven merchant portals in the last five years for large payment companies with more in the build phase in the customer experience arena we ve helped our payments clients build smart point of sale solutions and enhance their loyalty and omni channel capability driving repeat business and improving experiences and we upgrade payments methods we re working with elavon to integrate the likes of pay by bank app wechat and alipay and are expanding it to include tomorrow s technology including biometric payments methods we helped another global fx company scale their technology team and support the design implementation and infrastructure automation of many digital payment products providing b2b and b2c payments through multiple channels to their clients in a further expansion of payments related business we are doubling the teams working for global payments on their e commerce platforms particularly in the u s additionally we are in the agile development stage of two open banking psd2 solutions for market leading account information and payment initiation services now turning to other areas our partnership with bain company continues to accelerate bringing in three more active projects over the last quarter and successfully driving revenue growth for both businesses a key area of growth has been in the private equity space and we expect this to continue to be a pillar of our joint go to market strategy both to perform a joint technology due diligence to assess company s readiness for digital transformation and to deliver real value once the deal is closed last call we spoke about the large digital transformation client we had won together the strategic review is progressing well and we are beginning to look towards helping our client with the implementation phase our client growth has translated into strong employee growth we ended the quarter with 5 389 employees an 18 increase from 4 580 in the same point in the previous fiscal year we continue to focus on attracting great people to endava creating an environment where the interesting technology and business challenges the career development opportunities and investment in our people makes endava a desirable destination in the cities where we operate we continue to forge relationships with local universities as an example we developed a strategic partnership with two universities in moldova which graduate around 350 it students annually at these universities we provide educational programs designed and delivered by endava mentors and held in labs which we have fitted out to endava office standards this significantly enhances the endava brand amongst our target undergraduates and finally an update on brexit we continue to review the potential impact of brexit on endava currently we ve not identified any clients who are adjusting their spending plans with us as a result of the uncertainties caused by brexit mark will talk about how we ve mitigated fx risk in his financial section which we continue to monitor closely despite brexit and other well reported macro uncertainties we continue to look forward confidently our demand environment continues to be healthy and our pipeline is strong customers across our territories and verticals need to change and endava is well positioned to help drive their transition our ability to help our clients ideate new products and services and scale them into production deeply differentiates us and makes us an ideal partner as a result we remain optimistic about our ability to deliver sustainable growth in the future i ll now pass the call on to mark thurston our cfo who will walk you through our financial results for the quarter and update guidance for the rest of the fiscal year mark thurston thanks john here s some highlights for the recent quarter endava s revenue totaled â 71 8 million for the 3 months ended december 31 2018 compared to â 50 0 million in the same period last year a 43 6 increase over the same period in the prior year in constant currency our revenue growth rate was 42 4 our adjusted gross profit was â 30 4 million for the 3 months ended december 31 2018 compared to â 19 3 million in the same period last year a 56 9 increase over the same period in the prior year our adjusted gross profit margin was 42 3 for the quarter up from 38 7 for the same period last year the year over year improvement was mainly due to continued improvement in pricing and continued strong utilization adjusted gross profit is our reported gross profit excluding allocated cost of sales and the impact of share based compensation adjusted gross profit margin is calculated as a percentage of our total revenue our adjusted profit before tax for the 3 months ended december 31 2018 was â 13 6 million compared to â 7 5 million for the same period last year an 80 7 year over year increase our adjusted profit before tax margin was 18 9 for the 3 months ended december 31 2018 compared to 15 0 for the same period last year the year over year improvement in our adjusted profit before tax margin is mainly the improved adjusted gross margin adjusted pbt is defined as our profit before taxes adjusted to exclude the impact of share based compensation expense amortization of acquired intangible assets realized and unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses fair value movement on contingent consideration initial public offering expenses incurred and sox readiness expenses all of which are non cash other than realized foreign currency exchange gains and losses initial public offering and sox readiness expenses adjusted pbt margin is calculated as a percentage of our total revenue our adjusted diluted eps was 20 pence for the three months ended december 31 2018 calculated on 54 9 million diluted shares as compared with 12 pence for the same period last year calculated on 49 6 million diluted shares up 66 7 year over year we are growing with our largest clients revenue from our top 10 largest clients decreased to 38 of revenue for the three months ended december 31 2018 from 45 of revenue for the same period last year but the average spend per client from our 10 largest clients increased from â 2 2 million to â 2 7 million we are also growing outside of our top 10 clients the number of clients who paid us at least â 1 million on a rolling 12 month basis grew to 60 at december 31 2018 compared to 42 at december 31 2017 and to 52 at september 30 2018 these large clients operate in all three of our geographical locations north america europe and uk we continue to diversify our geographic mix in the three months ended december 31 2018 north america accounted for 27 of revenue compared to 15 in the same period last year europe accounted for 28 of revenue compared to 37 in the same period last year and the uk 45 of revenue compared to 48 in the same period last year revenue from north america grew 160 5 for the three months ended december 31 2018 over the same quarter of 2017 with velocity partners making a significant contribution comparing the same periods revenue from europe grew 6 1 and the uk 35 7 we grew in all three of our industry verticals during the quarter revenues from payment and financial services grew 22 8 for the three months ended december 31 2018 over the same quarter of 2017 and accounted for 53 of revenue compared to 62 in the same period last year revenue from tmt grew 51 3 for the three months ended december 31 2018 over the same quarter of 2017 and accounted for 27 of revenue compared to 26 in the same period last year revenue from other grew 132 7 for the three months ended december 31 2018 over the same quarter of 2017 and now accounts for 20 of revenue compared to 12 in the previous fiscal year this growth was mainly driven by clients in the consumer products goods health care and retail sectors our free cash flow was â 9 2 million for the three months ended december 31 2018 compared to â 7 4 million during the same period last year our free cash flow is our net cash provided by used in operating activities plus grants received less net purchases of noncurrent tangible and intangible assets capex for the three months ended december 30 2018 as a percentage of revenue was 2 8 compared to 2 3 in the same period last year as john mentioned we see the major impact on endava from brexit coming from fx volatility since 2015 endava has taken a conscious decision to diversify geographically away from the uk back then the uk represented 78 of fiscal year 15 revenues whereas in q2 of fiscal year 19 the u k stands at 45 of revenue at q2 fiscal 19 the proportion of revenue that were non british pound currencies were 62 while the proportion of non british pound expenses was 81 3 the natural hedge we are developing mitigates large fx movements we estimate that if the british pound weakens by 5 versus the u s dollar and the euro our adjusted profit before tax margin would be reduced by approximately 0 3 percentage points for fiscal year 19 our guidance for our q3 fiscal 19 is as follows we expect revenues will be in the range of â 71 million to â 72 million representing constant currency growth of between 20 and 21 we expect diluted adjusted eps to be in the range of 16 pence to 17 pence per share our updated guidance for full year fiscal 2019 is as follows we expect revenues will be in the range of â 284 million to â 286 million representing constant currency growth of between 29 and 30 we expect diluted adjusted eps to be in the range of 69 pence to 72 pence per share this concludes our prepared comments operator we are now ready to open the line for q a question and answer session operator your first question comes from ashwin shirvaikar of citi ashwin shirvaikar good quarter here and good guidance i guess my question is my first question is with regards to talent which i think is addressed a little bit in the prepared comments but given the given that some of your competitors have either acquired or are building out presence in a couple of your core geographies like romania could you comment on whether you re starting to see any kind of impact as it relates to talent john cotterell yes thanks ashwin so recruitment of quality staff in each of our locations is always a challenge it always requires a successful business to build a good market presence a good brand and proposition a good career proposition to attract and retain the best and we re continuing to find that now i think you re referring to one or two organizations that have moved into through acquisition i think mainly into romania the reality is that those companies have been there for a while so cognizant for instance acquired softvision we looked back and we can see that we d lost three people to softvision over the previous three years so a very very small attrition to them we haven t seen any since the cognizant move at all and i think the other one who s done something is globant and we haven t seen anything with them at all ashwin shirvaikar great no that s very candid and then very good to hear as well just the other question i had the other segment obviously very strong growth there partly driven by velocity and your comments on north america i was most curious about the comment you had that north america even without velocity had the fastest organic growth across the board so what s driving that is it partly maybe the fact that you are now public is it the presence of the acquisition of velocity was seen as a commitment to the geography is it delivery being a little bit more same or similar time zones what is the thing that you are doing any of the i mean can you give some more details on what s going on there john cotterell sure so actually you picked up on all the key points there so just to give the headlines we were up 161 on the equivalent quarter last year actually the number for organic growth in the u s was 43 7 on a constant currency basis so it was very very strong and i think the deal we did bringing velocity partners on board absolutely confirmed our commitment to the u s significantly enhanced our presence and credibility you put that alongside the new york stock exchange listing and the recognition that we see in the u s for companies who have listed and we ve seen a very strong and positive response by u s customers and of course with the significant strengthening of our latin american delivery we have much much more near shore capability and that was always a little bit of a little bit of an issue for us on the west coast as you are aware so we ve seen a lot of really good activity on the west coast emerging from that operator your next question comes from brian essex of morgan stanley your line is open brian essex great i was wondering if you could dig in a little bit to your worldpay relationship and how that s progressing given the i guess ownership changes at that customer have you been able to expand that relationship and what the outlook might be for deepening the relationship within the larger organization john cotterell sure so yes the worldpay relationship continues to be strong continues to grow in q2 we grew by 6 over sequentially over q1 which was of course itself was an excellent quarter the rest of the business the rest of endava is growing fast so it means worldpay is continuing to shrink very slowly as a proportion of the endava business while growing itself so it s now sub 10 so we were 9 7 in q2 compared to 11 2 in q2 last fiscal year and 9 8 in q1 the relationship remains very good we continue to commission new teams and move into new project areas we re having much more meaningful conversations around some opportunities in cincinnati but there s nothing signed and we started providing teams to them from latin america just giving some greater time zone coverage on a key program that they have so very positive brian essex maybe just a follow up on the pricing front it seems like and i think you commented in the in your prepared remarks that pricing was driving some margin improvement there can you maybe unpack that a little bit and help us understand where are you seeing the better pricing is this from any particular type of region customer or contract type john cotterell yes so our pricing continues to expand it s a reasonably favorable environment more so with new customers than the larger old ones where we re going through inflationary type price discussions with them but overall it s an encouraging environment and as mark commented we ve seen the benefit of that on to our gross margin it s pretty much across the board in all the geographies across all the sectors there it s pretty universal and i think very much down to the fact that we re operating in this next gen technology space where the differentiation and the opportunities for change that we can bring to our clients means that they re amenable to the pricing that we have because they can see the impact the positive impact on their business mark thurston and you get a sense for it brian when you look at our revenue per head which we measure as the revenue over the average operational head so ended the quarter at 59 000 compared to this equivalent quarter last year of 54 000 so that s almost 9 increase now part of revenue per head is utilization and rates but it gives you an indication of the progress that we re making in this environment on the rate discussions operator your next question comes from bryan bergin of cowen your line is open bryan bergin i wanted to dig in on the bain relationship here it sounds like you re continuing to show traction there can you comment on how you re seeing the client wins driving more industry diversification i think you mentioned are there other industry opportunities that you like through the bain relationship and then also how is the nature of these deals compared to your existing engagements are these potentially larger in overall scale john cotterell so yes we re seeing a lot of activity with bain and of course we announced the bain partnership to the world at the beginning of october and we re reporting q2 numbers here so it s quite a short time period over which to see change but now that we ve made our partnership public we ve seen quite a lot of activity so the main areas are in financial services cpg retail and private equity as i touched on the interesting thing on the private equity side is that obviously then applies across many many industries essentially helping customers to evaluate potential acquisitions giving some insights into how technology can be used to transform those business models and drive improved performance and clearly we hope that where our private equity customers proceed with the deal that we d be well placed to assist them in the execution of the transformation strategy so we re at that very much front end of what we re doing in that space so it s another route into those strategic conversations with clients about how technology can transform their business models going forward bryan bergin okay and mark can you comment on the sustainability of the margin strength how are you thinking about the gross margin from here as you go in through the second half mark thurston so we had a very strong adjusted gross margin so at 42 3 and we sort of trailed in coming to the quarter with anticipated strong utilization and pricing which has been driving it but people should bear in mind going forward that we moved our main pay round from june to january so we have put through the majority of our pay rises through in january which was to align with the local tax authorities in the locations that we operate in so the gross margin will be impacted in q3 we also see the utilization coming off slightly from where it has been through the most recent quarters so the margin will gross margin will come down slightly and but as we go through the rest of the year we would then seek to recover those cost increases by moving our rates up with the clients and therefore start to recover the gross margin so in summary q3 will come off somewhat from the quarter that we ve just seen operator your next question comes from maggie nolan of william blair maggie nolan wanted to talk about the good growth that you saw you said in part it was driven in particular by some of your larger existing customers can you give us a little more detail there is this a couple of customers in top 5 top 10 any particular geographies or verticals that they re sitting in john cotterell yes so the growth is pretty much across the board there s a mixture of sectors and so on that are covered by our top clients and i think one of the encouraging things for us given our roots in payments and financial services is the amount of opportunity that we re seeing to take on technology transformation stories into other sectors and some of those other sector clients cpg and so on are making it into our top 10 client base now as well as our traditional sectors and i think that s one of the very exciting things is that you see these technology waves coming through and impacting different sectors actually it is carrying us across into different parts of the economy and different segments mark thurston yes i mean i think we re seeing strength bases i mean if you look at the average spend in the top 10 that s increased and also the average spent outside the top 10 so it s good solid progress across the portfolio maggie nolan okay great and then what s your appetite for m a like right now and how does the acquisition pipeline look john cotterell so on the m a front we ve been absorbing velocity partners it was an absolutely crucial deal for us in expanding in the u s and so on as we ve touched on earlier and clearly we had a very busy year last year going through the ipo process but we re now back to looking and talking to people on the m a front our strategy remains the same focused on tuck in level deals that are going to add capability from a sectoral domain point of view geographic or technology perspective and we ve had a few conversations but there s really nothing progressed to a point where it s worth calling out at the moment operator our next question comes from bryan keane of deutsche bank your line is open bryan keane let me ask the demand question another way so if you look at the second quarter revenues and earnings it came in ahead of your guide so what caused it to be above expectations when you guided a quarter ago because it does look like second quarter organic growth accelerated so maybe something surprised you guys a bit on the demand side mark thurston no surprises basically i think we still have trailed the momentum in the business was strong we did say that we felt good about the business and we still continue to feel good about it and we re a newly established public company and we want to perform and guide as such so there was no sort of significant lurch or an improvement that wasn t foreseen john cotterell i mean i think at a very small level there was a little bit less holiday take and which converted into billing that we didn t anticipate but it wasn t material bryan keane and remind us as you go into every quarter and you give guide on the quarter what s your level of visibility to the revenue and the earnings mark thurston it s pretty strong i think as we ve outlined before we have good visibility we split our revenues down into contracted and committed so near term the visibility is very strong we tend to be at the sort of 90 to 95 and sometimes a little higher so we do have good visibility bryan keane okay and the last one i had was just on utilization mark i think you said utilization expected to drop a little bit going into the third just curious any reasons for that and then should we expect it to pick up back in the fourth or is just utilization running a little hot right now mark thurston so i think we highlighted this all in q1 q2 the utilization had picked up mainly because the business accelerated going into the financial year and our supply of our people to sort of deliver on those revenues sort of lagged slightly behind that and as a result utilization revved up slightly higher than we re comfortable with but the supply side of the business has now sort of caught up utilization is coming down to our more sort of standard norms and i don t see at the moment any particular sort of revving going forward so we re in that sort of comfortable level at the moment operator your next question comes from charles brennan of crã dit suisse your line is open charles brennan i ve just got a question on your guidance actually if i look at my model it looks like in the prior year the growth comp eases slightly in the third quarter versus the second quarter and yet when i look at your guidance it looks like you re assuming a slight downtick in organic growth can you give us the reasons behind that is that just simply some brexit uncertainty you re factoring into the guidance is it some known contracts that are ramping down that we should be aware of or is it just sort of usual endava conservatism mark thurston so as usual endava conservatism typically when we re going from q2 to q3 we do see a slight slowdown down from quarter to quarter on a run rate basis and it s not marked when you look at the year as a whole but it s particularly a pattern we do see mainly because most of the companies we provide our services to have a fiscal year that begins in january so freshly agreed budgets starts to come on stream in the quarter and this quarter is really no different to that but we re seeing positive momentum and you can see the sort of confidence that we feel by the full year guidance operator there are no further questions at this time i will now return the call to our presenters john cotterell thank you and thanks everyone for joining us on this call as you all picked up we re optimistic about our ability to continue to deliver sustainable growth and we look forward to speaking with you on next quarter s call thank you operator this concludes today s conference call you may now disconnect

much of what kroll uncovered in its findings are bolstered in the findings of the presidential investigation team which went a step further in not only breaking down how the ministry of finance conducted the controversial us 25 million mop up exercise liberia owes a lot to the united states of america since as far back as 1819 when the us congress appropriated 100 000 toward the establishment of what is now africa s oldest republic which it went on to officially recognize in 1862 15 years after its establishment as a sovereign nation in 1847 both countries continue to share close diplomatic economic and military ties the benefits on both ends have been reciprocal at the height of world war ii liberia joined the allies and monrovia the nation s capital was host to important allied logistics bases with firestone becoming the large munitions supplier for the allies on the flip side liberia has benefited immensely from us support despite strained ties between 1971 and 1980 when president william r tolbert decided to establish diplomatic relations with the soviet union and other eastern bloc nations both countries forged close ties in the 1980s when the government of samuel kanyon doe was viewed as important to the us cold war policies in africa the end result the ronald reagan led administration pumped between 500 million and 1 3 billion during the 1980s from the u s through direct and indirect channels and liberia became home to a relay station for the voice of america with the setting up of a large navigation tower and the country becoming the cia s main african base for the majority of this period without a doubt the us remains liberia s most important international partner and stakeholder billions of dollars have been thrown liberia s way through the united states aid for international development s development assistance program since the end of the civil war usaid s post conflict rebuilding strategy has been focusing on reintegration with an eye on a longer term development focus the usaid has also heavily invested in strengthening civil society s role in delivering services and advocating good governance this is why we are baffled over the latest wave of statements coming from the country liberians regard as its adopted stepfather the us embassy in monrovia has since the public release of an independent review report prepared by kroll associates inc regarding allegations of the disappearance of new liberian dollar banknotes on february 28 been bending over backwards to point out what it calls some inaccurate references attributed to the kroll report we and most liberians get it the kroll report is a scope study and not an indictment on anyone the findings do not suggest that anyone stole any of the ld 16 billion or the us 25 million intended for mop up exercise in the wake of the ever rising exchange rate what we don t get is why is the us embassy repeatedly trying to babysit liberians reaction to the report in two statements so far the us appear to be going beyond the extremities by suggesting liberians are overacting or that many are misunderstanding what s in play here the latest statement reads where there are gaps in the report s understanding of events or inconsistent data this is stated as such without rendering judgement as to why the u s embassy for its part stated in a message accompanying the release of the kroll report no information in the kroll report should be interpreted on its own as an indication of improper conduct by any specific individual or individuals without further investigation by appropriate liberian officials we encourage everyone to read the entire report and take due care in any interpretation or reference to the kroll report to ensure accuracy and fairness from where liberia has come the history and recurring impunity on corruption justifies the reaction many are having in the wake of both the kroll and the presidential task force findings the us embassy must continue to support and encourage good governance especially when liberians are exercising their rights to air their views and offer inputs under the very norms the us encourages pragmatic responses from the government of liberia and its people to liberians credit many appear to be reading dissecting analyzing and scrutinizing the findings so far with a great degree of interest which is particularly encouraging for a country and perhaps continent often criticized for not reading in releasing the report last week the us embassy itself encouraged liberians to read the report in its entirety and in its own words encourage pragmatic responses from the government of liberia and its people what is important to note here is that liberians are fed up with corruption in any shape size or form and rightly so this is a nation which stood and watched as thirteen officials of former president william r tolbert s government were executed for corruption nepotism and greed this is a nation which for the past twelve years have been consumed by reports of corruption and each and every liberian want this cancer to be rid of our nation this is why the findings in the scope study has caught everyone s attention the report while concluding that kroll s analysis of delivery documentation provided by the central bank of liberia cbl confirmed that new banknotes totaling lrd 15 506 billion were received into the cbl s reserve vaults and that kroll found no information to support allegations that a container of banknotes went missing does point out several discrepancies for example the report raises concerns regarding the overall accuracy and completeness of the cbl s internal records and identifies systemic and procedural weaknesses at the cbl and identifies shortcomings in liberia s fiscal and monetary management processes that are longstanding and continue to the present day so we and most liberians get it what we don t get is the irony from the us kroll the company it paid to conduct the scoping study reported kroll has sought to obtain information from the cbl regarding the end recipient of the new banknotes e g commercial banks liberian ministries etc however the cbl has not been able to provide this information at either a summary or detailed transactional level liberians are appreciative of america s support but the us embassy is crossing the line here as liberians exercise their rights to free speech and allow the government to speedily investigate and bring those responsible for the discrepancies cited in the us funded kroll and the liberia presidential task force reports to book the report also said the kroll was not provided with adequate supporting documentation to demonstrate that the cbl adhered to its internal tendering policies in the procurement of the external banknote manufacturer crane ab in essence kroll s own report identified discrepancies at every stage of the process for controlling the movement

banknotes to liberia the delivery of movement of funds within and out of the cbl s vaults in fact much of what kroll uncovered in its findings are bolstered in the findings of the presidential investigation team which went a step further in not only breaking down how the ministry of finance conducted the controversial us25 million mop up exercise the team observed that the principle of know your customer kyc was not observed throughout the mop up exercise thereby creating room for illicit exchange or money laundering a review of the report submitted to the investigation by the six 6 teams responsible for the disbursement exchange of the united states dollars with the liberian dollars whom that some foreign exchange bureau and businesses were not duly registered while other businesses received cash without proper identification for example report submitted by the leader of team 2 mr kontar richards shows that there was no evidence of transactions with business entities such as business registration document and address of these entities there are several summary sheets in hand writing which do not have any indication that these vendors money and or signed for it refer to exhibit 43 for kontar field report and written statement the team also reported some businesses institutions in the three categories mentioned above received lesser amounts then what was

other separate investigations were under way including alleged corruption for personal gain salary increases without white house approval use of government staff on personal projects and unnecessary spending on offices and security he resigned july 5 2018 the list of officials in america who stepped down their posts in the wake of investigations is endless this is why we applaud the decision of president george manneh weah to take action against those found to have broken the laws in the wake of the kroll report so far former governor milton weeks deputy governor charles sirleaf and dorbor hagba are all in custody awaiting arraignment mr richard walker head of banking is also among those being sought for arrest according to authorities nevertheless we want to urge the president to go a step further in taking a similar action against his influential finance minister samuel tweah over the controversial mop up exercise thirteen members of former president william r tolbert government were executive on april 23 1980 they were accused of corruption the history of liberia is intertwined with a cancer which continues to ruin the country s progress and development from where liberia has come the history and recurring impunity on corruption justifies the reaction many are having in the wake of both the kroll and the presidential task force findings the us embassy must continue to support and encourage good governance especially when liberians are exercising their rights to air their views and offer inputs under the very norms the us encourages pragmatic responses from the government of liberia and its people in the same vein the us cannot adopt a baby sitting policy on how liberians carry out these pragmatic responses democracy and good governance are the hallmark of any modern society the us of all places should know and understand this much these reports should not end here but lead to further investigations in the main time those found liable should remove themselves from the process while the investigation takes place and president weah should avoid any temptation toward selective actions resulting from these findings liberians are appreciative of america s support but the us embassy is crossing the line here as liberians exercise their rights to free speech and allow the government to speedily investigate and bring those responsible for the discrepancies cited in the us funded kroll and the liberia presidential task force reports to book

the trump administration hit its forecast of 3 percent real gdp growth last year as new data shows that the economy grew 3 1 percent from the last quarter of 2017 through the last quarter of 2018 there are other ways to measure this sort of thing but i think this way is the most accurate and its policy contributed to this outcome the deficit financed tax cuts added to growth in 2018 as did significant deficit spending but before popping the champagne corks trump aides should recognize that contrary to their claims gdp growth is already slowing for students of the failed promises of supply side trickle down economics that s not a surprise lower taxes or increased government spending that s not offset by tax increases or spending cuts elsewhere feeds automatically into higher gdp for the simple and obvious reason that both consumer and government spending count as part of gdp that result isn t guaranteed if tax cuts and spending push up interest rates either through actual overheating or by making the federal reserve nervous about potential overheating that would counteract the growth effects of spending but even as the fed began last year with a few minor rate hikes it backed off and the interest rate on the 10 year bond is lower now than it was a year ago inflation is also in check so the big story for last year s 3 percent growth rate is that deficit spending fueled growth without overheating or crowd out the theory that public borrowing takes the place of more productive private borrowing thus pushing up interest rates this result has ushered in a robust debate about whether deficits matter at all they do but it s nuanced see here but the real problem for the administration is that the growth effects of large 2018 deficits are already fading and that reveals some bad news about the impact of the tax cuts since around 2010 the gdp s trend growth rate has been about 2 percent meaning 2018 came in about a point above trend in human terms that means unemployment was about half a point lower than would have occurred absent the fiscal stimulus which in turn translates into around 800 000 jobs and while real wages haven t done anywhere near as well as the administration promised when selling the tax cuts they have recently been growing in real terms thanks in part to the high pressure labor market as well as lower energy prices but for 3 percent to become the new trend as the fiscal stimulus fades structural growth accelerators must kick in most importantly faster productivity growth this in fact is the administration s theory of the case one immortalized by economist art laffer s supply side growth story high end tax cuts would juice business investment which would lead to faster productivity growth it s a lovely story but the data never fail to reject it most forecasters got last year about right but as fiscal stimulus fades they predict slower growth ahead they re collectively saying that what happened last year was keynesian stimulus providing a temporary growth bump not a lasting upshift as in the laffer story these forecasts could be wrong but thurday s report already shows gdp slowing from its faster trend earlier in the year moreover while the business investment data has been solid it s been what we d expect at this stage of the expansion leading economist dean baker to conclude that the evidence is overwhelming that the impact of the tax cut was a conventional keynesian demand side stimulus rather than the investment led growth that was the ostensible justification for the large reduction in corporate income taxes finally whenever we re talking about gdp growth in our highly unequal economy we have to ask how much it lifted all boats not just the yachts recent analysis by david leonhardt at the new york times finds that after tax income growth for the wealthiest household has long outpaced gdp growth while the upper middle class the 90th to 99th percentiles have kept pace with gdp everyone else has lagged far behind to be clear that data takes a few years to come out but up to date information on corporate profitability vs wage outcomes suggests that these unequal patterns persist sure we can temporarily juice the economy with deficit financed tax cuts but we ve known that since keynes but such stimulus always fades and if the cuts are structured mostly to benefit the wealthy the middle class won t have much to show for them so here s something else we re learning again even though we ve long known it was true trickle down economics still doesn t work jared bernstein a former chief economist to vice president joe biden is a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities and author of the reconnection agenda reuniting growth and prosperity

a report made public on thursday reveals that more than 100 million us dollars of liberian banknotes that had reportedly gone missing are in fact accounted for however the independent report commissioned by the us embassy in monrovia provides a damning assessment of procedures within the country s central bank as well as action taken by the liberian government the 68 page report produced by business intelligence firm kroll associates inc goes into considerable detail to uncover the fate of the liberian banknotes reports about the disappearance of 138 million us dollars had sparked demonstrations in liberia last year with hundreds of protesters taking to the streets and an online campaign using the hashtag bringbackourmoney it also risked marring the start of george weah s presidency the scandal stretched from the end of former president ellen johnson sirleaf s final term in office to weah s installation in the executive mansion kroll s report entitled project fabre provides a forensic analysis of the approval for printing additional banknotes the awarding of the contract to a swedish firm called crane ab the shipping of the banknotes and the movement of the funds to and from the country s central bank vaults although the investigation dismissed the suggestion that all of the new banknotes are missing it does reveal significant mismanagement and potential corruption are likely to have had a devastating impact on liberia s economy central bank ordered banknotes without approval the banknotes were requested in two separate orders by the central bank according to kroll s report and although the first order was approved by the country s parliament the actual order had been placed by the central bank 11 days before it received the green light from the legislature parliamentary approval was not sought for the second order of 10 billion liberian dollars 89 million us dollars by the central bank and it placed the order with the swedish banknote printers four weeks before a letter from a parliamentary clerk and secretary of the senate requesting that old banknotes be replaced with new ones tendering for the banknotes was also circumvented by the central bank with kroll s report noting that it appears that a competitive procurement process did not take place extra banknotes more banknotes were printed than were ordered with an additional 4 5 million us dollars extra being delivered to liberia kroll said some fluctuation in the quantity of banknotes had been expected in the original contract but according to the report the actual overall variance in the quantity of banknotes shipped was 5 11 percent far greater than the 1 5 percent outlined in the first order there were further differences in the number of banknotes said to have been packed by the banknote printers and the shipping lists with an additional 17 3 million us dollars arriving by air or sea it is not clear from kroll s investigation whether something was amiss or the discrepancy is just down to the central bank s inadequate records there were also considerable differences in the weight of the consignments containing the new banknotes kroll reported crane ab had shipped 5 675 kilograms of banknotes however a bill for air cargo from emirates indicated a consignment of 5 826 kilograms kroll said no explanation had been made by the central bank but the accuracy of the customs documentation was in question increasing the money supply the banknotes had been requested by the central bank to be infused into the liberian economy but it was not clear if the new banknotes were intended to replace banknotes or in addition to existing legal tender according to kroll initially old banknotes gradually disappeared from circulation and we saw more new banknotes in circulation said rfi s monrovia based correspondent darlington porkpa but in recent months we noticed the reintroduction of old banknotes on the market the kroll investigation determined that all new banknotes provided by the first order had been injected into the liberian economy by december 2018 even though old banknotes in circulation were not removed from the money supply it was the same for the second order of new banknotes with some 90 percent being injected into the economy and a significant portion of the old banknotes being left in circulation it is also not clear who received the new banknotes commercial banks government ministries etc there is a risk that significant funds were and remain unaccounted for said paul nash the apparent author of the report by kroll nash an expert in fraud and corruption also investigates a further mop up procedure instigated by weah s administration in july 2018 they intended to buy up liberian currency with 25 million us dollars in an operation that would run somewhat contrary to the central bank s action of flooding the economy with new liberian dollars kroll said some 15 million us dollars of liberian currency were purchased although it said it was not told how this was structured or implemented alongside the purchase of liberian dollars 5 million us dollars was put into circulation and the remaining 5 million dollars had not been withdrawn from liberia s account at the federal reserve bank of new york according to the investigation despite being intended to help strengthen the liberian dollar some 7 8 million us dollars of liberian banknotes that had been purchased in this mop up were put back into circulation six months later according to kroll the operation involved teams from the central bank buying up banknotes from local businesses and foreign exchange bureaus which created an enhanced level of risk that funds could be unaccounted for the vaults kroll conducted a physical check of banknotes within liberia s central bank vaults the contents of the four vaults are managed by handwritten forms without checks and balances to independently verify accurate data entry movements of banknotes in and out of the vaults are susceptible to error and or intentional falsification while kroll said some 189 000 us dollars were unreconciled or not accounted for kroll concluded that the increase in banknotes in circulation could have contributed to inflation in liberia it estimated inflation at the end of january 2019 of 25 percent the increase of banknotes in circulation may be a factor in the rapid depreciation of the lrd exchange rate the report said the liberian dollar weakened considerably over the course of last year one us dollar was worth 125 liberian dollars at the start of 2018 compared to 157 liberian dollars by the end of december according to data from xe com rfi contacted eugene nagbe liberia s information minister for a reaction to kroll s report he was unavailable for comment this article uses an exchange rate of 1 us dollar 112 liberian dollars a blended three year average cited by kroll in the report rfi believes this figure provides a more accurate reflection of the cost as expressed in us dollars given the considerable weakening of the liberian dollar

points to the seriousness of the situation at that time the economic adjustment program was negotiated by one government but a large part of it ended up being implemented by the following government from our side of the table so to speak we saw a seamless transition we saw in the portuguese teams under both governments the same determination to find effective solutions that sense of national unity at a time of crisis was key for the success of the program and it is something that has stayed with us in the post program period largely under yet another government we have witnessed again a commitment to sound macroeconomic policies which has helped the economy on its recovery path portugal and the portuguese people deserve tremendous credit for their efforts i am sure that you are proud of them just as i am proud of how the imf was able to support portugal as a steadfast partner and friend portugal has made great progress and so after a decade of crisis and recovery we can say that portugal has made great strides its real gdp is now back above the level it was before the crisis and its unemployment rate is at a fifteen year low with the program era labor reform facilitating strong job creation its business climate is more attractive to investors for example in the mid 2000s it used to take almost a month to start a business now it takes less than five days its economy has rebalanced to become more export oriented including a reinvigorated tourism sector leading the external current account to move from chronic deficits of around 10 percent of gdp to balanced it has made impressive progress in cutting the fiscal deficit and reducing borrowing costs and let me add it has repaid its obligations to the imf five years ahead of schedule muito obrigada my main message for you today is that portugal will have to continue relying on its illustrious tradition because the waters of the global economy are likely to become more treacherous vasco da gama was not afraid of the darkness and as he explored the indian ocean he knew the importance of pushing ahead even when the horizon was dark i would strongly recommend that you to do the same today to steer not drift risks in the rest of the world are increasing and will likely constitute the most significant source of instability for the portuguese economy so you should build on recent success to strengthen your resilience further pursuing reforms today might be difficult but these reforms will help during a storm outlook for the global economy while global growth in 2018 remained close to post crisis highs the expansion is weakening and at a rate that is faster than expected we are not staring at a recession but downside risks have clearly risen what are the challenges rising trade tensions further escalation of trade barriers could subtract almost half a percent from global growth going forward as supply chains get disrupted and the environment for investment becomes more uncertain the rising level of global debt is a challenge at 182 trillion as of end 2017 almost 60 percent higher than in 2007 it leaves governments firms and households more vulnerable to weaker and asynchronous growth as well as higher interest rates a slowdown in china although the transition to lower more sustainable growth is welcome there is a risk that the deceleration in china could be faster than expected even if new stimulus in china is effective it is being targeted at relatively less import intensive activities so the rest of the world might still feel a deceleration closer to home growth in the euro area has also passed its peak our growth forecast for 2019 is 1 6 percent a 0 3 percentage point reduction compared to the forecast in october we will review that forecast in about one month during our spring meetings in washington within the euro area the significant revisions are for germany where difficulties in the auto sector and lower external demand will weigh on growth in 2019 and for italy where sovereign and financial risks are adding headwinds to growth a disorderly brexit could also have significant consequences all likely brexit outcomes will involve net costs for the uk economy but the higher the impediments that arise in the new relationship with europe the higher the cost an agreement that minimizes uncertainty and trade barriers will best support growth conversely leaving without a withdrawal agreement and a framework for the future relationship with the eu is the most significant near term risk to the uk economy and to varying degrees others in europe will be affected too ireland of course and others such as the netherlands with a close relationship to the uk a disorderly brexit would also hit portugal important trade and tourism links could be disrupted and a loss of financial market confidence outside your borders could lead to higher sovereign and bank interest rates which would weigh on growth the need for global cooperation maneuvering through the economic challenges ahead will require leaders to have a clear sense of direction and steady but decisive hands on the tiller the current environment still offers the opportunity to advance policies and reforms and build buffers fiscal and financial defenses for sustainable robust and inclusive growth but the moment may not last for long leaders need to take advantage of this moment navigating the new economic environment requires increasing international cooperation not less many of the challenges facing us today transcend national borders and require coordinated responses this is true both of traditional policies regulating international transactions trade and capital flow measures and the new challenges of our changing economic landscape including rising inequality addressing the impacts of climate change and the challenges and opportunities of fintech while the global frameworks that have served the world well are being questioned the answer must be to fix the system not abandon it we need to launch a new multilateralism that is more inclusive people oriented accountable and results oriented priorities for europe closer to home there is a need for european leaders to prepare their region and their domestic economies for riskier times some countries in the euro area have not made sufficient progress in cutting deficits and placing their debts on a downward path this coupled with weaker growth increases the risk that interest rates for countries and banks may spike causing a further weakening of growth and job creation these countries would do well to rebuild their fiscal defenses now rather than wait until poorer growth worsens their debt ratios or until markets force them to act other countries by contrast enjoy ample fiscal space in those countries subject to observing fiscal frameworks in place we recommend selectively boosting productive spending targeted at raising potential growth this would have positive spillovers on other european economies we also think there is a need to enhance risk sharing in both the public and private sectors within the euro area we believe this needs to be done while preserving appropriate incentives risk reduction at the national level is indeed necessary for carefully designed risk sharing frameworks to be viable and effective to improve public sector risk sharing the euro area needs a meaningfully sized central fiscal capacity there are many proposals on the table including one from the imf which seeks to address the legitimate concerns of some member states about the risk of permanent transfers and moral hazard developing consensus in this area will take time but discussions need to continue at both the technical and political levels the euro area also needs more cross border private sector risk sharing through the financial markets in other words a much deeper financial sector union this means advancing the capital markets union to facilitate more cross border investment diversification through traded financial instruments it also means completing the banking union where the biggest missing piece is common deposit insurance all those euro area reforms would strengthen the monetary union nevertheless the fundamental responsibility for improving economic resilience will remain national this brings me back to portugal priorities for portugal portugal needs to step up its efforts today so that it is prepared for the future further strengthening the underlying fiscal balance would help accelerate the pace of debt reduction and positively differentiate portugal from other high debt countries adjustment today could allow policy to be loosened later when it might be needed continue the repair of the banking system there has been much progress restoring the banks balance sheets in the last few years here our message is to keep pressing with this important work structural reforms to boost saving investment and productivity are essential to raise living standards while helping the economy deleverage reducing existing vulnerabilities key steps include making the labor market work better simplifying regulations and improving the efficiency of judicial processes these reforms can be targeted in a way that shield the poorest in society and reduce inequality in fact portugal has a strong track record of undertaking reforms whilst protecting the most vulnerable preparing for the future we are undergoing a period of rapid technological change which will reshape the way we live and work these changes cannot be ignored and it is critical that portugal is prepared this involves building regulatory institutions that protect consumers without stifling competition developing an education system that is geared for the needs of the future workforce and building sound safety nets so that those displaced by technology are not left behind portugal is well placed to benefit from this technological revolution it has long been an outward facing country and is successfully reorienting its economy towards technology and innovation here in portugal for example google has created a service center for europe the middle east and africa which i understand has been recently expanded from about 500 to 1300 employees and you have brought the web summit conference a world class event to your shores technology and innovation is marked by disruptions of the established order well here too you have a long tradition back in the late 15th century vasco da gama was what we today would call a disruptor he showed that there was an alternative route to india that avoided the ottoman controlled silk route opening up vast new trade networks a few years later another portuguese explorer pedro alvares cabral tried to further disrupt that earlier disruption and ended up in brazil portugal needs to continue in this tradition preparing for difficult times ahead whilst being nimble enough to grasp new opportunities when they arise i would like to close by quoting one of your greatest poets luis de camões and i m going to try to do it in portuguese so bear with me and pardon me in advance impossibilidades não façais que quem quis sempre pôde thank you very much and i am most happy to hear your views and comments vasco da gama the first european to reach india by sea circumnavigating the cape of good hope famously said i am not afraid of the darkness real death is preferable to a life without living don t make up impossibilities cause those who ve wanted always achieved

the post the existential politics of climate change appeared first on isep by jessica green thomas hale and jeff d colgan 21 february 2019 climate change energy and sustainability climate politics are changing beyond politics as usual climate politics are becoming existential climate forcing and climate vulnerable interests are both fighting for the survival of their way of life we offer recommendations for how the paris process and domestic coalition building can be mutually reinforcing emphasizing the role of labor climate politics are changing after years of gridlock the 2015 paris agreement puts domestic politics front and center shifting from a global deal approach to a more flexible catalytic system in which countries and other actors set their own goals and ratchet them up over time at the domestic level there is new momentum and conflict beyond politics as usual climate politics are becoming existential varying interests are fighting for the survival of their way of life this is forcing governments to confront the enormous economic implications of a changing climate and altering the nature of climate politics for example after years of denialism and obstruction the us is considering two bills on climate change one an expansive green new deal focused on massive government investments the other a narrower plan to price carbon and following the emergence of the gilets jaunes movement france is engaged in a national conversation about climate change and inequality similar debates are emerging throughout the developed world time is short the next round of national pledges under the paris agreement is due in 2020 the shift to existential politics will up end much of the conventional wisdom around climate policy fault lines will sharpen but this will provide opportunities for progress seeding and supporting winning coalitions at the domestic level is critical for the post paris regime the existential politics of climate change distributional politics is about who gets what and climate politics are no different who should pay more for energy through a modest carbon tax how much money should the developed world provide to help vulnerable nations adapt to climate change existential politics is like distributional politics on steroids the stakes are whose way of life gets to survive in a world of existential politics different interests fight for their jobs homes and preservation of other assets owners of assets that cause climate change and critically those who work for them face increasing threats of being put out of business or losing their jobs as coal plants are shuttered manufacturing moves elsewhere and renewables increasingly compete with fossil fuel based energy other climate forcing industries from agriculture to cement manufacturing will also have to decarbonize or face the prospect of going out of business even if the net benefits are positive some workers in those industries will lose their livelihoods and for many future employment will be difficult despite definitive evidence of climate change climate forcing asset owners continue to pour vast resources into preserving the value of their assets and preventing more aggressive climate politics 1 at the other end of the spectrum owners of climate vulnerable assets such as residents of small island states and coastal areas farmers and insurance companies or the tourism industry face the prospect of losing everything as the effects of climate change intensify scientists have attributed the intensity of recent natural disasters to climate change including hurricanes maria and harvey and the california forest fires 2 one study estimates that the direct damages from climate change will reduce gdp in the southeast us by almost 30 3 these climate losers at least some of the wealthy ones are beginning to organize to forestall greater losses in miami a new political coalition has formed to protect further devaluation of real estate and the elite ski resort in whistler british columbia is demanding compensation from the oil sector in alberta as climate losers become more numerous and diverse we can expect entrenched interests like fossil fuel owners to respond with more short termism and obstructionism on climate policy fossil fuel companies spent more than 30 million to defeat a carbon tax proposal in a 2018 washington state referendum and a renewable energy initiative in arizona lost in the midterms with the state utility spending upwards of 20 million to defeat it these changes will provoke a fundamentally different sort of political contestation policy and strategy will need to adapt to the new reality of existential politics turn losers into winners the critical role of labor but existential politics need not be cause for despair it can be an opportunity to create a broad base for support on climate action first and foremost this requires recognizing those who will lose from pro climate policies and neutralizing their opposition the existential politics of climate change are as much about workers as about an energy transition the political magic of marrying job creation with decarbonization efforts has attracted policy entrepreneurs since at least the early 2000s for example the obama administration s post crisis stimulus package included numerous green jobs initiatives and the 2016 clinton campaign s climate platform promised a rapid expansion of clean energy jobs across america figures like ban ki moon michael bloomberg and thomas friedman have endorsed more ambitious packages along these lines framed as a green new deal the sunrise movement alexandria ocasio cortez and a growing group of democrats and democratic socialists are beginning to understand how the technocratic win win version of these ideas could be used as tools for political mobilization the supporters of the new green new deal have wisely understood that merely showing the possibility of upfront tangible benefits is not enough real progress requires building a coalition to demand them ocasio cortez proposes total decarbonization while employing anyone who needs a job this reframing of the climate issue is an obvious focus in the us and other oecd nations to win over labor as a key constituent by providing them with employment the political effect is palpable the green new deal has generated more political salience in a few months than policies like carbon taxes or a cap and trade systems have generated in years such redistributive measures the preferred tools of economists have dominated policy debates for decades but rarely are they implemented at a price that can actually drive deep decarbonization pigovian redistribution may be elegant but in a world of existential politics no one gets out on the streets to demand it other examples show how existential politics can turn losers into winners in the oecd after committing to shutting its most of its coal mines by the end of next year spain has pledged to invest 250m in those regions affected by the policy some will receive compensation for early retirement while others are re skilled most will receive additional social aid germany s coal phaseout commission has proposed an even costlier package some 40 billion over the next decades in short building broad coalitions requires a focus on labor compensating workers in climate forcing sectors in creative ways like buying out pension plans from failing coal companies if done correctly this will galvanize greater support for pro climate policies without acting as more corporate welfare nationalizing pensions will be a considerable expense but one targeted at a large swath of the population rather than the wealthy few climate forcing asset owners it could be financed at least partly by other pro climate policies like a carbon tax when workers know that losing their job will not mean losing their homes they are much more likely to support climate policy there is some evidence that a similar approach would resonate elsewhere the gilets jaunes movement in france demonstrates that regressive climate policies will not be acceptable to the vast majority of democratic electorates at the same time we must realize that owners of climate forcing assets will also lose from decarbonization policies investors in oil companies and other fossil firms may demand compensation for giving up their assets as saudi arabia has always demanded in international climate negotiations with billions of dollars at stake they will continue to obstruct progress on climate policy broad based domestic coalitions are one strategy to counter their structural power implications for international climate policy building domestic winning coalitions under increasingly existential political conditions will be critical for decarbonization yet countries do not operate in a vacuum rather international drivers will be a vital part of determining whether pro decarbonization coalitions wield power domestically and create momentum transnationally three steps can help first the nationally determined nature of the paris pledges should be strengthened to focus on politically powerful domestic priorities many of the 2015 pledges do this already india trumpets the value of solar energy china includes industrial policy goals and peru emphasizes forestry the paris agreement requires national pledges to be comparable and measurable and represent progression over time but within these constraints we should encourage the widest possible range of policy measures so that future political leaders see in the paris system a vessel into which they can project their own ambitions second transnational networks of cities states regions businesses and other actors can help strengthen pro climate interests at the national level in the united states cities states and businesses representing over half of us gdp have declared that they will adhere to the paris agreement despite the trump administration s intention to withdraw in other countries like japan and mexico similar coalitions are pushing their governments to higher ambition while these interests act locally they are networked globally and after the paris conference have been institutionalized in the unfccc process this access to international attention expertise and resources can give pro climate actors an advantage in national political fights finally international climate finance will need to catch up with the shift from distributional to existential politics while climate related foreign aid from rich to poor countries can help as promised under the paris agreement the next step is ending fossil fuel subsidies worldwide particularly those for coal rich countries need to get their own house in order although there are many different ways to construe what constitutes a subsidy conservative estimates suggest that oecd nations spent roughly 150 billion on fossil fuel subsidies 4 further under the belt and road initiative chinese policy banks and other public funds have supported billions more in fossil fuel infrastructure the g20 agreed in 2009 that these subsidies should end phasing out subsidies should be billed as more than a technocratic fix to inefficient markets but rather a rightful redistribution of wealth to workers jessica green is associate

by russell a whitehouse healthcare was a top 2 issue in 6 7 issue priority polls conducted in 2018 and was the top issue in 4 7 the most important subcategory to voters is lowering prescription drug prices according to a harvard poll conducted in mid december democrats and republicans alike view it as their top healthcare priority bernie can point to his 2017 s amdt 178 to s con res 3 which would have allowed for much cheaper canadian drug importation it was killed by a slim 52 votes including one by cory booker as well as 3 bills that he has introduced this year as the godfather of medicare for all all the recent polling should hearten bernie in the aforementioned harvard poll 60 of republicans support a universal medicare buy in option another poll from mid october found 52 republican support for medicare for all a kaiser family foundation poll from last month found that 47 of republicans support medicare for all as long as people have an option to keep their current plan and 64 of republicans support a medicaid buy in option overall support for m4a skyrockets to a 2 3 majority kaiser family finds once people learn that it will guarantee healthcare as a right eliminate premiums and reduce out of pocket expenses these kff findings demonstrate on explaining the particulars of m4a to independents and republicans there is a lot of misinformation floating around about m4a in the media and the white house once people will learn about the individual benefits of m4a as well as the fact that even conservative economists acknowledge that it would save 2t and the fact that every other industrialized nation has universal healthcare support will continue to soar amongst every voting bloc stressing the fact that bernie is the person who brought m4a into the public consciousness and that most of his opponents either jumped on the m4a bandwagon recently or don t support it at all he can make strides in winning the over 45 vote which he lost handily in 2016 to clinton the economy was a top 2 issue in 5 7 issue priority polls conducted in 2018 this provides both a challenge and an opportunity for bernie trump will boast nonstop about rock bottom unemployment rates lower taxes really lower tax withholdings and the stock market bernie and warren are the only candidates who have the financial street knowledge consistency and experience illuminating the public about these issues to credibly change the status quo sanders has been vocalizing the plight of the working class his entire career most non rich people know that they are being screwed over even if they can t give a detailed economic explanation of why wages that barely keep up with inflation shrinking workplace benefits and security increasing tuition for a decreasing long term payoff skyrocketing healthcare costs an increasingly oligarchic political system that ignores working class voting issues trump s trumped up boasts will be pretty easy for bernie to pick apart in regards to shrinking unemployment he can point out that it s merely a continuation of the economic recovery that started under obama employment figures are inflated by what could be described as two for one employment a poor person might have to work two or more part time jobs to scrape by or a freelancer may work for several companies per year government statistics track employer records not employee records thus the aforementioned kinds of workers get counted multiple times this two for one employment is now the rule not the exception 94 of jobs created under the obama administration were part time or temporary further demonstrating this stat padding is the fact that the number of people who filed tax returns this year decreased by a whopping 12 4 that would seem to indicate that actual employment has actually plummeted in the first full year of trump s tax law in regards to trump s tax cuts most working class people are seeing little to no savings due to the elimination of most individual deductions a lot of the supposed savings are merely from reduced withholdings not increased returns in fact the average refund has shrunk 8 4 this year according to the irs website even the people who have noticed a benefit will have to kiss them goodbye when they expire in 2025 meanwhile the corporate tax cuts are permanent lastly the stock market is not something that trump should be bragging about yes it reached record highs in the first half year of the new tax law but by the end of the year many stocks had fallen below pre tax law levels in the case of major companies like apple facebook and google the temporary growth was mostly fuelled by stock buybacks not an actual increase in multifactor productivity unit labor costs or industrial production which have been stagnant for years anyway the wealthiest 10 of americans own 90 of all shares and these tycoons pay a lower tax rate on these capital gains than the average american does through earned income the republicans are able to get away with passing voodoo economics bills because they lie about the effects that it will have and because the democrats have traditionally done little to call out their b s bernie is a very policy oriented kind of guy he will know how to articulate the aforementioned points for the common person and will have to do so often to counter the gop s perpetual lies likewise he must be tireless in explaining how keystone legislation like medicare for all a green new deal and free public college will yes cost a lot of taxpayer money initially but will eventually be a net saver of money m4a will eliminate medical bankruptcy the 1 cause of bankruptcy protect the increasing majority of americans who don t have jobs that offer healthcare coverage ax runaway prescription drug pricing and save the lives of 45k previously uninsured people per year a gnd would not only help counter climate change but also create countless blue collar jobs manufacturing installation maintenance it would also help to keep the us economy competitive with china s the latter is quickly establishing itself as the world s green manufacturing powerhouse free public college particularly with an emphasis on trade schools will help decrease unemployment and job skills based income inequality it has been embraced by ultraconservative and ultra poor tennessee bernie in his campaign kickoff video talked about the need to end the destructive war on drugs private prisons and cash bail and bring about major police department reform he has been remarkably consistent on criminal justice reform 23 years ago he co sponsored a bill to legalize marijuana back in 2015 he said it seems to me that rather than spending huge amounts of money on jails and on private corporations who are incentivized to keep people in jail it might make a lot more sense to spend money on job training and education so that people do not end up in jail in the first place this speaks to the appeal that bernie s economic policies can have with black voters they would disproportionately benefit unemployed and underemployed black youth back in college bernie organized a campaign to fight housing discrimination another major issue in america s cities and suburbs continuing to articulate denunciations of systemic injustice and programs that would help the black working class is key to winning the presidency clinton lost 6 of the net black vote to trump compared to obama in 2012 losing black voters in swing state cities like milwaukee and philadelphia helped clinton to lose the electoral college likewise the black vote could play the deciding role in 2020 democratic primaries many voters could be attracted to kamala harris a black woman and one of the primary front runners so bernie mustn t let the media smear him as being out of touch with black voters like they did back in 2016 sanders can run on his long history of supporting criminal justice reform while pointing out kamala s record of doing the opposite while she was california a g in terms of immigration bernie should take advantage of the increasing unpopularity of trump s hardline stance 2019 polling has shown that 41 of the country wishes to build a border wall with a 57 majority opposed on the question of whether there s a national border emergency trump declaring a national emergency even fewer americans agree 34 support trump s position and 63 disagree in a quinnipiac poll and a gallup poll conducted this year an average of 24 of respondents expressed general dissatisfaction with immigration the recent debacles over inhumane treatment of immigrants at the border and in detention plus trump s loss on holding gov t funding hostage over border wall funding have left a sour taste in the mouths of many moderates on the issue in the 2016 presidential election the democrats lost an 8 net latino vote lead to the gop as opposed to obama romney bernie can win back some of these voters and attract new voters by renewing focus on immigration reform and the daca issue which has bipartisan support among citizens but which have been forgotten by the democratic leadership he can also draft legislation to crack down on visa overstays a far larger contributor to illegal immigration than border crossings to placate moderates i would advise that he avoids jumping on the abolish ice bandwagon as i think it would alienate too many undecided s rather he should talk about the need to radically reform it this could include a rapid scaling down of detention centers a greater focus on preventing immigrant dehydration deaths on the desert border and a more streamlined system of asylum seeker processing as the temperamental anti trump bernie can also talk about increasing aid conflict mediations and business opportunities for central america to reduce the demand for people from these countries to flee for the us bernie s actions to end the drug war would also help to end the cartel violence that spikes migration from latin america much was made of bernie s popularity with young voters in 2016 he garnered more youth votes than hillary and trump combined such dominance didn t hand bernie the nomination however from 2008 to 2106 the youth vote only jumped in 6 major democratic primary states highlighted in the below chart bernie only won 2 of them mi and wi wisconsin s youth voter turnout only increased by 7 in those 8 years little more than wisconsin s 2 4 total population growth during that time to be fair bernie doubled the youth turnout in michigan which he won in a stunning upset but fell in all 4 of the first four primary states there s little to reason bernie s youth vote can substantially increase in next year s primaries given the plethora of rivals in last year s congressional elections the youth vote reached a record high of 31 one third of that portion voted for republicans bernie s free public college proposal and similar legislation will naturally attract some politically savvy young people but to win in politics you need to secure the over 45 vote bernie s staff shouldn t jump over backwards to get young people to pokemon go to the polls but rather should plan on winning over cynical older voters bernie s massive deficit with older people of color in particular likely cost bernie the nomination in 2016 this is a brief overview of how bernie can be successful in 2020 this time he will have at least two formidable primary opponents harris and warren and possibly biden as well the mainstream media and democratic establishment will likely be major hurdles as well like they were in 2016 to overcome the dissenters and get through to the voters bernie will need perfect a formula of policy talking points empathy with the working class and people of color plus substantive critiques of his opponents bernie likely would have won in 2016 had he attacked clinton more aggressively on her corruption and perpetual flip flopping time will tell if bernie s new campaign manager faiz shakir will adapt these ideas
there were so many high profile events last week in the end the positive ones were more than enough to offset the negative ones us china trade truce was extended indefinitely and it looks closer than ever to have deal msci s increase of weighting of chinese stocks gave china another huge boost chance of no deal brexit faded much with uk prime minister theresa may s new arrangements on the other hand escalation of pakistan india tensions and the collapse of trump kim summit in vietnam just gave the markets very brief impact while economic data released during the week were mixed talks of bottoming in global slowdown emerged as risks are abating the turn in sentiment pushed treasury yields sharply higher yen suffered broad based selloff as yield gaps widened sharply with 10 year jgb staying negative though canadian dollar took the weakest spot as much weaker than expected q4 gdp suggested that its economy could be left behind by others late selloff in oil prices also did no favor to the loonie sterling ended as the strongest followed by euro but late strength in dollar suggests that it s catching up very quickly progress made in us china trade talks but nothing is done until everything is done it appeared that sufficient progress were made in us china trade negotiations to convince trump to announce extension of trade truce indefinitely early last week the news set a positive tone for the global financial markets in particular in china us trade representative is going to publish formal notice in the federal register next week confirming that the rate of additional duty for the products covered by the september 2018 action will remain at 10 percent until further notice comments from the us official regarding the negotiation were generally positive even though ustr robert lighthizer sounded cautious in his testimony to house ways and means committee lighthizer said real progress were made and us could turn the corner in the economic relationship with china but much still needs to be done before an agreement is reached and more importantly after it is reached treasury secretary steven mnuchin said the team is working on a 150 page very detailed document for significant structural commitments from china mnuchin hoped to make progress this month and if we do there will be a summit of the presidents national economic council director larry kudlow hailed that lighthizer has worked miracles on this chinese deal and we ve never come this far on china trade however as usual with any deal it s agreed only when everything s agreed trump indicated in a tweet on saturday that he made a sudden request to china to immediately remove all tariffs on american agricultural products he claimed it s based on the fact that we are moving along nicely with trade discussions and he didn t increase the tariffs on march 1 it s uncertain what china s response to trump s request would be from china s point of view the logical equivalent response to trump s refrain from more tariffs is not to impose retaliation measures of their own and china has already made some good faith purchases of us soybeans since the start of trade truce chinese leaders could have their own rationales in rejecting trump s requests the negotiation could turn down hill if china does say no and as a recap trump said after the summit with north korean leader kim jong un collapsed that i am always prepared to walk and i m never afraid to walk from a deal and i would do that with china too if it didn t work out he walked away from a deal with kim after traveling all the way to vietnam he can certainly walk away from a deal with china sitting in the oval office china s response will be closely watched and this could be the turning point in whole us china trade negotiations msci quadrupoles weighting of chinese stocks could translate into billions of inflow market sentiments were further lifted in particular in china again after msci announced to increase the weight of china a shares in msci indices the weighting will be increased from 5 to 20 in three steps step 1 msci will increase the index inclusion factor of all china a large cap shares in the msci indexes from 5 to 10 and add chinext large cap shares with a 10 inclusion factor coinciding with the may 2019 semi annual index review step 2 msci will increase the inclusion factor of all china a large cap shares in the msci indexes from 10 to 15 coinciding with the august 2019 quarterly index review step 3 msci will increase the inclusion factor of all china a large cap shares in the msci indexes from 15 to 20 and add china a mid cap shares including eligible chinext shares with a 20 inclusion factor to the msci indexes coinciding with the november 2019 semi annual index review after the process completes there will be 253 large and 168 mid cap china a shares including 27 chinext shares in the msci emerging markets index representing a weight of 3 3 in the pro forma index the decision was generally seen as symbolic acknowledgement of the growing importance of china s stock markets it could trigger increasing interest from us and european financial institutions in china a shares on the other hand it s also an indication that china s capital market are opening up much faster than anticipated and foreign investors would pick up a much larger role in the chinese markets morgan stanley said up to usd 3b of passive flows would be attracted on top of usd 15b it highlighted previously harvest global investments said together with the opening policies the decision would mean up to usd 100b of foreign inflows to a shares in 2019 more than double of usd 45b in 2018 t rowe price said the decision would translate into usd 40b worth of inflows chance of no deal brexit diminished after new arrangements diminishing chance of no deal brexit gave a strong boost to the pound and also to general market sentiments at this point it uncertain how the eu and uk are going to solve the issue of irish backstop yet for the commons to approve it there must be legally binding that the backstop is temporary eu is willing to offer further assurances nothing more with or without an updated brexit deal three votes are scheduled between march 12 and 14 march 12 meaningful vote on a new brexit deal prime minister theresa may promised to renegotiate with the eu especially on the irish backstop issue as the eu has so far refused to reopen negotiations the best pm may could do is to secure some legal guarantees march 13 no deal vote if the new deal is again rejected on march 12 pm may would table a motion asking if the mps support to leave the eu without a deal on march 29 this is to get explicit consensus from the parliament as pm may affirmed that the uk will only leave without a deal if there is explicit consent in the house for that outcome march 14 vote on extension of art 50 delaying the time to officially leave the eu from mar 29 2019 if the above motion is rejected meaning the parliament rejects a no deal brexit with a majority it would then have to vote on whether to seek a short limited extension to article 50 if the extension is approved pm may would have to seek unanimous approval from the eu parliament on the extension even with the arrangement there is still some uncertainty left in case of a delay a short timeframe would unlikely be meaningful for any breakthrough some in the eu parliament instead propose a 21 month extension a longer extension would increase the chance of a second referendum and while it is more likely that the majority would vote for an extension if no deal is approved may has yet to reveal a contingency plan should the extension vote be rejected but after all for now the stage is set that there will only be no deal brexit if there is explicit consent in the parliament global treasury yields surged but jgb stayed negative the developments in the financial markets are a result of a combination of all factors in particular the above three treasury yields in us uk and germany surged sharply over the week us 10 year yield rose 0 1 to close at 2 755 last week and reclaimed 2 7 handle consolidation from 2 799 has likely completed at 2 632 immediate focus is back on 2 799 resistance this week and break there will confirm this bullish case more importantly that would also indicate that medium term correction from 3 248 has completed at 2 554 ahead of 38 2 retracement of 1 336 2016 low to 3 248 2018 high at 2 517 and there is prospect of retesting 3 248 ahead in this case us 30 year yield was event stronger and affirmed the 10 year yield bullish development equivalent resistance at 3 109 which is close to 38 2 retracement of 3 3455 to 2 900 at 3 112 was firmly taken out rebound from 2 900 has resumed and correction from 3 455 should have completed at 2 900 after hitting 38 2 retracement of 2 102 2016 low to 3 455 2018 high at 2 938 further rise should be seen to 61 8 retracement of 3 3455 to 2 900 at 3 242 in near term there is also prospect of retesting 3 455 strong rallies were also seen in uk 10 year gilt yield and german 10 year bund yield japan 10 year jgb yield rose too but closed negative at 0 01 us stocks firm but lacked momentum chinese stocks powered up us stocks were firm last week but lacked upside momentum dow hit as high as 26241 42 on monday but retreated since then as noted before dow is already in sell zone above 78 6 retracement of 26951 81 to 21712 53 at 25830 6041 we re only viewing rise from 21712 53 as a leg in the consolidation pattern from 26951 81 only thus even in case of another rise dow should continue to lose upside momentum indeed it s already losing momentum as seen in daily macd break of 25762 21 support should at least trigger pull back to 55 day ema now at 25062 58 with prospect of reversing whole rise from 21712 53 the rally in chinese stocks last week were totally out of our expectations shanghai sse took out 38 2 retracement of 3587 03 to 2440 90 at 2878 72 last week further rise should be seen to 61 8 retracement at 3149 20 in near term more importantly the strong break of 55 week ema argues that corrective fall from 5178 19 2015 high has completed with three waves down to 2440 90 on bullish convergence condition in weekly macd there is prospect of heading back to 38 2 retracement of 5178 19 to 2440 90 at 3486 54 in medium term german dax extended the rebound from 10279 20 last week it s partly lifted by much stronger than expected german retail sales data too near term outlook will now stay bullish as long as last week s low at 11416 08 holds focus is immediately on 11726 62 key resistance it s close to 55 week ema now at 11763 83 decisive break should confirm completion of medium term correction from 13596 89 2018 high and in that case we should at least see further rise to 61 8 retracement of 13596 89 to 10279 20 at 12329 53 position trading we have a aud jpy short position sold at 78 40 our stop at 79 84 was not hit despite a couple of rally attempt in the cross we were totally wrong on expectation of yen strength in particular the envisaged rejection by 55 day ema in usd jpy and eur jpy didn t happen instead widening yield spreads pushed both usd jpy and eur jpy sharply higher taking out key resistance levels the case for up trend resumption in yen is no longer there nevertheless we were still correct in expectation of aussie weakness such weakness in best seen in the lack of positive reaction to the strong rally in chinese stocks and fundamentally expectation of rba rate cut continued to build up some further selloff could be seen ahead after rba rate decision australia gdp trade balance and retail sales this week considering all we will switch from aud jpy short to aud usd short this week we ll close the aud jpy at market open then we ll sell aud usd on break of 0 7050 below 0 7054 support with stop at 0 7125 above 0 7121 minor resistance firm break of 0 7054 will confirm completion of rebound from 0 6722 aud usd is holding inside medium term channel and failed to sustain above 55 day ema which keeps medium term down trend intact while 0 6722 is the first target we re actually looking at breaking 0 6722 to resume larger down trend to 0 6008 2008 low eur jpy weekly outlook eur jpy rose strongly to as high as 127 50 last week before closing at 127 19 as rise from 118 62 extended and accelerated initial bias remains on the upside for 61 8 retracement of 137 49 to 118 62 at 130 28 next on the downside break of 126 60 minor support will turn intraday bias neutral and bring consolidations first but downside of retreat should be contained by 124 23 125 95 support zone to bring rise resumption in the bigger picture current development argues that medium term decline from 137 49 2018 high has completed with three waves down to 118 62 already decisive break of 133 12 resistance will confirm this bullish case and whole up trend from 109 03 2016 low might resume through 137 49 in that case on the downside break of 124 23 support will invalidate this case and turn focus back to 118 62 instead in the long term picture eur jpy is staying in long term sideway pattern established since 2000 fall from 137 49 is seen as a falling leg inside the pattern and could have completed break of 133 12 resistance will likely send eur jpy through 137 49 towards 149 76 2014 high

from the author mark alexander the patriot s primer on american liberty a treatise on the eternal struggle between liberty and tyranny and on the primacy of rule of law over rule of men our cause is noble it is the cause of mankind george washington table of contents sons of liberty the fight for freedom the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants thomas jefferson on december 16 1773 boston radicals members of a secret organization of american patriots sons of liberty boarded three east india company ships at griffin s wharf they threw 342 chests of british east india company tea into boston harbor this iconic event foretold the coming revolution against oppressive taxation and tyranny and it is immortalized as the boston tea party resistance to the british crown had been mounting since king george iii imposed the writs of assistance giving british authorities the power to arrest and detain colonists for any reason he also imposed oppressive bills of attainder targeting colonists for punishment without a trial the quartering act of 1765 even authorized troops to use the homes of his colonial subjects as barracks the spirit of protesting had intensified over previously enacted taxes including the 1764 sugar act 1765 stamp act and 1767 townshend acts the framework for king george s tyrannical monarchy was outlined by one of his predecessors king james i in an address to parliament in 1610 the state of monarchy is the supremest thing upon earth for kings are not only god s lieutenants upon earth and sit upon god s throne but even by god himself are called gods kings are justly called gods for that they exercise a manner or resemblance of divine power upon earth they have power of raising and casting down of life and of death judges over all their subjects and in all causes and yet accountable to none but god to dispute what god may do is blasphemy so is it sedition in subjects to dispute what a king may do in the height of his power i would wish you to be careful to avoid three things in the matter of grievances first that you do not meddle with the main points of government that is my craft secondly i would not have you meddle with such ancient rights of mine as i have received from my predecessors and lastly i pray you beware to exhibit for grievance anything that is established by a settled law for it is an undutiful part in subjects to press their king wherein they know beforehand he will refuse them the mounting colonial resistance came to bloodshed in march 1770 when british troops fired on civilians in boston killing five colonists this event widely known as the boston massacre gave credence to the slogan no taxation without representation but it was the 1773 tea act under which the crown collected a three pence tax on each pound of tea imported to the colonies that instigated many tea party protests and seeded the american revolution indeed as james madison reflected in 1823 the people of the u s owe their independence and their liberty to the wisdom of descrying in the minute tax of three pence on tea the magnitude of the evil comprised in the precedent news of the tea party protest in boston galvanized the colonial movement opposing onerous british parliamentary acts that were a violation of the natural charter and constitutional rights of the british colonists in response to the rising colonial unrest the british enacted additional measures to punish the citizens of massachusetts and to suppress resistance to the crown s authority these were labeled intolerable acts the first of which was the 1774 boston port bill that blockaded the harbor in an effort to starve bostonians into submission among the patriots who broke the blockade to supply food to the people of boston was william prescott who would later prove himself a heroic military leader at bunker hill and saratoga to his fellow patriots in boston prescott wrote we heartily sympathize with you and are always ready to do all in our power for your support comfort and relief knowing that providence has placed you where you must stand the first shock our forefathers passed the vast atlantic spent their blood and treasure that they might enjoy their liberties both civil and religious and transmit them to their posterity now if we should give them up can our children rise up and call us blessed the boston blockade was followed by the massachusetts government act the administration of justice act and the quartering act but far from accomplishing the desired outcome the crown s oppressive countermeasures hardened colonial resistance and led to the convention of the first continental congress on september 5 1774 in philadelphia to establish unity the first continental congress agreed that an attack on any colony would be considered an attack on all and it began strengthening militias by march 1775 civil discontent was at its tipping point and american patriots in massachusetts and other colonies were preparing to cast off their masters the spirit of the coming revolution was captured in 39 year old patrick henry s impassioned speech to the second virginia convention concluding i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death that month dr joseph warren also delivered a fiery oration in boston warning of complacency and instilling courage among his fellow patriots the man who meanly will submit to wear a shackle condemns the noblest gift of heaven and impiously affronts the god that made him free ease and prosperity though pleasing for a day have often sunk a people into effeminacy and sloth our country is in danger but not to be despaired of our enemies are numerous and powerful but we have many friends determining to be free and heaven and earth will aid the resolution on you depend the fortunes of america you are to decide the important question on which rest the happiness and liberty of millions yet unborn act worthy of yourselves on the evening of april 18 1775 general thomas gage acting as the crown s military governor of massachusetts dispatched a force of 700 british army regulars with secret orders these troops under the command of lieutenant colonel francis smith were to arrest 53 year old boston tea party leader samuel adams massachusetts provincial congress president john hancock and merchant fleet owner jeremiah lee but what directly tied gage s orders to the later enumeration in our constitution s second amendment of the innate right to keep and bear arms was the primary mission of his redcoat brigades they were charged with undertaking a preemptive raid to confiscate arms and ammunition stored by massachusetts patriots in the town of concord patriot militia and minutemen under the leadership of the radical sons of liberty anticipated this raid and the confrontations with british regulars at lexington and concord proved the fuse that ignited the american revolution near midnight on april 18 41 year old paul revere who had arranged an advance signal warning of british movements departed charlestown near boston for lexington and concord in order to warn john hancock samuel adams and other sons of liberty that the british army was marching to arrest them and seize their weapons caches after meeting with hancock and adams in lexington revere was captured but his patriot ally samuel prescott continued to concord warning militiamen along the way the patriots in lexington and concord along with other citizen militias in new england were bound by minute man oaths to stand at a minute s warning with arms and ammunition the oath of the lexington militia read we trust in god that should the state of our affairs require it we shall be ready to sacrifice our estates and everything dear in life yea and life itself in support of the common cause in the early dawn of april 19 their oaths would be tested with blood under the command of 46 year old farmer and militia captain john parker seventy seven militiamen assembled on the town green at lexington where they soon faced smith s overwhelming force of seasoned british regulars parker did not expect shots to be exchanged but his orders were stand your ground don t fire unless fired upon but if they mean to have a war let it begin here within close musket range from the patriots column british major john pitcairn swung his sword and ordered lay down your arms you damned rebels not willing to sacrifice his small band of patriots on the green as parker later wrote in a sworn deposition i immediately ordered our militia to disperse and not to fire but his patriots did not lay down their arms then under pitcairn s orders as parker testified immediately said troops made their appearance and rushed furiously fired upon and killed eight of our party without receiving any provocation therefor from us ten other patriots were wounded as the american militia retreated toward concord with the british in pursuit their ranks grew to more than 400 in concord the british divided in order to search for armament stores before noon the second confrontation between regulars and militiamen occurred as 100 british light infantry from three companies faced the ranks of militia and minutemen at concord s old north bridge from depositions on both sides the british fired first killing two and wounding four this time however the militia commander major john buttrick ordered fire for god s sake fellow soldiers fire and fire they did the volley commenced with what poet ralph waldo emerson later immortalized as the shot heard round the world with that shot farmers laborers landowners and statesmen alike brought on themselves the sentence of death for treason in the ensuing firefight the british suffered heavy casualties in disarray the redcoats retreated to concord proper and after reinforcing their ranks marched back toward lexington during their concord retreat british regulars took additional casualties in sporadic firefights the most notable of those was an ambush by the reassembled ranks of john parker s militia that became known as parker s revenge despite being joined by reinforcements when they returned to lexington the king s men were no match for the patriot ranks the militia and minutemen inflicted heavy casualties on the redcoats along their 18 mile tactical retreat to boston by day s end the patriots suffered forty nine killed thirty nine wounded and five missing the british casualties totaled seventy three killed 174 wounded and twenty six missing upon hearing of those first shots in what would become an eight year struggle for american liberty samuel adams declared to fellow patriot john hancock what a glorious morning this is by the time the second continental congress convened in may 1775 the young nation was in an open war for liberty and independence it was a revolution to win liberty not just for the people of massachusetts but for all americans and indeed for all mankind the rights these patriots fought to secure are eternal not temporal on july 6 1775 less than three months after the confrontation at lexington and concord the continental congress passed thomas jefferson s declaration of the causes and necessity for taking up arms which asserted the inherent right of the people to defend themselves against tyranny we most solemnly before god and the world declare that exerting the utmost energy of those powers which our beneficent creator hath graciously bestowed upon us the arms we have been compelled by our enemies to assume we will in defiance of every hazard employ for the preservation of our liberties being with one mind resolved to die freemen rather than to live slaves with a humble confidence in the mercies of the supreme and impartial god and ruler of the universe we most devoutly implore his divine goodness to protect us happily through this great conflict in january 1776 thomas paine published his pamphlet common sense which framed the uprising by noting the cause of america is in a great measure the cause of all mankind in his 1776 treatise thoughts on government 41 year old john adams justified revolution by declaring government is instituted for the common good for the protection safety prosperity and happiness of the people and not for profit honor or private interest of any one man family or class of men therefore the people alone have an incontestable unalienable and indefeasible right to institute government and to reform alter or totally change the same when their protection safety prosperity and happiness require it on may 15 1776 the continental congress adopted a resolution calling on states to prepare for rebellion in its preamble john adams advised his countrymen to sever all oaths of allegiance to the crown we hold these truths endowed by their creator in the supposed state of nature all men are equally bound by the laws of nature or to speak more properly the laws of the creator samuel adams on july 2 1776 delegations from the thirteen sovereign states convened as the second continental congress at the pennsylvania state house the delegates voted in support of a much debated resolution for colonial unity and independence the new york delegation abstained as it had not received permission from the colony s provincial congress to vote in the affirmative on july 3 john adams wrote to his wife abigail yesterday the greatest question was decided which ever was debated in america and a greater perhaps never was or will be decided among men you will see in a few days a declaration setting forth the causes which have impelled us to this mighty revolution and the reasons which will justify it in the sight of god and man adams continued the second day of july 1776 will be the most memorable epocha in the history of america i am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival it ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance by solemn acts of devotion to god almighty it ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade with shews games sports guns bells bonfires and illuminations from one end of this continent to the other from this time forward forever more you will think me transported with enthusiasm but i am not i am well aware of the toil and blood and treasure that it will cost us to maintain this declaration and support and defend these states yet through all the gloom i can see the rays of ravishing light and glory adams concluded i can see that the end is more than worth all the means and that posterity will tryumph in that day s transaction even altho we should rue it which i trust in god we shall not the delegates then spent two days reviewing the draft of the proposed declaration of independence which 33 year old thomas jefferson composed at the request of john adams after revisions and deletions it was ratified on july 4 and signed by john hancock president of the continental congress the fourth of july has since become the independence day we celebrate with pomp and parade with shews games sports guns bells bonfires and illuminations on the night of the enactment of the declaration of independence printer john dunlap produced the first 200 broadsides for distribution notably however the famous parchment copy of the declaration now in the national archives ordered produced by congress on july 19 included the additional word unanimous after the new york delegation affirmed its support it was then signed by 56 patriots some of whom were not present in philadelphia in early july most signed in early august with the last signature affixed on november 4 the delegate signers who were merchants farmers doctors lawyers and those of other common professions all pledged our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor to the cause of liberty nine of the fifty six would indeed lose their lives in the ensuing conflict the delegates declared when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature s god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation our founders further avowed the declaration s most foundational principle we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness our declaration of independence was derived from common law the laws of nature and nature s god and the assertion that the rights of all men were unalterable as endowed by their creator rather than by the rulers of men was radical as was its call on the supreme judge of the world for protection of divine providence the declaration s first paragraph references the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature s god entitle them which informs the words endowed by their creator in the second paragraph the eternal assertion that liberty for all people is endowed by their creator and is thus unalienable should require no defense because we hold these truths to be self evident the rights of man are immutable as affirmed by the laws of nature and of nature s god to better understand what is meant by the laws of nature and of nature s god recall that our declaration s signers were not of one mind on matters of theology and religious doctrine they were christians deists and agnostics but above their diversity of beliefs they uniformly declared the rights of all people were are and forever will be innate and unalienable as established by the laws of nature and of nature s god this is not an article of faith it is the assertion that the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the fundamental rights of mankind enshrined in our declaration of independence are inherent and eternal applicable to all humans of every nation religion race and ethnicity for all time it makes no difference what one s concept of nature s god or our creator is or whether one subscribes to such an understanding all people are entitled to liberty and all the rights so embodied those rights are not the gift of man nor the laws ascribed by men as founder alexander hamilton wrote the sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty records they are written as with a sun beam in the whole volume of human nature by the hand of the divinity itself and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power indeed the declaration and constitution were designed specifically to protect those rights not award them life liberty and the pursuit of happiness are natural rights gifts from god not from government the root of all debate between liberty and tyranny or in contemporary political parlance between right those who would conserve foundation principles and left those who would discard them is the contest to determine who endows liberty is liberty the inherent right of all people or is it awarded by presidents legislatures and judges the importance of this foundational question cannot be overemphasized nor can the threat to liberty posed by those who would discard it the declaration s common law inspiration for the rights of mankind has its origin in governing documents dating back to the english constitutions of clarendon 1164 and the magna carta 1215 each established an objective rule of law over and above the subjective rule of the king rex lex the king is law was ultimately replaced by lex rex the law is king the magna carta stated the king was bound under the law by a national covenant a declaration of mutual obligations of the ruler and those ruled the roots of liberty and rule of law are also found in the protestant reformation s wars of religion and in the seventeenth century puritan writers most notably samuel rutherford and his works in his 1690 second treatise on government john locke articulated this contractual vision of a government of laws existing to protect the liberties of its citizens the context for locke s thought was the glorious revolution 1688 and the english bill of rights 1689 however our declaration s most contemporary common law inspiration was william blackstone s 1765 commentaries on the laws of england perhaps the most scholarly historical and analytical treatise on natural law blackstone wrote as man depends absolutely upon his maker for everything it is necessary that he should in all points conform to his maker s will this will of his maker is called the law of nature this law of nature being coeval with mankind and dictated by god himself is of course superior in obligation to any other it is binding over all the globe in all countries and at all times no human laws are of any validity if contrary to this upon these two foundations the law of nature and the law of revelation depend all human laws that is to say no human laws should be suffered to contradict these justice james wilson a signer of both the declaration of independence and the constitution and one of george washington s first nominees to the supreme court wrote law communicated to us by reason and conscience has been called natural as promulgated by the holy scriptures it has been called revealed but it should always be remembered that this law natural or revealed flows from the same divine source it is the law of god human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is divine as john adams resolved if men through fear fraud or mistake should in terms renounce and give up any essential natural right the eternal law of reason and the great end of society would absolutely vacate such renunciation the right to freedom being the gift of god almighty it is not in the power of man to alienate this gift and voluntarily become a slave it is these fundamental principles of liberty as endowed and protected by rule of law versus the rule of men that thomas jefferson and the delegates enumerated in our declaration of independence and which james madison later codified in our constitution references to god and our creator would eventually be included in all fifty state constitutions we resolve to conquer or die the fate of unborn millions will now depend under god on the courage and conduct of this army our cruel and unrelenting enemy leaves us no choice but a brave resistance or the most abject submission we have therefore to resolve to conquer or die our own country s honor all call upon us for a vigorous and manly exertion and if we now shamefully fail we shall become infamous to the whole world george washington at the advent of the american revolution john adams wrote objects of the most stupendous magnitude and measure in which the lives and liberties of millions yet unborn are intimately interested are now before us we are in the very midst of a revolution the most complete unexpected and remarkable of any in the history of nations concluding his sermon on january 21 1776 american clergyman john peter muhlenberg issued a call to arms that resonated across the colonies he famously threw off his clerical robes to reveal the uniform of a continental army officer declaring for everything there is a season and a time for every matter under heaven there is a time for all things there is a time to preach and a time to fight and now is the time to fight the next day he led 300 men of his church and surrounding churches to join general washington s continental army as the eighth virginia regiment samuel adams captured the spirit of the revolution in his philadelphia statehouse speech a month after the declaration s signing courage then my countrymen our contest is not only whether we ourselves shall be free but whether there shall be left to mankind an asylum on earth for civil and religious liberty if i have a wish dearer to my soul than that my ashes may be mingled with those of warren and montgomery it is that these american states may never cease to be free and independent of those unwilling to defend liberty adams declared contemplate the mangled bodies of your countrymen and then say what should be the reward of such sacrifices if ye love wealth better than liberty the tranquility of servitude than the animated contest of freedom go from us in peace we ask not your counsels or arms crouch down and lick the hands which feed you may your chains sit lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen in december 1776 thomas paine wrote in the american crisis of the contest for liberty these are the times that try men s souls the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their country but he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman tyranny like hell is not easily conquered yet we have this consolation with us that the harder the conflict the more glorious the triumph what we obtain too cheap we esteem too lightly heaven knows how to put a price upon its goods and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated as benjamin franklin noted it is a common observation here that our cause is the cause of all mankind and that we are fighting for their liberty in defending our own american patriots faced what seemed to be insurmountable odds but their unanimously chosen leader george washington was by common acclamation a divinely inspired choice as commander in chief of the continental army washington had proven his steadfast leadership as a young virginia militia officer in the french and indian war two decades before the revolution most notably at the battle of the monongahela when the french and their indian allies ambushed general edward braddock s forces and mortally wounded braddock the british were retreating in chaos washington rode back and forth amid the pitched battle rallying braddock s troops and his virginians into an ordered retreat in the process two horses were shot from under him and he would later count four bullet holes through his coat but he himself was unscathed concerning overwhelming odds washington wrote in his 1776 general orders let us therefore rely upon the goodness of the cause and the aid of the supreme being in whose hands victory is to animate and encourage us to great and noble actions the eyes of all our countrymen are now upon us and we shall have their blessings and praises if happily we are the instruments of saving them from the tyranny mediated against them let us therefore animate and encourage each other and shew the whole world that a freeman contending for liberty on his own ground is superior to any slavish mercenary on earth washington continued the hour is fast approaching on which the honor and success of this army and the safety of our bleeding country depend remember officers and soldiers that you are freemen fighting for the blessings of liberty that slavery will be your portion and that of your posterity if you do not acquit yourselves like men the revolutionary war was hard fought and nearly lost on many fields there were pitched and bloody battles between the onset at lexington and concord in april 1775 and the war s conclusion with the treaty of paris in 1783 the major campaigns were boston 1775 76 invasion of quebec 1775 76 new york and new jersey campaigns 1776 77 saratoga 1777 philadelphia 1777 78 and yorktown 1781 the most notable battles in and around those early campaigns were ticonderoga may 1775 bunker hill june 1775 quebec december 1775 and charleston june 1776 in the first battle after the signing of the declaration of independence brooklyn heights august 1776 king george s 400 ship armada and its 32 000 british and hessian troops overwhelmed washington s retreating force and took the strategic harbor of new york it was the largest maritime attack until d day in 1944 when ironically our nation combined forces with the british and other allies to free europe from another tyrant british generals assumed that subduing the rest of the colonial rebellion would not prove too difficult but they had never confronted militiamen imbued with the spirit of liberty the seminal battles that followed were trenton december 1776 bennington august 1777 saratoga october 1777 the encampment at valley forge december 1777 monmouth june 1778 rhode island august 1778 kings mountain october 1780 cowpens january 1781 and finally yorktown october 1781 for context my own family s patriot lineage includes militiamen who settled in what would become east tennessee prior to the revolution they served with john sevier s overmountain men who engaged british general charles cornwallis s brutal irish henchman major patrick ferguson at kings mountain the militiamen killed ferguson and defeated his forces on october 7 1780 a battle that turned the tide of the american revolution they went on to fight with general francis marion the swamp fox in south carolina and then served under george washington at yorktown until cornwallis and his british army surrendered in october 1781 there were 217 000 american patriots engaged in the revolutionary war with an estimated 6 800 battle deaths but the overall deaths including those who succumbed to starvation and disease exceeded 55 000 our french allies suffered more than 10 000 battle deaths mostly at sea and their spanish allies bore more than 5 000 casualties in comparison to the casualty counts of the twentieth century s world wars these numbers are small as a percentage of the population however the casualty statistics are harrowing in 1776 the thirteen colonies population was just under 2 5 million less than twenty percent of the population of britain at the time at the war s end in 1783 washington wrote it is yet to be decided whether the revolution must ultimately be considered as a blessing or a curse a blessing or a curse not to the present age alone for with our fate will the destiny of unborn millions be involved benjamin rush observed the american war is over but this far from being the case with the american revolution on the contrary nothing but the first act of the drama is closed it remains yet to establish and perfect our new forms of government and to prepare the principles morals and manners of our citizens for these forms of government after they are established and brought to perfection in retrospect john adams wrote but what do we mean by the american revolution do we mean the american war the revolution was effected before the war commenced the revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people a change in their religious sentiments of their duties and obligations this radical change in the principles opinions sentiments and affections of the people was the real american revolution for his part rather than anoint himself king as some speculated he might at the revolutionary war s conclusion general washington chose instead to return to his mount vernon farm when king george iii heard from his american born portrait painter benjamin west that washington would retire rather than take power as a sovereign he reportedly replied if he does that he will be the greatest man in the world in fact washington had been unanimously elected to serve as the commander in chief of our continental army he would be unanimously elected as president of the constitutional convention he would be unanimously elected as our first president and then unanimously reelected to a second term but he voluntarily relinquished each office once his duty was completed he was not on a quest for power and titles he was governed by strength of character love of country and family and foremost his devotion to american liberty the man known as both the father of our country and its indispensable man set the highest standard for presidential character we the people we the people of the united states in order to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquility provide for the common defence promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america preamble to the constitution of the united states in 1776 the second continental congress appointed a committee representing the thirteen newly sovereign states to draft a formal document of incorporation on november 15 1777 the states approved the articles of confederation and perpetual union the articles which maintained the maximal autonomy of the individual states were finally ratified on march 1 1781 and the united states in congress assembled became the congress of the confederation regarding self governance at the close of the revolutionary war it was evident to most american leaders that the articles of confederation between the states did not sufficiently ensure the interests and security of the confederation in september 1786 at the urging of 35 year old james madison twelve delegates from five states new jersey new york pennsylvania delaware and virginia met in annapolis maryland to consider amendments to the articles those delegates called for representatives from every state to convene at the pennsylvania state house in philadelphia for full consideration of the revisions needed and twelve states rhode island declining sent fifty five delegates a third of whom had signed the declaration of independence the most noted delegates were george washington james madison roger sherman alexander hamilton benjamin franklin and george mason thomas jefferson was in europe in his capacity as minister to france but he expressed his cautious support for the new constitution in correspondence with madison noticeably absent from the proceedings were patrick henry samuel adams and thomas paine who believed the articles needed modification not a replacement their concern was that establishing a new constitution could imperil our fundamental liberties summing up those sentiments henry wrote that he smelt a rat in philadelphia tending toward the monarchy the philadelphia constitutional convention opened on may 25 1787 and unanimously elected george washington as the convention s president drafting a new constitution was soon favored instead of amending the existing articles the next three months were devoted to deliberations on various proposals the objective was to draft a document to secure the rights and principles enumerated in the declaration of independence and the articles of confederation thus preserving liberty in late july after much debate the committee of detail was appointed to draft a document that included all of the compromise agreements based primarily on madison s virginia plan establishing a republican form of government subject to strict rule of law reflecting the consent of the people and severely limiting the power of the central government a month later the committee of style and arrangement which included james madison as primary author and intellectual inspiration gouverneur morris alexander hamilton william samuel johnson and rufus king produced the final draft of the constitution which was then submitted on september 17 1787 for delegate signatures here it must be stressed that this document established a republic not a popular democracy which is to say that it affirmed the primacy of rule of law over the rule of men benjamin franklin said of the new document i confess that there are several parts of this constitution which i do not at present approve but i am not sure i shall never approve them for having lived long i have experienced many instances of being obliged by better information or fuller consideration to change opinions even on important subjects which i once thought right but found to be otherwise thus i consent sir to this constitution because i expect no better and because i am not sure that it is not the best of the fifty five delegates thirty nine signed the new constitution while the remaining delegates declined most out of concern that the power apportioned through the new plan was a threat to the sovereignty of the several states and thus to individual liberty the ensuing ratification debates among the states were vigorous james madison john jay and alexander hamilton the latter having distinguished himself at age twenty six as washington s chief aide and officer at the battle of yorktown in 1781 authored and published the federalist papers a collection of eighty five essays written under the pseudonym publius advocating for ratification of the new constitution and the strong central government it established to this day the federalist papers remain our constitution s most detailed explication affirming the original meaning and intent of our nation s founding document anti federalists opposed the plan under consideration because they believed it allocated too much power to the central government patrick henry samuel adams george mason robert yates thomas paine samuel bryan and richard henry lee were among those who spoke against ratification and some authored several essays that were aggregated and published as the anti federalist papers the federalists prevailed however madison conceded it has been said that all government is an evil it would be more proper to say that the necessity of any government is a misfortune this necessity however exists and the problem to be solved is not what form of government is perfect but which of the forms is least imperfect to that end it is important to note that the strong central government established by our constitution bore no resemblance to nor did that document authorize the behemoth intrusive statist central government that we have today in federalist no 32 hamilton notes but as the plan of the convention aims only at a partial union or consolidation the state governments would clearly retain all the rights of sovereignty which they before had and which were not by that act exclusively delegated to the united states the new constitution stipulated that once nine of the thirteen original states ratified it through state conventions a date would be established for its implementation this created controversy as the new constitution had no standing authority to make such a stipulation however once the ninth state new hampshire reported its convention s approval on june 21 1788 the continental congress set the constitution s enactment date as march 4 1789 with rhode island s ratification on may 29 1790 all thirteen states endorsed the constitution though critical of many of its provisions thomas jefferson wrote in reflection on the convention and its product the example of changing a constitution by assembling the wise men of the state instead of assembling armies will be worth as much to the world as the former examples we had given them the constitution too which was the result of our deliberation is unquestionably the wisest ever yet presented to men as previously noted our founders affirmed that the unalienable rights of man enumerated in our declaration of independence and by extension as codified in its subordinate guidance our constitution are those endowed by their creator regarding the supremacy of the declaration s enumerations on the occasion of the declaration s fiftieth anniversary madison wrote to jefferson on the distinctive principles of the government of the u states the best guides are to be found in the declaration of independence as the fundamental act of union of these states hence the u s constitution was created as a contractual agreement binding the several states into one union as implied by our original national motto e pluribus unum but the innate rights of mankind identified in the declaration provide the overarching basis for that union immutable and non negotiable by way of collective agreement and compromise but as james monroe cautioned how prone all human institutions have been to decay how subject the best formed and most wisely organized governments have been to lose their check and totally dissolve how difficult it has been for mankind in all ages and countries to preserve their dearest rights and best privileges impelled as it were by an irresistible fate of despotism upon ratification james madison observed it is impossible for the man of pious reflection not to perceive in a finger of that almighty hand which has been so frequently and signally extended to our relief in the critical stages of the revolution following ratification on february 4 1789 george washington who had played a central role in the adoption and ratification of our constitution was elected by the majority of every state s electors to serve as our nation s first president he was inaugurated on april 30 of that year notably he was elected again in 1792 and served until 1797 however as he had previously done as commander in chief during the revolution instead of perpetuating his office he humbly returned to his mount vernon farm to secure these rights the conventions of a number of the states having at the time of their adopting the constitution expressed a desire in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added preamble to the bill of rights endeavoring to further define our constitution s limits on governmental encroachment on the innate rights of the people james madison its primary architect introduced to the first congress in 1789 a bill of rights which was ratified on december 15 1791 our bill of rights was inspired by three remarkable documents the first was john locke s two treatises of government 1689 regarding the protection of property in the latin context proprius or one s own life liberty and estate the second the virginia declaration of rights 1776 was authored by george mason as part of that state s constitution finally of course was our declaration of independence authored by thomas jefferson though the bill of rights is commonly referred to as the first ten amendments to our constitution one should distinguish these ten articles from amendments the bill of rights is an integral part of our constitution constitutional amendments made over the course of our nation s history have modified the constitution per its own stipulation madison proposed the articles to prevent misconstruction or abuse of our natural rights by stipulating declaratory and restrictive clauses to prevent the central government from violating those rights the addition of the bill of rights was hotly debated among our founders many argued that the mere reiteration of these innate and unalienable rights of mankind within the constitution implied that those rights are subject to change the subtext being that those rights are granted to the people by the state rather than inherent as endowed by their creator alexander hamilton maintained in federalist no 84 bills of rights in the sense and in the extent in which they are contended for are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution but would even be dangerous they would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted and on this very account would afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were granted for why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do but anti federalist george mason was among sixteen of the fifty five constitutional convention delegates who refused to sign the constitution because it did not adequately address limitations on what the central government had no power to do indeed he worked with patrick henry and samuel adams against its ratification for that very reason as a result of mason s insistence the first session of congress incorporated those ten additional limitations on the federal government for the reasons outlined by the preamble to the bill of rights the conventions of a number of the states having at the time of their adopting the constitution expressed a desire in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added and as extending the ground of public confidence in the government will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution of note in the earlier debates on the language in the constitution madison argued in framing a system which we wish to last for ages we should not lose sight of the changes which ages will produce this was a reference to the question of the length of terms for senators and other such particulars however everyone in the constitution and bill of rights debates would reject the notion that such changes would ever apply to the constriction of natural rights such as those enumerated in the first and second articles read in context the bill of rights is both another affirmation of the unalienable rights of mankind and a clear proscription upon any central government infringement of those rights the purpose of its inclusion was without question to further secure those rights an evil of colossal magnitude i believe a time will come when an opportunity will be offered to abolish this lamentable evil everything we do is to improve it if it happens in our day if not let us transmit to our descendants together with our slaves a pity for their unhappy lot and an abhorrence of slavery patrick henry slavery on the american continent long preceded the arrival of africans as indigenous tribal people had enslaved those from other tribes for centuries the enslavement of black africans and indentured servitude of white immigrants occurred both in the northern and southern colonies in the north slaves were primarily domestic servants and dispensing with institutionalized slavery was much more rapid than in the south where after the rise of cotton at the onset of the industrial revolution the entire economy depended on slave labor much has rightly been written of the fact that at the time our declaration was instituted and our constitution ratified many africans remained enslaved in the american colonies and states notably strong sentiments for emancipation were also expressed in that same era views on slavery changed dramatically with the enlightenment of the mid eighteenth century the same enlightenment that informed the fundamental tenet in our declaration of independence that all men were created equal in 1774 thomas jefferson wrote the abolition of domestic slavery is the great object of desire in those colonies where it was unhappily introduced in their infant state in his draft of the declaration jefferson wrote has waged cruel war against human nature itself violating its most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him captivating and carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither he later wrote nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate than that these people are to be free negro slavery wrote john adams is an evil of colossal magnitude benjamin franklin concluded that slavery was an atrocious debasement of human nature he added every measure of prudence therefore ought to be assumed for the eventual total extirpation of slavery from the united states i have throughout my whole life held the practice of slavery in abhorrence john jay declared it is much to be wished that slavery may be abolished the honour of the states as well as justice and humanity in my opinion loudly call upon them to emancipate these unhappy people to contend for our own liberty and to deny that blessing to others involves an inconsistency not to be excused during the constitutional convention in 1787 james madison declared we have seen the mere distinction of color made in the most enlightened period of time a ground of the most oppressive dominion ever exercised by man over man he also foresaw a time when slavery would divide the nation observing the real difference of interests lay not between large and small but between the northern and southern states the institution of slavery and its consequences formed a line of discrimination george washington would later write i wish from my soul that the legislature of could see the policy of a gradual abolition of slavery there is not a man living who wishes more sincerely than i do to see a plan adopted for the abolition of such assertions by those who owned slaves are viewed in the contemporary context as a contradiction though in the context of the period they were not unfortunately as ingrained as the institution of slavery was in the colonial period arguments for emancipation gained little traction slavery would not be abolished until the end of the cataclysmic war between the states seventy six years after our constitution s ratification of that war s 2 75 million combatants there were more than 620 000 deaths almost two thirds from disease the primary catalyst for that bloody war was slavery and its extension westward the secondary reason for the war was an issue of states rights and a host of economically oppressive federal policies benefiting the more populous northern states to the detriment of the agrarian south abraham lincoln s war objective was first and foremost to preserve the union he generally advocated returning slaves to a newly created nation in africa as an example of the intricacies of lincoln s motives and the complexities of the era notably he offered robert e lee command of the union forces at the war s outset but lee declined writing that his first allegiance was to his home state of virginia i look upon secession as anarchy if i owned the four millions of slaves in the south i would sacrifice them all to the union but how can i draw my sword upon virginia my native state by late 1862 it was apparent to lincoln that the preservation of the union could not be achieved without the emancipation of slaves despite resistance from his free white labor constituents in the north who did not want competition from an influx of black laborers from the south lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation in 1863 full emancipation was ultimately codified in 1865 with the ratification of the thirteenth amendment the securing of additional rights by the fourteenth amendment and the right to vote by the fifteenth amendment but it would take the 1964 civil rights act to establish uniform legal racial parity for black americans rule of law they define a republic to be a government of laws and not of men john adams article vi of our constitution proclaims this constitution shall be the supreme law of the land on rule of law thomas jefferson noted we lay it down as a fundamental that laws to be just must give a reciprocation of right that without this they are mere arbitrary rules of conduct founded in force and not in conscience benjamin rush wrote accordingly where there is no law there is no liberty and nothing deserves the name of law but that which is certain and universal in its operation upon all the members of the community for its first 150 years with a few exceptions our constitution and the rule of law it enshrines stood mostly as our founders and the people intended as is in accordance with its original intent in other words it was interpreted exegetically as textually constructed rather than eisegetically as a so called living constitution that could be continually reinterpreted by jurists to comport with the agendas of later generations of politicians incrementally and most rapidly in recent decades constitutional rule of law has been diluted and degraded by the actions of those in the executive legislative and judicial branches most notably the latter and at great hazard to the future of liberty indeed james madison s warning was prescient there are more instances of the abridgment of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations thomas jefferson counseled repeatedly that the greatest threat to rule of law and constitutional limitations on central government was an unbridled judiciary the original error establishing a judiciary independent of the nation and which from the citadel of the law can turn its guns on those they were meant to defend and control and fashion their proceedings to its own will the opinion which gives to the judges the right to decide what laws are constitutional and what not not only for themselves in their own sphere of action but for the legislature and executive also in their spheres would make the judiciary a despotic branch jefferson clearly understood that should our constitution ever become a malleable document for a politicized and despotic judiciary to misinterpret according to executive and legislative special interests rule of law would gradually yield to the rule of men the historical terminus of the latter being inevitably and irrevocably tyranny to avoid political corruption our framers did not subject judges to election they assumed judges would remain above such influences and stay true to rule of law thus protecting our constitution from avarice and populist adulteration our founders and early members of the judiciary were men of character who were deeply devoted to liberty and rule of law jefferson predicted that many in the executive and legislative branches would eventually abandon their sacred oaths to support and defend our constitution likewise the ideologically appointed judiciary has suffered a similar fate of oath corruption that exploitation of the bench is difficult to correct since judges are protected from electoral eviction it may be argued that all three branches of government have devolved into various degrees of despotic branches regarding the process of amendment prescribed by our constitution george washington wrote if in the opinion of the people the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the constitution designates but let there be no change by usurpation for though this in one instance may be the instrument of good it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed alexander hamilton concurred writing a sacred respect for the constitutional law is the vital principle the sustaining energy of a free government he declared the present constitution is the standard to which we are to cling under its banners bona fide must we combat our political foes rejecting all changes but through the channel itself provides for amendments on the subject of constitutional interpretation jefferson wrote the constitution on which our union rests shall be administered according to the safe and honest meaning contemplated by the plain understanding of the people of the united states at the time of its adoption a meaning to be found in the explanations of those who advocated it on every question of construction carry ourselves back to the time when the constitution was adopted recollect the spirit manifested in the debates and instead of trying what meaning may be squeezed out of the text or invented against it conform to the probable one in which it was passed jefferson concluded our peculiar security is in the possession of a written constitution let us not make it a blank paper by construction james madison agreed i entirely concur in the propriety of resorting to the sense in which the constitution was accepted and ratified by the nation in that sense alone it is the legitimate constitution and if that is not the guide in expounding it there may be no security for a consistent and stable more than for a faithful exercise of its powers madison added as the courts are generally the last in making the decision it results to them by refusing or not refusing to execute a law to stamp it with its final character this makes the judiciary department paramount in fact to the legislature which was never intended and can never be proper justice james wilson stated the first and governing maxim in the interpretation of a statute is to discover the meaning of those who made it the federalist papers clearly delineate constitutional interpretation in federalist no 78 hamilton wrote may truly be said to have neither force nor will but merely judgment liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone but would have everything to fear from its union with either of the other departments in federalist no 81 hamilton declared there is not a syllable in the which directly empowers the national courts to construe the laws according to the spirit of the constitution the constitution ought to be the standard of construction for the laws and that wherever there is an evident opposition the laws ought to give place to the constitution and yet this nonexistent spirit is the errant basis for today s living constitution enabling amendment by judicial diktat rather than its prescribed method in article v shortly before his death jefferson wrote at the establishment of our constitutions the judiciary bodies were supposed to be the most helpless and harmless members of the government experience however soon showed in what way they were to become the most dangerous that the insufficiency of the means provided for their removal gave them a freehold and irresponsibility in office that their decisions seeming to concern individual suitors only pass silent and unheeded by the public at large that these decisions nevertheless become law by precedent sapping by little and little the foundations of the constitution and working its change by construction before any one has perceived that that invisible and helpless worm has been busily employed in consuming its substance in truth man is not made to be trusted for life if secured against all liability to account to this end national courts have done great damage to our constitution s original form and intent errantly regressively and perilously eroding rule of law and progressively replacing it with the rule of men the federal judiciary has indeed become the despotic branch of which jefferson forewarned rule of men the basis of our political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of government but the constitution which at any time exists until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people is sacredly obligatory upon all george washington the first significant instance of constitutional interpretation by the federal judiciary was the 1803 case of marbury v madison the supreme court under chief justice john marshall denied a plaintiff s claim because it relied on the judiciary act of 1789 which the court ruled unconstitutional since that ruling the marbury precedent has been used by judicial activists to violate the limits of judicial power outlined in article iii of our constitution it has thus eroded rule of law and created a mounting constitutional crisis prior to woodrow wilson s progressive presidency and then franklin roosevelt s further expansion of central government power with his new deal social welfare programs the courts were still largely populated with originalists that is those who properly rendered legal interpretation based on the constitution s original intent because of this roosevelt was often at odds with the courts so determined was fdr to overstep the constitutional limits on the executive branch that in 1937 he covertly conceived a plan to increase the number of justices on the supreme court from nine to fifteen with the expectation that his six newly minted appointees would give him a favorably predisposed activist majority it s no coincidence that the term living constitution was coined that same year roosevelt s effort to pack the courts went down to resounding bipartisan defeat but during his unprecedented three terms in office he died 82 days into his fourth term he appointed eight supreme court justices their activist rulings consistently allowed him to enact his statist new deal policies greatly expanding the power and scope of the central government in effect roosevelt successfully converted the judicial branch from one of independent review according to rule of law into one of subservience according to the rule of men fortunately in 1951 the twenty second amendment was ratified setting a two term limit on the presidency but the constitutional damage done by fdr s imperial dynasty remains in its prescription for separating the judiciary from the executive branch federalist no 73 notes judges by being often associated with the executive might be induced to embark too far in the political views of that magistrate and thus a dangerous combination might by degrees be cemented between the executive and judiciary departments it is impossible to keep the judges too distinct from every other avocation than that of expounding the laws it is peculiarly dangerous to place them in a situation to be either corrupted or influenced by the executive by the mid twentieth century executives and legislatures advocating for central government power had all but co opted the judiciary and those who favored judicial despotism have been devitalizing rule of law ever since in the decades that followed fdr s reign the notion of a living constitution that is subject to contemporaneous judicial interpretation molded by political agendas infested many federal court jurisdictions with increasing frequency judicial activists legislating from the bench were nominated and confirmed to the supreme court by like minded politicians this degradation in rule of law was codified by chief justice earl warren s court in trop v dulles 1958 in that ruling the high court noted that the constitution should comport with evolving standards that mark the progress of a maturing society in other words the warren court believed that the constitution should be a fully pliable document as thomas jefferson had forewarned a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary which they may twist and shape into any form they please since then activist judges have not only undermined the plain language of our constitution but have also done equal injury to the bill of rights by the 1980s the adulteration of our constitution by its supreme court arbiters was so commonplace that justice thurgood marshall would frequently deliver his lecture titled the constitution a living document he thus defended constitutional interpretation based on contemporaneous moral political and cultural circumstances more recently the late justice antonin scalia wrote the argument of flexibility and it goes something like this the constitution is over 200 years old and societies change it has to change with society like a living organism or it will become brittle and break but you would have to be an idiot to believe that the constitution is not a living organism it is a legal document it says some things and doesn t say other things justice clarence thomas followed there are really only two ways to interpret the constitution try to discern as best we can what the framers intended or make it up no matter how ingenious imaginative or artfully put unless interpretive methodologies are tied to the original intent of the framers they have no basis in the constitution to be sure even the most conscientious effort to adhere to the original intent of the framers of our constitution is flawed as all methodologies and human institutions are but at least originalism has the advantage of being legitimate and i might add impartial on the political consequences of a living constitution justice scalia concluded plainly if you think aficionados of a living constitution want to bring you flexibility think again as long as judges tinker with the constitution to do what the people want instead of what the document actually commands politicians who pick and confirm new federal judges will naturally want only those who agree with them politically indeed as thomas jefferson wrote in questions of power then let no more be heard of confidence in man but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the constitution a wall of separation congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances article one bill of rights among the most egregious examples of judicial activism undermining our constitution are the many flawed rulings rendered in regard to article one the first amendment of the bill of rights particularly to its assurance of religious freedom once again in plain language the first amendment stipulates congress shall make no law but activist courts have ruled that this clear prohibition on congress applies to virtually every public forum from public schools and sporting events to public squares there is no more ominous assault on our constitution no more serious threat to the liberty endowed by creator than the grossly errant notion that any vestige of religious expression must be eradicated from all levels of government and by extension anything funded by government federal state or local to the extent that knowledge of our creator at one time prevalent in every educational institution can be eradicated from public discourse then the most critical historic foundational principle that the inherent right to liberty is endowed by our creator will be undermined consequently the rule of law necessary to sustain liberty will be subordinated to the rule of men and liberty lost the foundational assertion that liberty is not endowed by the state is antithetical to ideological leftists claim that they should be the licensing arbiters of all freedoms and that they should be empowered to determine how and to whom freedom will equitably apply again the root of all debate between liberty and tyranny is the contest to determine who endows liberty is liberty the inherent right of all people or is it selectively awarded by presidents legislatures and judges only to those they deem worthy the importance of this foundational question cannot be overemphasized nor can the threat to liberty posed by those who would ignore it further our founders intent with the first amendment was that the central government would not favor one religious denomination over others by act of congress thus specifying congress shall make no law thomas jefferson referenced that prohibition when noting the constitution built a wall of separation between church and state and nothing more but for decades judicial activists have interpreted the first amendment s establishment clause to suit their political agendas placing severe constraints on the free exercise of religion by invoking jefferson s once obscure but now wholly misrepresented wall of separation metaphor advocates of the living constitution are intent on removing faith from every public quarter erroneously citing jefferson s 1802 letter to the danbury baptists association in connecticut at that time jefferson rightly supported the disestablishment of the anglican church as the official religion in virginia baptists hoped he would similarly affirm the disestablishment of the congregational church in connecticut moreover baptists feared the national government would declare anglicanism the national church much as the crown recognized the church of england as its official church recognition of state backed religions led to discrimination against those who were not adherents of the official church responding to the baptists about their concerns jefferson wrote i contemplate with solemn reverence that act of the whole american people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof thus building a wall of separation between church and state i reciprocate your kind prayers for the protection and blessing of the common father and creator of man two days after writing that letter jefferson attended religious services in the house of representatives jefferson s letter reaffirmed the bill of rights barrier between federal and state governments as well as the prohibition against congress making any law respecting an establishment of religion his separation language most certainly did not create a prohibition against faith expression in public venues yet those are the limitations under modern federal judiciary interpretations the intended consequence of the contemporary artificial barrier between church and state is to remove references to our creator from all public forums particularly government educational institutions the objective of such secularization is over time the cultural erosion of the understanding of the eternal assurance that liberty and other fundamental rights of all people are unalienable unalterable recall that jefferson also proclaimed the god who gave us life gave us liberty at the same time can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of god that they are not to be violated but with his wrath indeed i tremble for my country when i reflect that god is just that his justice cannot sleep for ever indeed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness are the natural rights of man they are gifts endowed by our creator not government and yet so called progressive politicians and judicial activists would have us believe otherwise it was with firm regard for the rights of mankind that our constitution was written and ratified in order to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity as such it established a constitutional republic whose foundation was law based on natural rights not rights allocated by governments or by those in positions of power our political way of life john quincy adams wrote is by the laws of nature and of nature s god and of course presupposes the existence of god the moral ruler of the universe and a rule of right and wrong of just and unjust binding upon man preceding all institutions of human society and government george mason declared the laws of nature are the laws of god whose authority can be superseded by no power on earth the conviction that our rights are innately bestowed by the laws of nature and of nature s god is enumerated in the constitutional preambles of every state in our union george washington wrote in his 1796 farewell address let it simply be asked where is the security for property for reputation for life if the sense of religious obligation deserts the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in the courts of justice and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle john adams also asserted our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other samuel adams wrote religion and good morals are the only solid foundation of public liberty and happiness noted supreme court jurists have challenged the modern error of the wall of separation interpretations justice william o douglas an fdr nominee who served for 36 years wrote in the majority decision of the 1952 case of zorach v clauson the first amendment does not say that in every and all respects there shall be a separation of church and state otherwise the state and religion would be aliens to each other hostile suspicious and even unfriendly we are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a supreme being when the state encourages religious instruction it follows the best of our traditions douglas concluded to hold that it may not would be to find in the constitution a requirement that the government show a callous indifference to religious groups we find no constitutional requirement which makes it necessary for government to be hostile to religion and to throw its weight against efforts to widen the effective scope of religious influence we cannot read into the bill of rights such a philosophy of hostility to religion chief justice warren e burger cited the zorach v clauson opinion in lynch v donnelly 1984 the concept of a wall of separation between church and state is a useful metaphor but is not an accurate description of the practical aspects of the relationship that in fact exists the constitution does not require complete separation of church and state it affirmatively mandates accommodation not merely tolerance of all religions and forbids hostility toward any anything less would require the callous indifference that was never intended by the establishment clause he added indeed we have observed such hostility would bring us into war with our national tradition as embodied in the first amendment s guaranty of the free exercise of religion and finally as the late supreme court chief justice william rehnquist declared the wall of separation between church and state is a metaphor based on bad history a metaphor which has proved useless as a guide to judging it should be frankly and explicitly abandoned it is impossible to build sound constitutional doctrine upon a mistaken understanding of constitutional history the establishment clause had been expressly freighted with jefferson s misleading metaphor for nearly forty years there is simply no historical foundation for the proposition that the framers intended to build a wall of separation the recent court decisions are in no way based on either the language or intent of the framers but the greatest injury of the wall notion is its mischievous diversion of judges from the actual intentions of the drafters of the bill of rights the palladium of the liberties of a republic a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed article two bill of rights article two the second amendment of our bill of rights was written as a proscription against government intrusion on and usurpation of the natural rights of man because the right of the people to keep and bear arms is the most formidable line of defense against government intrusion on those rights indeed this inherent right is the first civil right the fundamental guarantor of all others as affirmed by our founders as previously noted the first shots of the eight year struggle for american independence fired at lexington and concord were in response to the british government s attempt to disarm the people it was understood then as now that the inherent right to self defense was irrevocable unalterable and not to be infringed it was and remains the most fundamental of the unalterable rights of man the rights of all people after the conclusion of the revolutionary war during the 1788 massachusetts convention debates for ratification of the u s constitution samuel adams proclaimed the said constitution shall never be construed to prevent the people of the united states who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms other states provided similar assurances in their constitutions based on common law james madison in his first bill of rights draft proposed what would become the second amendment this was a concession to the anti federalists who insisted on the enumeration of these specific liberties in the constitution much to the objection of the federalists who believed this might imply to future generations that those inherent rights were subject to amendment or alteration given the preeminent status of the second amendment and the growing contemporary chorus of calls to amend or fully repeal it we should be clear that our founders never intended this inherent right to be infringed as noted previously typical of those objections was this from alexander hamilton in federalist no 84 bills of rights in the sense and in the extent in which they are contended for are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution but would even be dangerous for why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do we should be equally clear about what our founders intended to convey with each clause of the second amendment as affirmed by noted linguists a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state and the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed the reference to a well regulated militia has been a subject of some dispute do these words refer to a standing army as some today errantly assert a national body of armed forces necessary for the safety and security of the nation clearly our founders objected to standing armies and viewed them as a potential threat to citizens under an oppressive regime while the militia reference is not to a standing army it is clear that our founders had a uniform concern for such military bodies at the constitutional convention madison said a standing military force with an overgrown executive will not long be safe companions to liberty the means of defense against foreign danger have been always the instruments of tyranny at home in madison s federalist no 46 he declared that the constitution should be ratified despite fears of a standing army because americans are armed and because they are also organized into state militias not controlled by the proposed federal government according to madison besides the advantage of being armed which the americans possess over the people of almost every other nation the existence of subordinate governments to which the people are attached and by which the militia officers are appointed forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of madison also observed prophetically as it turns out that european governments are afraid to trust the people with arms i say prophetically because the inability of europeans to defend themselves against the tyrannical socialist dictatorships of adolf hitler benito mussolini and joseph stalin resulted in the deaths of more than thirty five million european civilians more specifically as noah webster wrote in 1787 before a standing army can rule the people must be disarmed as they are in almost every kingdom in europe the supreme power in america cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be on any pretense raised in the united states a military force at the command of congress can execute no laws but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional for they will possess the power and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive a people can never be deprived of their liberties webster insisted while they retain in their own hands a power sufficient to any other power in the state despite this fundamental truth there exists a cynical and malicious argument for undermining the second amendment this argument is made by historical revisionists who insist that because a well regulated militia refers to a state militia or guard it only authorizes the people to keep and bear arms in their capacity as members of such militias the second amendment however has two clauses just as it has two purposes the first affirms the advantage of a well regulated militia the second affirms the right of the people to keep and bear arms thus the second does not limit or restrict to keep and bear arms to only militias but rather affirms the right of the people to do so in the context of the debates about the bill of rights critics of the proposed constitution believed that both the establishment of militias and the individual right to keep and bear arms were vital to the future of liberty thus the second amendment affirms those two rights much as the first amendment affirms five rights pertaining to religion speech press assembly and petition of the government moreover in the context at the time of the framing well regulated meant orderly much as it did in common references to well regulated government and well regulated families it was also generally understood that militia was a reference to the whole body of the people though state militias were generally limited to able bodied men george mason whose virginia bill of rights was the inspiration for our constitution s bill of rights noted in the ratification debates i ask sir what is the militia it is the whole people he noted as well to disarm the people is the best and most effectual way to enslave them virginia statesman richard henry lee wrote to preserve liberty it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms and be taught alike especially when young how to use them likewise during the ratification debates patrick henry declared the great object is that every man be armed everyone who is able may have a gun are we at last brought to such humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our defense our founders agreed and articulated repeatedly that the inherent right of the people to keep and bear arms was the most dependable assurance of preserving liberty in his magisterial commentaries on the constitution 1833 justice joseph story appointed to the supreme court by james madison affirmed the preeminence of the second amendment the right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered as the palladium of the liberties of a republic since it offers a strong moral check against usurpation and arbitrary power of the rulers and will generally even if these are successful in the first instance enable the people to resist and triumph over them jefferson asked rhetorically what country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance let them take arms alexander hamilton observed if the representatives of the people betray their constituents there is then no recourse left but in the exertion of that original right of self defense which is paramount to all positive forms of government he added little more can reasonably be aimed at with respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped historically there have been no successful attempts to abolish the second amendment s assurance of the innate rights of the people to defend their liberty but there are now perilous threats to that assurance that is precisely why in the debates over ratification of the bill of rights as previously noted many of our founders expressed concern that the enumeration of such rights might imply to future generations that such rights were subject to alteration that notwithstanding our second amendment rights have most certainly been subject to much alteration by malicious judicial misinterpretation make no mistake statists in the executive legislative and judicial branches who favor a centralized socialist government endeavor wherever possible to enfeeble and erode the second amendment in doing so they move ever closer to their ultimate objective and that of their uninformed constituents disarming the american people and demoting our constitutional standing from that of citizens to our ancestors standing as subjects the powers not delegated the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people article ten bill of rights the federal government has over the years routinely violated this article ten the tenth amendment by wielding all manner of legislative and regulatory powers powers that should be according to rule of law reserved to the states respectively or to the people equally injurious to our constitution is the manner in which the assurance of states rights outlined in the tenth amendment has been eroded by legislative malfeasance and judicial diktat in federalist no 39 james madison expounded on the covenantal nature of the states would be federal arrangement voluntarily bound by mutual obligation each state he wrote in ratifying the constitution is considered as a sovereign body independent of all others and only to be bound by its own voluntary act in this relation then the new constitution will if established be a federal and not a national constitution in federalist no 45 madison highlighted the definite limits placed upon power in such a federal structure the powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal government are few and defined those which are to remain in the state governments are numerous and indefinite to help ensure that the central government would not overstep its constitutional authority madison wrote in federalist no 46 ambitious encroachments of the federal government on the authority of the state governments would not excite the opposition of a single state or of a few states only they would be signals of general alarm but what degree of madness could ever drive the federal government to such an extremity but by 1792 madison foresaw the potential for abuse and he protested loudly against the prospect of the new government s urge to redistribute the wealth of its citizens for purposes other than those expressly authorized by our constitution if congress can do whatever in their discretion can be done by money and will promote the general welfare the government is no longer a limited one possessing enumerated powers but an indefinite one subject to particular exceptions similarly thomas jefferson wrote giving a distinct and independent power to do any act they please which may be good for the union would render all the preceding and subsequent enumerations of power completely useless it would reduce the whole to a single phrase that of instituting a congress with power to do whatever would be for the good of the united states and as sole judges of the good or evil it would be also a power to do whatever evil they please certainly no such universal power was meant to be given them was intended to lace them up straightly within the enumerated powers and those without which as means these powers could not be carried into effect in his remarkable wisdom jefferson also warned that the legislature and courts should not enact laws so complex and convoluted as to conceal their meaning and implications from those for whom they were ostensibly created laws are made for men of ordinary understanding and should therefore be construed by the ordinary rules of common sense their meaning is not to be sought for in metaphysical subtleties which may make anything mean everything or nothing at pleasure unfortunately the law today is barely comprehensible in its scope even to those who legislate and interpret it and this has dire implications for the federalist system of government established by our constitution a republic if you can keep it our new constitution is now established and has an appearance that promises permanency but in this world nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes benjamin franklin as our founders debated the language of our constitution ben franklin wrote i have so much faith in the general government of the world by providence that i can hardly conceive a transaction of such momentous importance to the welfare of millions now existing and to exist in the posterity of a great nation should be suffered to pass without being in some degree influenced guided and governed by that omnipotent omnipresent beneficent ruler in whom all inferior spirits live and move and have their being at the close of the constitutional convention in philadelphia a citizen asked franklin if the delegates had formed a republic or a monarchy a republic he responded famously if you can keep it and the key to keeping that republic is in the genius of how our constitution was written the republican principles it outlined those principles were and remain based on axiomatic and eternal truths to that end as a warning for future generations to beware of cunning ambitious and unprincipled men george washington wrote of those predisposed to tread on the rights of the people a just estimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which predominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the truth of this position daniel webster noted good intentions will always be pleaded for every assumption of authority it is hardly too strong to say that the constitution was made to guard the people against the dangers of good intentions there are men in all ages who mean to govern well but they mean to govern they promise to be good masters but they mean to be masters or as alexander hamilton put it of those men who have overturned the liberties of republics the greatest number have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people commencing demagogues and ending tyrants john adams observed is the present state of the nation republican enough is virtue the principle of our government is honor or is ambition and avarice adulation baseness covetousness the thirst of riches indifference concerning the means of rising and enriching the contempt of principle the spirit of party and of faction the motive and the principle that governs on the necessity of wisdom and reason thomas jefferson wrote man once surrendering his reason has no remaining guard against absurdities the most monstrous and like a ship without rudder is the sport of every wind with such persons gullibility takes the helm from the hand of reason and the mind becomes a wreck john adams warned of dire consequences should such wisdom and reason fail to sustain the liberty enshrined in our constitution a constitution of government once changed from freedom can never be restored liberty once lost is lost forever unfortunately and at the expense of liberty the constitution has suffered under generations of cunning ambitious and unprincipled politicians and judges whose successors now recognize only vestiges of its original intent today constitutional rule of law has been enfeebled by those who have failed to abide by their sacred oaths to support and defend the same as the erosion of constitutional authority undermines individual liberty it likewise undermines economic liberty and the primary instruments of that erosion are taxation and regulation our founders were clearly concerned about the government s power to impose and collect taxes most notably the direct taxation of income accordingly they enumerated specific limitations on taxing and spending james madison addressed the issue of unlimited spending and warned that the misconstruction of the power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united states amounts to an unlimited commission to exercise every power which may be alleged to be necessary for the common defense or general welfare as chief justice john marshall wrote in mcculloch v maryland 1819 an unlimited power to tax involves necessarily a power to destroy because there is a limit beyond which no institution and no property can bear taxation to ensure that federal taxation would be limited to these constraints article i section 8 of our constitution the taxing and spending clause as duly ratified in 1789 defined taxes duties imposts and excises but section 8 required that such shall be uniform throughout the united states this in effect limited the power of congress to impose direct taxes on individuals as further outlined in section 9 no capitation or other direct tax shall be laid unless in proportion to the census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken that constitutional limitation survived until 1861 when the first income tax was imposed to defray union costs during the war between the states that three percent tax on incomes over 800 about 15 000 in 2020 dollars was sold as an emergency war measure in 1894 congressional democrats tested the constitution again passing a peacetime tax of two percent on income above 4 000 about 140 000 in 2020 dollars a year later the supreme court overturned that tariff as not complying with the limitations set forth in article 1 that eventually resulted in the most devastating blow to economic liberty dealt by the father of american socialism woodrow wilson he was elected in large part due to his mastery of the classist rhetoric outlined by karl marx s nineteenth century communist manifesto wilson used that rhetoric to gain rapid passage of the sixteenth amendment in 1913 which specified the congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes from whatever source derived without apportionment among the several states and without regard to any census or enumeration from whatever source derived indeed the top tax rate levied under the new amendment was seven percent on incomes above 500 000 about 15 000 000 in 2020 dollars but today almost every individual with an income of 25 000 or more less than 1 000 in 1914 dollars is taxed if wilson had attempted to impose his tax on incomes of 1 000 a second american revolution surely would have commenced but like most assaults on liberty the levied income tax has avoided insurrection by incremental application targeting primarily the wealthy over the past century but with deeper economic implications for much broader groups of income earners wilson s sixteenth amendment has been used to enact unequal and discriminatory taxation of targeted groups of income classes progressive taxation as it is known the resulting classism is the bulwark of all socialist movements the class warfare agenda opened the floodgates for populist executives and legislators to enact taxes for expenditures not expressly authorized by our constitution and thus signaled the end of constitutionally limited government with its resulting unlimited empowerment of the rule of men notably however the construction of the sixteenth amendment notwithstanding article i section 9 of our constitution assures that no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed as these would allow the targeting of individuals or minority groups for undue punishment thus it should be argued that targeting certain classes of income earners constitutes a bill of attainder which should disqualify all but the even distribution of taxation by way of a flat tax across the board beyond wilson however the most reckless of the twentieth century s class warfare provocateurs was franklin d roosevelt who was ironically an aristocrat at the onset of the great depression he instituted a plethora of policies that further challenged constitutional limits on our government the cost of which now threatens our nation s economic solvency fdr s economic and social solutions were shaped by his upbringing as a wealthy inheritance welfare liberal those raised dependent on inheritance handouts rather than government
in the northern argentine province of jujuy at a dizzying 4 000 metres above sea level redand blue banners inscr ibed w ith chinese characters flap outside a temporary office perched on a barren desert this is cauchari the site of latin america s largest solar plant chinese technology and finance have enabled the project which is part of argentina s plan to boost renewable energy generation with argentina struggling to attract foreign investment for infrastructure over the past decade it has increasingly turned to china and cauchari reflects the two countries close cooperation chinese banks and companies have developed coal fired power plants worldwide now they are making the foray into cross border solar energy development but are projects such as cauchari exceptional or a sign of a broader shift towards china developing clean energ y overseas harnessing the desert sun cauchari is a remote site 300 kilometres from san salvador jujuy s capital when finished it will consist of 1 2 million solar panels and provide the grid with 300 megawatts of power eventually expanding to produce 500 megawatts making it one of the largest solar plants in the world cauchari is in the area with the best solar radiation of the world we also have good weather conditions and low smog both good for the project said guillermo giralt technical director of cauchari solar one of the companies involved in the project the export import bank of china china exim is financing 85 percent of the project s us 390 million total cost the local government will provide the remainder through a green bond provincial energy company jemse owns and manages the plant which is being built by shanghai electric power construction sepc a subsidiary of the construction group powerchina a chinese firm talesun is also supplying the solar panels the government has agreed to provide indigenous communities who own the land where cauchari is located with two percent of its annual profits this share could equate to up to us 1 million community members have also received training and a range of job opportunities at the site ranging from catering to transportation our initial condition for the project was for it to have local workers in order to achieve that we trained 600 people from nearby towns and then hired them said mario pizarro jujuy s energy secretary the project will likely be finished by may and have a lifespan of 25 years argentina s clean energy drive the cauchari solar plant is expected to cut both energy costs and carbon dioxide emissions the latter by some 325 000 tonnes it is one of the largest projects awarded through the renovar energy auction which approved 147 projects with a combined installed capacity of 4 466 megawatts cauchari represents the success of the renovar scheme and shows the potential of renewables in argentina we have great green resources with a lot of potential that are starting to come to light said congressman juan carlos villalonga who is head of the los verdes green party the government has set a target for renewables to account for 20 percent of the entire energy matrix by 2025 they now account for about four percent however the renewables push runs in parallel to the promotion of hydrocarbon extraction through dozens of shale gas and oil projects in the southern region of patagonia argentina has a huge potential to generate wind power in patagonia and solar in the north resources exist for biogas and biomass in provinces with sizeable agricultural industries despite this potential argentina lags behind its latin american neighbours chilean energy watchdog the national electric coordinator cen estimates that solar will account for nearly 10 percent of the energy mix this year while wind could hit just over six percent meanwhile uruguay has been consistently growing its share of wind and solar which accounted for over 44 percent of its electricity generation in some months last year china s growing presence in argentina argentina enjoys a strategic integral alliance with china a high diplomatic status that the latter confers on only a handful of countries former president cristina fernández de kirchner elevated the level of cooperation by signing dozens of treaties with china many of them controversial in the last decade chinese products went from accounting for 5 percent to 20 percent of argentina s imports argentina s exports to china did not grow at the same rate increasing from just 8 percent to around 12 percent today this has led to a record trade deficit of more than us 5 billion between the two countries alongside investing in several infrastructure projects such as dams and railways china has played a key role in the renovar scheme in the first round of bidding half the winning wind energy projects and three quarters of solar were linked to chinese capital and technology according to carlos saint james former head of argentina s renewable energies chamber cader the use of chinese technology in argentine energy projects has generated concerns among national industry associations who fear the incentives offered to foreign companies through programmes such as renovar inhibit the use of their own technology according to wholesale power administrator cammesa argentine technology accounted for scarcely 10 percent of the total used in wind energy projects auctioned through renovar s first two rounds in the nuclear sector president mauricio macri met with chinese counterpart xi jinping in december amid expectations the two would approve plants with chinese finance and reactors this despite argentina s advanced nuclear industry the project stalled after a group of former environment ministers wrote to the government questioning its economic wisdom chinese banks and companies eye solar the cauchari plant is part of a nascent but growing trend of chinese financiers and companies striking out in the cross border solar market since 2010 china exim and china development bank cdb along with a handful of companies have pursued solar projects globally cdb and exim are stateowned policy banks tasked w i t h s u p p o r t i n g t h e government s domestic and overseas development agenda this includes promoting industrial upgrading and building an overseas market for chinese companies to date the banks have financed a number of large scale solar projects in developed countries and countries closely integrated with the belt and road infrastructure initiative including pakistan in 2015 a world resources institute wri and boston university study found that solar lending made up only 5 6 percent of china s major commercial and policy banks power generation and transmission portfolio from 2014 to 2017 however for the two policy banks that is up from practically zero investment prior to 2010 chinese companies have also started to invest in solar projects abroad both in greenfield development and through mergers and acquisitions similar to the banks solar only constituted four percent of companies overseas investments from 2000 to 2017 according to a princeton and boston university study however they started to pick up as of 2012 some of these renewable energy companies have been supported by the same large banks which have given them significant lines of credit policies pave the way a longside argentina s strong relationship with china cauchari likely appealed to china exim due to the renovar scheme according to the princeton and boston university study investment in renewable energy projects by chinese companies is concentrated in mature markets with strong renewable energy policies such as the uk australia brazil and india building on china s domestic solar boom chinese banks and companies are well equipped to serve these markets for banks the policy environment can also have a strong influence on a project s feasibility last year the china led asian infrastructure investment bank made its first solar energy investment in a large solar park in egypt maría del carmen de castro ovejero a senior investment operations specialist and the bank s team leader for the egypt project said that the country s policy support for renewable energy enabled the project and the bank s participation from my point of view as an engineer technically everything is possible but if you don t have the support of the government nothing will happen she said like argentina egypt has established a feed in tariff guaranteeing developers a minimum price for the solar power they sell back to the grid bloomberg new energy finance found that building wind and solar photovoltaic plants is already less expensive than building large scale gas and coal plants however policies like egypt s and argentina s help the new energy industries break into the market and secure financing barriers remain as renewable energy continues to become cheaper will projects such as cauchari replace china s conventional energy inves tments overseas in developing countries technical issues continue to pose challenges for large scale solar development according to de castro ovejero solar plants are technically simple and quick to develop but integrating plants into the grid can be difficult solar is normally developed in very remote locations so it is important that the grid connection is available in order to finance these projects grid stability is another issue especially in developing countries she said clearer renewable energy policies are also needed to drive chinese investment the wri and boston university study found that only 31 out of 56 countries analysed had concrete renewable energy targets in their paris agreement national climate plans even with targets developing countries can lack the capacity to design and implement specific policies laurel ostfield head of communications and development for the aiib said that the bank has a special fund that can help countries fill that gap fossil fuel inertia while chinese banks and companies are making inroads in solar development globally their overall energy investment portfolios remain heavily skewed toward fossil fuels the wri and boston university study found that between 2014 and 2017 fossil fuel investments accounted for 91 of the energy loan portfolios of the six major banks studied lihuan zhou a research analyst at wri who co authored the study said that the chinese government could send clearer signals on renewables currently there are several high level chinese documents for example issued by the state council and the ministry of ecology and environment they have very high level language on a vision for the green bri but on the more operational level there is a lack of policy or incentives for banks to provide green finance overseas meanwhile the chinese government just like the argentine is offering incentives for fossil fuel investment yuan jiahai a professor at the north china electricity and power university said china s use of policy loans equates to invisible subsidies for overseas coal projects these projects do not help these countries realise their climate goals and hurt china s interests in terms of international image and investment risk he said adding to be more constructive china should trade the invisible subsidies for clear development aid to help belt and road countries launch renewable energy business development and drive the global energy investment transformation perhaps a product of the state s investment priorities it is privately owned enterprises that are leading china s overseas solar investment while state owned enterprises remain focused on fossil fuel investment solar forecast when workers lay the final chinese panels at cauchari argentina will take a leap closer to the renewable energy leaders in the region equipped with chinese technology developed by a chinese contractor and financed by one of china s largest banks cauchari also displays china inc s potential to dominate a new industry whether china will fully embrace foreign solar markets in the near term remains unclear but xiao wang an economist at the aiib sees the future reflected in the chinese solar arrays now helping power nations from egypt to argentina the timeline might be slightly different but in roughly 10 years the cost of renewable generation plus storage per kilowatt hour will be on a par with fossil fuel or even lower so this is a clear direction to move in this story first appeared on chinadialogue net it is reproduced with kind permission from the publishers for

valley cottage ny sbwire 03 02 2019 wind energy is the power extracted from wind using wind turbines a wind turbine is a device that transforms the kinetic energy of the wind into electrical energy wind energy is a renewable form of energy that is available in ample quantity and extensively it is an alternative to fossil fuels which are depleting in quantity wind energy is the cleanest resource it has neither toxic gas emissions nor greenhouse gas emissions wind turbines are connected to the network of electricity transmission the onshore and offshore wind that is trapped is an inexpensive competitive and significant source of energy wind energy contributed to 4 of the total global electricity usage in 2013 the application of wind turbines is primarily in wind mills that are used to generate electricity these wind turbines in wind mills can be used to avail off grid electricity in the remote regions it has been known to empower rural electrification initiatives three fourths of the small wind turbines are present in the remote regions of the world and are the only sources of energy for instance wind power systems are fuelling the telecommunication towers in the secluded places between argentina and chile request for report sample another application of wind turbines is associated with the hybrids of wind and solar power generation devices wind and solar sources complement each other in changing climatic conditions wind turbines have vital applications in off grid low power systems in which the storage of batteries is avoided wind turbines also have application in cathodic protection pipes in which its electric charge neutralizes the galvanic corrosion of pipes laid in reactive soils wind turbines are used to charge electric fences yacht and boat batteries efficiently wind turbines have been used to pump water for decades and they remain a significant application in both developed and developing economies the end use industries of wind turbines can be broadly classified into industrial commercial and residential the industrial use can be further divided into power generation agriculture industrial automation engineering and telecommunication despite being commercially niche market at present wind turbines are expected to expand due to increasing government subsidies and incentive programmes on the use of wind energy the global wind industry produced about 37 000 mw in 2013 latin america in particular has provided the industry with an essential substitute growth market for wind power in 2013 latin america alone representedapproximately 45 of the installed capacity of north and south america combined it was largely driven by the wind markets of brazil and mexico which can be regarded as the dual pillars of the latin american market the average price of wind energy contracts in brazil is us 50 mwh and gives wind energy an edge over conventional fossil fuels there this is a major driver for the wind turbine market in brazil the wind power in mexico provides power to over 65 000 households and exports it to us food and beverage company nestle had invested us 60 7 million in wind energy in mexico and employed wind energy for its 85 electricity requirement the cumulative wind capacity in mexico reached 1988 mw by the end of 2013 indicating a 31 4 growth rate the installed capacity in 2013 was 76 mw in argentina 200 mw in chile 30 mw in peru 11 mw in uruguay and149 mw in venezuela strong wind resources and rising electricity prices and energy demand are driving the demand for renewable energy higher the latin american industrial policies are effective as they have tailored depreciation tax policies which enable industries to actively partner with wind energy generators for their energy usage also wind plants do not need to be in the vicinity of the end user and just need a connection to the latin american power grids feed in electricity tariffs have been introduced to motivate the use of renewable energy such as wind energy solar energy hydropower thermal energy and biomass energy this encourages investment in renewable energy as the government makes provisions for higher retail rates for electricity for the producers of new energy technologies consistently declining monopoly in the latin american electricity sector had paved way for wind turbine manufacturers the current wind turbine market is competitive gamesa is the leading turbine supplier in mexico and holds 73 5 of the market it is followed by vestas with 22 of the market contribution ge is also a major turbine manufacturer with 4 5 market share in mexico besides the collapse of the spain based oems other equipment manufacturers wind market has compelled companies to expand their business in latin america request for report table of content toc by 2015 latin america is expected to have 3 gw of installed wind capacity annually surging up to 4 3 gw by 2022 the manufacturers have to meet

in the netflix era many americans are managing their finances based on their monthly subscription payments often with little regard to the total they ll pay in the long run that paradigm benefits the automotive industry and the lenders that finance car loans as auto sales remain near record levels the average price of vehicles hit an all time high of more than 36 000 in 2018 according to kelley blue book and with interest rates rising car shoppers are now borrowing more than ever and extending their loans to record lengths new car buyers agreed to pay an average of 551 per month for 69 months in january according to car buying advice site edmunds that s nearly 10 percent more per month than three years earlier start your day smarter get usa today s daily briefing in your inbox it s a clear cut sign of how americans feel confident in a strong economy but is it sustainable car debt has risen 75 percent since the great recession in 2009 reaching an all time high of 1 2 trillion according to the u s public interest research group easy credit and longer repayment terms have coaxed many consumers into buying more car than they can really afford said ed mierzwinski u s pirg s senior director for consumer programs in an email it s even worse for those who have been subjected to deceptive and predatory lending practices at auto dealers average annual interest rates jumped from 4 68 percent in january 2017 to 4 99 percent that same month in 2018 and then to a 10 year high of 6 19 percent in january 2019 according to edmunds with new vehicle prices averaging nearly 37 000 in january according to kelley blue book monthly payments are getting out of reach for many buyers several automotive executives interviewed recently by usa today said car buyers can afford it amid a strong job market and encouraging stock gains the economy is still at a very strong level said henio arcangeli jr a leading executive in honda s u s division although interest rates are coming up which obviously can increase the purchase cost of the vehicle on a historic basis they re still at a very low level that s true auto interest rates on 4 year loans were never this low in the 1990s for example when they ranged between about 7 percent and 12 percent according to the st louis fed but car buyers could run into trouble if the economy takes a turn for the worse and their income drops especially because they re locking themselves into long term loans netflix subscriptions can be canceled car payments can t at least not without giving up the vehicle about 83 percent of americans rely on their own car or someone else s to get to work every day according to an august 2018 poll by research firm gallup more than 7 million americans are now at least three months delinquent on their auto loan payments the benchmark for many lenders to trigger a repossession according to the federal reserve bank of new york the number of these troubled borrowers is a million more than in 2010 following the global financial crisis that led to a bailout for automakers and financiers phaedra wainaina a new law school graduate in michigan who recently lost her job as a legal researcher was quickly overwhelmed by her bills including a car loan i had to make the decision between paying car notes and buying food the 26 year old single mom said she defaulted on her 2010 chevrolet equinox loan and the suv was repossessed i am considered someone who has higher education and still got behind deals dry up one reason the tab is getting more expensive is because deals are harder to find zero percent interest rate offers which were common following the great recession hit a 13 year low in january according to edmunds one big reason is the federal reserve s interest rate hikes which are aimed at curbing inflation in a strong economy but the impact on consumers is higher monthly payments the biggest surprise for me is how quickly we ve seen interest rates go up above 6 percent edmunds analyst jessica caldwell said referring to auto loans people were used to low interest rates and that s no longer the case that is kind of frightening for a lot of people one big driver of the bulkier loans is bulkier vehicles said melinda zabritski senior director of automotive financial solutions for experian automotive a decade ago the best selling segment of vehicles was affordable small cars like the ford focus sedan she said today it s entry level crossovers like the toyota rav4 and ford escape which carry starting prices of several thousand more dollars fundamentally consumers have changed what they re buying zabritski said that s part of where we re seeing these rising prices they ve changed so much that the focus in fact is gone ford is discontinuing the car along with the fusion and fiesta sedans and general motors is killing the chevrolet cruze a focus competitor along with several other car models that s because rising interest rates simply haven t stopped people from borrowing more to fuel their thirst for bigger and bigger vehicles in the suv boom which has depressed sales of cheaper and smaller passenger cars the average new car buyer borrowed 31 707 in january marking an all time high for the month according to edmunds and the most common loan term is now 72 months according to experian the good news is the average consumer has a very healthy balance sheet right now said lakhbir lamba executive vice president of retail lending at pnc but lamba noted that while pnc doesn t offer loans beyond 72 months many of the bank s competitors are offering 84 month loans or even longer in some cases there s been a lot of debate over is there stress in that asset class and i ll tell you a lot of it depends upon the financial institution and the type of consumer they re lending money to lamba said we ve seen some stress but nothing that would concern us how to avoid paying too much advisers say car buyers should consider the total amount they re paying over time but many people think more about whether they can handle the monthly payment at january s rates a 60 month loan on the average amount borrowed costs a total of 36 947 over time adding just 12 months to the loan increases the cost of the vehicle by 1 092 it feels like everything is advertised to us at a monthly rate caldwell said that s the way we ve been conditioned now another tip if you can t afford a midsize suv for example consider a midsize car the price difference between the average midsize suv and the average midsize car in january was 38 744 to 25 930 according to kelley blue book contributing detroit free press reporter frank witsil follow usa today reporter nathan bomey on twitter nathanbomey

middle classes economic future than about donald trump s tweets his indiscretions and russia those are important issues but americans want to know who is going to feel their very real pain and do something about it most don t have the time or inclination to hear about much of anything else democrats need to remember that many of the incumbents i speak with are really into investigating trump

quickly i worry that not all of my colleagues have what it takes to keep up with her but they better start working on it 2020 is going to be a good year for democrats or more precisely a bad year for republicans worse than last year was trump is going to be on the top of the ticket and failed republican policies are going to be on the top of voters minds thursday john harwood reporting for cnbc warned that voters are starting to notice that republican promises to grow the economy better than obama did was just more trump bullshit trump s economic lies all came crashing down yesterday demonstrating the hollowness of a core gop campaign theme throughout the 2016 campaign and since the president and his party have vowed to kick start tepid obama era economic growth specifically they insisted tax cuts and deregulation would return growth to its post world war ii average of 3 percent a level candidate trump said derisively that president barack obama became the first president in modern history never to reach in a single year new government data on thursday morning show that trump too has failed to reach the 3 percent promised land according to one major metric the commerce department s bureau of economic analysis measured 2018 growth at 2 9 percent matching the peak obama enjoyed in 2015 instead of annual 2018 growth the white house emphasized a different growth measure comparing growth from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018 by that measure the economy grew 3 1 percent but obama too reached 3 percent growth on a four quarter basis four different times where obama failed to enjoy 3 percent annual growth was on the bea s official annual number his 2015 peak was 2 9 percent like trump s for 2018 thursday s preliminary 2 9 percent figure could later be revised although economist mark zandi of moody s analytics said the most likely direction would be down for the rest of the president s term economic forecasters agree that number will decline 2018 will be the high water mark for growth in the trump administration zandi predicted he expects the decade old economic expansion will shrink to 1 1 percent growth in 2020 with a better than even chance of recession growth ticked up in 2017 to 2 2 percent though that rate fell below what the congressional budget office had forecast before trump s election as the president took steps toward deregulation republican allies in congress called tax cuts critical to achieving their 3 percent goal the tax cuts passed in december 2017 and when growth surged to 4 2 percent in the second quarter of 2018 the white house declared victory we re on track to reach the highest annualized growth in 13 years the president assured reporters remember when obama said you need a magic wand to make that happen donald trump jr told breitbart well abracadabra obama we re doing it in fact growth in a single quarter had topped 4 2 percent four different times during the obama administration a broad range of analysts had forecast that a deficit financed tax cut would stimulate short term boost beginning in 2018 yet even as 3rd quarter growth slowed to 3 4 percent white house advisers reiterated their confidence in july treasury secretary steve mnuchin called the u s well on the path for four to five years of sustained 3 percent growth in december top white house economist kevin hassett sounded the same note while acknowledging a slowdown in business investment we re definitely going to be at 3 or above 3 for both 2018 and 2019 he told cnbc thursday s bea data show otherwise growth kept falling in the fourth quarter to 2 6 percent the increase in business investment has continued to taper having predicted growth of substantially over 3 percent former national economic council director gary cohn has blamed trump s trade tariffs for offsetting the boost from the tax cut but the white house and its allies lacked credible evidence for their growth claim to begin with the 3 percent long term projection was always a stretch in light of the demographic headwinds harvard s greg mankiw who chaired the council of economic advisers for president bush told cnbc conomists at cbo and the federal reserve have cut their forecasts for 2019 growth to 2 3 percent for the long term both project growth below 2 percent the joe who penned this report refers to joe weisenthal market analyst and bloomberg tv host it s worth reading because he s picking up on a trend that s just beginning and will grow

billions of dollars of pre election spending by the indian government and political parties in the next two months is unlikely to stop the nation s economy from slowing further economists said asia s third largest economy lost momentum in the final quarter of 2018 as the annual rate of growth slipped to 6 6 percent much lower than expected and the slowest pace in five quarters but the worst may not be over prime minister narendra modi who will be seeking a second term in elections due to be held by may in an interim budget last month introduced populist spending measures worth rs 1 8 lakh crore 25 37 billion and modest tax cuts in the current fiscal year ending march 31 in an attempt to win the votes of farmers and the urban middle class that is on top of additional spending at state government level the political parties are also likely to spend nearly rs 50 000 crore during the election campaign according to estimates of cms a delhi based think tank but weakening global growth rising oil prices in recent weeks slowing growth in government spending on infrastructure and delays in investment decisions because of uncertainty about who will form the next government could more than offset the extra election related spending an expected deceleration in economic growth in major economies around the world including china and the united states is expected to hurt trade growth we don t expect any election spend related upside to growth for the next two quarters said soumya kanti ghosh chief economist at state bank of india the country s largest state run bank he said there was an overall slowdown in consumption and government spending on infrastructure and that this could continue until the september quarter ghosh is forecasting economic growth could decline to 6 2 percent in the january march quarter and below 6 percent in the june quarter the government has played down the risks to the economy subhash chandra garg one of the top officials in the finance ministry said the downward revision of the government s annual gdp growth estimate to 7 percent in the current financial year was at least in part due to an upward revision of gdp growth for the previous year to 7 2 percent weakening demand growth in consumer spending which accounts for nearly 60 percent of the economy slowed to 8 4 percent in the october december quarter compared with a revised 9 9 percent increase in the previous quarter policy advisers are worried that the global slowdown could hurt the manufacturing sector hitting auto engineering textile and some other labor intensive sectors a senior government official said total federal government expenditure is set to slow down after the election as the bills for the stimulus earlier in the year have to be paid creating a further drag on growth the interim budget forecasts show government spending growth slowing to 13 percent in the next fiscal year beginning april 1 from an estimated 15 percent in the current fiscal year many private economists and brokerage firms tracking other macro economic indicators have advised their clients about the risks of an economic slowdown persisting for next few quarters january data signals that the slowdown has spilled over into 2019 said radhika rao economist at dbs bank in singapore sectors that are continuing to portray weakness include auto sales likely on the back of tighter financing conditions particularly in the non banking finance sector she said also read modi govt has given far more autonomy to governors than previous govts says sanjeev sanyal
targeted news service washington march 2 sen charles grassley r iowa issued the following statement which was published in the congressional record on feb 28 on legislation s 617 to amend the internal revenue code of 1986 to extend certain expiring provisions to provide disaster tax relief mr president before the presidents day recess i announced that i would introduce legislation if the tax extenders weren t included in the legislation that we passed at that time that would keep government open today i am following through on that promise with a bill that i am introducing with finance committee ranking member senator wyden of oregon it is fitting that i am taking this step in the same month as groundhog day as the subject of my remarks is something that congress has had to deal with too many times already next to me is a depiction from the movie groundhog day which is about a man named phil who must relive the same day over and over until he gets everything right while we still need to break the cycle of repetitive short term extensions the right thing to do right now is to extend these already expired provisions for 2018 and 2019 as i have said before the tax extenders are a collection of temporary tax incentives that have required extension on a very regular basis in order to keep them available to the taxpayers currently there are 26 provisions at one time there were as many as 50 some we have done away with some of them and made some of those laws permanent but these 26 provisions expired at the end of 2017 they need to be extended as well as three others that expired at the end of last year today we are in the middle of filing season for 2018 tax returns and taxpayers affected by these expired provisions need a resolution so that they can file i want to stress that i want to find a long term resolution so that we don t have to have temporary tax policy but it is critical we make it clear to the taxpayers that these provisions are available for the 2018 filing season and extending them for this year will give us room to take a needed long term view of this temporary tax policy many of the tax extenders are intended to be incentives and to be successful then these incentives need to be in effect before decisions can be made that is why we should provide extensions for at least 2 years to maximize that incentive effect but it is also important that we extend these provisions for 2018 even though the year has obviously already ended we have developed a very bad policy and a very bad habit of extending these tax provisions year after year and people and businesses have come to expect that the extension will happen as a result decisions were made by various businesses in 2018 based upon the expectation of extension and that is a reasonable expectation because we have done it over decades in other words people did what we wanted them to do in their business decisions when these provisions were created we should not retroactively punish these businesspeople for congress s inaction today a diverse group of organizations including the national biodiesel board the american trucking associations and the national corn growers association among others sent a letter to congressional leaders requesting that the expired provisions be extended through 2019 as quickly as possible i want to quote a few sentences from that letter providing taxpayers with a predictable planning outlook as it pertains to tax rules is conducive to increased private sector investment and economic activity accordingly we respectfully ask that you act to retroactively extend these expired tax provisions through 2019 on the first appropriate legislative vehicle mr president i ask unanimous consent that the complete letter be printed in the record there being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the record as follows february 28 2019 hon nancy pelosi speaker of the u s house washington dc hon kevin mccarthy u s house republican leader washington dc hon mitch mcconnell u s senate majority leader washington dc hon charles schumer u s senate democratic leader washington dc hon richard neal chairman u s house committee on ways and means washington dc hon kevin brady ranking republican member u s house committee on ways and means washington dc hon charles grassley chairman u s senate finance committee washington dc hon ron wyden ranking democratic member u s senate finance committee washington dc dear speaker pelosi republican leader mccarthy majority leader mcconnell democratic leader schumer chairman neal ranking member brady chairman grassley and ranking member wyden the following organizations representing diverse business energy transportation real estate and agriculture sectors are writing to you regarding the pressing need to address the expired tax provisions tax extenders we respectfully ask that at a minimum the house and senate retroactively extend these provisions through 2019 promptly in order to minimize potentially severe disruptions to the recently opened tax filing season these temporary tax provisions have remained lapsed since the end of 2017 this has created confusion for the numerous industry sectors that utilize these tax incentives and has threatened thousands of jobs in the u s economy the continued uncertainty with regard to eventual congressional action on tax extenders is undermining the effectiveness of these incentives and stands as a needless barrier to additional job creation and economic growth in the private sector providing taxpayers with a predictable planning outlook as it pertains to tax rules is conducive to increased private sector investment and economic activity accordingly we respectfully ask that you act to retroactively extend these expired tax provisions through 2019 on the first appropriate legislative vehicle we sincerely appreciate your attention to this matter and stand ready to work with you to achieve this important objective sincerely advanced biofuels association advanced biofuels business council air conditioning contractors of america acca air conditioning heating and

roofing industry alliance u s canola association mr president another very important point i want to make has to do with the question about whether an extender package should be offset or not around here the word offset means if you have tax provisions that might lose revenue then do you have other revenue coming in to take its place the house has decided that is what you should do pay as you go or paygo as they might call it it is a rule of the house i have a long record of promoting budget responsibility and i am as concerned about the deficit and debt as anyone however we also have bipartisan precedent for treating the extension of temporary tax policy like these extenders just as we treat the extension of annual spending policy in neither case do we need offset for such extensions in other words it is all right to spend more money or continue to spend the same amount of money after a program has expired and you don t have to offset it when you have tax law that has been on the books for a couple of decades and it is sunset why should you have to sunset that there are a few people around here who think it is all right to spend money without offsets but it is wrong to do tax policy unless you have offsets there are a few specific items in this legislation that i want to take time to mention significant work has already been done to provide long term solutions on two extenders the short line railroad tax credit and the biodiesel tax credit the bill i am introducing extends those credits at their current levels for 2018 and 2019 i want my colleagues to know that i still remain committed to enacting the compromises that several of our colleagues and i worked with the stakeholders to achieve the bill also includes an extension of a proposal adopted last congress that would extend the 7 5 percent floor for itemized deductions of medical expenses without this provision the floor on deductions will be 10 percent for 2019 this means that without this provision individuals with chronic illnesses and high medical expenses would have to pay more for healthcare before that excess can be deducted in the expenses on their 2019 tax returns this proposal is a very important priority for one of our best colleagues senator collins she deserves a lot of credit for getting what has turned into a bipartisan proposal to help many americans facing catastrophic medical expenses finally the legislation includes provisions to assist americans who have been affected by natural disasters in 2018 this package includes proposals that we have adopted in prior years to help americans recover from natural disasters across our country for example the package would allow increased access to retirement funds and relax restrictions around charitable giving i am sure everyone here would like to help people affected by these natural disasters as soon as we are able to i don t want my comments today to imply that each tax extender should be permanently extended but the right thing to do now is to provide extensions for at least 2018 and 2019 in the long term congress needs to decide if these provisions should be allowed to expire or if they should be phased out or if they should be made permanent as current tax policy or modified in some way beyond expiring phasing out or being made permanent those decisions need to be made after we resolve the short term crisis caused by the current lapse these provisions have support of members on both sides of the aisle for people who think that things around here get done only with republicans fighting democrats or vice versa these provisions have wide bipartisan support there is a solid foundation for a long term package consisting of many of these provisions in one form or another we need to get past today so that we can chart the course for a reliable future for the tax extenders and give business some certainty just as phil wants to stop living the same day over and over again i think all of us want to break the cycle of short term extensions of in many cases very popular tax policy the legislation i introduce today with the ranking member senator wyden of oregon is a critical first step toward helping taxpayers complete their 2018 returns and helping us begin work on a long term solution to temporary tax policy i have asked our majority leader to rule xiv this bill onto the calendar and i urge the house to send us a tax bill to address the extenders without further delay just this morning i had discussions with iowa congressmen of both political parties about this issue to contact the leadership of the house and the leadership of the ways and means committee on the importance of moving legislation since the constitution doesn t allow the senate to move tax legislation in the first place

accident quarter loss pick partially offset by better reserve development and higher hurricane mitigation income the net expense ratio was 36 1 in fourth quarter 2018 down 3 9 points from 40 0 in the

alice kenny 10 february 2006 a black labrador puppy romps through a woodland clearing near the croton reservoir her yelps masked by the roaring overflow of thousands of gallons of freshly melted snow pounding down the dam s 18 story hand hewn stone wall the reservoir s underground pipes meanwhile pull water along the first lap of its gravity powered exodus from this postcard pretty upstate town to distant spigots in new york city for nearly two hundred years city residents depended on upstate communities to contribute to the largest unfiltered water system in the world the city s watershed spans nearly 2000 square miles an area roughly the size of the state of delaware with a labyrinth of 19 reservoirs and aqueducts cutting across nine counties to provide 1 2 billion gallons of drinking water daily to 9 million new yorkers having invested heavily in this delivery system new yorkers appreciated their water once considered the purest in the nation but when the federal government adopted the safe drinking water act mandating that all major surface water systems filter their water or prove they could protect the watershed producing it new yorkers also began valuing the upstate watershed from where it came a filtration plant large enough to clean the city s water supply would cost between 8 10 billion in today s dollars approximately 6 billion to build and another 250 million annually to maintain preserving the watershed conversely was estimated at 1 5 billion just over a dime invested on ecological preservation for every dollar that would have been spent on a filtration plant so in 1997 new york city embarked on a monumental plan to buy thousands of upstate acres shield its reservoirs from pollution improve treatment plants and septic systems and subsidize environmentally sound economic development its success depended on convincing historically disparate parties beleaguered farmers and inner city taxpayers federal regulators and city administrators environmentalists and economists that the plan would benefit them all offering something for nearly everyone the city s watershed plan soon became the darling of environmentalists and economists alike now with this novel scheme reaching its maturity experts are examining whether the city s ecosystem approach actually proved to be the more economic choice and with so many competing priorities many wonder also whether the watershed program has a future others can emulate from the perspective of william harding a biologist and executive director of the watershed protection and partnership council a state agency offering a forum for the varied partners the ecosystem solution could last indefinitely as long as the watershed doesn t make the same mistakes as others have believing they could adequately attenuate the affects of over development an unhappy history already the city was too late to avoid having to build a half billion dollar filtration plant to clean water from reservoirs east of the hudson river where the puppy romped although the puppy s playground appeared bucolic the water nearby was tainted from the byproducts of suburban growth failing septic systems overwhelmed wastewater treatment plants and polluted runoff that slipped from streets to reservoirs in this commuter s haven explains david warne of new york city department of environmental protection the city could not plausibly argue that it could control water quality but if it worked quickly the city could preserve the newer portion of their watershed located west of the hudson river in mostly farm land since this supplied 90 percent of city water it could avoid building the larger budget busting filtration plant striking a deal to protect this land mass however would not be easy some would say that the city had already overplayed its hand during its century long reservoir building spree the city generated enormous antipathy using the bully power of eminent domain to evict entire villages laying claim to their water sources the city took prime land from farmers closed mills and moved schools and churches from a distance this could be viewed as an historical curiosity a price to pay perhaps for a higher goal but in upstate communities where new york city s newer reservoirs displaced current residents parents grandparents uncles and aunts the anger remains raw our shared history is not a happy one says alan rosa who represented upstate watershed residents during negotiations leading to the 1997 watershed agreement he now directs the catskill watershed corporation the agency that implements the agreement s regional environmental protection and economic development programs with eminent domain a continuing threat and industry sparse rosa grew up in a region whose main streets were dominated by boarded up buildings and aging for sale signs to keep the region from following the path of its neighbors across the river the city would have to win over wary upstate residents using diplomacy and cash instead of the single hammer of eminent domain while clearly more land adjoining reservoirs had to be purchased communities also had to be convinced to change their zoning to minimize population growth and provide run off protection measures farmers had to be cajoled into altering pastures so that animal dung did not flow straight into reservoirs waste water treatment plants had to be upgraded and septic systems needed fixing finally after seven years of tense negotiations documented in a file stretching a foot wide the city brokered a deal with the disparate stakeholders to preserve and enhance the upstate watershed ecosystem services parable or reality overcoming upstate objections was the city s first hurdle next they had to convince naysayers that the city s watershed plan a groundbreaking effort in the new concept of ecosystem services or letting the environment do the work was based on concrete accounting some still argue that these services particularly as they relate to the city watershed have limited value mark sagoff acting director of the institute for philosophy and public policy at the university of maryland disparagingly labeled the idea of a market for ecosystems services the catskills parable after the region housing the watershed reached by phone at his maryland office sagoff expounded on his perspective discussed in an article he wrote for politics and life sciences magazine and excerpted last june in perc magazine sagoff argues in essence that the city s watershed did not need protection because it was never actually threatened the city preserved the ecosystem to obtain epa approval to forego building a filtration plant he says not to obtain ecosystem services disinfecting water it is not clear that rainwater needs to be purified or filtered by the catskills ecosystem he says the city s upstate reservoirs met clean water standards before the watershed agreement was signed and may be compromised he said by the city s push to preserve open space rainwater he says approximates distilled water so impurities are more likely to come from rather than be removed by the landscape onto which rain water falls wildlife specifically deer and beaver running rampant in undeveloped forests drop fecal matter into soil that leaches into upstate reservoirs none the less he added the city s long standing chlorination system destroys these and other impurities harding the biologist directing the watershed partnership council strongly disagrees there are reams of good science showing the demonstrable effect of watersheds on good water quality first rainwater is not distilled water it carries a lot of unpleasant things such as acid rain mercury and pollution he says land he added as opposed to paved roads or concrete spillways is the only stop gap between dirty water getting into receiving bodies city funded pathogen transport studies demonstrate that germs can travel no further than 150 feet through soil if dirt didn t purify he adds then septic systems wouldn t work sagoff overlooks the preventative aspect of clean water legislation harding argues although chlorine destroys most impurities studies show that water quality is heightened by keeping impurities out of the water in the first place just because water is safe to drink today harding adds doesn t mean it will be safe five to ten years from now none the less water flowing from reservoirs west of the hudson river is safer today than when the watershed agreement was signed nine years ago and nearly every stakeholder involved deems the agreement a success although most stress that ongoing efforts are needed water is cleaner with one fewer reservoir labeled as having excess amounts of nutrients farmers are pocketing profits and environmentalists are pointing to the city s watershed agreement as the prime example of how ecological solutions reap financial benefits financial report card the city s daring promise to save taxpayer dollars by underwriting the environment proved accurate according to a recent audit the city spent or committed between 1 4 1 5 billion in watershed protection projects so far says city epa spokesperson warne averaging 167 million in expenditures per year had the city opted instead to build the filtration plant taxpayers would have already dished out approximately 6 billion to build the plant plus another 250 million per year for maintenance since the city completed the bulk of its capital intensive programs warne adds savings on future watershed protection costs will be even greater specific future financial expenditures will be determined after the federal environmental protection agency s upcoming ten year review meanwhile the federal epa gave the project high marks on interim report cards noting that five new sewage treatment plants have been built and hundreds have been rebuilt more than 2000 septic tanks have been replaced or repaired three million dollars have been spent and seven times that amount has been committed to stream water management to lessen the threat of flood damage reduce erosion and improve stream ecology the city purchased 70 000 acres of land one of most effective and crucial tools for permanently protecting water according to the watershed protection and partnership council money needs to be set aside for further purchases warne says although specific acreage requirements have not been set the effort to purchase land is chugging along says eric a goldstein a lawyer for the natural resources defense council but developers and bulldozers are also moving along i view the next ten years as the last opportunity to acquire priority lands meanwhile rural new yorkers found a market for the ecosystem service they house we ve become a water exporting region says catskill watershed corporation director rosa the watershed agreement boosted the upstate economy with money pouring in at a rate of 100 million a year it provided employment invested in local businesses and promoted ecotourism the city pays local contractors to install septic systems upgrade wastewater treatment plants and set up storm water protection measures locals land jobs with the city and state department of environmental conservation farmers receive reimbursements for building fences and bridges that herd their livestock away from waterways landowners are paid to keep forests undeveloped work in progress although the benefits are clear says al appleton the former director new york city s water and sewer system who helped initiate parts of the watershed agreement the cost appreciation equation of this ecosystem investment is not as simple as it looks you can t make a single investment and expect to be done it remains a work in progress requiring nurturing monitoring and money none the less he continues the program already established that ecosystem services not only produce superior environmental and social results it produces them far more cheaply that traditional environmental strategies the watershed agreement s documented environmental and economic achievements sent ripples throughout the united states more than 140 cities are now considering watershed conservation instead of building filtration plants as for the program s future it could go on indefinitely harding says more land is being acquired better scientific advances have been made and increased funding is coming from the federal state and local government we re not running out of time steam or money alice kenny is a prize winning science

introduction with an estimated economic growth of 5 1 to 5 2 for 2018 1 economic activities in indonesia are expected to show a strong improvement one of the indications of strong economic activities is the growing need for office space for businesses it is expected that office space in jakarta will increase from 6 million square metres in 2017 2 to 7 5 million square metres between 2018 and 2020 3 leasing an office space is an easy way for a business to acquire office space in a prime location and to help the business to free up working capital thus a carefully prepared lease agreement is invaluable for the lessee and lessor as a number of issues may be encountered when leasing a building for office space it is important to consider these ahead of time this article highlights five of the most common ones overview of leasing laws in indonesia commercial lease agreements between lessees and lessors are not covered by any specific law unlike in several other countries where in some cases standard format lease agreements are available agreements between lessees and lessors on leasing an object are generally regulated under the indonesian civil code under the code a lease is an agreement under which a party binds itself to provide an object to another party for a certain period against a fixed price to be paid by the latter party this covers both moveable and immoveable goods under the code lessors are obliged to deliver the leased object to the lessee maintain the object in a sufficiently good condition to ensure that it can serve the purpose of the lease and allow the lessee to enjoy the leased object unhindered on the other hand lessees must maintain the object of the lease in a sufficiently good condition and for the purpose stated in the lease agreement or without such a provision according to the supposed purposes given the circumstances and pay the rent at the determined time given the very generic scope of indonesian civil code there are numerous types of lease agreement for office leases key characteristics of lease agreements lease agreements for office or commercial space in indonesia are often presented in a standard format prepared by the lessor or building owner or in some cases by the building management which gives the lessee little room to negotiate however this is not the case if the lessee is an anchor or major tenant in the property being leased as an anchor or major tenant it is common for the lessor to grant naming rights or advertising rights in addition the lessor may accommodate a request from the lessee for a special access arrangement to the leased property adjustment to the construction of the building or property to accommodate the lessee s specific requirements or special facilities brought in to the leased property bankruptcy of lessor or sale of property one of the lessee s concerns is the bankruptcy of the lessor which is treated differently to the bankruptcy of the lessee where the lessor retains the right to terminate the lease under articles 36 and 38 of the bankruptcy and debt repayment law 37 2004 if the lessor is declared bankrupt and the court appoints a curator the curator cannot immediately terminate the lease if the lessee complies with all of its obligations if the rent has been paid in advance the lease agreement cannot be terminated early in a recent supreme court decision the court ruled that a curator cannot terminate a lease agreement early if the lessee has paid the rent in full for the relevant term 4 another concern a lessee may have is the status of the lease agreement if the lessor decides to sell the leased property to a third party in this case the lessee s rights are protected under the code which states that the sale of a leased object will not terminate the lease unless this has been agreed to settling disputes over lease agreements another consideration is the method to be used to settle disputes this must be considered carefully especially if either party to the lease agreement is affiliated with a foreign corporation eg a foreign investment company as the lease agreement most likely involves a real property in indonesia judicial resolution outside indonesia should not be considered as an option as indonesia is not party to any bilateral or multilateral treaties regarding the reciprocal enforcement of rulings therefore if a foreign ruling calls for the payment of monetary damages in order to obtain recovery in indonesia the creditor must file a new suit against the debtor in the relevant district court in indonesia this procedure effectively amounts to a retrial of the dispute and while the foreign court decision can be used as evidence the indonesian court will not be bound by its findings given the above the most common dispute settlement methods provided for in indonesian lease agreements are domestic litigation domestic arbitration or international arbitration in a country that is party to the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards 1958 the new york convention domestic litigation the litigation process in indonesia is lengthy depending on the complexity of the case it can take from six months to approximately one year to obtain a district court ruling and the losing party can then file an appeal in the relevant high court litigation before the high court can take another six months and the losing party can then appeal to the supreme court which can take from one to five years before a final and binding ruling is handed down all proceedings in the indonesian courts are conducted in indonesian so all foreign language documents to be submitted to the court must be translated despite recent improvements in the indonesian court system many parties remain reluctant to turn to the indonesian courts unless the situation requires interim relief enforceable in indonesia or for matters involving indonesian statutory rights or claims that may not otherwise be arbitrable thus making the indonesian court system the best and possibly only viable option domestic arbitration under the arbitration law 30 1999 all awards handed down by a tribunal or individual arbitrator within indonesia are treated as domestic awards regardless of the international nature of the dispute or parties therefore whenever parties choose the arbitration law as the lex arbitri ie the law of the place in which the arbitration is to take place the resulting award is always treated as domestic under indonesian law the following are several distinguishing features of the arbitration law only claims of a commercial nature or involving rights within the full legal authority of the disputing parties may be subject to arbitration the language of the proceedings is indonesian although the parties remain free to choose a different language their choice is subject to the tribunal s consent the arbitration is usually decided on written documents a hearing can be conducted only if both parties consent to it or the tribunal deems it necessary the district court s involvement in the arbitral process is strictly limited to rendering assistance with the appointment withdrawal or recusal of arbitrators as well as the enforcement of the award although arbitrators have the power to grant certain types of interim relief it is doubtful whether the district court would agree to enforce such orders in the event of non compliance pending the litigation once rendered the award must be registered with the district court within 30 days otherwise it will be deemed unenforceable the district court s decision to reject a request for the execution of a domestic award is final and binding the only grounds for rejection are that there is no valid agreement to arbitrate the dispute is not arbitrable or the award is contrary to decency or public order the grounds for requesting the annulment of a domestic award are limited to matters involving fraud or intentional concealment and do not include grounds such as lack of jurisdiction as in many other jurisdictions domestic arbitral awards in indonesia are not subject to appeal of any kind to the courts since arbitral proceedings are confidential and district court opinions are not reported little information is available on the enforcement of domestic arbitration awards the abovementioned unusual features of the arbitration law increase the risk that a domestic award may be unenforced based on formalistic or arbitrary grounds or that an award made in excess of the tribunal s jurisdiction may not be subject to annulment by the losing party further the arbitration law offers no judicial assistance with the enforcement of interim measures imposed by arbitrators on the positive side the costs of administered domestic arbitration in indonesia are quite competitive particularly for smaller claims therefore for contractual matters involving straightforward factual and legal issues and where interim relief is not a major concern domestic arbitration may provide an efficient and cost effective method of dispute resolution international arbitration for foreign investors international arbitration offers at least one important distinct advantage over both domestic arbitration and domestic courts forum neutrality in addition in well established regional venues such as singapore and hong kong arbitration enjoys the full support of a strong lex arbitri backed by a reliable and independent court system however parties should be aware that there are inherent limits to the usefulness of even the best lex arbitri therefore in cases where provisional relief is urgently needed with respect to assets or persons located in indonesia the interim orders of a foreign court or arbitrator are unenforceable in indonesia and indonesian courts may decline to exercise jurisdiction if the underlying dispute is subject to a binding arbitration agreement however once a final award has been entered its recognition and enforcement in indonesia should generally be but in practice is not always simple and straightforward under the arbitration law any award handed down by a tribunal or individual arbitrator outside indonesia is treated as an international award for the purposes of recognition and enforcement under the new york convention at the same time when indonesia ratified the convention it entered a reservation declaring that it would limit its application to disputes arising out of legal relationships that are considered commercial under indonesian law therefore article 5 of the arbitration law which states that claims of only a commercial nature or involving rights within the full legal authority of the disputing parties may be subject to arbitration applies equally to domestic and international awards thus if enforcement in indonesia is anticipated care must be taken at the outset to ensure that the subject matter of the dispute will be deemed arbitrable under both the lex arbitri and indonesian law other conditions for the recognition and enforceability of an international award in indonesia are that it must be rendered by a tribunal in a country that is also a party to the new york convention the order must not violate public order and the order must be registered with and a writ of execution must be obtained from the central jakarta district court chair it is important to include in the appointment of the tribunal an undertaking that the arbitrators will register the award with the local court for enforcement if requested by the winning party unlike domestic awards international awards are not subject to strict time limits for recognition and enforcement further while a decision of the central jakarta district court chair granting exequatur ie an enforcement order of an international award is not subject to appeal a decision refusing exequatur can be appealed to the supreme court which should resolve the matter within 90 days service charges the service charge in lease agreements usually includes a charge for the electricity needed for lighting public areas air conditioning and lifts a charge for water security services and the operation and maintenance of public areas eg public restrooms a charge for operating and maintaining including repairing the building and equipment machinery and building facilities eg water disposal and treatment lifts and fire suppression equipment a charge for cleaning public areas a charge to cover employee salaries security personnel engineers technicians and office staff and building management a charge for general administration matters eg permits licences and tax and a charge for building insurance depending on the lessor the agreement regarding service charges may vary including when payment is due eg quarterly or semi annually and who charges the service tax normally the lessee pays the service charge together with the rent to the lessor as part of the payment of the rent however in some cases the lease agreement may require the lessee to pay the service charge separately from the rent to the lessor or the building management engaged by the lessor these arrangements can have two different consequences from the tax standpoint in the first case the withholding tax is paid at the rate which applies to rent including the service charge in the second case the tax due on the rent is paid at the rate which applies to the rent while the tax due on the service charge is paid at the rate which applies to management services charge it is therefore common for the lessee to engage a qualified indonesian tax consultant to review or finalise the arrangement regarding the rent and service charge to make sure that the tax regulations are not infringed one of the most debated items in a lease agreement is the cost of the service charge previously lessees would accept the service charge without question but it now has become customary for the lessee and lessor to determine the service charge after comparing the average service charge in several similar buildings in the same location this is a fairer way to decide on the service charge for both the lessee and lessor gross up payment for rent the income tax law 7 1983 as amended several times obliges the lessee to withhold the income tax due on the rent paid to the lessor thus the lessor receives less than the amount stated in the lease agreement and in some cases particularly in the case of the lease of a building owned by an individual owner or a more traditional lessor or building owner the lessor insists on being paid the full amount of the rent stated in the lease agreement although lease agreements commonly contain a clause under which each party accepts responsibility for its respective tax obligations some lessors still insist that the lessee grosses up the rent payment however as tax regulations require the lessee to withhold income tax from the rent paid to the lessor the lessee should not pay the lessor the full amount of the rent stated in the lease agreement as the tax authority will decide that the lessee is not complying with its obligation to withhold income tax from the rent paid to the lessor therefore the lessee and lessor should come to an agreement that the rent stated in the lease agreement includes an additional amount corresponding to the withholding tax to be withheld so that the lessor receives the full amount of the rent as originally intended it is also common for the lease to be paid three months in advance repair work under the indonesia civil code the lessor must maintain the leased object and may ask for repairs to be made except for repairs for which the lessor is responsible the lessor should also be responsible for all defects in the leased object that prevent its use on the other hand the lessee should be responsible for damage caused to the leased object during the lease term unless it can be established that the damage was not caused by the lessee this should include any damage to the leased object or loss to the lessor caused by the lessee s roommates or transferee and the lessee should be required to take down and remove everything installed or constructed within the premises at the lessee s own cost without damaging the leased object however in indonesia it has become common practice for commercial office or building leases to state that any repair and maintenance work will be undertaken by the lessor or in some cases by the building manager engaged by the lessor especially if the lessor is also the owner of the building this is because the lessor usually understands the construction of the property much better than the lessee or the contractors engaged by the lessee and this way any maintenance or repair work necessary can be performed without threatening the integrity of the construction of the building to this end it is common for lease agreements in indonesia to contain clauses under which the lessor or the building management engaged by it undertakes the maintenance and repair work including clauses regarding the lessor s response time following receipt of a request from the lessee a time limit for completing the repair and maintenance work who pays the cost of the repair and maintenance work and the compensation available to the lessee if the maintenance and repair work disrupts the lessee s activities sinking funds sometimes a debate ensues over the proposal to establish a sinking fund during the negotiations over the lease agreement between the lessee and the lessor unfortunately there is no specific regulation on office or property leases which defines or regulates sinking funds usually a sinking fund is established to cover repairs and maintain the property which are the basic obligations of the lessor however in some cases the lessor will try to include a contribution to the sinking fund in the service charge which is not refundable thereby making the lessee also responsible to a certain degree for the maintenance and repair of the property however the lessor can often be persuaded to contribute to the sinking fund charged to the lessee often as part of the service charge refundable on lease s expiry but no interest is usually payable on the accumulated contributions as if they were a deposit in strata title buildings ie multi level apartment blocks and horizontal subdivisions with shared areas the sinking fund paid to the tenants association is not refundable as the association uses it for the maintenance and repair of the strata title building however this is not the case in commercial building leases as there is no specific regulation on this matter it is unclear which practice is most appropriate and so whether the sinking fund contributions are refundable to the lessee upon the lease s expiry depends on the negotiations between the lessee and the lessor if the lessor insists on charging the lessee a non refundable contribution to the sinking fund the contribution should constitute additional income for the lessee under the income tax law consequently the contribution paid is subject to withholding tax at the prevailing rate and the lessee must withhold the tax due on the contribution paid to the sinking fund lessees should consider this aspect when negotiating with a lessor on the other hand if the contribution to the sinking fund will be refunded on the lease s expiry it does not constitute additional income for the lessor and therefore the lessee not need withhold any income tax on it meanwhile it is common practice in indonesia to refund any deposit the lessee pays to the lessor during the lease term without any interest and this also applies to the contribution to the sinking comment given the various issues discussed above in indonesia both the lessee and the lessor should prepare the lease agreement carefully to avoid any potential dispute arising during the lease term in some cases the lessee does not negotiate the lease agreement diligently and so may well accept lease provisions that would be unacceptable to other lessees while at the other end of the spectrum sometimes the lessee and the lessor get involved in multiple lengthy sessions when negotiating the lease agreement for further information on

social security deserves to be a hot button issue for the 2020 presidential election here s why it won t be no it s not your imagination the election cycle does seem to be starting earlier and earlier as time goes on just weeks after the midterm elections wrapped up this past november members of the democratic party were throwing their hats into the ring to declare themselves as candidates for the 2020 presidential election to be held in november 2020 like earnings season with the stock market campaign season simply doesn t stop anymore the 2020 election is bound to captivate the attention of the american public there are a number of hot button issues that president trump assuming he s the republican nominee for president and the eventual democrat nominee will have to address this includes healthcare reform national and border security economic growth and likely our nation s growing national debt however one issue that absolutely deserves to be center stage but is unlikely to receive any serious discussion during the presidential election is social security social security isn t going bankrupt but it s still in big trouble on one hand america s most important social program has done a bang up job of providing a financial foundation for tens of millions of retired and disabled people each month about 63 million benefit checks are disbursed and more than 22 million of these recipients are lifted out of poverty as a result of their payout this shows that america s social investment in its retired and disabled workforce is doing exactly what it was intended to do then again the foundation that social security provides is also showing signs of weakness last year the program s asset reserves grew by the lowest amount in more than three decades the social security board of trustees has forecast that a major inflection point is right around the corner whereby the program will begin paying out more than it collects each year these growing net cash outflows brought about by ongoing demographic changes are projected to deplete social security s nearly 2 9 trillion in asset reserves by 2034 to be crystal clear social security not having a dime left in its asset reserves doesn t mean the program is bankrupt or insolvent rather it just means that the existing payout schedule isn t sustainable over the long run the program s 12 4 payroll tax on earned income and the taxation of benefits over certain income thresholds are two recurring sources of revenue that ensure social security can t go bankrupt but in order to maintain payouts over the long term defined as the next 75 years the trustees have estimated the need to reduce benefit checks up to 21 by 2034 that s not a welcome outlook given that more than 3 out of 5 retired workers currently rely on social security for at least half of their monthly income fixing social security means someone always loses current and future retirees are clearly worried about this top social program and they d like the leading candidate from both major political parties to address how they ll go about strengthening social security for the long run unfortunately neither the republican nor democrat presidential candidate is likely to discuss social security much if at all leading up to the 2020 elections for one simple reason all solutions mean some group has to lose make no mistake about it there are quite a few solutions on the table in capitol hill that would work to raise additional tax revenue reduce long term expenditures or take a middle of the road approach thereby eliminating the program s 13 2 trillion cash shortfall through 2092 but every solution presented means some individuals won t come out as winners as an example one of the core proposals that republican lawmakers would like to see implemented is a gradual increase to the full retirement age i e the age at which you become eligible to receive your full monthly benefit currently set to peak at age 67 for those born in 1960 or later the gop has called for a gradual increase up to age 70 for full retirement benefits in order to counteract increased longevity doing so would reduce lifetime benefits paid by the program by either coercing workers to wait longer to claim benefits or to take an even steeper monthly reduction by claiming early although such a solution would protect current and soon to be retired seniors it would reduce the lifetime benefit potential of future generations of workers president trump understands this and back in 2013 he urged the gop to steer clear of the topic around election time as for democrats they d prefer to see the payroll tax earnings cap currently 132 900 in 2019 increased or eliminated right now any earned income i e wages and salary paid to workers above 132 900 is exempt from the 12 4 payroll tax over the past three plus decades the amount of earned income exempt from this crucial income generator for social security has quadrupled from around 300 billion to 1 2 trillion raising or eliminating this cap would instantly generate more revenue for the program but it would also not provide any extra benefits for the well to do during retirement despite their added payroll tax contributions put another way amending social security could mean costing your political party precious votes come election time the republican core proposal negatively impacts working age americans which could make reelection difficult for president trump meanwhile the democrat proposal hurts the wealthy who just happen to be important campaign donors and policy influencers no matter the resolution to social security s problems someone will lose and for that reason social security has become a topic that only second term presidents are likely to consider tackling

trump had his own wealth tax in 1999 but the math was wrong before elizabeth warren s wealth tax there was donald trump s wealth tax it was 1999 and he was trying to get the reform party to run him as their presidential candidate for the 2000 campaign although trump conducted a media blitz to get the wealth tax idea on the front pages nobody could figure how it worked why he proposed it or whose idea it was it might have originated with trump or maybe it originated with longtime trump campaign adviser roger stone says dave shiflett who co authored a book with trump advertisement advertisement the math just didn t add up trump was off by trillions of dollars by the time he actually ran in 2016 he had re purposed himself as a market driven conservative to win the republican nomination and ultimately the white house the billionaire candidate said in 2016 that he tried to pay as little tax as possible and since then has generally compared democrats tax the rich plans to the socialist regime of nicolas maduro in venezuela shiflett who co wrote trump s 2000 book the america we deserve thinks stone probably came up with the idea but mostly finds it amusing that anyone takes the proposal that appeared in the book seriously in 1999 trump ran a brief campaign for the nomination of the reform party he was attempting to emulate the success of jesse ventura a former professional wrestler who had won election as governor of minnesota on the reform ticket yet people close to the reform party s founder ross perot thought a trump candidacy was a bad idea pat buchanan the conservative columnist became the party s nominee in the 2000 election advertisement advertisement in november 1999 seeking to make a splash trump rolled out his wealth tax plan in a series of interviews the idea according to trump was to take a chunk of the wealth of the richest americans use it to pay off the national debt and then use the savings to shore up social security implement a middle class tax cut and eliminate the estate tax story continues warren a massachusetts senator running for the 2020 democratic nomination has proposed a wealth tax on those with a net worth of more than 50 million the top 0 1 percent of americans she says the tax would raise 2 75 trillion over 10 years pat choate perot s running mate in 1996 said trump s goal of paying off the national debt was in line with the politics of the time perot himself had run in part on the idea of fiscal responsibility but in 1999 using a wealth tax to pay off the debt seemed to address a problem that was already fading the u s was turning a surplus at the time leading federal reserve chairman alan greenspan to warn congress of negative consequences should liquidity in the treasury bond market dry up compounding the confusion trump s figures didn t add up he proposed a 14 25 percent tax on the net worth of americans who had wealth of more than 10 million excluding their primary homes he said the plan would raise 5 7 trillion advertisement advertisement trump said at the time that economists i ve consulted estimated american wealth at 50 trillion with 40 trillion of that being controlled by the top 1 percent in reality he was off by 10 trillion in the total amount of u s wealth and by double digit percentage points on how much of the country s population controls that wealth according to the federal reserve and economists who have estimated wealth concentration u s households had a total net worth of about 40 trillion and the top 1 percent controlled less than half of that rather than tax households with more than 10 million in assets excluding primary homes to raise 5 7 trillion congress would have had to implement a 14 25 percent tax on the net worth of all americans including their primary homes to raise the kind of money trump promised said mark zandi now an economist with moody s analytics and that s assuming no one found a way to cheat the system by undervaluing assets or moving them abroad advertisement advertisement trump apparently wasn t deeply involved in crunching the numbers when he announced his wealth tax proposal shiflett was helping to write the book that would outline the policies he d support as president shiflett said he had one long interview with stone and trump where they tried to come up with some ideas while he doesn t remember who came up with the wealth tax proposal shiflett said stone drove most of the policy proposals trump had strong opinions on terrorism on north korea and strongly supported a single payer health care system but tax issues were an afterthought shiflett said he did make a big thing about the tax that it would cost him a lot of money shiflett said adding it wasn t going to cost him a lot of money because it wasn t going to happen advertisement advertisement shiflett said after trump won the white house in 2016 a dutch television crew showed up at his home with the book and took its contents seriously a position shiflett thought was funny there was no air of seriousness involved here shiflett said it s not like we were writing a book for the ages that people will always refer to when the great president is being considered for his place in history or something like that shiflett added that stone seemed mostly into the humor of trump running for president stone did not respond to a voice message and email seeking comment a federal judge on feb 21 ordered him not to speak publicly about a criminal case against him the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment once the proposal became news it struck douglas holtz eakin then chairman of syracuse university s economics department as especially bizarre because of the favorable situation with the u s budget and the debt advertisement advertisement holtz eakin now the president of the right leaning american action forum said the trump plan was the kind of thing he d use in class as an example of bad policy if the last time i accumulated a lot of wealth they took 14 25 percent of it am i really going to do that again holtz eakin said in 2003 holtz eakin took the helm of the congressional budget office just as the surpluses were turning into huge deficits
the postal and telecommunications regulatory authority of zimbabwe potraz says it is reviewing proposals by mobile network operators mnos for a tariff hike in light of movement in the exchange rate as determined on the inter bank market potraz acting director general kennedy dewera yesterday said following the country s monetary policy statement mps which introduced an inter bank foreign exchange market where electronic money known as real time gross settlement bond notes and coins can be traded against other currencies at market rates mnos had approached the industry regulator with requests for a tariff review indeed we have received those applications from various operators and these are still being considered by the authority you may be aware that there have been developments in the economy and those developments impact on the decisions to be made by the regulator he said on behalf of potraz boss gift machengete who is representing zimbabwe at the mobile world congress in barcelona at a value added services workshop in the capital introduction of the interbank market was a departure from the central bank s long maintained position that the local currency was at par with the us dollar although on the black market the currency traded at higher rates to the greenback according to central bank governor john mangudya the exchange rate debuted at 2 50 against the united states dollar lower than black market rates of around 3 50 with the new tariff anticipated to reflect this reality dewera said he was not in a position to give a time frame when the watchdog may have a final position on the tariff matter given wide consultations had to be concluded before a decision could be reached so these factors are still being looked at within the timeframe that the regulator can consider them it is difficult to give the exact time when we can expect a final position as the process isn t entirely up to the regulators we have to consult extensively but when the analysis has been done it will be taken to the operators the acting potraz boss said dumisani nkala a business development manager with telco said the local tariffs were already the most expensive in the region if you look at what zimbabwe is charging the estimates are that we are five times higher but operators may be asking for a tariff review because of their cost structures and obtaining economic conditions she said however spencer manguwa netone executive customer experience said the tariff was long over due given zimbabwe s difficult macro economic environment it is all because of the high operating costs and expenses we incur as organisations we are not being exempt from the harsh economic conditions in zimbabwe we are also saying it s very important that we remain viable and meet our obligations not just to the consumer but to stakeholders and shareholders therefore the tariff increase becomes imperative to match economic developments and changes he said this comes as zimbabwe s largest mobile network services provider econet wireless on tuesday announced an adjustment in tariffs for roaming and international calling services to reflect movement in the exchange rate as determined on the inter bank market dailynews

as potential legislation the so called green new deal certainly could have had a better launch but despite a not quite ready for prime time roll out its key goal of de carbonization is gaining ground on both sides of the aisle in congress and more importantly with industry recently mdu resources nyse mdu became the latest us electric utility to retire coal announcing the shutdown of 3 power plants by the end of 2021 giant mining firm glencore plc london glen pledged to cap its coal output and two bipartisan bills to boost carbon capture and storage technologies began circulating in the us senate current energy storage technology is not capable of economically resolving the intermittency issues of wind and solar power during nextera energy s nyse nee fourth quarter earnings call however ceo jim robo forecast a cost for wind plus 4 hour storage of between 7 and 10 cents per kilowatt hour and a cost of 7 5 to 10 5 cents kwh for solar plus storage all by early in the next decade and without any subsidies and incentives getting there depends on the premise that continued technology improvements and cost declines will follow current multi year trends but as robo points out those economics if achieved will be cheaper than the operating cost of coal nuclear and less fuel efficient oil and gas units nextera forecasts annual growth of 6 to 8 percent in earnings per share for the combination of its regulated florida utility and the unregulated unit that s the leading wind and solar power producer in the us that target could prove quite conservative if solar and wind economics prove as disruptive as robo believes unfortunately every bit of that potential upside is reflected in the company s trailing 12 months price earnings ratio of 25 times plus and nextera and other renewable energy leaders face another challenge pg e corp nyse pcg may attempt to use its bankruptcy as a lever to cut the price of existing contracts i continue to believe california will ultimately insist contracts are honored as these renewables producers investment is critical to meeting the state s decarbonization goals nextera continues to find opportunities elsewhere including the giant wind solar storage project announced with portland general electric nyse por this week but we re more bullish on renewable energy yieldcos like nextera energy partners nyse nep which own growing portfolios of valuable assets and are considerably cheaper pattern energy group nsdq pegi for example pays a yield of 8 percent and renewable energy is hardly the only green new deal winner semiconductors for example are essential to the emerging fleet of electric and self driving vehicles they re also key to improving efficiency of conventional trucks and automobiles so they win whichever technology comes out on top natural gas and new nuclear are not favored by the principal green new deal sponsors but the combination of cheap and abundant supplies from shale and new takeaway capacity is speeding electric utilities switch from coal to gas in the us and from fuel oil to gas in mexico kinder morgan inc nyse kmi which transports 40 percent of us gas forecasts a 32 percent lift in us demand including exports by 2030 as for new nuclear it s critical for southern company nyse so to get its two new reactors up and running at the vogtle site in georgia without major new cost overruns that s far from certain in light of the project s struggles under previous contractor westinghouse but the project is now 74 percent completed and several new chinese reactors using the same ap 1000 model are now in service and relatively problem free success at southern could be all that s needed to spur a us industry renaissance china inc is another likely green new deal winner the country increasingly dominates global production of solar components and batteries according to bloomberg new energy finance annual global solar module production capacity is 219 gigawatts up 61 percent over the past two years demand in 2018 however was only 107 gw the upshot is capacity continues to consolidate in the strongest hands with 70 manufacturers leaving the business and the 10 largest producers now controlling 66 percent of global capacity chinese companies have emerged at the top of the heap for two reasons the voracious appetite of the country s domestic market and the government s designation of solar and energy storage as key sectors chinese innovation and ramping up of production capacity have been critical to driving down the global price of solar components and a similar effort is underway with battery storage that includes new processes for recycling lithium ion batteries previously used in electric vehicles niche lending to renewable energy and efficiency projects is already big business demonstrated by robust fourth quarter results at hannon armstrong sustainable infrastructure capital nyse hasi technically a business development company hannon is organized as a real estate investment trust allowing it to shelter income and pay a generous dividend business development companies bdcs typically run aground at some point during the economic cycle because they focus lending on the less creditworthy in contrast hannon s niche has proven highly resistant to economic swings particularly the behind the meter efficiency projects that make up 75 percent of its backlog the company s focus also allows it to stick to investment grade corporations and municipalities where default risk is a fraction of that carried by more conventional bdcs last year hannon froze its quarterly dividend as took an earnings hit from refinancing debt to fixed rates from mainly variable interest rates recently it resumed annual dividend growth after reporting 8 7 percent higher 2018 earnings topping the guidance range of 2 to 6 percent over the past year investors have had numerous opportunities to buy hannon below 22 which i view as a good entry point resuming dividend growth will eventually earn this stock a higher buy target but now up more than 25 percent year to date a pause is overdue be patient

known as the united states mexico canada usmca the new north american trade deal is still awaiting ratification by lawmakers in the three countries source reuters file mexico s government on friday threatened to slap duties on new us products in retaliation for the trump administration s steel and aluminium tariffs as it seeks to turn up pressure on washington to exempt it from the measures us president donald trump set tariffs of 25 per cent on imported steel and 10 per cent on aluminium last june prompting mexico and other trade partners to hit back mexico has consistently argued that the tariffs only damage commerce within north america and should be withdrawn mexican deputy economy minister luz maria de la mora told reuters in an interview that if the us government did not repeal the tariffs her government would have a revamped list in its carousel of us targets ready in about two months advertisement we re carrying out an evaluation and there are products from the agricultural sector we re probably going to bring in some new ones and take some others out as well as in the industrial sector and the steel industry de la mora said the value of the goods targeted under the list would remain equivalent to the impact of the trump tariffs de la mora said estimating the damage they caused at 2 7 billion mexico s previous government retaliated almost immediately against the metal tariffs slapping measures on agricultural goods including pork legs apples and cheese as well as various steel products even if the value of the goods targeted by mexico remained the same swapping in new products could encourage more us businesses to lobby washington against the tariffs the new mexican government of leftist president andres manuel lopez obrador took office in december and de la mora said the country would continue to reject trump s measures advertisement we should not fall into this protectionist trap said de la mora who brought years of experience working in international trade for the mexican government to the post noting that trump had tried to use the metal tariffs as leverage during the renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement nafta de la mora said now that since a new deal had been agreed last year the argument was no longer valid mexico is not a national security threat for the united states she said this is really important it really needs to be understood that mexico is a partner mexico is an ally known as the united states mexico canada usmca the new north american trade deal is still awaiting ratification by lawmakers in the three countries advertisement de la mora said mexico s congress would likely first pass a new labour bill designed to strengthen the rights of unionized workers fulfilling a commitment made with the usmca deal she expressed hope that law would be approved before the current session of congress concludes on april 30 lawmakers would likely move on to usmca ratification during the following session due to begin in september she added uncertainty over mexico s access to the us market has been a worry for business while lopez obrador s decision making and attacks on the neo liberal policies he said his predecessors pursued have also left some investors unimpressed still de la mora said that after her meetings with investors at the world economic forum in davos in january she believed levels of foreign direct investment fdi very similar to the past few years could be maintained in mexico advertisement all the companies indicated to me they have faith in mexico she said mexico s full year 2018 fdi totalled 31 6 billion preliminary official data showed this week

by adriana barrera and dave graham mexico city reuters mexico s government on friday threatened to slap duties on new u s products in retaliation for the trump administration s steel and aluminum tariffs as it seeks to turn up pressure on washington to exempt it from the measures u s president donald trump set tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum last june prompting mexico and other trade partners to hit back mexico has consistently argued that the tariffs only damage commerce within north america and should be withdrawn mexican deputy economy minister luz maria de la mora told reuters in an interview that if the u s government did not repeal the tariffs her government would have a revamped list in its carousel of u s targets ready in about two months we re carrying out an evaluation and there are products from the agricultural sector we re probably going to bring in some new ones and take some others out as well as in the industrial sector and the steel industry de la mora said the value of the goods targeted under the list would remain equivalent to the impact of the trump tariffs de la mora said estimating the damage they caused at 2 7 billion advertisement advertisement mexico s previous government retaliated almost immediately against the metal tariffs slapping measures on agricultural goods including pork legs apples and cheese as well as various steel products even if the value of the goods targeted by mexico remained the same swapping in new products could encourage more u s businesses to lobby washington against the tariffs the new mexican government of leftist president andres manuel lopez obrador took office in december and de la mora said the country would continue to reject trump s measures we should not fall into this protectionist trap said de la mora who brought years of experience working in international trade for the mexican government to the post advertisement advertisement noting that trump had tried to use the metal tariffs as leverage during the renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement nafta de la mora said now that since a new deal had been agreed last year the argument was no longer valid mexico is not a national security threat for the united states she said this is really important it really needs to be understood that mexico is a partner mexico is an ally known as the united states mexico canada usmca the new north american trade deal is still awaiting ratification by lawmakers in the three countries de la mora said mexico s congress would likely first pass a new labor bill designed to strengthen the rights of unionized workers fulfilling a commitment made with the usmca deal advertisement advertisement she expressed hope that law would be approved before the current session of congress concludes on april 30 lawmakers would likely move on to usmca ratification during the following session due to begin in september she added uncertainty over mexico s access to the u s market has been a worry for business while lopez obrador s decision making and attacks on the neo liberal policies he said his predecessors pursued have also left some investors unimpressed still de la mora said that after her meetings with investors at the world economic forum in davos in january she believed levels of foreign direct investment fdi very similar to the past few years could be maintained in mexico all the companies indicated to me they have faith in mexico she said advertisement advertisement mexico s full year 2018 fdi totaled 31 6 billion preliminary official data showed this week reporting by dave graham and adriana barrera editing by frank jack daniel james dalgleish and g crosse
new yorkers must oppose economic development policies that give more power to billionaires and their corporations over our communities future hq2 scam follow 5 min read mar 1 2019 1 listen share as new yorkers we believe every person has the right to good union jobs safe and dignified affordable housing strong and stable communities a great public education and a voice in our democracy because of these values we must oppose governor cuomo s failed economic development policies that give more power over our communities futures to billionaires and their corporations cuomo s plea for amazon to come back to new york and the open letter that appears in the new york times today does not accurately reflect the desires of immigrant communities working class communities and communities of color amazon left the first time around because of fierce vocal opposition and that opposition still remains we defeated them recently and we will do it again the amazon hq2 plan was a perfect example of the governor s failed economic development policies it was a backroom deal that cut out communities and handed a 500 million grant and 2 5 billion in future public money to the wealthiest man in the world other than the union construction and building services jobs that were already in place from previous plans for the site and that were grandfathered into the deal amazon made little commitment to local hiring and promised just 30 jobs for public housing residents their presence in seattle drove up rents and homelessness to unprecedented levels a similar headquarters in long island city would have done the same in queens accelerating the displacement of our communities furthermore amazon refused to stay neutral to unionization efforts or to stop their collaboration with ice which is incompatible with the values of the people of new york the state of new york has allocated tens of billions of dollars to corporations in the name of economic development but communities and workers across the state continue to suffer from disinvestment while governor cuomo said that amazon leaving was the greatest tragedy since he s been in office our communities face real tragedies every day that continue to go unaddressed by the administration students are suffering from crumbling schools outdated textbooks and crowded classrooms while the state owes our public schools billions of dollars in aid the governor refuses to comply with a lawsuit that would force the state to release that aid to our public schools nearly 100 000 new yorkers sleep in shelters each night a number that has risen 36 on governor cuomo s watch nearly 100 000 rent stabilized apartments have been lost public housing residents are living in deplorable conditions while state funding for public housing continues to decline plans like nycha 2 0 and nextgen nycha are inadequate solutions to new york s ongoing public housing crisis riders can no longer depend on the mta to get to work school and critical appointments cuomo has presided over disinvestment in the system that now requires 40 billion to pay for repairs and modernization we are a diverse coalition of new yorkers who believe that we need bottom up economic development designed for the benefit of our communities not for billionaires corporations and real estate speculators cuomo s failed economic development policies have extracted our wealth in exchange for false job promises look no further than the buffalo billion project which has been riddled with corruption and cost the state nearly 1 million per job we are committed to the establishment of a new equitable economic development agenda that redirects the billions of dollars currently spent on tax breaks and subsidies for corporations towards deep community led investments in our neighborhoods we need investment that creates good union jobs real affordable housing fully funded schools and modernized public infrastructure rather than pursuing economic development policies that lead to displacement we demand policies that create housing stability and security we call for universal rent control that gives people not the real estate industry the power to determine where they live no new yorker should live in fear of a rapid rent increase or an eviction we will continue to hold amazon accountable and defend our communities from their monopolistic practices their tax avoidance and their collaboration with ice we will continue to stand in solidarity with amazon workers facing brutal working conditions and union busting bosses these fights won t be easy but we know new yorkers will stand with us in our fight for a state that works for all of us signed

before elizabeth warren s wealth tax there was donald trump s wealth tax it was 1999 and he was trying to get the reform party to run him as their presidential candidate for the 2000 campaign although trump conducted a media blitz to get the wealth tax idea on the front pages nobody could figure how it worked why he proposed it or whose idea it was it might have originated with trump or maybe it originated with longtime trump campaign adviser roger stone says dave shiflett who co authored a book with trump the math just didn t add up trump was off by trillions of dollars by the time he actually ran in 2016 he had re purposed himself as a market driven conservative to win the republican nomination and ultimately the white house the billionaire candidate said in 2016 that he tried to pay as little tax as possible and since then has generally compared democrats tax the rich plans to the socialist regime of nicolas maduro in venezuela shiflett who co wrote trump s 2000 book the america we deserve thinks stone probably came up with the idea but mostly finds it amusing that anyone takes the proposal that appeared in the book seriously in 1999 trump ran a brief campaign for the nomination of the reform party he was attempting to emulate the success of jesse ventura a former professional wrestler who had won election as governor of minnesota on the reform ticket yet people close to the reform party s founder ross perot thought a trump candidacy was a bad idea pat buchanan the conservative columnist became the party s nominee in the 2000 election in november 1999 seeking to make a splash trump rolled out his wealth tax plan in a series of interviews the idea according to trump was to take a chunk of the wealth of the richest americans use it to pay off the national debt and then use the savings to shore up social security implement a middle class tax cut and eliminate the estate tax warren a massachusetts senator running for the 2020 democratic nomination has proposed a wealth tax on those with a net worth of more than 50 million the top 0 1 percent of americans she says the tax would raise 2 75 trillion over 10 years pat choate perot s running mate in 1996 said trump s goal of paying off the national debt was in line with the politics of the time perot himself had run in part on the idea of fiscal responsibility but in 1999 using a wealth tax to pay off the debt seemed to address a problem that was already fading the u s was turning a surplus at the time leading federal reserve chairman alan greenspan to warn congress of negative consequences should liquidity in the treasury bond market dry up compounding the confusion trump s figures didn t add up he proposed a 14 25 percent tax on the net worth of americans who had wealth of more than 10 million excluding their primary homes he said the plan would raise 5 7 trillion trump said at the time that economists i ve consulted estimated american wealth at 50 trillion with 40 trillion of that being controlled by the top 1 percent in reality he was off by 10 trillion in the total amount of u s wealth and by double digit percentage points on how much of the country s population controls that wealth according to the federal reserve and economists who have estimated wealth concentration u s households had a total net worth of about 40 trillion and the top 1 percent controlled less than half of that rather than tax households with more than 10 million in assets excluding primary homes to raise 5 7 trillion congress would have had to implement a 14 25 percent tax on the net worth of all americans including their primary homes to raise the kind of money trump promised said mark zandi now an economist with moody s analytics and that s assuming no one found a way to cheat the system by undervaluing assets or moving them abroad trump apparently wasn t deeply involved in crunching the numbers when he announced his wealth tax proposal shiflett was helping to write the book that would outline the policies he d support as president shiflett said he had one long interview with stone and trump where they tried to come up with some ideas while he doesn t remember who came up with the wealth tax proposal shiflett said stone drove most of the policy proposals trump had strong opinions on terrorism on north korea and strongly supported a single payer health care system but tax issues were an afterthought shiflett said he did make a big thing about the tax that it would cost him a lot of money shiflett said adding it wasn t going to cost him a lot of money because it wasn t going to happen shiflett said after trump won the white house in 2016 a dutch television crew showed up at his home with the book and took its contents seriously a position shiflett thought was funny there was no air of seriousness involved here shiflett said it s not like we were writing a book for the ages that people will always refer to when the great president is being considered for his place in history or something like that shiflett added that stone seemed mostly into the humor of trump running for president stone did not respond to a voice message and email seeking comment a federal judge on feb 21 ordered him not to speak publicly about a criminal case against him the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment once the proposal became news it struck douglas holtz eakin then chairman of syracuse university s economics department as especially bizarre because of the favorable situation with the u s budget and the debt holtz eakin now the president of the right leaning american action forum said the trump plan was the kind of thing he d use in class as an example of bad policy if the last time i accumulated a lot of wealth they took 14 25 percent of it am i really going to do that again holtz eakin said in 2003 holtz eakin took the helm of the congressional budget office just as the surpluses were turning into huge deficits
it is already clear that the presidential campaign just starting will be focused overwhelmingly on our fast declining middle class and for good reason for the 52 percent of americans earning between 45 200 to 135 600 salaries are not keeping up with the cost of living this is the most important issue of our time plain and simple it extends from blue collar laborers to white collar professionals a revealing bottom line of this socioeconomic reality is that most americans don t have as much as 400 on hand in case of emergency president trump and sen bernie sanders i vt figured this out during their previous run in 2016 they had their ears to the ground and they carved out a populist message that wasn t all that divergent beneath the layers of competing arena spectacle both were anti globalist the idea was jobs creation mosads for jobs to be meaningful they must pay competitively in a cutthroat economy that requires more than just more low paying service jobs such as warehousing jobs at amazon fulfillment centers experts conclude those actually cause job losses in other local industries it turns out that protectionism itself isn t much help either tariffs end up as a regressive tax against the moderate to low income population in short they end up costing working people more for essential goods such as food and children s clothing conservatives infatuation with a lowered corporate tax rate also ends up hurting the middle class it actually has exacerbated the income gap between the haves and the have nots research shows that lowering corporate taxes doesn t mean money is trickling down to workers patents get moved to low tax areas but a change in location of intellectual property doesn t translate into building more u s factories to add insult to injury affluent americans earning over 200 000 a year have been able to reclassify their income to save yet more on taxes through corporate breaks i m worried about the loss of our middle class because without that secure buffer between rich and poor democracy is finished no other issue tops this right now democracy always is at risk when the middle class drops out all that remains then is a small wealthy elite that protects its assets generationally and makes itself distant from the grassroots while a majority population living with daily insecurity over the acquisition of basic needs nurtures festering resentments this formula does not spell great success for a free and stable regime there is only one way out of this crippling socioeconomic situation and it happens to be truly bipartisan it is clear and easy to move forward if only government and the electorate can reach beyond partisan formulae my proposal contains two fundamental policy ingredients one relies on government and the other on the private sector but these two features cannot work without each other it is a marriage of sorts mossecondads the first ingredient is government deregulation of business and the second is socially responsible behavior on the part of our corporate leaders the national association of manufacturers reports that annual federal regulation compliance mostly harms small businesses the cost of regulation for manufacturers goes beyond direct expenditures by 37 percent add to that local and state regulation small companies may end up paying more to comply with myriad regulations than with the daily grind of just trying to build a company no wonder only the corporate behemoths survive and become ever more dominant over our markets and culture they are the only businesses that can but large corporations also have to make a choice that if they are going to do more than pay lip service to the democratic ideal that allowed them to flourish in the first place they have to worry less about margins and more about people how much is enough i came of age in the reagan era when unions were broken but i think now that while unions may have demanded too much their core concerns were and are justified they wanted a living wage benefits and ultimately respect for workers who were vital in the making of a product corporate leaders do not need to gouge cities and workers for their own stock options and astronomical returns offer rank and file employees a bit more more wall street firms are putting their clients money into impact investments which puts capital into companies that have social purpose that s a good model all companies should think of themselves as impact investments where they develop a culture of fairness and honor for each link in the production chain this proposal asks for something very basic pay all employees a salary that correlates to the cost of living in the cities where they work that s all it is beyond the scope of government to do so the corporate sector has to decide if it will do the right thing by the american people it is that simple in the end it comes down to choice what kind of nation do we want to be do we want a paternalistic government operating concurrently with an oligarchic corporate sector or an environment that allows for the longevity of small business while marshaling the moral will to compel big business to act just as we would expect any citizen to with real care and concern for all those in its orbit if sovereignty lies with the people we the people have to take ownership of our future the answer does not lie in washington or on wall street it lies with us and what we demand of our society this election year is more than a national debate over who ought to be president it is a time to close the american divide abraham unger ph d is senior research fellow at the carey institute for government reform and an associate professor and director of urban programs at the department of government and politics wagner college new york he is the author of the death and life of the american middle class palgrave macmillan 2018
trump had his own wealth tax in 1999 but the math was wrong before elizabeth warren s wealth tax there was donald trump s wealth tax it was 1999 and he was trying to get the reform party to run him as their presidential candidate for the 2000 campaign although trump conducted a media blitz to get the wealth tax idea on the front pages nobody could figure how it worked why he proposed it or whose idea it was it might have originated with trump or maybe it originated with longtime trump campaign adviser roger stone says dave shiflett who co authored a book with trump advertisement advertisement the math just didn t add up trump was off by trillions of dollars by the time he actually ran in 2016 he had re purposed himself as a market driven conservative to win the republican nomination and ultimately the white house the billionaire candidate said in 2016 that he tried to pay as little tax as possible and since then has generally compared democrats tax the rich plans to the socialist regime of nicolas maduro in venezuela shiflett who co wrote trump s 2000 book the america we deserve thinks stone probably came up with the idea but mostly finds it amusing that anyone takes the proposal that appeared in the book seriously in 1999 trump ran a brief campaign for the nomination of the reform party he was attempting to emulate the success of jesse ventura a former professional wrestler who had won election as governor of minnesota on the reform ticket yet people close to the reform party s founder ross perot thought a trump candidacy was a bad idea pat buchanan the conservative columnist became the party s nominee in the 2000 election advertisement advertisement in november 1999 seeking to make a splash trump rolled out his wealth tax plan in a series of interviews the idea according to trump was to take a chunk of the wealth of the richest americans use it to pay off the national debt and then use the savings to shore up social security implement a middle class tax cut and eliminate the estate tax warren a massachusetts senator running for the 2020 democratic nomination has proposed a wealth tax on those with a net worth of more than 50 million the top 0 1 percent of americans she says the tax would raise 2 75 trillion over 10 years pat choate perot s running mate in 1996 said trump s goal of paying off the national debt was in line with the politics of the time perot himself had run in part on the idea of fiscal responsibility but in 1999 using a wealth tax to pay off the debt seemed to address a problem that was already fading the u s was turning a surplus at the time leading federal reserve chairman alan greenspan to warn congress of negative consequences should liquidity in the treasury bond market dry up advertisement advertisement compounding the confusion trump s figures didn t add up he proposed a 14 25 percent tax on the net worth of americans who had wealth of more than 10 million excluding their primary homes he said the plan would raise 5 7 trillion trump said at the time that economists i ve consulted estimated american wealth at 50 trillion with 40 trillion of that being controlled by the top 1 percent in reality he was off by 10 trillion in the total amount of u s wealth and by double digit percentage points on how much of the country s population controls that wealth according to the federal reserve and economists who have estimated wealth concentration u s households had a total net worth of about 40 trillion and the top 1 percent controlled less than half of that advertisement advertisement rather than tax households with more than 10 million in assets excluding primary homes to raise 5 7 trillion congress would have had to implement a 14 25 percent tax on the net worth of all americans including their primary homes to raise the kind of money trump promised said mark zandi now an economist with moody s analytics and that s assuming no one found a way to cheat the system by undervaluing assets or moving them abroad trump apparently wasn t deeply involved in crunching the numbers when he announced his wealth tax proposal shiflett was helping to write the book that would outline the policies he d support as president shiflett said he had one long interview with stone and trump where they tried to come up with some ideas while he doesn t remember who came up with the wealth tax proposal shiflett said stone drove most of the policy proposals trump had strong opinions on terrorism on north korea and strongly supported a single payer health care system but tax issues were an afterthought shiflett said advertisement advertisement he did make a big thing about the tax that it would cost him a lot of money shiflett said adding it wasn t going to cost him a lot of money because it wasn t going to happen shiflett said after trump won the white house in 2016 a dutch television crew showed up at his home with the book and took its contents seriously a position

the international monetary fund on friday revived a usd 1 5 billion bailout for sri lanka that was suspended over a government power struggle last year that seriously slowed economic growth the washington based lender said officials visiting colombo agreed to re activate the three year loan which started in 2016 and spread the instalments over an additional year the team reached understandings at the staff level with the sri lankan authorities to allow more time for the completion of the economic reform agenda the imf said the fund had been due to release an instalment in october when president maithripala sirisena sacked his prime minister and called fresh elections triggering a two month power struggle in the island nation because of the crisis the economy grew by just 3 0 percent last year making it the slowest expansion in 17 years according to the central bank of sri lanka the imf said it expected sri lanka s growth to improve to 3 5 percent in 2019 sri lanka s supreme court eventually held that sirisena s actons were unconstitutional allowing premier ranil wickremesinghe to resume his duties wickremesinghe told parliament in january that his dismissal on october 26 was a coup and a death blow to the economy during the crisis three international credit rating agencies downgraded the country s debt and the extra borrowing costs forced sri lanka to abandon plans to raise loans abroad but the imf noted that sri lanka s economy was gradually stabilising after the weak economic performance in 2018 in the context of external shocks and domestic political uncertainty at this difficult juncture a concerted effort is needed by all stakeholders to preserve the hard won gains official figures show that sri lanka will have to repay a record usd 5 9 billion in foreign loans in 2019 one of the biggest drags on the balance sheet is national carrier sri lankan airlines which has accumulated losses and debts of over usd 2 billion the government has failed to privatise the airline but the president has revived attempts to find a partner who could inject new capital to keep the airline afloat

in his scathing sturm und drang takedown of the 1851 french dictatorial coup the 18th brumaire of louis napoléon marx remarks that history repeats twice the first time as tragedy the second time as farce thus when luther pit himself against the catholic establishment he put on according to marx the mask of the apostle paul likewise the french revolution of 1789 1814 draped itself alternately in the guise of the roman republic and the roman empire and to marx s chagrin the latter guise in particular enjoyed a revival under louis napoléon bonaparte who drew on it relentlessly to rationalize his retconning of the napoléonic legacy marx in his essay focuses understandably on the evocations of the past that had acquired political significance in france but while france continues even to this day to be partially gripped by nostalgia for the revolutionary heroism requisite to the establishment of an ostensibly neo roman republic in the years from 1979 2007 the anglo american world skewing toward unfettered free markets came to embrace its own brand of historical nostalgia that of the english enlightenment against the evils of the growing welfare state what became known as neoliberalism governance was initially invoked as a return to a laissez faire order dominant throughout the 19th century to this day apologists like samuel gregg argue that the night watchmen state of the 19th century anglo american world left markets alone to bring about an unmatched order of global prosperity and development this ideal order was challenged by re distributive efforts through the mid 20th century and only began to gain traction again in the 1970s and 80s when intellectuals like friedrich hayek and politicians like margaret thatcher surged to popularity and power by the 1990s with the establishment of international legal regimes via institutions such as the world trade organization wto neoliberalism seemed unstoppable indeed figures like francis fukuyama famously declared the end of history arguing that neoliberalism s triumph was so complete there could be no genuine competing ideologies of course all good things must come to an end since the great recession of 2007 08 neoliberalism s popularity has been waning across the globe right wing populists what we have elsewhere called post modern conservatives are emerging across the globe to challenge its internationalism fetishism of the market economy and tendency to engender mass migration and cultural change many neoliberals have expressed surprise at these developments they were confident that the hayekian gambit they staked the international order on that the mass of people would accept massive inequality and social transformation in return for a gradually improving standard of living now seems like a bust some might attribute this development chiefly to the impact of the great recession which destroyed millions of lives across the globe and indeed we do not intend to undervalue the recessions impact as a catalyst but it is essential to understand that the failings of neoliberalism run much deeper it was characterized by an array of internal contradictions that indeed have the air of farce to show why we will begin by demonstrating the superficiality of neoliberal ideology even relative to the enlightenment forebears they invoked but rarely appreciated this is an aspect of a broader project to demonstrate why neoliberal doctrines were riven by intellectual failings and practical challenges from the get go which were often masked by their transient success as a system of hegemonic global governance looking at where neoliberal authors were blind to problems figures like smith understood can demonstrate why it is faltering as a capitalist project even on its own terms neoliberalism and classical political economy whenever the legislature attempts to regulate the differences between masters and their workmen its counsellors are always the masters when the regulation therefore is in favour of the workmen it is always just and equitable but it is sometimes otherwise when in favour of the masters adam smith the wealth of nations while the ideas of hayek and milton friedman indeed bear a superficial resemblance to those of enlightenment thinkers such as adam smith their efforts to cast themselves as their successors are in a crucial sense disingenuous in this short article we will focus on describing the difference between the work of adam smith and friedman this is because few authors better highlight the distinction between the comparative rigor of classical political economy even when endorsing nascent capitalist dynamics against the more stridently ideological accounts of the neoliberals in the wealth of nations smith while supportive of the liberalization of laws impeding trade insists on the importance of the role of government in complimenting the function of the market smith a beneficiary of the rich intellectual climate of eighteenth century scotland itself in large part a product of the scottish government s levying of taxes to finance schools including for the poor argued that governments should pay for the construction of among other things schools bridges and roads he also makes the point throughout the text what has been described as the invisible hand the capacity of individuals to enhance the welfare of the collective through the pursuit of their own ends can only manifest within a society in which the authority of the private sector is held in check due to the fact that its interests are always in some respects different from and even opposite to that of the public in the hands of friedman smith s ideas undergo a considerable metamorphosis for while smith stresses the need for intelligent private sector regulation friedman by contrast espouses something closer to a free market absolutism one limited only by his call for a negative income tax to ameliorate extremes of poverty and his acknowledgement of the occasional need for public sector monopoly as in military defense though even this friedman blames on socialists in the form of the threat from the kremlin barring these exceptions in friedman s view seemingly all forms of government provided social security and regulation from social housing to state licensure can be either privatized or abolished in an effort to reinforce his claim that the private sector is far more efficient than the public one across virtually all sectors friedman also attempts to disprove what he views as the foundational myth of the american welfare state by alleging the federal reserve severely mismanaged the money supply during the great depression this argument however is highly selective and revisionist while friedman blames the great depression on the federal reserve s allowing of the money supply to fall by one third from 1929 1932 he fails to examine the significant role played by the roosevelt administration s 1934 gold reserve act in expanding the american money supply friedman s commentary on the new deal is by no means the only part of capitalism and freedom that is deeply flawed in the seventh chapter of the book capitalism and discrimination friedman argues that the free market is a socially equalizing force due to its indiscriminate nature and that minorities wrongfully attribute to capitalism the residual restrictions they experience rather than to recognize that the free market has been the major factor enabling these restrictions to be as small as they are an utterly hilarious notion given that friedman here appears to be pitting his book against the actual political experience of all social minorities there is something to be said for this argument one not so dissimilar to marx s claim that the the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations but by making the sweeping assertion that the preserves of discrimination in any society are the areas that are most monopolistic in character whereas discrimination against groups of particular color or religion is least in those areas where there is the greatest freedom of competition friedman 1 classifies all governments as de facto more discriminatory than the private sector and 2 treats the question of freedom of competition ahistorically the problems with this are manifold as for point 1 it is clear that in many cases governments have been able to successfully counteract private sector discrimination as is witnessed in an american context by the large number of african americans who found employment with the american government due to its relatively aggressive enforcement of fair employment practices after the 1964 civil rights act regarding point 2 it should be remembered that the principle of freedom of competition is often used to uphold policies which are explicitly discriminatory in nature just consider the right of slave owners to hold slaves as property prior to the emancipation proclamation another problem of friedman s analysis is the way that he like many neoliberals condemns government intervention yet is nevertheless willing to take credit for all of the positive gains it s accrued this is in sharp contrast to smith s position in the wealth of nations smith was far more sensitive to the way in which government often played a fundamental role in securing the rights and property of capital often through dramatic and unwarranted intervention as the quote at the start of this section indicates he felt this was a disaster it meant that capital was able to use government to secure its interests often at the expense of their workers and the population as a whole this is part and parcel of why smith believed the state may have a crucial role to play in assisting workers to ensure they had opportunities for flourishing outside of work and also is foundational to his arguments for breaking up monopolizing tendencies where they arise contrast this with the comparative silence of figures like friedman when government efforts succeed in ameliorating the conditions of the worst well off with the often shrill reaction which occurs when redistributive efforts harm the interests of capital even marginally for instance friedman argues that there is drastically less inequality in western capitalist societies like the scandinavian countries france britain and the united states than in a status society like india or a backward country like egypt and friedman speculates in lieu of data maybe even in russia yet so far is this is true it would only be the case historically due to the combination of developed capitalist industry and redistributive measures imposed by the government keep in mind that when friedman wrote capitalist and freedom the highest marginal tax rate in the united states was 87 similarly friedman notes that while john stuart mill remarked in 1848 that mechanical inventions lightened the day s toil of any human being the chief characteristic of progress and development over the past century is that it has freed the masses from backbreaking toil and has made available to them products and services that were formerly the monopoly of the upper classes without in any corresponding way expanding the products and services available to the wealthy but it never occurs to friedman even fleetingly that the capacity of the populace at large to enjoy the wealth created by more advanced capitalist production may owe to the adoption throughout the developed world of more extensive redistributive measures adam smith let alone karl marx would certainly not have been so blind conclusion neoliberalism post modern conservatism and the contradictions of praxis there are many more contradictions that could be dissected with capitalism and freedom just one of several canonical neoliberal tomes but in sum we can say that capitalism and freedom contributed to the reinforcement of two significant economic fallacies which have been devastating in practice the first of these is that lowering taxes would not lead to significantly heightened inequality a point friedman makes repeatedly throughout the text the second is that the pathway to development lies in a program of full scale deregulation the latter notion in particular came to influence the free trade frenzy of the eighties and nineties as nations both rich and poor eagerly ceded portions of their sovereignty to wed themselves to transnational trade agreements on the basis of the belief that they only stood to benefit on the proving ground of reality however both these assumptions proved problematic on one hand it s clear that the lowering of tax rates in the western capitalist nations described by friedman as well other factors such as anti inflationary monetary policy and a lowered birth rate has indeed contributed to a significant rise in inequality with nations such as the united states and the united kingdom now backsliding into dickensian disparities between rich and poor and facing correspondent political destabilization on the other hand the irony of international free trade is that the countries that have most succeeded in enriching themselves such as japan and china have maintained varyingly stringent regimes of capital controls to prevent national income from falling considerably below gdp or in other words to prevent foreign takeover leading to the excessive payment of rents abroad by contrast regions such as africa which lacked the sovereignty to impose said controls now must contend with a full blown neocolonialism one in which as much as 40 50 per cent of all manufacturing capital is foreign owned no surprise then that the public of the western capitalist nations at large no longer able to bask in the credit bubble that sustained their living standard prior to 2008 09 are suffering from deep neoliberal fatigue while the turn towards post modern conservatism as an alternative is deeply disturbing it is not entirely surprising as observed by slavoj žižek the left must recognize that beneath the banality of its xenophobia lies and vulgarity post modern conservatism can initially propose policies which seem attractive to individuals who have suffered under neoliberalism and its contradictions trump for instance frequently criticizes the liberal economic programs supported by so called elites leftists must understand this if they are to fully grasp the initial appeal of post modern conservative doctrine where we need to be critical is observing that even where they propose superficially attractive policies many of these figures have little intention to implement progressive measure in practice trump s domestic policies such as ending obamacare and lowering tax rates disproportionately favour fiscal dumping and thus the jet set class he regularly rails at only on the question of foreign trade beholden as it is to a system of regulations that nations like china have deftly exploited to prevent foreign annexation has trump likely sensing the diminishing gains associated with it elected to upset the republican status quo fixating on the gamesmanship of other countries also helps trump as thomas piketty has observed distract from his plutocratically directed domestic policies post modern conservatives are a false solution to real problems and can only be counted on to deliver a politics of dishonesty and division only a genuine progressive alternative can provide true solutions to the contradictions engendered by neoliberal doctrine and policy the liberal economic policy dreamt up by the english enlightenment ended in tragedy a dramatic heightening of industrial productivity coupled with the impoverishment of the populace at large this conflict was only subdued with the foundation of the welfare state more recently the existence of the social state helped prevent the 07 08 recession from becoming a re run of the great depression as regular state payments and stimulus packages aided in offsetting the impacts of a pervasive confidence failure neoliberal hegemony then ends in farce as a diminished force within an economic establishment that s only managed to save itself through bathing itself in the chilly waters of socialization

democrats aim to nationalize not only the economy but also families presidential candidates elizabeth warren and kamala harris have both publicly endorsed socialized child care warren s plan is supposedly funded by what else wealth confiscation but only from the rich so don t worry everybody it s okay to use government force to take money from people who have more than you and use it to employ people guess these folks are a okay with capital and brain drain that leads to fewer economic opportunities for women overall child care should be a fundamental right period i remember how hard it was to find affordable high quality child care for my two kids when i was a working mom and it s a zillion times harder today here s how my universalchildcare plan works elizabeth warren ewarren february 19 2019 earlier this month hard left feminist katha pollitt also argued in the new york timesthat now at the apogee of u s government debt and family disintegration is the time to socialize child care when i discussed this idea on npr recently another panelist stephanie coontz a professor at evergreen state college yes that one said the socialized daycare cause gets lots of help from our society getting past this idea that the best thing for kids is to be taken care of privately this is precisely the opposite of what american children need most mothers do not want to work full time inasmuch as any significant demand for a nationalized child care entitlement exists it is largely driven by father abandonment or incapacity mother deprivation is not a sane response to a problem that largely exists due to father deprivation it can in fact only make things worse we can see this simply by using our common sense but it is also backed up by plenty of research on government early childhood programs family bonding and childhood development let s take a look at some of the myriad evidences that nationalized child care is a horrible idea children deeply need their mothers present if you have never seen held or cared for a six week old baby the typical earliest time he may be deposited in daycare you cannot truly understand how helpless and desperately needy such small people are they are essentially still newborns all they have known and loved in their life to that point besides other people s muted voices is their mother she is their bridge to the world and they cling to her first in utter dependence and ideally later to go confidently off into that world because she s taught them how children need their mothers presence both emotionally and physically mothers heartbeats and breaths synchronize those of their babies teaching the little ones to regularize thus stabilizing some of their bodies most important processes mothers breasts automatically change temperature to warm up or cool down baby as he needs her milk naturally changes itself to fit his unique dietary needs at every moment of infancy this is just the tip of the iceberg for how a mother s physical presence is necessary for a child to have his best start in life and it tapers off only gradually over some 15 20 years in another example their mother s heartbeat smell and voice comfort and secure small children in a strange harsh world that takes them a lifetime to begin to understand studies show that children s stress levels immediately drop when they are suffering just upon hearing their mother s voice hearing mom is as good as a hug and can actually help sick children heal faster a small child s deep need for constant loving attention from his mother is psychological as well as physiological psychological research indicates that a strong positive attachment to one s mother particularly from birth to age three provides a defining template for one s ability to love and be loved throughout life this crucial relationship affects socially important outcomes such as crime aggression and the ability to build a strong family the woman who carried and developed a child in her own body has an obvious and irreplaceable advantage over every other contender in ability to respond to that child s early physical and emotional needs the relationship mother and child develop while doing this in the early years and then gradually shifting to support the child s maturity into adulthood as father gradually takes on a stronger role is one of the strongest most irreplaceable and central social bonds known to humankind we mess with it at our peril the process of unfolding as a whole person is deeply linked to our early mothering it cannot happen well if mother is simply not there and no other person on earth even a wonderful and warm and loving person who tries really hard can possibly replace mom everybody knows that it s as obvious as the sun in the sky and the implications for daycare are obvious early institutionalization harms children thus it is no surprise that large long term studies show a correlation between the amount of time a child spends in daycare and a poorer relationship with his parents clinginess aggression risk taking depression defiance and impulsivity the earlier a child enters daycare and the longer he spends there each week the worse these emotional and behavior problems seem to be this has also been shown true in the only two gold standard studies we have of government preschool programs as well as quebec s universal child care entitlement all of these programs showed overall negative effects for children that persisted until adulthood researchers tracking tennessee s pre k found that participants early gains quickly transformed into worse academic performance more discipline problems and higher special education placements than children who hadn t participated a federal evaluation of the nationwide preschool program head start which reaches down to age three found no academic benefits to the program and some emotional harms for example of those who joined head start at age four teachers reported strong evidence of an unfavorable impact on the incidence of children s emotional symptoms and once in third grade these children reported worse peer relations than their counterparts teachers also reported that head start participants were more shy and reticent compared to peers who had spent their early years in private care in quebec researchers wrote the following in an award winning study we report striking evidence that children s outcomes have worsened since the program was introduced we also find suggestive evidence that families we study became more stressed with the introduction of the program this is manifested in increased aggressiveness and anxiety for the children more hostile less consistent parenting for the adults and worse adult mental health and relationship satisfaction that was in 2009 in 2015 the researchers found that these problems for children persisted until adulthood and even contributed to an increase in crime it also resulted in health problem and long term hyperactivity these kinds of negative effects seem to kick in most visibly around 15 20 hours per week of non maternal care the evidence is actually not that mixed people who support government provided care for children that inevitably separates them from their mothers for many hours per week tend to ignore the negative studies or claim the evidence is mixed because some other studies show positive or no registered effects to institutionalizing small children first we must realize the negative findings come from the highest quality studies we have positive or null findings tend to come from more poorly designed studies on many fewer children the most cited preschool studies in particular are very old and were done in boutique settings that are rarely replicated and have never scaled up despite many many tries billions of dollars and huge pr pushes they are not comparable in quality to the findings of these better newer bigger studies second we must place the research discussion into context the recent replication crisis has shown that modern science and especially social science is deeply corrupted the findings of many if not the majority of highly cited studies that have influenced policy and culture cannot be replicated in other words they are completely unreliable this is another reason to be skeptical and prefer randomized controlled trials which include two of the large scale studies i cited above showing negative effects third the social science sector that generates most of the studies on these topics is one of the farthest left spheres in an already overwhelmingly leftist academia in 2015 write carrie lukas and stephen rhoades in national affairs an important study found that the culturally liberal outlook of almost all social psychologists had biased the studies and conclusions they reached the study found that social psychology is a mental monoculture other research has bolstered this finding in other words the body of research is highly unreliable and probably most of it can be ignored they mainly serve to construct a pretense that the research is at least neutral on separating small children from their families for many hours against all natural instincts it s not why so invested in pushing moms away from their kids most of the proposals for programmatically separating children from their families represent the economy on terms that are convenient for big business and collectivists more broadly not on terms that women themselves think are ideal for women as i wrote last year they also represent the economy on terms that damage children 1 let s discuss this remarkable article in nytimes about the importance of universal daycare no not the kathapollitt op ed from sunday an article from 1974 about conditions in the soviet union which sound well see if this remind you of anything oren cass oren_cass february 11 2019 10 10 he d assume we lost the cold war and our economic system had collapsed no no you tell him we won and our economy has been growing by leaps and bounds we re more prosperous than ever then he d shake his head chuckle and walk away because that s just crazy oren cass oren_cass february 11 2019 many of our current economic and education paradigms are anti family they rob from the future to promote consumption today that s not coincidentally america s dominant economic model and it s not sustainable borrowing from tomorrow has to end at some point and the more we do it the worse the crash will be the principle applies to government debt and spending as much as it does to robbing children of the mental and emotional development they need and get from an at home mother in the early years an intuitive understanding of this is probably why six in ten american adults thinkchildren are better off when one parent focuses full time on raising them mothers themselves besides the three quarters with young children who prefer part time or no employment also cite work flexibility and part time work opportunities as desires in roughly equal proportions as wanting cheaper child care yet instead of exploring the preferences that are likely to yield better outcomes for children politicians focus on programs we cannot afford that do not support what most women want nor is best for their kids of course although we often act otherwise adult opinions are far less important than whether this will be good for the children after all if generating tax dollars through more working mothers today cannibalizes on the happiness and productivity of the next generation which already has to pay for tens of trillions in unfunded government programs that will not benefit them it s bad for the country not to mention the less happy and productive individuals affected this is all a head fake yet when we talk about any of these issues we hear little response from those who support this kind of social structure such as pollitt in her nyt op ed and the panelists who discussed this topic with me on npr s on point recently that s because the left has moved beyond robustly justifying entitlements that have the potential to undermine families and thus society itself just like social security has helped bring america s fertility rate nearly below replacement level by reducing generational interdependence instead we mostly hear so called arguments that because somebody somewhere wants something she should have the right to force other people to pay for it wild arguments like these are designed to shift the overton window hard left so that it seems reasonable to only soft collectivize child care through proposals like ivanka trump s paid leave yet what american children need is not a compromise between freedom and collectivism but a full window shift in precisely the opposite direction decrusting employment and child care regulations to give families more freedom to care for their children according to their own preferences strong governmental preferences for marriage and self sufficient child raising and a cultural shift to make it clear that families should be responsible for their own children and that we expect people to make children only when they are capable of caring for those children without stealing the fruits of other people s labor what that requires is not so much money as it does marriage it takes one man and one woman to make a child and it takes one man and one woman to care for that child marriage is by far the most efficient and effective way to raise children it operates on the simple principle of the division of labor one person works to provide for the family and one person works to nurture the family both occupations are needed and both are full time jobs the benefits are completely mutual as well as social men live longer have better overall health and happiness and earn more and achieve higher career success when they are married women are far less likely to be in poverty are happier and enjoy better sex for example both are relieved from the economic pressures and loneliness that typically accompany the single life all this is good for not just the family members immediately involved but for all the rest of us strong families make for a happier and more self reliant society weak or nonexistent families make for a more depressed indebted and government dependent society and we get more weak families when we subsidize their disintegration through things like socialized child care instead we should create a culture that affirms the importance of self sustaining families and the parent child bond

we didn t need raghuram rajan s new book to convince us that economics attracts some of the smartest people on the planet although rajan himself is a fine example of that fact currently a professor at the university of chicago he has served as governor of the reserve bank of india chief economic adviser to india and chief economist of the international monetary fund while receiving along the way nearly every accolade granted to rising young economists back in 2005 for example rajan warned that the new mortgage backed instruments of financial innovation were putting the international economic order at risk at the time former treasury secretary lawrence summers dismissed his warnings as the misguided natterings of a luddite but the subsequent economic collapse and long recession would prove rajan the better observer of market behavior his 2010 book fault lines was denounced by the new york times s paul krugman is there a finer recommendation in economics as unknowingly adopting the politically motivated myth of the american enterprise institute but rajan s discussion seems mostly unexceptionable arguing that the u s government s mortgage subsidies contributed significantly to the creation of the financial crisis in the true lessons of the recession a 2012 follow up article in foreign affairs rajan insisted that the west can t borrow and spend its way to recovery his latest book the third pillar claims that the world s current economic condition proves that finance and government are insufficient vehicles for human flourishing markets and the state rajan points out have essentially abandoned the idea of community and despite the monetary gains of computer connectivity we are paying a steep price both sociologically and politically for the loss of shared civic feeling at the local level rajan is right of course or right at least in principle we didn t need the third pillar to remind us how clear eyed economists can be but the book does the job proving that raghuram rajan is one of our few essential observers of the economic order discerning the consequences of the flow of money around the world unfortunately the third pillar also demonstrates how blind economists can be think of economics not as an intellectual discipline think of it instead as a cultural mechanism for identifying the world s smartest idiots raghuram rajan s particular blind spot is metaphysics and the existential reality of the things he hopes to promote the third pillar wants to pose community as necessary for civilization in the old metaphor of a three legged stool rajan pictures the seat of culture resting on finance government and community each leg aids the others and yet opposes them resisting their excesses when government becomes too oppressive finance takes its revenge as taxpayers flee and less oppressed communities flourish when finance becomes too powerful communities grow angry and government feels compelled to step in and so on find the right balance between them rajan writes and society prospers right balance is our problem these days strong economic growth will always prove unstable if unameliorated by the benefits of community national government will flutter between indifference and intrusion without the particularized knowledge that community provides rajan notes for example the curious fact that new businesses tend to find better start up loans when their options are limited to only a few local banks he lays out the evidence that suggests ranchers do better when disputes over fences and wandering livestock are handled with local cooperation rather than nationalized in actions by the police written law and distant civil courts and from such examples in his opening chapters comes the conclusion that community succeeds because its apparent problems offering only limited choices and narrow solutions are in fact advantages community may work precisely because of these constrictions which gives its members confidence that they will stay mutually committed there are several well worn paths that an author could follow from this point including communitarianism the catholic social theory of subsidiarity or even full blown distributionism and sometimes rajan can sound as though he s channeling g k chesterton around 1920 laying out the history in which insufficiently constrained nation states and insufficiently fettered finance mechanisms undid communities around the globe in our much later time rajan sees although his clarity about the point varies that computer and cellphone connectivity fails to provide a sufficient substitute for real community the question of course is what then makes community real what are its unavoidable characteristics what are its minimal arrangements what constitutes its essential being i have suggested elsewhere that shared grief is necessary the living give us crowds the dead give us communities a community without a graveyard is not a community but even short of such descents into the metaphysics of political theory any attempt to insist on the importance of community will require some way of identifying the key existential elements the locatedness in place and time that distinguishes say virtual communities online from real communities in the physical world and rajan seems simply to lack whatever is necessary to identify community in this way readers will approach the book glad to find an economist praising community and fretting about the twin millstones of nation states and financial markets grinding down to chaff the shared experience of local human interaction in the end however the third pillar proves a disappointment brilliant as he is rajan is blind to anything he can t see through his economic and political lenses community gets defined politically and economically in the book which eventually reduces community to politics and economics exactly what the third pillar says community is important because it is not he ends up praising the fading of national borders after chapters explaining the advantages of the homogenous communities destined to be destroyed by lack of border control and so by the end of the third pillar the idea of community decays into a vague set of voters rajan recognizes that the modern nation state is suffering a loss of density its very fragility creating dangerous populist efforts to restore the loss his central concern he notes is the passions that are unleashed when an imagined community like the nation fulfills the need for belonging that the neighborhood can no longer meet but he nonetheless recommends ever greater powers granted to nation states including powers to intrude into the internal operations of communities to demand the nationally demanded principle of inclusiveness that those communities will have difficulty surviving the idea of community started strongly in the third pillar as a support for culture empowered to stop the destruction caused by state and market but it proves only a whimper that things used to be better at best an economic and political device controlled by economics and politics for fooling people into not acting on their cultural unhappiness brilliant of course and stupid
