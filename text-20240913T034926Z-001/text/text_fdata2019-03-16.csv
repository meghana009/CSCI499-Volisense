set out below in full and unedited text you should carefully consider the specific risks and uncertainties set forth below and the other information contained within this strategic report as these are important factors that could cause the company s actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from our expected or historical results we operate in a highly competitive environment and unanticipated changes relating to competitive factors in our industry including ongoing industry consolidation may impact our results of operations we compete on the basis of a number of different factors such as product offerings project execution customer service and price in order to compete effectively we must develop and implement innovative technologies and processes and execute our clients projects effectively we can give no assurances that we will continue to be able to compete effectively with the products and services or prices offered by our competitors our industry including our customers and competitors has experienced unanticipated changes in recent years moreover the industry is undergoing vertical and horizontal consolidation to create economies of scale and control the value chain which may affect demand for our products and services because of price concessions for our competitors or decreased customer capital spending this consolidation activity could impact our ability to maintain market share maintain or increase pricing for our products and services or negotiate favorable contract terms with our customers and suppliers which could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows we are unable to predict what effect consolidations and other competitive factors in the industry may have on prices capital spending by our customers our selling strategies our competitive position our ability to retain customers or our ability to negotiate favorable agreements with our customers demand for our products and services depends on oil and gas industry activity and expenditure levels which are directly affected by trends in the demand for and price of crude oil and natural gas we are substantially dependent on conditions in the oil and gas industry including i the level of exploration development and production activity ii capital spending and iii the processing of oil and natural gas in refining units petrochemical sites and natural gas liquefaction plants by energy companies that are our customers any substantial or extended decline in these expenditures may result in the reduced pace of discovery and development of new reserves of oil and gas and the reduced exploration of existing wells which could adversely affect demand for our products and services and in certain instances result in the cancellation modification or re scheduling of existing orders in our backlog these factors could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability the level of exploration development and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include but are not limited to the following demand for hydrocarbons which is affected by worldwide population growth economic growth rates and general economic and business conditions costs of exploring for producing and delivering oil and natural gas political and economic uncertainty and socio political unrest government policies and subsidies related to the production use and exportation importation of oil and natural gas available excess production capacity within the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec and the level of oil production by non opec countries oil refining and transportation capacity and shifts in end customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas technological advances affecting energy consumption development exploitation and relative price and availability of alternative sources of energy and our customers shift of capital to the development of these sources volatility in and access to capital and credit markets which may affect our customers activity levels and spending for our products and services and natural disasters the oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge while oil and natural gas prices have recently started to rebound from the downturn that began in 2014 the market remains quite volatile and the sustainability of the price recovery and business activity levels is dependent on variables beyond our control such as geopolitical stability opec s actions to regulate its production capacity changes in demand patterns and international sanctions and tariffs continued volatility or any future reduction in demand for oilfield services and could further adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our success depends on our ability to develop implement and protect new technologies and services our success depends on the ongoing development and implementation of new product designs including the processes used by us to produce and market our products and on our ability to protect and maintain critical intellectual property assets related to these developments if we are not able to obtain patent trade secret or other protection of our intellectual property rights if our patents are unenforceable or the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology or if we are not able to adequately protect our patents or trade secrets we may not be able to continue to develop our services products and related technologies additionally our competitors may be able to independently develop technology that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets if any of these events occurs we may be unable to meet evolving industry requirements or do so at prices acceptable to our customers which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows the industries in which we operate or have operated expose us to potential liabilities including the installation or use of our products which may not be covered by insurance or may be in excess of policy limits or for which expected recoveries may not be realized we are subject to potential liabilities arising from among other possibilities equipment malfunctions equipment misuse personal injuries and natural disasters any of which may result in hazardous situations including uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids fires and explosions although we have obtained insurance against many of these risks our insurance may not be adequate to cover our liabilities further the insurance may not generally be available in the future or if available premiums may not be commercially justifiable if we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or if we were to incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance such potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows we may lose money on fixed price contracts as customary for some of our projects we often agree to provide products and services under fixed price contracts we are subject to material risks in connection with such fixed price contracts it is not possible to estimate with complete certainty the final cost or margin of a project at the time of bidding or during the early phases of its execution actual expenses incurred in executing these fixed price contracts can vary substantially from those originally anticipated for several reasons including but not limited to the following unforeseen additional costs related to the purchase of substantial equipment necessary for contract fulfillment or labor shortages in the markets for where the contracts are performed mechanical failure of our production equipment and machinery delays caused by local weather conditions and or natural disasters including earthquakes and floods and a failure of suppliers subcontractors or joint venture partners to perform their contractual obligations the realization of any material risks and unforeseen circumstances could also lead to delays in the execution schedule of a project we may be held liable to a customer should we fail to meet project milestones or deadlines or to comply with other contractual provisions additionally delays in certain projects could lead to delays in subsequent projects for which production equipment and machinery currently being utilized on a project were intended pursuant to the terms of fixed price contracts we are not always able to increase the price of the contract to reflect factors that were unforeseen at the time its bid was submitted and this risk may be heightened for projects with longer terms depending on the size of a project variations from estimated contract performance or variations in multiple contracts could have a significant impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows new capital asset construction projects for vessels and manufacturing facilities are subject to risks including delays and cost overruns which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations we regularly carry out capital asset construction projects to maintain upgrade and develop our asset base and such projects are subject to risks of delay and cost overruns that are inherent to any large construction project and are the result of numerous factors including but not limited to the following shortages of key equipment materials or skilled labor unscheduled delays in the delivery or ordered materials and equipment design and engineering issues and shipyard delays and performance issues failure to complete construction in time or the inability to complete construction in accordance with its design specifications may result in loss of revenue additionally capital expenditures for construction projects could materially exceed the initially planned investments or can result in delays in putting such assets into operation our failure to timely deliver our backlog could affect future sales profitability and relationships with our customers many of the contracts we enter into with our customers require long manufacturing lead times due to complex technical and logistical requirements these contracts may contain clauses related to liquidated damages or financial incentives regarding on time delivery and a failure by us to deliver in accordance with customer expectations could subject us to liquidated damages or loss of financial incentives reduce our margins on these contracts or result in damage to existing customer relationships the ability to meet customer delivery schedules for this backlog is dependent upon a number of factors including but not limited to access to the raw materials required for production an adequately trained and capable workforce subcontractor performance project engineering expertise and execution sufficient manufacturing plant capacity and appropriate planning and scheduling of manufacturing resources failure to deliver backlog in accordance with expectations could negatively impact our financial performance we face risks relating to our reliance on subcontractors suppliers and our joint venture partners we generally rely on subcontractors suppliers and our joint venture partners for the performance of our contracts although we are not dependent upon any single supplier certain geographic areas of our business or a project or group of projects may depend heavily on certain suppliers for raw materials or semi finished goods any difficulty in engaging suitable subcontractors or acquiring equipment and materials could compromise our ability to generate a significant margin on a project or to complete such project within the allocated timeframe if subcontractors suppliers or joint venture partners refuse to adhere to their contractual obligations with us or are unable to do so due to a deterioration of their financial condition we may be unable to find a suitable replacement at a comparable price or at all moreover the failure of one of our joint venture partners to perform their obligations in a timely and satisfactory manner could lead to additional obligations and costs being imposed on us as we may be obligated to assume our defaulting partner s obligations or compensate our customers any delay failure to meet contractual obligations or other event beyond our control or not foreseeable by us that is attributable to a subcontractor supplier or joint venture partner could lead to delays in the overall progress of the project and or generate significant extra costs even if we are entitled to make a claim for these extra costs against the defaulting supplier subcontractor or joint venture partner we may be unable to recover the entirety of these costs and this could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations our businesses are dependent on the continuing services of certain of our key managers and employees we depend on key personnel the loss of any key personnel could adversely impact our business if we are unable to implement key strategies or transactions in their absence the loss of qualified employees or failure to retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to successfully conduct research activities and develop marketable products and services pirates endanger our maritime employees and assets we face material piracy risks in the gulf of guinea the somali basin and the gulf of aden and to a lesser extent in southeast asia malacca and the singapore straits piracy represents a risk for both our projects and our vessels which operate and transport through sensitive maritime areas such risks have the potential to significantly harm our crews and to negatively impact the execution schedule for our projects if our maritime employees or assets are endangered additional time may be required to find an alternative solution which may delay project realization and negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations seasonal and weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our services and operations our business may be materially affected by variation from normal weather patterns such as cooler or warmer summers and winters adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico or extreme winter conditions in canada russia and the north sea may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers operations cause supply disruptions or loss of productivity and may result in a loss of revenue or damage to our equipment and facilities which may or may not be insured any of these events or outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations due to the types of contracts we enter into and the markets in which we operate the cumulative loss of several major contracts customers or alliances may have an adverse effect on our results of operations we often enter into large long term contracts that collectively represent a significant portion of our revenue these agreements if terminated or breached may have a larger impact on our operating results or our financial condition than shorter term contracts due to the value at risk moreover the global market for the production transportation and transformation of hydrocarbons and by products as well as the other industrial markets in which we operate is dominated by a small number of companies as a result our business relies on a limited number of customers if we were to lose several key contracts customers or alliances over a relatively short period of time we could experience a significant adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our operations require us to comply with numerous regulations violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our operations and manufacturing activities are governed by international regional transnational and national laws and regulations in every place where we operate relating to matters such as environmental protection health and safety labor and employment import export controls currency exchange bribery and corruption and taxation these laws and regulations are complex frequently change and have tended to become more stringent over time in the event the scope of these laws and regulations expand in the future the incremental cost of compliance could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our international operations are subject to anti corruption laws and regulations such as the u s foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the u k bribery act of 2010 the bribery act the anti corruption provisions of french law n 2016 1691 dated december 9 2016 relating to transparency anti corruption and modernization of the business practice sapin ii law the brazilian anti bribery act also known as the brazilian clean company act and economic and trade sanctions including those administered by the united nations the european union the office of foreign assets control of the u s department of the treasury u s treasury and the u s department of state the fcpa prohibits providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage we may deal with both governments and state owned business enterprises the employees of which are considered foreign officials for purposes of the fcpa the provisions of the bribery act extend beyond bribery of foreign public officials and are more onerous than the fcpa in a number of other respects including jurisdiction non exemption of facilitation payments and penalties economic and trade sanctions restrict our transactions or dealings with certain sanctioned countries territories and designated persons as a result of doing business in foreign countries including through partners and agents we are exposed to a risk of violating anti corruption laws and sanctions regulations some of the international locations in which we currently or may in the future operate have developing legal systems and may have higher levels of corruption than more developed nations our continued expansion and worldwide operations including in developing countries our development of joint venture relationships worldwide and the employment of local agents in the countries in which we operate increases the risk of violations of anti corruption laws and economic and trade sanctions violations of anti corruption laws and economic and trade sanctions are punishable by civil penalties including fines denial of export privileges injunctions asset seizures debarment from government contracts and termination of existing contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses as well as criminal fines and imprisonment in addition any major violations could have a significant impact on our reputation and consequently on our ability to win future business we have implemented internal controls designed to minimize and detect potential violations of laws and regulations in a timely manner but we can provide no assurance that such policies and procedures will be followed at all times or will effectively detect and prevent violations of the applicable laws by one or more of our employees consultants agents or partners the occurrence of any such violation could subject us to penalties and material adverse consequences on our business financial condition or results of operations compliance with environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations environmental laws and regulations in various countries affect the equipment systems and services we design market and sell as well as the facilities where we manufacture our equipment and systems and any other operations we undertake we are required to invest financial and managerial resources to comply with environmental laws and regulations and believe that we will continue to be required to do so in the future failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties the imposition of remedial obligations the issuance of orders enjoining our operations or other claims these laws and regulations as well as the adoption of new legal requirements or other laws and regulations affecting exploration and development of drilling for crude oil and natural gas are becoming increasingly strict and could adversely affect our business and operating results by increasing our costs limiting the demand for our products and services or restricting our operations existing or future laws and regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change may adversely affect our business existing or future laws concerning the release of greenhouse gas emissions or that concern climate change including laws and regulations that seek to mitigate the effects of climate change may adversely impact demand for the equipment systems and services we design market and sell for example oil and natural gas exploration and production may decline as a result of such laws and regulations and as a consequence demand for our equipment systems and services may also decline in addition such laws and regulations may also result in more onerous obligations with respect to our operations including the facilities where we manufacture our equipment and systems such decline in demand for our equipment systems and services and such onerous obligations in respect of our operations may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows disruptions in the political regulatory economic and social conditions of the countries in which we conduct business could adversely affect our business or results of operations we operate in various countries across the world instability and unforeseen changes in any of the markets in which we conduct business including economically and politically volatile areas could have an adverse effect on the demand for our services and products our financial condition or our results of operations these factors include but are not limited to the following nationalization and expropriation potentially burdensome taxation inflationary and recessionary markets including capital and equity markets civil unrest labor issues political instability terrorist attacks cyber terrorism military activity and wars supply disruptions in key oil producing countries the ability of opec to set and maintain production levels and pricing trade restrictions trade protection measures price controls or trade disputes sanctions such as prohibitions or restrictions by the united states against countries that are the targets of economic sanctions or are designated as state sponsors of terrorism foreign ownership restrictions import or export licensing requirements restrictions on operations trade practices trade partners and investment decisions resulting from domestic and foreign laws and regulations regime changes changes in and the administration of treaties laws and regulations inability to repatriate income or capital reductions in the availability of qualified personnel foreign currency fluctuations or currency restrictions and fluctuations in the interest rate component of forward foreign currency rates dtc and euroclear paris may cease to act as depository and clearing agencies for our shares our shares were issued into the facilities of the depository trust company dtc with respect to shares listed on the nyse and euroclear with respect to shares listed on euronext paris dtc and euroclear being referred to as the clearance services the clearance services are widely used mechanisms that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in their respective systems which include many large banks and brokerage firms the clearance services have general discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agencies for our shares if either of the clearance services determine at any time that our shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities then we believe that our shares would not be eligible for continued listing on the nyse or euronext paris as applicable and trading in our shares would be disrupted any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our shares the united kingdom s proposed withdrawal from the european union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business we are based in the united kingdom and have operational headquarters in paris france houston texas united states and in london united kingdom with worldwide operations including material business operations in europe in june 2016 a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum brexit the referendum was advisory and the united kingdom government served notice under article 50 of the treaty of the european union in march 2017 to formally initiate a withdrawal process the united kingdom and the european union have had a two year period under article 50 to negotiate the terms for the united kingdom s withdrawal from the european union the withdrawal agreement and political declaration that were endorsed at a special meeting of the european council on november 25 2018 did not receive the approval of the united kingdom parliament in january 2019 further discussions are ongoing although the european commission has stated that the european union will not reopen the withdrawal agreement any extension of the negotiation period for withdrawal will require the consent of the remaining 27 member states of the european union brexit has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union and has given rise to calls for certain regions within the united kingdom to preserve their place in the european union by separating from the united kingdom these developments or the perception that any of them could occur could have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of the global financial markets and could significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets asset valuations currency exchange rates and credit ratings may be especially subject to increased market volatility lack of clarity about applicable future laws regulations or treaties as the united kingdom negotiates the terms of a withdrawal as well as the operation of any such rules pursuant to any withdrawal terms including financial laws and regulations tax and free trade agreements intellectual property rights supply chain logistics environmental health and safety laws and regulations immigration laws employment laws and other rules that would apply to us and our subsidiaries could increase our costs restrict our access to capital within the united kingdom and the european union depress economic activity and further decrease foreign direct investment in the united kingdom for example withdrawal from the european union could depending on the negotiated terms of such withdrawal eliminate the benefit of certain tax related e u directives currently applicable to u k companies such as us including the parent subsidiary directive and the interest and royalties directive which could subject to any relief under an available tax treaty raise our tax costs if the united kingdom and the european union are unable to negotiate mutually acceptable withdrawal terms or if other e u member states pursue withdrawal barrier free access between the united kingdom and other e u member states or within the european economic area overall could be diminished or eliminated any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as an english public limited company we must meet certain additional financial requirements before we may declare dividends or repurchase shares and certain capital structure decisions may require stockholder approval which may limit our flexibility to manage our capital structure we may not be able to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our ordinary shares in accordance with our announced intent or at all under english law we will only be able to declare dividends make distributions or repurchase shares other than out of the proceeds of a new issuance of shares for that purpose out of distributable profits distributable profits are a company s accumulated realized profits to the extent that they have not been previously utilized by distribution or capitalization less its accumulated realized losses to the extent that they have not been previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital duly made in addition as a public limited company incorporated in england and wales we may only make a distribution if the amount of our net assets is not less than the aggregate of our called up share capital and non distributable reserves and to the extent that the distribution does not reduce the amount of those assets to less than that aggregate following the merger we implemented a court approved reduction of our capital which was completed on june 29 2017 in order to create distributable profits to support the payment of possible future dividends or future share repurchases our articles of association permit us by ordinary resolution of the stockholders to declare dividends provided that the directors have made a recommendation as to its amount the dividend shall not exceed the amount recommended by the board of directors the directors may also decide to pay interim dividends if it appears to them that the profits available for distribution justify the payment when recommending or declaring payment of a dividend the directors are required under english law to comply with their duties including considering our future financial requirements in addition the board of directors determinations regarding dividends and share repurchases will depend on a variety of other factors including our net income cash flow generated from operations or other sources liquidity position and potential alternative uses of cash such as acquisitions as well as economic conditions and expected future financial results our ability to declare and pay future dividends and make future share repurchases will depend on our future financial performance which in turn depends on the successful implementation of our strategy and on financial competitive regulatory technical and other factors general economic conditions demand and selling prices for our products and services and other factors specific to our industry or specific projects many of which are beyond our control therefore our ability to generate cash depends on the performance of our operations and could be limited by decreases in our profitability or increases in costs regulatory changes capital expenditures or debt servicing requirements any failure to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our ordinary shares could negatively impact our reputation harm investor confidence in us and cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline our existing and future debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding debt we have substantial existing debt as of december 31 2018 after giving effect to the merger our total debt is 4 2 billion we also have the capacity under our 2 5 billion credit facility in addition to our bilateral facilities to incur substantial additional debt our level of debt could have important consequences for example it could make it more difficult for us to make payments on our debt require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions distributions and other general partnership purposes increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions limit our ability to obtain additional financing to enable us to react to changes in our business or place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt additionally any failure to meet required payments on our debt or to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments in the event of such default the holders of such debt could elect to declare all the amounts outstanding under such instruments to be due and payable the london inter bank offered rate libor and certain other interest benchmarks may be subject to regulatory guidance and or reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences the united kingdom s financial conduct authority which regulates libor has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit libor rates after 2021 and it is unclear if libor will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating libor will evolve if libor ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating libor change from their current form interest rates on our current or future debt obligations may be adversely affected a downgrade in our debt rating could restrict our ability to access the capital markets the terms of our financing are in part dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies we cannot provide assurance that any of our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels capital structure planned asset purchases or sales near and long term production growth opportunities market position liquidity asset quality cost structure product mix customer and geographic diversification and commodity price levels a downgrade in our credit ratings particularly to non investment grade levels could limit our ability to access the debt capital markets or refinance our existing debt or cause us to refinance or issue debt with less favorable terms and conditions moreover our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing as well as have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations uninsured claims and litigation against us including intellectual property litigation could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings we have insurance coverage against operating hazards including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products or operating environments in which our employees operate to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available however our insurance policies are subject to exclusions limitations and other conditions and may not apply in all cases for example where willful wrongdoing on our part is alleged additionally the nature and amount of that insurance may not be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation additionally in individual circumstances certain proceedings or cases may also lead to our formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits our financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected claims not covered by insurance in addition the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs the resolution of these claims could require us to enter into license agreements or develop alternative technologies the development of these technologies or the payment of royalties under licenses from third parties if available would increase our costs if a license were not available or we are not able to develop alternative technologies we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we conduct operations around the world in many different currencies because a significant portion of our revenue is denominated in currencies other than our reporting currency the u s dollar changes in exchange rates will produce fluctuations in our revenue costs and earnings and may also affect the book value of our assets and liabilities and related equity although we do not hedge translation impacts on earnings we do hedge transaction impacts on margins and earnings where the transaction is not in the functional currency of the business unit our efforts to minimize our currency exposure through such hedging transactions may not be successful depending on market and business conditions moreover certain currencies in which the company trades specifically currencies in countries such as angola and nigeria do not actively trade in the global foreign exchange markets and may subject us to increased foreign currency exposures as a result fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we may incur significant merger related costs we have incurred and expect to incur additional non recurring direct and indirect costs associated with the merger in addition to the costs and expenses associated with the consummation of the merger we are also integrating processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems while we have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred relating to the merger and continue to assess the magnitude of these costs there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration and implementation expenses these costs and expenses could reduce the realization of efficiencies and strategic benefits we expect to achieve from the merger and the expected net benefit of the merger may not be achieved in the near term or at all our acquisition and divestiture activities involve substantial risks we have made and expect to continue to pursue acquisitions dispositions or other investments that may strategically fit our business and or growth objectives we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to locate suitable acquisitions dispositions or investments or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us even if we do successfully execute such transactions they may not result in anticipated benefits which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results if we are unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings including any expected increases in revenues and operating results we may not be able to successfully cause a buyer of a divested business to assume the liabilities of that business or even if such liabilities are assumed we may have difficulties enforcing our rights contractual or otherwise against the buyer we may invest in companies or businesses that fail causing a loss of all or part of our investment in addition if we determine that an other than temporary decline in the fair value exists for a company in which we have invested we may have to write down that investment to its fair value and recognize the related write down as an investment loss a failure of our it infrastructure including as a result of cyber attacks could adversely impact our business and results of operations the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our it systems accordingly we rely upon the capacity reliability and security of our it hardware and software infrastructure and our ability to expand and update this infrastructure in response to changing needs we have been subject to cyber attacks in the past including phishing malware and ransomware and although no such attack has had a material adverse effect on our business this may not be the case with future attacks our systems may be vulnerable to damages from such attacks as well as from natural disasters failures in hardware or software power fluctuations unauthorized access to data and systems loss or destruction of data including confidential customer information human error and other similar disruptions and we cannot give assurance that any security measures we have implemented or may in the future implement will be sufficient to identify and prevent or mitigate such disruptions we rely on third parties to support the operation of our it hardware software infrastructure and cloud services and in certain instances utilize web based and software as a service applications the security and privacy measures implemented by such third parties as well as the measures implemented by any entities we acquire or with whom we do business may not be sufficient to identify or prevent cyber attacks and any such attacks may have a material adverse effect on our business while our it vendor agreements typically contain provisions that seek to eliminate or limit our exposure to liability for damages from a cyber attack we cannot ensure such provisions will withstand legal challenges or cover all or any such damages threats to our it systems arise from numerous sources not all of which are within our control including fraud or malice on the part of third parties accidental technological failure electrical or telecommunication outages failures of computer servers or other damage to our property or assets outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts the failure of our it systems or those of our vendors to perform as anticipated for any reason or any significant breach of security could disrupt our business and result in numerous adverse consequences including reduced effectiveness and efficiency of operations inappropriate disclosure of confidential and proprietary information reputational harm increased overhead costs and loss of important information which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future our insurance coverage may not cover all of the costs and liabilities we incur as the result of any disruptions or security breaches and if our business continuity and or disaster recovery plans do not effectively and timely resolve issues resulting from a cyber attack we may suffer material adverse effects on our business we are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy data protection and data security our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business we are subject to international data protection laws such as the general data protection regulation or gdpr in the european economic area the gdpr imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data which have increased our obligations including for example by requiring more robust disclosures to individuals notifications in some cases of data breaches to regulators and data subjects and a record of processing and other policies and procedures to be maintained to adhere to the accountability principle in addition we are subject to the gdpr s rules on transferring personal data outside of the eea including to the united states and some of these rules are currently being challenged in the courts failure to comply with the requirements of gdpr and the local laws implementing or supplementing the gdpr could result in fines of up to 20 000 000 or up to 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher as well as other administrative penalties we are likely to be required to expend significant capital and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance with the gdpr and other applicable data protection legislation and we may be required to put in place additional control mechanisms which could be onerous and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we may not realize the cost savings synergies and other benefits expected from the merger the combination of two independent companies is a complex costly and time consuming process as a result we will be required to continue to devote management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of technip and fmc technologies the integration process may disrupt our businesses and if ineffectively implemented could preclude realization of the full benefits expected from the merger our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the operations of technip and fmc technologies or otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of the merger could interrupt and seriously harm the results of our operations in addition the overall integration of technip and fmc technologies may result in unanticipated expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of client relationships diversion of management s attention or other problems and such problems could if material cause our stock price to decline the difficulties of combining the operations of technip and fmc technologies include but are not limited to the following managing a significantly larger company coordinating geographically separate organizations the potential diversion of management focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters aligning and executing our strategy retaining existing customers and attracting new customers maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees integrating two unique business cultures the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations coordinating distribution and marketing efforts integrating it communications and other systems changes in applicable laws and regulations managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the merger and taking actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals many of these factors are at least partially outside our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue and diversion of management s time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if the operations of technip and fmc technologies are successfully integrated we may not realize the full benefits of the merger including the synergies cost savings sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all as a result the combination of technip and fmc technologies may not result in the realization of the full benefits expected from the merger the irs may not agree that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for u s federal tax purposes and may seek to impose an excise tax on gains recognized by certain individuals although we are incorporated in the united kingdom the u s internal revenue service the irs may assert that we should be treated as a u s domestic corporation and therefore a u s tax resident for u s federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the u s internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code for u s federal income tax purposes a corporation i is generally considered a domestic corporation or u s tax resident if it is organized in the united states or of any state or political subdivision therein and ii is generally considered a foreign corporation or non u s tax resident if it is not considered a domestic corporation because we are a u k incorporated entity we would be considered a foreign corporation and therefore a non u s tax resident under these rules section 7874 of the code section 7874 provides an exception under which a foreign incorporated entity may in certain circumstances be treated as a domestic corporation for u s federal income tax purposes we do not believe this exception applies however the section 7874 rules are complex and subject to detailed regulations the application of which is uncertain in various respects it is possible that the irs will not agree with our position should the irs successfully challenge our position it is also possible that an excise tax under section 4985 of the code the section 4985 excise tax may be assessed against certain disqualified individuals including former officers and directors of fmc technologies inc on certain stock based compensation held thereby we may if we determine that it is appropriate provide disqualified individuals with a payment with respect to the section 4985 excise tax so that on a net after tax basis they would be in the same position as if no such section 4985 excise tax had been applied in addition there can be no assurance that there will not be a change in law or interpretation including with retroactive effect that might cause us to be treated as a domestic corporation for u s federal income tax purposes u s tax laws and or guidance could affect our ability to engage in certain acquisition strategies and certain internal restructurings even if we are treated as a foreign corporation for u s federal income tax purposes section 7874 u s treasury regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder may adversely affect our ability to engage in certain future acquisitions of u s businesses or to restructure the non u s members of our group these limitations if applicable may affect the tax efficiencies that otherwise might be achieved in such potential future transactions or restructurings in addition the irs and the u s treasury have issued final and temporary regulations providing that even if we are treated as a foreign corporation for u s federal income tax purposes certain intercompany debt instruments issued on or after april 4 2016 will be treated as equity for u s federal income tax purposes therefore limiting u s tax benefits and resulting in possible u s withholding taxes although recent guidance from the u s treasury proposes deferring certain documentation requirements that would otherwise be imposed with respect to covered debt instruments and further indicates that these rules generally are the subject of continuing study and may be further materially modified the current regulations may adversely affect our future effective tax rate and could also impact our ability to engage in future restructurings if such transactions cause an existing intercompany debt instrument to be treated as reissued for u s federal income tax purposes we are subject to the tax laws of numerous jurisdictions challenges to the interpretation of or future changes to such laws could adversely affect us we and our subsidiaries are subject to tax laws and regulations in the united kingdom the united states france and numerous other jurisdictions in which we and our subsidiaries operate these laws and regulations are inherently complex and we are and will continue to be obligated to make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws and regulations to our operations and businesses the interpretation and application of these laws and regulations could be challenged by the relevant governmental authorities which could result in administrative or judicial procedures actions or sanctions which could be material in addition the u s congress the u k government the european union the organization for economic co operation and development the oecd and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations new tax initiatives directives and rules such as the u s tax cuts and jobs act the oecd s base erosion and profit shifting initiative and the european union s anti tax avoidance directives may increase our tax burden and require additional compliance related expenditures as a result our financial condition results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected further changes including with retroactive effect in the tax laws of the united states the united kingdom the european union or other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could also adversely affect us we may not qualify for benefits under tax treaties entered into between the united kingdom and other countries we operate in a manner such that we believe we are eligible for benefits under tax treaties between the united kingdom and other countries however our ability to qualify for such benefits will depend on whether we are treated as a u k tax resident the requirements contained in each treaty and applicable domestic laws on the facts and circumstances surrounding our operations and management and on the relevant interpretation of the tax authorities and courts for example because of the anticipated withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union brexit we may lose some or all of the benefits of tax treaties between the united states and the remaining members of the european union and face higher tax liabilities which may be significant another example is the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting the mli which entered into force for participating jurisdictions on july 1 2018 the mli recommends that countries adopt a limitation on benefit rule and or a principle purposes test rule with regards to their tax treaties the scope and interpretation of these rules as adopted pursuant to the mli are presently under development but the application of either rule might deny us tax treaty benefits that were previously available the failure by us or our subsidiaries to qualify for benefits under tax treaties entered into between the united kingdom and other countries could result in adverse tax consequences to us including an increased tax burden and increased filing obligations and could result in certain tax consequences of owning and disposing of our shares we intend to be treated exclusively as a resident of the united kingdom for tax purposes but french or other tax authorities may seek to treat us as a tax resident of another jurisdiction we are incorporated in the united kingdom english law currently provides that we will be regarded as a u k resident for tax purposes from incorporation and shall remain so unless i we are concurrently a resident in another jurisdiction applying the tax residence rules of that jurisdiction that has a double tax treaty with the united kingdom and ii there is a tiebreaker provision in that tax treaty which allocates exclusive residence to that other jurisdiction in this regard we have a permanent establishment in france to satisfy certain french tax requirements imposed by the french tax code with respect to the merger although it is intended that we will be treated as having our exclusive place of tax residence in the united kingdom the french tax authorities may claim that we are a tax resident of france if we were to fail to maintain our place of effective management in the united kingdom any such claim would be settled between the french and u k tax authorities pursuant to the mutual assistance procedure provided for by the tax treaty concluded between france and the united kingdom there is no assurance that these authorities would reach an agreement that we will remain exclusively a u k tax resident a determination which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects a failure to maintain exclusive tax residency in the united kingdom could result in adverse tax consequences to us and our subsidiaries and could result in certain adverse changes in the tax consequences of owning and disposing of our shares the company has identified material weaknesses relating to internal control over financial reporting if our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses or if one or more additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to further restate our financial results which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows management identified material weaknesses in the company s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2017 and december 31 2018 as described in the corporate governance report of this u k annual report a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis as a result of the material weaknesses management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december 31 2018 in addition as a result of these material weaknesses our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of december 31 2018 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective until these material weaknesses are remediated they could lead to errors in our financial results and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows if our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses or if one or more additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows restrict our ability to access the capital markets require significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies subject us to fines penalties or judgments harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence and in the market price of our stock additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting could be identified in the future any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation could result in additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under section 404 of the u s sarbanes oxley act of 2002 and the rules promulgated under section 404 the existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information leading to among other things a decline in our stock price we can give no assurances that the measures we have taken to date or any future measures we may take will fully remediate the material weaknesses identified or that any additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future due to our failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting in addition even if we are successful in strengthening our controls and procedures those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or ensure

principal risks and uncertainties the principal risks and uncertainties at set out in the strategic report of the 2018 annual report are set out below in full and unedited text you should carefully consider the specific risks and uncertainties set forth below and the other information contained within this strategic report as these are important factors that could cause the company s actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from our expected or historical results we operate in a highly competitive environment and unanticipated changes relating to competitive factors in our industry including ongoing industry consolidation may impact our results of operations we compete on the basis of a number of different factors such as product offerings project execution customer service and price in order to compete effectively we must develop and implement innovative technologies and processes and execute our clients projects effectively we can give no assurances that we will continue to be able to compete effectively with the products and services or prices offered by our competitors our industry including our customers and competitors has experienced unanticipated changes in recent years moreover the industry is undergoing vertical and horizontal consolidation to create economies of scale and control the value chain which may affect demand for our products and services because of price concessions for our competitors or decreased customer capital spending this consolidation activity could impact our ability to maintain market share maintain or increase pricing for our products and services or negotiate favorable contract terms with our customers and suppliers which could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows we are unable to predict what effect consolidations and other competitive factors in the industry may have on prices capital spending by our customers our selling strategies our competitive position our ability to retain customers or our ability to negotiate favorable agreements with our customers demand for our products and services depends on oil and gas industry activity and expenditure levels which are directly affected by trends in the demand for and price of crude oil and natural gas we are substantially dependent on conditions in the oil and gas industry including i the level of exploration development and production activity ii capital spending and iii the processing of oil and natural gas in refining units petrochemical sites and natural gas liquefaction plants by energy companies that are our customers any substantial or extended decline in these expenditures may result in the reduced pace of discovery and development of new reserves of oil and gas and the reduced exploration of existing wells which could adversely affect demand for our products and services and in certain instances result in the cancellation modification or re scheduling of existing orders in our backlog these factors could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability the level of exploration development and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include but are not limited to the following demand for hydrocarbons which is affected by worldwide population growth economic growth rates and general economic and business conditions costs of exploring for producing and delivering oil and natural gas political and economic uncertainty and socio political unrest government policies and subsidies related to the production use and exportation importation of oil and natural gas available excess production capacity within the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec and the level of oil production by non opec countries oil refining and transportation capacity and shifts in end customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas technological advances affecting energy consumption development exploitation and relative price and availability of alternative sources of energy and our customers shift of capital to the development of these sources volatility in and access to capital and credit markets which may affect our customers activity levels and spending for our products and services and natural disasters the oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge while oil and natural gas prices have recently started to rebound from the downturn that began in 2014 the market remains quite volatile and the sustainability of the price recovery and business activity levels is dependent on variables beyond our control such as geopolitical stability opec s actions to regulate its production capacity changes in demand patterns and international sanctions and tariffs continued volatility or any future reduction in demand for oilfield services and could further adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our success depends on our ability to develop implement and protect new technologies and services our success depends on the ongoing development and implementation of new product designs including the processes used by us to produce and market our products and on our ability to protect and maintain critical intellectual property assets related to these developments if we are not able to obtain patent trade secret or other protection of our intellectual property rights if our patents are unenforceable or the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology or if we are not able to adequately protect our patents or trade secrets we may not be able to continue to develop our services products and related technologies additionally our competitors may be able to independently develop technology that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets if any of these events occurs we may be unable to meet evolving industry requirements or do so at prices acceptable to our customers which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows the industries in which we operate or have operated expose us to potential liabilities including the installation or use of our products which may not be covered by insurance or may be in excess of policy limits or for which expected recoveries may not be realized we are subject to potential liabilities arising from among other possibilities equipment malfunctions equipment misuse personal injuries and natural disasters any of which may result in hazardous situations including uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids fires and explosions although we have obtained insurance against many of these risks our insurance may not be adequate to cover our liabilities further the insurance may not generally be available in the future or if available premiums may not be commercially justifiable if we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or if we were to incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance such potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows we may lose money on fixed price contracts as customary for some of our projects we often agree to provide products and services under fixed price contracts we are subject to material risks in connection with such fixed price contracts it is not possible to estimate with complete certainty the final cost or margin of a project at the time of bidding or during the early phases of its execution actual expenses incurred in executing these fixed price contracts can vary substantially from those originally anticipated for several reasons including but not limited to the following unforeseen additional costs related to the purchase of substantial equipment necessary for contract fulfillment or labor shortages in the markets for where the contracts are performed mechanical failure of our production equipment and machinery delays caused by local weather conditions and or natural disasters including earthquakes and floods and a failure of suppliers subcontractors or joint venture partners to perform their contractual obligations the realization of any material risks and unforeseen circumstances could also lead to delays in the execution schedule of a project we may be held liable to a customer should we fail to meet project milestones or deadlines or to comply with other contractual provisions additionally delays in certain projects could lead to delays in subsequent projects for which production equipment and machinery currently being utilized on a project were intended pursuant to the terms of fixed price contracts we are not always able to increase the price of the contract to reflect factors that were unforeseen at the time its bid was submitted and this risk may be heightened for projects with longer terms depending on the size of a project variations from estimated contract performance or variations in multiple contracts could have a significant impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows new capital asset construction projects for vessels and manufacturing facilities are subject to risks including delays and cost overruns which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations we regularly carry out capital asset construction projects to maintain upgrade and develop our asset base and such projects are subject to risks of delay and cost overruns that are inherent to any large construction project and are the result of numerous factors including but not limited to the following shortages of key equipment materials or skilled labor unscheduled delays in the delivery or ordered materials and equipment design and engineering issues and shipyard delays and performance issues failure to complete construction in time or the inability to complete construction in accordance with its design specifications may result in loss of revenue additionally capital expenditures for construction projects could materially exceed the initially planned investments or can result in delays in putting such assets into operation our failure to timely deliver our backlog could affect future sales profitability and relationships with our customers many of the contracts we enter into with our customers require long manufacturing lead times due to complex technical and logistical requirements these contracts may contain clauses related to liquidated damages or financial incentives regarding on time delivery and a failure by us to deliver in accordance with customer expectations could subject us to liquidated damages or loss of financial incentives reduce our margins on these contracts or result in damage to existing customer relationships the ability to meet customer delivery schedules for this backlog is dependent upon a number of factors including but not limited to access to the raw materials required for production an adequately trained and capable workforce subcontractor performance project engineering expertise and execution sufficient manufacturing plant capacity and appropriate planning and scheduling of manufacturing resources failure to deliver backlog in accordance with expectations could negatively impact our financial performance we face risks relating to our reliance on subcontractors suppliers and our joint venture partners we generally rely on subcontractors suppliers and our joint venture partners for the performance of our contracts although we are not dependent upon any single supplier certain geographic areas of our business or a project or group of projects may depend heavily on certain suppliers for raw materials or semi finished goods any difficulty in engaging suitable subcontractors or acquiring equipment and materials could compromise our ability to generate a significant margin on a project or to complete such project within the allocated timeframe if subcontractors suppliers or joint venture partners refuse to adhere to their contractual obligations with us or are unable to do so due to a deterioration of their financial condition we may be unable to find a suitable replacement at a comparable price or at all moreover the failure of one of our joint venture partners to perform their obligations in a timely and satisfactory manner could lead to additional obligations and costs being imposed on us as we may be obligated to assume our defaulting partner s obligations or compensate our customers any delay failure to meet contractual obligations or other event beyond our control or not foreseeable by us that is attributable to a subcontractor supplier or joint venture partner could lead to delays in the overall progress of the project and or generate significant extra costs even if we are entitled to make a claim for these extra costs against the defaulting supplier subcontractor or joint venture partner we may be unable to recover the entirety of these costs and this could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations our businesses are dependent on the continuing services of certain of our key managers and employees we depend on key personnel the loss of any key personnel could adversely impact our business if we are unable to implement key strategies or transactions in their absence the loss of qualified employees or failure to retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to successfully conduct research activities and develop marketable products and services pirates endanger our maritime employees and assets we face material piracy risks in the gulf of guinea the somali basin and the gulf of aden and to a lesser extent in southeast asia malacca and the singapore straits piracy represents a risk for both our projects and our vessels which operate and transport through sensitive maritime areas such risks have the potential to significantly harm our crews and to negatively impact the execution schedule for our projects if our maritime employees or assets are endangered additional time may be required to find an alternative solution which may delay project realization and negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations seasonal and weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our services and operations our business may be materially affected by variation from normal weather patterns such as cooler or warmer summers and winters adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico or extreme winter conditions in canada russia and the north sea may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers operations cause supply disruptions or loss of productivity and may result in a loss of revenue or damage to our equipment and facilities which may or may not be insured any of these events or outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations due to the types of contracts we enter into and the markets in which we operate the cumulative loss of several major contracts customers or alliances may have an adverse effect on our results of operations we often enter into large long term contracts that collectively represent a significant portion of our revenue these agreements if terminated or breached may have a larger impact on our operating results or our financial condition than shorter term contracts due to the value at risk moreover the global market for the production transportation and transformation of hydrocarbons and by products as well as the other industrial markets in which we operate is dominated by a small number of companies as a result our business relies on a limited number of customers if we were to lose several key contracts customers or alliances over a relatively short period of time we could experience a significant adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our operations require us to comply with numerous regulations violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our operations and manufacturing activities are governed by international regional transnational and national laws and regulations in every place where we operate relating to matters such as environmental protection health and safety labor and employment import export controls currency exchange bribery and corruption and taxation these laws and regulations are complex frequently change and have tended to become more stringent over time in the event the scope of these laws and regulations expand in the future the incremental cost of compliance could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our international operations are subject to anti corruption laws and regulations such as the u s foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the u k bribery act of 2010 the bribery act the anti corruption provisions of french law n 2016 1691 dated december 9 2016 relating to transparency anti corruption and modernization of the business practice sapin ii law the brazilian anti bribery act also known as the brazilian clean company act and economic and trade sanctions including those administered by the united nations the european union the office of foreign assets control of the u s department of the treasury u s treasury and the u s department of state the fcpa prohibits providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage we may deal with both governments and state owned business enterprises the employees of which are considered foreign officials for purposes of the fcpa the provisions of the bribery act extend beyond bribery of foreign public officials and are more onerous than the fcpa in a number of other respects including jurisdiction non exemption of facilitation payments and penalties economic and trade sanctions restrict our transactions or dealings with certain sanctioned countries territories and designated persons as a result of doing business in foreign countries including through partners and agents we are exposed to a risk of violating anti corruption laws and sanctions regulations some of the international locations in which we currently or may in the future operate have developing legal systems and may have higher levels of corruption than more developed nations our continued expansion and worldwide operations including in developing countries our development of joint venture relationships worldwide and the employment of local agents in the countries in which we operate increases the risk of violations of anti corruption laws and economic and trade sanctions violations of anti corruption laws and economic and trade sanctions are punishable by civil penalties including fines denial of export privileges injunctions asset seizures debarment from government contracts and termination of existing contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses as well as criminal fines and imprisonment in addition any major violations could have a significant impact on our reputation and consequently on our ability to win future business we have implemented internal controls designed to minimize and detect potential violations of laws and regulations in a timely manner but we can provide no assurance that such policies and procedures will be followed at all times or will effectively detect and prevent violations of the applicable laws by one or more of our employees consultants agents or partners the occurrence of any such violation could subject us to penalties and material adverse consequences on our business financial condition or results of operations compliance with environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations environmental laws and regulations in various countries affect the equipment systems and services we design market and sell as well as the facilities where we manufacture our equipment and systems and any other operations we undertake we are required to invest financial and managerial resources to comply with environmental laws and regulations and believe that we will continue to be required to do so in the future failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties the imposition of remedial obligations the issuance of orders enjoining our operations or other claims these laws and regulations as well as the adoption of new legal requirements or other laws and regulations affecting exploration and development of drilling for crude oil and natural gas are becoming increasingly strict and could adversely affect our business and operating results by increasing our costs limiting the demand for our products and services or restricting our operations existing or future laws and regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change may adversely affect our business existing or future laws concerning the release of greenhouse gas emissions or that concern climate change including laws and regulations that seek to mitigate the effects of climate change may adversely impact demand for the equipment systems and services we design market and sell for example oil and natural gas exploration and production may decline as a result of such laws and regulations and as a consequence demand for our equipment systems and services may also decline in addition such laws and regulations may also result in more onerous obligations with respect to our operations including the facilities where we manufacture our equipment and systems such decline in demand for our equipment systems and services and such onerous obligations in respect of our operations may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows disruptions in the political regulatory economic and social conditions of the countries in which we conduct business could adversely affect our business or results of operations we operate in various countries across the world instability and unforeseen changes in any of the markets in which we conduct business including economically and politically volatile areas could have an adverse effect on the demand for our services and products our financial condition or our results of operations these factors include but are not limited to the following nationalization and expropriation potentially burdensome taxation inflationary and recessionary markets including capital and equity markets civil unrest labor issues political instability terrorist attacks cyber terrorism military activity and wars supply disruptions in key oil producing countries the ability of opec to set and maintain production levels and pricing trade restrictions trade protection measures price controls or trade disputes sanctions such as prohibitions or restrictions by the united states against countries that are the targets of economic sanctions or are designated as state sponsors of terrorism foreign ownership restrictions import or export licensing requirements restrictions on operations trade practices trade partners and investment decisions resulting from domestic and foreign laws and regulations regime changes changes in and the administration of treaties laws and regulations inability to repatriate income or capital reductions in the availability of qualified personnel foreign currency fluctuations or currency restrictions and fluctuations in the interest rate component of forward foreign currency rates dtc and euroclear paris may cease to act as depository and clearing agencies for our shares our shares were issued into the facilities of the depository trust company dtc with respect to shares listed on the nyse and euroclear with respect to shares listed on euronext paris dtc and euroclear being referred to as the clearance services the clearance services are widely used mechanisms that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in their respective systems which include many large banks and brokerage firms the clearance services have general discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agencies for our shares if either of the clearance services determine at any time that our shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities then we believe that our shares would not be eligible for continued listing on the nyse or euronext paris as applicable and trading in our shares would be disrupted any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our shares the united kingdom s proposed withdrawal from the european union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business we are based in the united kingdom and have operational headquarters in paris france houston texas united states and in london united kingdom with worldwide operations including material business operations in europe in june 2016 a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum brexit the referendum was advisory and the united kingdom government served notice under article 50 of the treaty of the european union in march 2017 to formally initiate a withdrawal process the united kingdom and the european union have had a two year period under article 50 to negotiate the terms for the united kingdom s withdrawal from the european union the withdrawal agreement and political declaration that were endorsed at a special meeting of the european council on november 25 2018 did not receive the approval of the united kingdom parliament in january 2019 further discussions are ongoing although the european commission has stated that the european union will not reopen the withdrawal agreement any extension of the negotiation period for withdrawal will require the consent of the remaining 27 member states of the european union brexit has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union and has given rise to calls for certain regions within the united kingdom to preserve their place in the european union by separating from the united kingdom these developments or the perception that any of them could occur could have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of the global financial markets and could significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets asset valuations currency exchange rates and credit ratings may be especially subject to increased market volatility lack of clarity about applicable future laws regulations or treaties as the united kingdom negotiates the terms of a withdrawal as well as the operation of any such rules pursuant to any withdrawal terms including financial laws and regulations tax and free trade agreements intellectual property rights supply chain logistics environmental health and safety laws and regulations immigration laws employment laws and other rules that would apply to us and our subsidiaries could increase our costs restrict our access to capital within the united kingdom and the european union depress economic activity and further decrease foreign direct investment in the united kingdom for example withdrawal from the european union could depending on the negotiated terms of such withdrawal eliminate the benefit of certain tax related e u directives currently applicable to u k companies such as us including the parent subsidiary directive and the interest and royalties directive which could subject to any relief under an available tax treaty raise our tax costs if the united kingdom and the european union are unable to negotiate mutually acceptable withdrawal terms or if other e u member states pursue withdrawal barrier free access between the united kingdom and other e u member states or within the european economic area overall could be diminished or eliminated any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as an english public limited company we must meet certain additional financial requirements before we may declare dividends or repurchase shares and certain capital structure decisions may require stockholder approval which may limit our flexibility to manage our capital structure we may not be able to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our ordinary shares in accordance with our announced intent or at all under english law we will only be able to declare dividends make distributions or repurchase shares other than out of the proceeds of a new issuance of shares for that purpose out of distributable profits distributable profits are a company s accumulated realized profits to the extent that they have not been previously utilized by distribution or capitalization less its accumulated realized losses to the extent that they have not been previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital duly made in addition as a public limited company incorporated in england and wales we may only make a distribution if the amount of our net assets is not less than the aggregate of our called up share capital and non distributable reserves and to the extent that the distribution does not reduce the amount of those assets to less than that aggregate following the merger we implemented a court approved reduction of our capital which was completed on june 29 2017 in order to create distributable profits to support the payment of possible future dividends or future share repurchases our articles of association permit us by ordinary resolution of the stockholders to declare dividends provided that the directors have made a recommendation as to its amount the dividend shall not exceed the amount recommended by the board of directors the directors may also decide to pay interim dividends if it appears to them that the profits available for distribution justify the payment when recommending or declaring payment of a dividend the directors are required under english law to comply with their duties including considering our future financial requirements in addition the board of directors determinations regarding dividends and share repurchases will depend on a variety of other factors including our net income cash flow generated from operations or other sources liquidity position and potential alternative uses of cash such as acquisitions as well as economic conditions and expected future financial results our ability to declare and pay future dividends and make future share repurchases will depend on our future financial performance which in turn depends on the successful implementation of our strategy and on financial competitive regulatory technical and other factors general economic conditions demand and selling prices for our products and services and other factors specific to our industry or specific projects many of which are beyond our control therefore our ability to generate cash depends on the performance of our operations and could be limited by decreases in our profitability or increases in costs regulatory changes capital expenditures or debt servicing requirements any failure to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our ordinary shares could negatively impact our reputation harm investor confidence in us and cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline our existing and future debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding debt we have substantial existing debt as of december 31 2018 after giving effect to the merger our total debt is 4 2 billion we also have the capacity under our 2 5 billion credit facility in addition to our bilateral facilities to incur substantial additional debt our level of debt could have important consequences for example it could make it more difficult for us to make payments on our debt require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions distributions and other general partnership purposes increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions limit our ability to obtain additional financing to enable us to react to changes in our business or place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt additionally any failure to meet required payments on our debt or to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments in the event of such default the holders of such debt could elect to declare all the amounts outstanding under such instruments to be due and payable the london inter bank offered rate libor and certain other interest benchmarks may be subject to regulatory guidance and or reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences the united kingdom s financial conduct authority which regulates libor has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit libor rates after 2021 and it is unclear if libor will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating libor will evolve if libor ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating libor change from their current form interest rates on our current or future debt obligations may be adversely affected a downgrade in our debt rating could restrict our ability to access the capital markets the terms of our financing are in part dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies we cannot provide assurance that any of our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels capital structure planned asset purchases or sales near and long term production growth opportunities market position liquidity asset quality cost structure product mix customer and geographic diversification and commodity price levels a downgrade in our credit ratings particularly to non investment grade levels could limit our ability to access the debt capital markets or refinance our existing debt or cause us to refinance or issue debt with less favorable terms and conditions moreover our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing as well as have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations uninsured claims and litigation against us including intellectual property litigation could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings we have insurance coverage against operating hazards including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products or operating environments in which our employees operate to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available however our insurance policies are subject to exclusions limitations and other conditions and may not apply in all cases for example where willful wrongdoing on our part is alleged additionally the nature and amount of that insurance may not be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation additionally in individual circumstances certain proceedings or cases may also lead to our formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits our financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected claims not covered by insurance in addition the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs the resolution of these claims could require us to enter into license agreements or develop alternative technologies the development of these technologies or the payment of royalties under licenses from third parties if available would increase our costs if a license were not available or we are not able to develop alternative technologies we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we conduct operations around the world in many different currencies because a significant portion of our revenue is denominated in currencies other than our reporting currency the u s dollar changes in exchange rates will produce fluctuations in our revenue costs and earnings and may also affect the book value of our assets and liabilities and related equity although we do not hedge translation impacts on earnings we do hedge transaction impacts on margins and earnings where the transaction is not in the functional currency of the business unit our efforts to minimize our currency exposure through such hedging transactions may not be successful depending on market and business conditions moreover certain currencies in which the company trades specifically currencies in countries such as angola and nigeria do not actively trade in the global foreign exchange markets and may subject us to increased foreign currency exposures as a result fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we may incur significant merger related costs we have incurred and expect to incur additional non recurring direct and indirect costs associated with the merger in addition to the costs and expenses associated with the consummation of the merger we are also integrating processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems while we have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred relating to the merger and continue to assess the magnitude of these costs there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration and implementation expenses these costs and expenses could reduce the realization of efficiencies and strategic benefits we expect to achieve from the merger and the expected net benefit of the merger may not be achieved in the near term or at all our acquisition and divestiture activities involve substantial risks we have made and expect to continue to pursue acquisitions dispositions or other investments that may strategically fit our business and or growth objectives we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to locate suitable acquisitions dispositions or investments or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us even if we do successfully execute such transactions they may not result in anticipated benefits which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results if we are unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings including any expected increases in revenues and operating results we may not be able to successfully cause a buyer of a divested business to assume the liabilities of that business or even if such liabilities are assumed we may have difficulties enforcing our rights contractual or otherwise against the buyer we may invest in companies or businesses that fail causing a loss of all or part of our investment in addition if we determine that an other than temporary decline in the fair value exists for a company in which we have invested we may have to write down that investment to its fair value and recognize the related write down as an investment loss a failure of our it infrastructure including as a result of cyber attacks could adversely impact our business and results of operations the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our it systems accordingly we rely upon the capacity reliability and security of our it hardware and software infrastructure and our ability to expand and update this infrastructure in response to changing needs we have been subject to cyber attacks in the past including phishing malware and ransomware and although no such attack has had a material adverse effect on our business this may not be the case with future attacks our systems may be vulnerable to damages from such attacks as well as from natural disasters failures in hardware or software power fluctuations unauthorized access to data and systems loss or destruction of data including confidential customer information human error and other similar disruptions and we cannot give assurance that any security measures we have implemented or may in the future implement will be sufficient to identify and prevent or mitigate such disruptions we rely on third parties to support the operation of our it hardware software infrastructure and cloud services and in certain instances utilize web based and software as a service applications the security and privacy measures implemented by such third parties as well as the measures implemented by any entities we acquire or with whom we do business may not be sufficient to identify or prevent cyber attacks and any such attacks may have a material adverse effect on our business while our it vendor agreements typically contain provisions that seek to eliminate or limit our exposure to liability for damages from a cyber attack we cannot ensure such provisions will withstand legal challenges or cover all or any such damages threats to our it systems arise from numerous sources not all of which are within our control including fraud or malice on the part of third parties accidental technological failure electrical or telecommunication outages failures of computer servers or other damage to our property or assets outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts the failure of our it systems or those of our vendors to perform as anticipated for any reason or any significant breach of security could disrupt our business and result in numerous adverse consequences including reduced effectiveness and efficiency of operations inappropriate disclosure of confidential and proprietary information reputational harm increased overhead costs and loss of important information which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future our insurance coverage may not cover all of the costs and liabilities we incur as the result of any disruptions or security breaches and if our business continuity and or disaster recovery plans do not effectively and timely resolve issues resulting from a cyber attack we may suffer material adverse effects on our business we are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy data protection and data security our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business we are subject to international data protection laws such as the general data protection regulation or gdpr in the european economic area the gdpr imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data which have increased our obligations including for example by requiring more robust disclosures to individuals notifications in some cases of data breaches to regulators and data subjects and a record of processing and other policies and procedures to be maintained to adhere to the accountability principle in addition we are subject to the gdpr s rules on transferring personal data outside of the eea including to the united states and some of these rules are currently being challenged in the courts failure to comply with the requirements of gdpr and the local laws implementing or supplementing the gdpr could result in fines of up to 20 000 000 or up to 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher as well as other administrative penalties we are likely to be required to expend significant capital and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance with the gdpr and other applicable data protection legislation and we may be required to put in place additional control mechanisms which could be onerous and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we may not realize the cost savings synergies and other benefits expected from the merger the combination of two independent companies is a complex costly and time consuming process as a result we will be required to continue to devote management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of technip and fmc technologies the integration process may disrupt our businesses and if ineffectively implemented could preclude realization of the full benefits expected from the merger our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the operations of technip and fmc technologies or otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of the merger could interrupt and seriously harm the results of our operations in addition the overall integration of technip and fmc technologies may result in unanticipated expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of client relationships diversion of management s attention or other problems and such problems could if material cause our stock price to decline the difficulties of combining the operations of technip and fmc technologies include but are not limited to the following managing a significantly larger company coordinating geographically separate organizations the potential diversion of management focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters aligning and executing our strategy retaining existing customers and attracting new customers maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees integrating two unique business cultures the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations coordinating distribution and marketing efforts integrating it communications and other systems changes in applicable laws and regulations managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the merger and taking actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals many of these factors are at least partially outside our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue and diversion of management s time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if the operations of technip and fmc technologies are successfully integrated we may not realize the full benefits of the merger including the synergies cost savings sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all as a result the combination of technip and fmc technologies may not result in the realization of the full benefits expected from the merger the irs may not agree that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for u s federal tax purposes and may seek to impose an excise tax on gains recognized by certain individuals although we are incorporated in the united kingdom the u s internal revenue service the irs may assert that we should be treated as a u s domestic corporation and therefore a u s tax resident for u s federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the u s internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code for u s federal income tax purposes a corporation i is generally considered a domestic corporation or u s tax resident if it is organized in the united states or of any state or political subdivision therein and ii is generally considered a foreign corporation or non u s tax resident if it is not considered a domestic corporation because we are a u k incorporated entity we would be considered a foreign corporation and therefore a non u s tax resident under these rules section 7874 of the code section 7874 provides an exception under which a foreign incorporated entity may in certain circumstances be treated as a domestic corporation for u s federal income tax purposes we do not believe this exception applies however the section 7874 rules are complex and subject to detailed regulations the application of which is uncertain in various respects it is possible that the irs will not agree with our position should the irs successfully challenge our position it is also possible that an excise tax under section 4985 of the code the section 4985 excise tax may be assessed against certain disqualified individuals including former officers and directors of fmc technologies inc on certain stock based compensation held thereby we may if we determine that it is appropriate provide disqualified individuals with a payment with respect to the section 4985 excise tax so that on a net after tax basis they would be in the same position as if no such section 4985 excise tax had been applied in addition there can be no assurance that there will not be a change in law or interpretation including with retroactive effect that might cause us to be treated as a domestic corporation for u s federal income tax purposes u s tax laws and or guidance could affect our ability to engage in certain acquisition strategies and certain internal restructurings even if we are treated as a foreign corporation for u s federal income tax purposes section 7874 u s treasury regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder may adversely affect our ability to engage in certain future acquisitions of u s businesses or to restructure the non u s members of our group these limitations if applicable may affect the tax efficiencies that otherwise might be achieved in such potential future transactions or restructurings in addition the irs and the u s treasury have issued final and temporary regulations providing that even if we are treated as a foreign corporation for u s federal income tax purposes certain intercompany debt instruments issued on or after april 4 2016 will be treated as equity for u s federal income tax purposes therefore limiting u s tax benefits and resulting in possible u s withholding taxes although recent guidance from the u s treasury proposes deferring certain documentation requirements that would otherwise be imposed with respect to covered debt instruments and further indicates that these rules generally are the subject of continuing study and may be further materially modified the current regulations may adversely affect our future effective tax rate and could also impact our ability to engage in future restructurings if such transactions cause an existing intercompany debt instrument to be treated as reissued for u s federal income tax purposes we are subject to the tax laws of numerous jurisdictions challenges to the interpretation of or future changes to such laws could adversely affect us we and our subsidiaries are subject to tax laws and regulations in the united kingdom the united states france and numerous other jurisdictions in which we and our subsidiaries operate these laws and regulations are inherently complex and we are and will continue to be obligated to make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws and regulations to our operations and businesses the interpretation and application of these laws and regulations could be challenged by the relevant governmental authorities which could result in administrative or judicial procedures actions or sanctions which could be material in addition the u s congress the u k government the european union the organization for economic co operation and development the oecd and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations new tax initiatives directives and rules such as the u s tax cuts and jobs act the oecd s base erosion and profit shifting initiative and the european union s anti tax avoidance directives may increase our tax burden and require additional compliance related expenditures as a result our financial condition results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected further changes including with retroactive effect in the tax laws of the united states the united kingdom the european union or other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could also adversely affect us we may not qualify for benefits under tax treaties entered into between the united kingdom and other countries we operate in a manner such that we believe we are eligible for benefits under tax treaties between the united kingdom and other countries however our ability to qualify for such benefits will depend on whether we are treated as a u k tax resident the requirements contained in each treaty and applicable domestic laws on the facts and circumstances surrounding our operations and management and on the relevant interpretation of the tax authorities and courts for example because of the anticipated withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union brexit we may lose some or all of the benefits of tax treaties between the united states and the remaining members of the european union and face higher tax liabilities which may be significant another example is the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting the mli which entered into force for participating jurisdictions on july 1 2018 the mli recommends that countries adopt a limitation on benefit rule and or a principle purposes test rule with regards to their tax treaties the scope and interpretation of these rules as adopted pursuant to the mli are presently under development but the application of either rule might deny us tax treaty benefits that were previously available the failure by us or our subsidiaries to qualify for benefits under tax treaties entered into between the united kingdom and other countries could result in adverse tax consequences to us including an increased tax burden and increased filing obligations and could result in certain tax consequences of owning and disposing of our shares we intend to be treated exclusively as a resident of the united kingdom for tax purposes but french or other tax authorities may seek to treat us as a tax resident of another jurisdiction we are incorporated in the united kingdom english law currently provides that we will be regarded as a u k resident for tax purposes from incorporation and shall remain so unless i we are concurrently a resident in another jurisdiction applying the tax residence rules of that jurisdiction that has a double tax treaty with the united kingdom and ii there is a tiebreaker provision in that tax treaty which allocates exclusive residence to that other jurisdiction in this regard we have a permanent establishment in france to satisfy certain french tax requirements imposed by the french tax code with respect to the merger although it is intended that we will be treated as having our exclusive place of tax residence in the united kingdom the french tax authorities may claim that we are a tax resident of france if we were to fail to maintain our place of effective management in the united kingdom any such claim would be settled between the french and u k tax authorities pursuant to the mutual assistance procedure provided for by the tax treaty concluded between france and the united kingdom there is no assurance that these authorities would reach an agreement that we will remain exclusively a u k tax resident a determination which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects a failure to maintain exclusive tax residency in the united kingdom could result in adverse tax consequences to us and our subsidiaries and could result in certain adverse changes in the tax consequences of owning and disposing of our shares the company has identified material weaknesses relating to internal control over financial reporting if our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses or if one or more additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to further restate our financial results which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows management identified material weaknesses in the company s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2017 and december 31 2018 as described in the corporate governance report of this u k annual report a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis as a result of the material weaknesses management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december 31 2018 in addition as a result of these material weaknesses our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of december 31 2018 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective until these material weaknesses are remediated they could lead to errors in our financial results and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows if our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses or if one or more additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows restrict our ability to access the capital markets require significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies subject us to fines penalties or judgments harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence and in the market price of our stock additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in

financial information leading to among other things a decline in our stock price we can give no assurances that the measures we have taken to date or any future measures we may take will fully remediate the material weaknesses identified or that any additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future due to our failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over

principal risks and uncertainties the principal risks and uncertainties at set out in the strategic report of the 2018 annual report are set out below in full and unedited text you should carefully consider the specific risks and uncertainties set forth below and the other information contained within this strategic report as these are important factors that could cause the company s actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from our expected or historical results we operate in a highly competitive environment and unanticipated changes relating to competitive factors in our industry including ongoing industry consolidation may impact our results of operations we compete on the basis of a number of different factors such as product offerings project execution customer service and price in order to compete effectively we must develop and implement innovative technologies and processes and execute our clients projects effectively we can give no assurances that we will continue to be able to compete effectively with the products and services or prices offered by our competitors our industry including our customers and competitors has experienced unanticipated changes in recent years moreover the industry is undergoing vertical and horizontal consolidation to create economies of scale and control the value chain which may affect demand for our products and services because of price concessions for our competitors or decreased customer capital spending this consolidation activity could impact our ability to maintain market share maintain or increase pricing for our products and services or negotiate favorable contract terms with our customers and suppliers which could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows we are unable to predict what effect consolidations and other competitive factors in the industry may have on prices capital spending by our customers our selling strategies our competitive position our ability to retain customers or our ability to negotiate favorable agreements with our customers demand for our products and services depends on oil and gas industry activity and expenditure levels which are directly affected by trends in the demand for and price of crude oil and natural gas we are substantially dependent on conditions in the oil and gas industry including i the level of exploration development and production activity ii capital spending and iii the processing of oil and natural gas in refining units petrochemical sites and natural gas liquefaction plants by energy companies that are our customers any substantial or extended decline in these expenditures may result in the reduced pace of discovery and development of new reserves of oil and gas and the reduced exploration of existing wells which could adversely affect demand for our products and services and in certain instances result in the cancellation modification or re scheduling of existing orders in our backlog these factors could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability the level of exploration development and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include but are not limited to the following demand for hydrocarbons which is affected by worldwide population growth economic growth rates and general economic and business conditions costs of exploring for producing and delivering oil and natural gas political and economic uncertainty and socio political unrest government policies and subsidies related to the production use and exportation importation of oil and natural gas available excess production capacity within the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec and the level of oil production by non opec countries oil refining and transportation capacity and shifts in end customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas technological advances affecting energy consumption development exploitation and relative price and availability of alternative sources of energy and our customers shift of capital to the development of these sources volatility in and access to capital and credit markets which may affect our customers activity levels and spending for our products and services and natural disasters the oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge while oil and natural gas prices have recently started to rebound from the downturn that began in 2014 the market remains quite volatile and the sustainability of the price recovery and business activity levels is dependent on variables beyond our control such as geopolitical stability opec s actions to regulate its production capacity changes in demand patterns and international sanctions and tariffs continued volatility or any future reduction in demand for oilfield services and could further adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our success depends on our ability to develop implement and protect new technologies and services our success depends on the ongoing development and implementation of new product designs including the processes used by us to produce and market our products and on our ability to protect and maintain critical intellectual property assets related to these developments if we are not able to obtain patent trade secret or other protection of our intellectual property rights if our patents are unenforceable or the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology or if we are not able to adequately protect our patents or trade secrets we may not be able to continue to develop our services products and related technologies additionally our competitors may be able to independently develop technology that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets if any of these events occurs we may be unable to meet evolving industry requirements or do so at prices acceptable to our customers which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows the industries in which we operate or have operated expose us to potential liabilities including the installation or use of our products which may not be covered by insurance or may be in excess of policy limits or for which expected recoveries may not be realized we are subject to potential liabilities arising from among other possibilities equipment malfunctions equipment misuse personal injuries and natural disasters any of which may result in hazardous situations including uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids fires and explosions although we have obtained insurance against many of these risks our insurance may not be adequate to cover our liabilities further the insurance may not generally be available in the future or if available premiums may not be commercially justifiable if we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or if we were to incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance such potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows we may lose money on fixed price contracts as customary for some of our projects we often agree to provide products and services under fixed price contracts we are subject to material risks in connection with such fixed price contracts it is not possible to estimate with complete certainty the final cost or margin of a project at the time of bidding or during the early phases of its execution actual expenses incurred in executing these fixed price contracts can vary substantially from those originally anticipated for several reasons including but not limited to the following unforeseen additional costs related to the purchase of substantial equipment necessary for contract fulfillment or labor shortages in the markets for where the contracts are performed mechanical failure of our production equipment and machinery delays caused by local weather conditions and or natural disasters including earthquakes and floods and a failure of suppliers subcontractors or joint venture partners to perform their contractual obligations the realization of any material risks and unforeseen circumstances could also lead to delays in the execution schedule of a project we may be held liable to a customer should we fail to meet project milestones or deadlines or to comply with other contractual provisions additionally delays in certain projects could lead to delays in subsequent projects for which production equipment and machinery currently being utilized on a project were intended pursuant to the terms of fixed price contracts we are not always able to increase the price of the contract to reflect factors that were unforeseen at the time its bid was submitted and this risk may be heightened for projects with longer terms depending on the size of a project variations from estimated contract performance or variations in multiple contracts could have a significant impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows new capital asset construction projects for vessels and manufacturing facilities are subject to risks including delays and cost overruns which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations we regularly carry out capital asset construction projects to maintain upgrade and develop our asset base and such projects are subject to risks of delay and cost overruns that are inherent to any large construction project and are the result of numerous factors including but not limited to the following shortages of key equipment materials or skilled labor unscheduled delays in the delivery or ordered materials and equipment design and engineering issues and shipyard delays and performance issues failure to complete construction in time or the inability to complete construction in accordance with its design specifications may result in loss of revenue additionally capital expenditures for construction projects could materially exceed the initially planned investments or can result in delays in putting such assets into operation our failure to timely deliver our backlog could affect future sales profitability and relationships with our customers many of the contracts we enter into with our customers require long manufacturing lead times due to complex technical and logistical requirements these contracts may contain clauses related to liquidated damages or financial incentives regarding on time delivery and a failure by us to deliver in accordance with customer expectations could subject us to liquidated damages or loss of financial incentives reduce our margins on these contracts or result in damage to existing customer relationships the ability to meet customer delivery schedules for this backlog is dependent upon a number of factors including but not limited to access to the raw materials required for production an adequately trained and capable workforce subcontractor performance project engineering expertise and execution sufficient manufacturing plant capacity and appropriate planning and scheduling of manufacturing resources failure to deliver backlog in accordance with expectations could negatively impact our financial performance we face risks relating to our reliance on subcontractors suppliers and our joint venture partners we generally rely on subcontractors suppliers and our joint venture partners for the performance of our contracts although we are not dependent upon any single supplier certain geographic areas of our business or a project or group of projects may depend heavily on certain suppliers for raw materials or semi finished goods any difficulty in engaging suitable subcontractors or acquiring equipment and materials could compromise our ability to generate a significant margin on a project or to complete such project within the allocated timeframe if subcontractors suppliers or joint venture partners refuse to adhere to their contractual obligations with us or are unable to do so due to a deterioration of their financial condition we may be unable to find a suitable replacement at a comparable price or at all moreover the failure of one of our joint venture partners to perform their obligations in a timely and satisfactory manner could lead to additional obligations and costs being imposed on us as we may be obligated to assume our defaulting partner s obligations or compensate our customers any delay failure to meet contractual obligations or other event beyond our control or not foreseeable by us that is attributable to a subcontractor supplier or joint venture partner could lead to delays in the overall progress of the project and or generate significant extra costs even if we are entitled to make a claim for these extra costs against the defaulting supplier subcontractor or joint venture partner we may be unable to recover the entirety of these costs and this could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations our businesses are dependent on the continuing services of certain of our key managers and employees we depend on key personnel the loss of any key personnel could adversely impact our business if we are unable to implement key strategies or transactions in their absence the loss of qualified employees or failure to retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to successfully conduct research activities and develop marketable products and services pirates endanger our maritime employees and assets we face material piracy risks in the gulf of guinea the somali basin and the gulf of aden and to a lesser extent in southeast asia malacca and the singapore straits piracy represents a risk for both our projects and our vessels which operate and transport through sensitive maritime areas such risks have the potential to significantly harm our crews and to negatively impact the execution schedule for our projects if our maritime employees or assets are endangered additional time may be required to find an alternative solution which may delay project realization and negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations seasonal and weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our services and operations our business may be materially affected by variation from normal weather patterns such as cooler or warmer summers and winters adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico or extreme winter conditions in canada russia and the north sea may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers operations cause supply disruptions or loss of productivity and may result in a loss of revenue or damage to our equipment and facilities which may or may not be insured any of these events or outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations due to the types of contracts we enter into and the markets in which we operate the cumulative loss of several major contracts customers or alliances may have an adverse effect on our results of operations we often enter into large long term contracts that collectively represent a significant portion of our revenue these agreements if terminated or breached may have a larger impact on our operating results or our financial condition than shorter term contracts due to the value at risk moreover the global market for the production transportation and transformation of hydrocarbons and by products as well as the other industrial markets in which we operate is dominated by a small number of companies as a result our business relies on a limited number of customers if we were to lose several key contracts customers or alliances over a relatively short period of time we could experience a significant adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our operations require us to comply with numerous regulations violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our operations and manufacturing activities are governed by international regional transnational and national laws and regulations in every place where we operate relating to matters such as environmental protection health and safety labor and employment import export controls currency exchange bribery and corruption and taxation these laws and regulations are complex frequently change and have tended to become more stringent over time in the event the scope of these laws and regulations expand in the future the incremental cost of compliance could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our international operations are subject to anti corruption laws and regulations such as the u s foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the u k bribery act of 2010 the bribery act the anti corruption provisions of french law n 2016 1691 dated december 9 2016 relating to transparency anti corruption and modernization of the business practice sapin ii law the brazilian anti bribery act also known as the brazilian clean company act and economic and trade sanctions including those administered by the united nations the european union the office of foreign assets control of the u s department of the treasury u s treasury and the u s department of state the fcpa prohibits providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage we may deal with both governments and state owned business enterprises the employees of which are considered foreign officials for purposes of the fcpa the provisions of the bribery act extend beyond bribery of foreign public officials and are more onerous than the fcpa in a number of other respects including jurisdiction non exemption of facilitation payments and penalties economic and trade sanctions restrict our transactions or dealings with certain sanctioned countries territories and designated persons as a result of doing business in foreign countries including through partners and agents we are exposed to a risk of violating anti corruption laws and sanctions regulations some of the international locations in which we currently or may in the future operate have developing legal systems and may have higher levels of corruption than more developed nations our continued expansion and worldwide operations including in developing countries our development of joint venture relationships worldwide and the employment of local agents in the countries in which we operate increases the risk of violations of anti corruption laws and economic and trade sanctions violations of anti corruption laws and economic and trade sanctions are punishable by civil penalties including fines denial of export privileges injunctions asset seizures debarment from government contracts and termination of existing contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses as well as criminal fines and imprisonment in addition any major violations could have a significant impact on our reputation and consequently on our ability to win future business we have implemented internal controls designed to minimize and detect potential violations of laws and regulations in a timely manner but we can provide no assurance that such policies and procedures will be followed at all times or will effectively detect and prevent violations of the applicable laws by one or more of our employees consultants agents or partners the occurrence of any such violation could subject us to penalties and material adverse consequences on our business financial condition or results of operations compliance with environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations environmental laws and regulations in various countries affect the equipment systems and services we design market and sell as well as the facilities where we manufacture our equipment and systems and any other operations we undertake we are required to invest financial and managerial resources to comply with environmental laws and regulations and believe that we will continue to be required to do so in the future failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties the imposition of remedial obligations the issuance of orders enjoining our operations or other claims these laws and regulations as well as the adoption of new legal requirements or other laws and regulations affecting exploration and development of drilling for crude oil and natural gas are becoming increasingly strict and could adversely affect our business and operating results by increasing our costs limiting the demand for our products and services or restricting our operations existing or future laws and regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change may adversely affect our business existing or future laws concerning the release of greenhouse gas emissions or that concern climate change including laws and regulations that seek to mitigate the effects of climate change may adversely impact demand for the equipment systems and services we design market and sell for example oil and natural gas exploration and production may decline as a result of such laws and regulations and as a consequence demand for our equipment systems and services may also decline in addition such laws and regulations may also result in more onerous obligations with respect to our operations including the facilities where we manufacture our equipment and systems such decline in demand for our equipment systems and services and such onerous obligations in respect of our operations may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows disruptions in the political regulatory economic and social conditions of the countries in which we conduct business could adversely affect our business or results of operations we operate in various countries across the world instability and unforeseen changes in any of the markets in which we conduct business including economically and politically volatile areas could have an adverse effect on the demand for our services and products our financial condition or our results of operations these factors include but are not limited to the following nationalization and expropriation potentially burdensome taxation inflationary and recessionary markets including capital and equity markets civil unrest labor issues political instability terrorist attacks cyber terrorism military activity and wars supply disruptions in key oil producing countries the ability of opec to set and maintain production levels and pricing trade restrictions trade protection measures price controls or trade disputes sanctions such as prohibitions or restrictions by the united states against countries that are the targets of economic sanctions or are designated as state sponsors of terrorism foreign ownership restrictions import or export licensing requirements restrictions on operations trade practices trade partners and investment decisions resulting from domestic and foreign laws and regulations regime changes changes in and the administration of treaties laws and regulations inability to repatriate income or capital reductions in the availability of qualified personnel foreign currency fluctuations or currency restrictions and fluctuations in the interest rate component of forward foreign currency rates dtc and euroclear paris may cease to act as depository and clearing agencies for our shares our shares were issued into the facilities of the depository trust company dtc with respect to shares listed on the nyse and euroclear with respect to shares listed on euronext paris dtc and euroclear being referred to as the clearance services the clearance services are widely used mechanisms that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in their respective systems which include many large banks and brokerage firms the clearance services have general discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agencies for our shares if either of the clearance services determine at any time that our shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities then we believe that our shares would not be eligible for continued listing on the nyse or euronext paris as applicable and trading in our shares would be disrupted any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our shares the united kingdom s proposed withdrawal from the european union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business we are based in the united kingdom and have operational headquarters in paris france houston texas united states and in london united kingdom with worldwide operations including material business operations in europe in june 2016 a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum brexit the referendum was advisory and the united kingdom government served notice under article 50 of the treaty of the european union in march 2017 to formally initiate a withdrawal process the united kingdom and the european union have had a two year period under article 50 to negotiate the terms for the united kingdom s withdrawal from the european union the withdrawal agreement and political declaration that were endorsed at a special meeting of the european council on november 25 2018 did not receive the approval of the united kingdom parliament in january 2019 further discussions are ongoing although the european commission has stated that the european union will not reopen the withdrawal agreement any extension of the negotiation period for withdrawal will require the consent of the remaining 27 member states of the european union brexit has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union and has given rise to calls for certain regions within the united kingdom to preserve their place in the european union by separating from the united kingdom these developments or the perception that any of them could occur could have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of the global financial markets and could significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets asset valuations currency exchange rates and credit ratings may be especially subject to increased market volatility lack of clarity about applicable future laws regulations or treaties as the united kingdom negotiates the terms of a withdrawal as well as the operation of any such rules pursuant to any withdrawal terms including financial laws and regulations tax and free trade agreements intellectual property rights supply chain logistics environmental health and safety laws and regulations immigration laws employment laws and other rules that would apply to us and our subsidiaries could increase our costs restrict our access to capital within the united kingdom and the european union depress economic activity and further decrease foreign direct investment in the united kingdom for example withdrawal from the european union could depending on the negotiated terms of such withdrawal eliminate the benefit of certain tax related e u directives currently applicable to u k companies such as us including the parent subsidiary directive and the interest and royalties directive which could subject to any relief under an available tax treaty raise our tax costs if the united kingdom and the european union are unable to negotiate mutually acceptable withdrawal terms or if other e u member states pursue withdrawal barrier free access between the united kingdom and other e u member states or within the european economic area overall could be diminished or eliminated any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as an english public limited company we must meet certain additional financial requirements before we may declare dividends or repurchase shares and certain capital structure decisions may require stockholder approval which may limit our flexibility to manage our capital structure we may not be able to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our ordinary shares in accordance with our announced intent or at all under english law we will only be able to declare dividends make distributions or repurchase shares other than out of the proceeds of a new issuance of shares for that purpose out of distributable profits distributable profits are a company s accumulated realized profits to the extent that they have not been previously utilized by distribution or capitalization less its accumulated realized losses to the extent that they have not been previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital duly made in addition as a public limited company incorporated in england and wales we may only make a distribution if the amount of our net assets is not less than the aggregate of our called up share capital and non distributable reserves and to the extent that the distribution does not reduce the amount of those assets to less than that aggregate following the merger we implemented a court approved reduction of our capital which was completed on june 29 2017 in order to create distributable profits to support the payment of possible future dividends or future share repurchases our articles of association permit us by ordinary resolution of the stockholders to declare dividends provided that the directors have made a recommendation as to its amount the dividend shall not exceed the amount recommended by the board of directors the directors may also decide to pay interim dividends if it appears to them that the profits available for distribution justify the payment when recommending or declaring payment of a dividend the directors are required under english law to comply with their duties including considering our future financial requirements in addition the board of directors determinations regarding dividends and share repurchases will depend on a variety of other factors including our net income cash flow generated from operations or other sources liquidity position and potential alternative uses of cash such as acquisitions as well as economic conditions and expected future financial results our ability to declare and pay future dividends and make future share repurchases will depend on our future financial performance which in turn depends on the successful implementation of our strategy and on financial competitive regulatory technical and other factors general economic conditions demand and selling prices for our products and services and other factors specific to our industry or specific projects many of which are beyond our control therefore our ability to generate cash depends on the performance of our operations and could be limited by decreases in our profitability or increases in costs regulatory changes capital expenditures or debt servicing requirements any failure to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our ordinary shares could negatively impact our reputation harm investor confidence in us and cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline our existing and future debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding debt we have substantial existing debt as of december 31 2018 after giving effect to the merger our total debt is 4 2 billion we also have the capacity under our 2 5 billion credit facility in addition to our bilateral facilities to incur substantial additional debt our level of debt could have important consequences for example it could make it more difficult for us to make payments on our debt require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions distributions and other general partnership purposes increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions limit our ability to obtain additional financing to enable us to react to changes in our business or place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt additionally any failure to meet required payments on our debt or to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments in the event of such default the holders of such debt could elect to declare all the amounts outstanding under such instruments to be due and payable the london inter bank offered rate libor and certain other interest benchmarks may be subject to regulatory guidance and or reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences the united kingdom s financial conduct authority which regulates libor has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit libor rates after 2021 and it is unclear if libor will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating libor will evolve if libor ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating libor change from their current form interest rates on our current or future debt obligations may be adversely affected a downgrade in our debt rating could restrict our ability to access the capital markets the terms of our financing are in part dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies we cannot provide assurance that any of our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels capital structure planned asset purchases or sales near and long term production growth opportunities market position liquidity asset quality cost structure product mix customer and geographic diversification and commodity price levels a downgrade in our credit ratings particularly to non investment grade levels could limit our ability to access the debt capital markets or refinance our existing debt or cause us to refinance or issue debt with less favorable terms and conditions moreover our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing as well as have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations uninsured claims and litigation against us including intellectual property litigation could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings we have insurance coverage against operating hazards including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products or operating environments in which our employees operate to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available however our insurance policies are subject to exclusions limitations and other conditions and may not apply in all cases for example where willful wrongdoing on our part is alleged additionally the nature and amount of that insurance may not be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation additionally in individual circumstances certain proceedings or cases may also lead to our formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits our financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected claims not covered by insurance in addition the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs the resolution of these claims could require us to enter into license agreements or develop alternative technologies the development of these technologies or the payment of royalties under licenses from third parties if available would increase our costs if a license were not available or we are not able to develop alternative technologies we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we conduct operations around the world in many different currencies because a significant portion of our revenue is denominated in currencies other than our reporting currency the u s dollar changes in exchange rates will produce fluctuations in our revenue costs and earnings and may also affect the book value of our assets and liabilities and related equity although we do not hedge translation impacts on earnings we do hedge transaction impacts on margins and earnings where the transaction is not in the functional currency of the business unit our efforts to minimize our currency exposure through such hedging transactions may not be successful depending on market and business conditions moreover certain currencies in which the company trades specifically currencies in countries such as angola and nigeria do not actively trade in the global foreign exchange markets and may subject us to increased foreign currency exposures as a result fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we may incur significant merger related costs we have incurred and expect to incur additional non recurring direct and indirect costs associated with the merger in addition to the costs and expenses associated with the consummation of the merger we are also integrating processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems while we have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred relating to the merger and continue to assess the magnitude of these costs there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration and implementation expenses these costs and expenses could reduce the realization of efficiencies and strategic benefits we expect to achieve from the merger and the expected net benefit of the merger may not be achieved in the near term or at all our acquisition and divestiture activities involve substantial risks we have made and expect to continue to pursue acquisitions dispositions or other investments that may strategically fit our business and or growth objectives we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to locate suitable acquisitions dispositions or investments or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us even if we do successfully execute such transactions they may not result in anticipated benefits which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results if we are unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings including any expected increases in revenues and operating results we may not be able to successfully cause a buyer of a divested business to assume the liabilities of that business or even if such liabilities are assumed we may have difficulties enforcing our rights contractual or otherwise against the buyer we may invest in companies or businesses that fail causing a loss of all or part of our investment in addition if we determine that an other than temporary decline in the fair value exists for a company in which we have invested we may have to write down that investment to its fair value and recognize the related write down as an investment loss a failure of our it infrastructure including as a result of cyber attacks could adversely impact our business and results of operations the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our it systems accordingly we rely upon the capacity reliability and security of our it hardware and software infrastructure and our ability to expand and update this infrastructure in response to changing needs we have been subject to cyber attacks in the past including phishing malware and ransomware and although no such attack has had a material adverse effect on our business this may not be the case with future attacks our systems may be vulnerable to damages from such attacks as well as from natural disasters failures in hardware or software power fluctuations unauthorized access to data and systems loss or destruction of data including confidential customer information human error and other similar disruptions and we cannot give assurance that any security measures we have implemented or may in the future implement will be sufficient to identify and prevent or mitigate such disruptions we rely on third parties to support the operation of our it hardware software infrastructure and cloud services and in certain instances utilize web based and software as a service applications the security and privacy measures implemented by such third parties as well as the measures implemented by any entities we acquire or with whom we do business may not be sufficient to identify or prevent cyber attacks and any such attacks may have a material adverse effect on our business while our it vendor agreements typically contain provisions that seek to eliminate or limit our exposure to liability for damages from a cyber attack we cannot ensure such provisions will withstand legal challenges or cover all or any such damages threats to our it systems arise from numerous sources not all of which are within our control including fraud or malice on the part of third parties accidental technological failure electrical or telecommunication outages failures of computer servers or other damage to our property or assets outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts the failure of our it systems or those of our vendors to perform as anticipated for any reason or any significant breach of security could disrupt our business and result in numerous adverse consequences including reduced effectiveness and efficiency of operations inappropriate disclosure of confidential and proprietary information reputational harm increased overhead costs and loss of important information which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future our insurance coverage may not cover all of the costs and liabilities we incur as the result of any disruptions or security breaches and if our business continuity and or disaster recovery plans do not effectively and timely resolve issues resulting from a cyber attack we may suffer material adverse effects on our business we are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy data protection and data security our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business we are subject to international data protection laws such as the general data protection regulation or gdpr in the european economic area the gdpr imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data which have increased our obligations including for example by requiring more robust disclosures to individuals notifications in some cases of data breaches to regulators and data subjects and a record of processing and other policies and procedures to be maintained to adhere to the accountability principle in addition we are subject to the gdpr s rules on transferring personal data outside of the eea including to the united states and some of these rules are currently being challenged in the courts failure to comply with the requirements of gdpr and the local laws implementing or supplementing the gdpr could result in fines of up to 20 000 000 or up to 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher as well as other administrative penalties we are likely to be required to expend significant capital and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance with the gdpr and other applicable data protection legislation and we may be required to put in place additional control mechanisms which could be onerous and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we may not realize the cost savings synergies and other benefits expected from the merger the combination of two independent companies is a complex costly and time consuming process as a result we will be required to continue to devote management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of technip and fmc technologies the integration process may disrupt our businesses and if ineffectively implemented could preclude realization of the full benefits expected from the merger our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the operations of technip and fmc technologies or otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of the merger could interrupt and seriously harm the results of our operations in addition the overall integration of technip and fmc technologies may result in unanticipated expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of client relationships diversion of management s attention or other problems and such problems could if material cause our stock price to decline the difficulties of combining the operations of technip and fmc technologies include but are not limited to the following managing a significantly larger company coordinating geographically separate organizations the potential diversion of management focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters aligning and executing our strategy retaining existing customers and attracting new customers maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees integrating two unique business cultures the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations coordinating distribution and marketing efforts integrating it communications and other systems changes in applicable laws and regulations managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the merger and taking actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals many of these factors are at least partially outside our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue and diversion of management s time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if the operations of technip and fmc technologies are successfully integrated we may not realize the full benefits of the merger including the synergies cost savings sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all as a result the combination of technip and fmc technologies may not result in the realization of the full benefits expected from the merger the irs may not agree that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for u s federal tax purposes and may seek to impose an excise tax on gains recognized by certain individuals although we are incorporated in the united kingdom the u s internal revenue service the irs may assert that we should be treated as a u s domestic corporation and therefore a u s tax resident for u s federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the u s internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code for u s federal income tax purposes a corporation i is generally considered a domestic corporation or u s tax resident if it is organized in the united states or of any state or political subdivision therein and ii is generally considered a foreign corporation or non u s tax resident if it is not considered a domestic corporation because we are a u k incorporated entity we would be considered a foreign corporation and therefore a non u s tax resident under these rules section 7874 of the code section 7874 provides an exception under which a foreign incorporated entity may in certain circumstances be treated as a domestic corporation for u s federal income tax purposes we do not believe this exception applies however the section 7874 rules are complex and subject to detailed regulations the application of which is uncertain in various respects it is possible that the irs will not agree with our position should the irs successfully challenge our position it is also possible that an excise tax under section 4985 of the code the section 4985 excise tax may be assessed against certain disqualified individuals including former officers and directors of fmc technologies inc on certain stock based compensation held thereby we may if we determine that it is appropriate provide disqualified individuals with a payment with respect to the section 4985 excise tax so that on a net after tax basis they would be in the same position as if no such section 4985 excise tax had been applied in addition there can be no assurance that there will not be a change in law or interpretation including with retroactive effect that might cause us to be treated as a domestic corporation for u s federal income tax purposes u s tax laws and or guidance could affect our ability to engage in certain acquisition strategies and certain internal restructurings even if we are treated as a foreign corporation for u s federal income tax purposes section 7874 u s treasury regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder may adversely affect our ability to engage in certain future acquisitions of u s businesses or to restructure the non u s members of our group these limitations if applicable may affect the tax efficiencies that otherwise might be achieved in such potential future transactions or restructurings in addition the irs and the u s treasury have issued final and temporary regulations providing that even if we are treated as a foreign corporation for u s federal income tax purposes certain intercompany debt instruments issued on or after april 4 2016 will be treated as equity for u s federal income tax purposes therefore limiting u s tax benefits and resulting in possible u s withholding taxes although recent guidance from the u s treasury proposes deferring certain documentation requirements that would otherwise be imposed with respect to covered debt instruments and further indicates that these rules generally are the subject of continuing study and may be further materially modified the current regulations may adversely affect our future effective tax rate and could also impact our ability to engage in future restructurings if such transactions cause an existing intercompany debt instrument to be treated as reissued for u s federal income tax purposes we are subject to the tax laws of numerous jurisdictions challenges to the interpretation of or future changes to such laws could adversely affect us we and our subsidiaries are subject to tax laws and regulations in the united kingdom the united states france and numerous other jurisdictions in which we and our subsidiaries operate these laws and regulations are inherently complex and we are and will continue to be obligated to make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws and regulations to our operations and businesses the interpretation and application of these laws and regulations could be challenged by the relevant governmental authorities which could result in administrative or judicial procedures actions or sanctions which could be material in addition the u s congress the u k government the european union the organization for economic co operation and development the oecd and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations new tax initiatives directives and rules such as the u s tax cuts and jobs act the oecd s base erosion and profit shifting initiative and the european union s anti tax avoidance directives may increase our tax burden and require additional compliance related expenditures as a result our financial condition results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected further changes including with retroactive effect in the tax laws of the united states the united kingdom the european union or other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could also adversely affect us we may not qualify for benefits under tax treaties entered into between the united kingdom and other countries we operate in a manner such that we believe we are eligible for benefits under tax treaties between the united kingdom and other countries however our ability to qualify for such benefits will depend on whether we are treated as a u k tax resident the requirements contained in each treaty and applicable domestic laws on the facts and circumstances surrounding our operations and management and on the relevant interpretation of the tax authorities and courts for example because of the anticipated withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union brexit we may lose some or all of the benefits of tax treaties between the united states and the remaining members of the european union and face higher tax liabilities which may be significant another example is the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting the mli which entered into force for participating jurisdictions on july 1 2018 the mli recommends that countries adopt a limitation on benefit rule and or a principle purposes test rule with regards to their tax treaties the scope and interpretation of these rules as adopted pursuant to the mli are presently under development but the application of either rule might deny us tax treaty benefits that were previously available the failure by us or our subsidiaries to qualify for benefits under tax treaties entered into between the united kingdom and other countries could result in adverse tax consequences to us including an increased tax burden and increased filing obligations and could result in certain tax consequences of owning and disposing of our shares we intend to be treated exclusively as a resident of the united kingdom for tax purposes but french or other tax authorities may seek to treat us as a tax resident of another jurisdiction we are incorporated in the united kingdom english law currently provides that we will be regarded as a u k resident for tax purposes from incorporation and shall remain so unless i we are concurrently a resident in another jurisdiction applying the tax residence rules of that jurisdiction that has a double tax treaty with the united kingdom and ii there is a tiebreaker provision in that tax treaty which allocates exclusive residence to that other jurisdiction in this regard we have a permanent establishment in france to satisfy certain french tax requirements imposed by the french tax code with respect to the merger although it is intended that we will be treated as having our exclusive place of tax residence in the united kingdom the french tax authorities may claim that we are a tax resident of france if we were to fail to maintain our place of effective management in the united kingdom any such claim would be settled between the french and u k tax authorities pursuant to the mutual assistance procedure provided for by the tax treaty concluded between france and the united kingdom there is no assurance that these authorities would reach an agreement that we will remain exclusively a u k tax resident a determination which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects a failure to maintain exclusive tax residency in the united kingdom could result in adverse tax consequences to us and our subsidiaries and could result in certain adverse changes in the tax consequences of owning and disposing of our shares the company has identified material weaknesses relating to internal control over financial reporting if our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses or if one or more additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to further restate our financial results which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows management identified material weaknesses in the company s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2017 and december 31 2018 as described in the corporate governance report of this u k annual report a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis as a result of the material weaknesses management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december 31 2018 in addition as a result of these material weaknesses our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of december 31 2018 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective until these material weaknesses are remediated they could lead to errors in our financial results and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows if our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses or if one or more additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows restrict our ability to access the capital markets require significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies subject us to fines penalties or judgments harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence and in the market price of our stock additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting could be identified in the future any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation could result in additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under section 404 of the u s sarbanes oxley act of 2002 and the rules promulgated under section 404 the existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information leading to among other things a decline in our stock price we can give no assurances that the measures we have taken to date or any future measures we may take will fully remediate the material weaknesses identified or that any additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future due to our failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over

open this photo in gallery bill morneau canada s minister of finance is photographed after a globe and mail interview in toronto on march 13 2019 fred lum the globe and mail the spotlight has not always been kind to bill morneau take for instance a town hall meeting held in oakville ont in september 2017 a couple of months earlier during a sleepy summer mr morneau unveiled a package of changes to the small business tax regime the issue soon blew up in his face doctors lawyers farmers and business owners were outraged at policies they saw as unfair which among other measures sought to restrict how income could be spread among family members who contribute to a business worse they felt the government was branding them as tax scofflaws in oakville the crowd seethed hurling questions at mr morneau and often drowning him out i appreciate he ventured before capitulating to the aggrieved shouting guys please let him speak pleaded fellow cabinet minister karina gould who was there as host that bought him at least a couple of minutes before another heckler interjected ms gould had to stand up and beg for calm before giving the floor back to mr morneau so i ll really stop there he said and say that i appreciate your comments federal budget 2019 five things to watch for today it was an almost painfully reticent response but not an unusual one for mr morneau for a finance minister one of the most powerful positions in ottawa he is oddly reserved and non confrontational contrast him with predecessors such as paul martin and jim flaherty all were take charge characters and household names in their own right and their prime ministers relied on them to implement bold agendas but after four years mr morneau has yet to make much of a mark and frustration with him in many segments of the business community seems to be building he is not by his own admission a natural politician he has sometimes appeared uncomfortable or stiff in front of cameras his statements bogged down with talking points the adversarial nature of question period in which mps lob insults at one another is far more chaotic than the genteel world of pension management where mr morneau worked as an executive for more than two decades his steadfast reserve seems out of the place with the unrelenting enthusiasm of many of his younger colleagues in caucus and especially set against prime minister justin trudeau s propensity for hugging and photo bombing prime ministers and finance ministers are often inseparable but mr trudeau s innermost circle has consisted of katie telford and until recently gerald butts whom he s known for years in an interview in his office in toronto however mr morneau seems pretty relaxed for a guy who will deliver his fourth federal budget on march 19 wearing a crisp blue suit he looks every bit the businessman he was before he entered politics he s even quick with a smile i guarantee you this will happen this year on monday the day before the budget i will get five or six people calling me saying you really need to put this in the budget he says in an interview with the globe and mail people don t understand the process and that s just the reality that sounds decisive and reassuring and no one has ever doubted mr morneau s credentials after he was elected in the riding of toronto centre and appointed finance minister his supporters played up his business experience those credentials lent the rookie liberal government under mr trudeau a degree of fiscal sobriety and gravitas but in many corners of bay street and the larger business community there is a sense of disappointment with mr morneau the federal government is racking up deficits with no plan to pay them down crucial infrastructure is still not built and business investment is weak the liberals scrapped a previous plan to return the budget to balance and now target a reduction of the federal debt to gdp ratio its fiscal projections will almost certainly change in tuesday s budget mr morneau s friends associates and former colleagues insist that the image doesn t match reality they say he truly thrives behind closed doors tackling big files talking policy or handling tough negotiations his contributions are substantial but largely unheralded they say the voting public doesn t get to see the deal maker and negotiator behind the scenes mr morneau has a few more months to make that case himself but he doesn t like to dwell on his record i am much more interested in getting stuff done than in talking about what i ve gotten done he says it is an election year of course and with that comes the possibility the forthcoming budget may be mr morneau s last this one may prove to be more important than most both for mr morneau and his party the liberals are no doubt hoping whatever measures are unveiled in a few days will shift attention away from the scandal surrounding the government s alleged political interference in the criminal prosecution of snc lavalin group inc the liberals will have a much harder time campaigning as the exemplars of transparency inclusivity and moral infallibility as they did before that leaves them to tout more tangible policy achievements particularly when it comes to the economy much of that task will fall to mr morneau he may not be as inexperienced as he was four years ago but this time he s making a sales pitch while carrying considerable political baggage and the audience is much more skeptical open this photo in gallery canada s finance minister bill morneau tries on a new pair of shoes during a pre budget photo opportunity with children in toronto ontario canada march 14 2019 mark blinch reuters just about anybody you ask on bay street will compliment mr morneau on his business achievements he earned an international education with degrees from insead in france and the london school of economics and joined the pension management and employee benefits firm founded by his father originally called w f morneau associates in 1987 mr morneau was appointed president in 1992 and later added ceo to his title overseeing acquisitions and eventually taking the company public by the time he left the firm now called morneau shepell it was pulling in more than 560 million in annual revenue mr morneau was also involved in non profit work such as serving as chair of covenant house a shelter for homeless youth in toronto through his job and his volunteer work he could see shifts in the labour market that were hurting many workers more skills training became necessary for decent employment and the possibility of having a secure pension plan was narrowing over the last few decades you see that the benefits of a growing economy are increasingly going to those who are more prepared to be successful mr morneau says for me it was really where s the place that you can have the biggest positive impact on the country it s the kind of sentiment that can sound painfully earnest but that s why he turned to federal politics mr morneau is an unlikely champion for the middle class he s a wealthy individual married to nancy mccain an heir to the mccain family fortune he set up a corporation to own a villa in france after all but friends say mr morneau really means it he was very clear and it s never changed that his role was to create growth for the economy says maryse harvey who worked as deputy chief of staff for mr morneau until last year it s the principle that drives him and drove most of his decisions some friends from the business world say mr morneau never struck them as partisan nor did he discuss politics but in february 2014 he appeared as a keynote speaker at the liberal party s convention in montreal as justin trudeau looked on adoringly in the crowd mr morneau attacked the governing conservatives economic policies as a business person i can tell you we can t slash our way to success we must invest in the things that matter he declared mr morneau became one of the liberal party s star candidates and he was rewarded with the finance post for someone who had never held elected office at any level of government before it was a remarkable show of confidence finance ministers have loomed large in ottawa michael wilson helped negotiate the north american free trade agreement and implemented the controversial federal goods and services tax paul martin is renowned for tackling the deficit jim flaherty held the reins during the financial crisis mr morneau just doesn t have the same presence i would say that he has ended up being less prominent than a finance minister ordinarily is says christopher ragan an associate professor of economics at mcgill university who also served on the federal government s economic advisory panel he s been overtaken by events and we just haven t seen as much from him indeed since donald trump was elected u s president so much of the government s attention has been focused on renegotiating nafta an army of canadian officials was involved including mr morneau but foreign affairs minister chrystia freeland emerged as the lead it s also not mr morneau s style to showboat nobody can see this from the outside but he s played the role of coo inside the government says robert asselin who served as policy and budget director for mr morneau until 2017 he didn t see his role as being in the media every day canada has added more than 900 000 jobs since the liberals election win at 5 8 per cent the jobless rate is near its lowest level on record average annual job growth under the liberals is roughly in line with historical averages ottawa was a new environment for mr morneau and his modesty was occasionally on display evan siddall who heads the canada mortgage and housing corp and has known mr morneau for years recalls giving mr morneau a briefing shortly after the liberals took office as protocol dictates he referred to his friend as minister mr morneau looked at him with genuine puzzlement and asked why aren t you calling me bill mr asselin points to three achievements he feels have been overlooked early in mr morneau s tenure he struck a major overhaul of the canada pension plan with the provinces a tricky file that languished unresolved among finance ministers for years the process took about a year and mr asselin credits mr morneau s negotiating skills for clinching the deal mr morneau also took on the thorny issue of federal health transfers to the provinces and methodically struck long term agreements with each government one by one finally mr morneau helped co ordinate federal agencies to enact measures to cool overheated housing markets and curb growth in household debt the outcry from the real estate industry was fierce these measures were seen as dramatic and irresponsible and people were worried he would almost cause a recession mr asselin says bill was able to do the difficult stuff within months of his appointment mr morneau also announced the creation of an economic advisory panel led by dominic barton global managing partner emeritus at mckinsey co the panel ultimately led to the creation of new federal agencies including the canada infrastructure bank and the invest in canada hub to attract foreign dollars mr morneau is the type of leader who asks questions rather than assert his opinion mr barton says he recalls a cabinet discussion last year focused on putting trade talks with china on hold in light of nafta negotiations and because of growing tensions between the united states and china mr morneau started probing the benefits of free trade with china compared with the existing arrangement under the world trade organization mr barton says that conversation ultimately led to measures in the budget to help canadian companies expand trade opportunities he has a very interesting style of inspiring people to say hey why can t we do that mr barton says and actually he knows but he doesn t tell you colleagues also praise mr morneau s cool demeanour during tense negotiations such as the talks to purchase the trans mountain pipeline from kinder morgan inc last year the guys at kinder morgan were really tough negotiators says mr siddall who mr morneau recruited for the deal making sessions the company s opening position was aggressive mr siddall recalls but mr morneau didn t respond with hostility he made it clear he was unhappy he didn t raise his voice he didn t use strong language mr siddall says he just said you re being unreasonable regulatory filings show the company s initial asking price was 6 5 billion which the government negotiated down to 4 5 billion the purchase was controversial of course environmentalists were dismayed a recent report by the parliamentary budget officer concluded ottawa likely overpaid too that was a project we didn t want to take on but took on because we knew it was the right thing to do for the country mr morneau says the government contends the purchase will prove to be a worthwhile investment leading to new jobs and increased tax revenue should the project proceed open this photo in gallery governor general david johnston and prime minister justin trudeau look on as bill morneau is sworn in as finance minister during ceremonies at rideau hall nov 4 2015 in ottawa adrian wyld the canadian press for some observers mr morneau disappointed almost immediately into his tenure former bank of canada governor david dodge now a senior adviser at bennett jones llp faults the government for its approach to the retirement age the previous conservative government made plans to raise old age security eligibility from 65 to 67 to address the strain of an aging population and longer life expectancies once in power the liberals nixed those plans out of the gate bill morneau did not stand up to the prime minister that s a structural mistake for which we are going to pay mr dodge says demonstrated right away he was not going to be the paul martin or the mike wilson type of finance minister that basically called the shots to make the economic side work mr morneau s own economic advisory panel recommended raising the retirement age but he hasn t acted on it he argues that doing so disproportionately affects low and middle income workers for those people we re recognizing that 65 is an appropriate age for them to hit retirement he says people who criticize the government for its decision are not thinking about how that actually impacts canadians for mr dodge though mr morneau s inexperience in politics led to problems it s unfortunate that the prime minister put him in that position early on he says he made some stumbles one of the most difficult periods proved to be the controversy over mr morneau s personal finances in october 2017 the globe and mail reported he had not placed his substantial private financial holdings into a blind trust prompting months of heated questions over his personal ethics mr morneau maintained he had followed the advice of the ethics commissioner who later launched an investigation into whether the minister was in a conflict of interest when he introduced a bill on private pension rules the investigation later cleared mr morneau but the commissioner s office fined him 200 for failing to disclose all relevant details of his ownership in a villa in france while under attack for his personal finances mr morneau was still dealing with the fallout from the government s changes to small business taxation the policies were meant to fulfill a campaign pledge to ensure that small business structures were not used by wealthy canadians for tax avoidance but the government s messaging on the issue was viewed by many as a personal insult every business owner in the country firmly believed they were being called a tax cheat by the minister of finance says dan kelly president and ceo of the canadian federation of independent business economic growth cooled considerably in the fourth quarter of 2018 and weakness is widely thought to spill over into 2019 however many private sector economists expect growth will pick up in the latter half of the year the minister eventually backed down considerably from his initial proposals and also lowered the small business tax rate but the debacle may have caused permanent damage to mr morneau s reputation it would have been a lot easier to kiss and make up but the rhetoric is burned in business owners minds mr kelly says this is still a pretty hot issue with small business owners what mr kelly found puzzling though was that neither he nor his staff ever met directly with mr morneau to discuss any of the policy changes mr kelly says the organization has met with every provincial and federal finance minister in its 48 years of existence it was shocking to us that minister morneau refused to meet with us despite dozens of requests mr kelly says we spoke to his political aides and were begging them to listen to us because we told them we can help you find ways to get out of some of the objectives you re setting without causing this brush fire the minister s office agreed to meet with cfib staff earlier this year while the whole episode must have been a learning experience for mr morneau he seems reluctant to expound on what exactly he took away from it you ve got to be very prepared for what the response is going to be he offers you ve got to have a deep understanding of who the constituents are that are going to be impacted speaking generally he says he s spent a lot of time over the past few years improving his communications skills whether it s with the media giving speeches or standing up during question period the very personal and aggressive part of that is something that is not in my estimation that productive but it s part of the role you get acclimatized to he says mr morneau s restrained approach is made all the more apparent when contrasted with conservative finance critic pierre poilievre he is mr morneau s polar opposite in practically every way quick with a retort instinctual rather than considered and clearly relishing his job to make the finance minister uncomfortable he often smirks when he asks a question he knows mr morneau will not answer such as during a committee meeting last year when he grilled the finance minister about a timeline for balancing the budget what i can tell you is mr morneau repeated before offering a non specific answer but mr morneau will fire off pot shots of his own these days asked about a path to balancing the budget he characterizes it as a conservative question it s a partisan one that s not based on a plan he says it s based on an ideology and obviously on a pretty inexperienced group of people in the current conservative party you know andrew scheer with no real business experience of his own the statement though still has the feel of something being workshopped open this photo in gallery bill morneau keith witmer what really matters when assessing finance ministers is whether their policies have helped or hindered the economy during mr morneau s time as finance minister economic growth has been tepid but not terrible and the country s unemployment rate is at 40 year lows at just 5 8 per cent as much as the liberals love to talk about jobs and the economy how much they can legitimately take credit for is debatable the canada child benefit introduced in mr morneau s first budget did put about 7 billion into the pockets of canadians and gave the economy a one time boost says douglas porter chief economist at the bank of montreal but over all the effect of the liberals policies is tricky to determine governments get too much blame when times are bad and they get too much credit when times are good mr porter says but there are other measures of success or failure when mr morneau introduced the canada child benefit the goal was to boost incomes and reduce poverty statistics canada reported in february that median after tax income of canadian families and unattached individuals rose 3 3 per cent to 59 800 in 2017 following two years without growth the percentage of canadians living below the poverty line meanwhile dropped from 10 6 per cent in 2016 to 9 5 per cent in 2017 the hallmark of mr morneau s tenure however just might be deficit spending the liberals ran on a campaign of modest short term deficits and a balancing of the books by 2019 then promptly tossed that plan aside after winning mr morneau has presided over a period that saw nearly 40 billion in new debt added over three years there is no plan to return to balance according to the government s november fiscal update federal debt will hit 764 7 billion in 2023 24 up from 634 5 billion in 2015 16 by the time the liberals took office they learned of a 10 billion shortfall in government finances compared with the figures used to develop their platform as the economy took a hit from the decline in oil prices rather than curtail spending plans the fiscal gap and sluggish growth strengthened the incentive to spend says mr asselin the former budget and policy director it kind of helped the narrative that we were trying to establish that we needed structural measures that would help the economy for the long run he says even though it would mean running bigger deficits than promised mr dodge says mr morneau is essentially borrowing money for the wrong things at the wrong time he doesn t fault the government for spending money on large infrastructure projects but says that also borrowing to essentially drive consumption puts unnecessary strain on finances if the economy really does hit the tank then they ve built a problem for themselves that s going to be very difficult to deal with he says they ve used up their fiscal room whenever mr morneau is asked about government spending which is pretty often his stock answer is that when measured as a percentage of gdp federal debt will actually decline over time by 2023 24 federal debt to gdp will fall to 28 5 per cent from 31 8 per cent when the liberals took office according to government projections i m not arguing that we don t have to always prudently manage our finances we do he says we want to make sure that we are not leaving people out of the equation of success mr morneau points to the canada workers benefit a measure introduced in last year s budget that aims to increase the take home pay for low income workers through a tax credit do i think that was a good investment absolutely he says would somebody who s in a different ideological position than me maybe not executives on bay street are more likely to be in the maybe not category the globe spoke with a handful of them all of whom requested anonymity to share their views candidly while they admire mr morneau as a person and business leader they re unhappy about some aspects of his tenure they grumbled about deficits tax rates the slow pace of infrastructure spending and the fact that canada still faces huge challenges exporting crude oil canadian business investment dropped off as alberta languished in recession investment figures have yet to fully recover even mr morneau s fall update which included an accelerated capital cost allowance for businesses was criticized as a reaction to the steep corporate tax cuts in the united states business investment meanwhile is still below where it was four years ago the government s single minded messaging on the middle class has left some executives wondering about the liberals commitment to business these comments may be more revealing of bay street than of mr morneau however i ve heard people whine about it he was one of us how dare he all that stuff mr siddall says this is a liberal centre left government his position would not be tenable if he did not play ball he says when mr morneau looks at the past few years he measures his performance against the reasons he got into politics in the first place doing the greatest good for the greatest number of canadians on that front he s feeling confident mr morneau is absolutely running again he says even looking forward to it i ll be very pleased to be out there talking about 900 000 new jobs that have been created he says i ll be very pleased to be talking about the lowest level of unemployment we ve seen in my working life mr morneau has definitely heard the views of his former colleagues in the business world recently he says he attended a dinner with business executives where they expressed concern about tax rates for the 1 per cent which the liberals hiked they re not recognizing that i have to think about all the people now not their particular business he says the problem is there s not a lot of tools at my disposal there s only so much redistribution you can do but i say to them if you re not going to raise pay then we need to think about what we re going to do so lowering their taxes is what we ve done earlier in his interview with the globe mr morneau deflected when asked about what his former colleagues in business thought of his tenure as finance minister but as the conversation winds down he returns to the question unprompted mr morneau starts musing about how the passage of time affects memory the way it blunts emotional highs and lows and the way it shapes how we view politicians in the years after they leave office the people who love me they re not going to love me as much in a decade he says the people who hate me they re not going to hate me as much in a decade time is forgiving there s a softening on all sides that happens he says and there s a forgetting
panelists discuss the links between democratic governance and global health bollyky great we re going to get started good afternoon thank you for coming on a beautiful spring day my name is tom bollyky and i m the director of the global health program here at the council on foreign relations you re here for a session on democracy and health thank you to those of you that have joined us online if you haven t already silenced your cellphones i d be grateful if you did so today s event is on the record and it is being livestreamed this will be an unusual format for a cfr roundtable and i m going to beg your indulgence with that i m going to start by giving an overview of the paper that my colleagues and i published today in the lancet it s the impetus for this meeting it assesses the links between democracy adult health and disease specific morality in 1970 countries over a forty six year period between 1970 and 2016 we re also releasing today a data interactive on cfr org that s based on those results at the end of this overview i ve been asked to just turn it over to the first panel rather than taking questions so in the meantime my colleagues will sit here awkwardly on stage while i do these initial remarks they will then get the chance to do a panel for forty five minutes on what the global trends are on democracy on health and on health spending and what we know about them and how we know about them the speakers on this panel joe dieleman and simon wigley are coauthors on this paper they re also more than capable of answering your questions about that paper my terrific colleague alyssa ayres is moderating the panel you will see me again however so if you do have questions you can try to work them into the second panel which i will be moderating the second panel has two speakers who are not associated with this paper but are most definitely expert in the topics of democracy internationally and its promotion those speakers are tom carothers from the carnegie endowment and kate somvongsiri from usaid they will speak again about democracy promotion internationally and ideas for extending its reach and its effectiveness i want to just make a couple of acknowledgements before we move on the first is to the cfr meetings team to thank them for organizing this great event and the second is to bloomberg philanthropies for their generous support for this research and this roundtable series this research is very much a product of collaboration of several coauthors and institutions and in particular i want to acknowledge tara templin who is at stanford and who led a lot of the analytical work underlying this paper and diana schoder who s here at cfr and they re both in the audience as well i m also contractually obliged to acknowledge the fact that the work you re about to hear is based in part on my book that was released last fall so it s plagues and the paradox of progress why the world is getting healthier in worrisome ways and with that let s get to what we re here to talk about today democracy in recent decades has played what has seemed like a modest role in global health for decades cuba and china were held out as countries that had provided good health to their populations at low cost many of the nations that have had the greatest gains in life expectancy ethiopia uganda myanmar rwanda are countries that are non democratic or autocratic they have achieved their successes often with the heavy support of international aid but health needs are starting to change in low and middle income countries so the child deaths worldwide over the last fifteen years have almost halved infectious diseases no longer cause the majority of death or disability in any region of the world including sub saharan africa and that leads to the fact that when you have these reductions in infectious diseases and of course you have these reductions in child deaths and you save the lives of children you re going to get more adults and that s what we re seeing and adults have adult health needs so you are getting more adults and you re having populations grow and that is happening at a rate that s much or that effect is overwhelming the fact that you know rates of noncommunicable diseases diseases that disproportionately affect adults heart disease diabetes cancers they re not necessarily increasing the rate but the population that is likely or susceptible to get those diseases you re seeing more of them because people are aging and you re seeing population growth and that s really driving the fast rate of increase in these diseases you can see that from the share of health burdens in low and middle income countries that are now represented by these noncommunicable diseases take an example bangladesh from 1990 will go from a country that had roughly 28 percent of its death and disability associated with these noncommunicable diseases by 2040 that ll be 82 percent that s roughly the same as it is in the united states but they ll do that transition in fifty years instead of two hundred you see similar results with countries like ethiopia and myanmar which are also having very dramatic shifts in health needs what that led us to question is whether or not the results or the modest results we ve seen from democracy in the past on life expectancy and on child deaths whether that would also be true for these noncommunicable diseases or health concerns of adults and what we find is not so much so the first analysis that we did was looking at countries that transitioned to democracy between 1970 and 2015 and compared their adult life expectancy life expectancy at fifteen with countries that had not transitioned during that time period so it s about fifteen countries that had transitioned fifty five countries that had not and we controlled for hiv because hiv is a disease that predominantly affects adults but is heavily targeted by development assistance for health international aid and that s true both in democracies and in autocracies and so we didn t want to get that confounding effect but what you see is for the countries that transitioned their adult life expectancy increased by 3 percent after the first ten years of that transition and that s a pretty dramatic difference from other nations you can see that here on your left hand side and the right hand figure shows the probability that those results are the byproduct of chance and that probability s very low all right so the next analysis we did was to look at what drivers what explains the mortality reductions you see from various diseases within a country and we compared democracy or democratic experience which is the quality of the democracy and how long the country has been a democracy to other factors like gdp per capita or urbanicity or aid and what you find is that democratic experience explains more of the reductions and is associated more strongly with more of the reductions in mortality from diseases like cardiovascular disease transportation injuries which are like road traffic injuries cancers and other noncommunicable diseases they re more associative than gdp so for cardiovascular disease it represents almost close to a quarter or explains as close to a quarter of those differences and for the other causes a little bit less you do not however see that many infectious diseases are associated with improvements with increases in democratic experience you also see that the role of democracy is increasing over time this shows you just for cardiovascular diseases and increased from roughly 13 percent to again around 23 percent of explaining again the differences within countries from in morality so what explains this outsized effect health effect of democracy on noncommunicable diseases on adult health versus infectious diseases that disproportionately affect children well one thing we wanted to make sure is that we re not just seeing a byproduct of democracies being wealthier and what you see here is that increases from democracy are in fact not associated with increases in gdp they are however associated those increases with increases in government health spending and declines in mortality from cardiovascular disease how big of an effect is this having well for each point increase in democratic stock again democratic experience you see a 2 percent reduction in mortality from cardiovascular disease over twenty years for cardiovascular diseases transport injuries tuberculosis and other noncommunicable diseases it s about a 9 percent total decrease in morality over twenty years that may not sound a lot but the median country increased its democratic experience or its democratic stock by 4 88 points over those twenty years so what that means is if you just look at cardiovascular diseases alone we estimate improvements in democracy averting 16 2 million deaths globally because you see this dramatic shift of noncommunicable diseases to more populous countries if you just extent that rate of improvement out to 2017 it goes to twenty one and a half million again because of this dramatic shift that s happening so to try to make these results a little more policy actionable we tried to identify which component of democracy is really driving these health benefits and what you see is if you remove them one by one it s free and fair elections so if you remove free and fair elections from the drivers or the overall components of democracy the health effects cease to be statistically significant they effectively disappear so what conclusions do we draw from these findings we draw the fact that increasingly democracy or elections and the health of the people are inseparable that this suggests that there needs to be more support for development agency programs that promote democracy in governance and this will be particularly true as it seems unlikely we re going to see dramatic increases in global health aid in the future particularly for ncds and injuries that looking at democracy promotion and governance may be a way to see big health benefits without necessarily seeing large increases in development assistance with that i will turn it over to the panel applause ayres thank you thank you for that fascinating introduction to the topic here welcome to our first panel in today s event on democracy matters in global health we ve got with us our two speakers simon wigley and joe dieleman i am you have their bios with you in your reading packet my name is alyssa ayres and i m senior fellow here at the council on foreign relations i m regionally focused i focus on india pakistan and south asia where you ve got some big democracies and some health challenges and some health improvements but i m looking forward to hearing more from both simon and joe i think we re going to lead off with simon wigley sure sure so i m going to focus more on the democracy side of the study but try and connect it to some of the results that tom mentioned and perhaps i could start with a general sort of statement about the argument that s sitting in the background here and it s familiar to those who ve read amartya sen s development as freedom where he argues that democracies have a wider that government has a wider support base than an autocracy so it has more the political survival of democratic leaders depends on obtaining more votes which means the need for spreading health care to a wider set of the population is higher but also there s an important feedback loop that democratic leaders can receive feedback about the need for intervention and success of that intervention so this is kind of sitting in the background as the main argument the strength of the study a lot of it comes down to the strength of the data we rely on two datasets one of which joe will explain a lot more detail and better than i can from the ihme and global burden of disease database the other one relies on a relatively new study on indicators of democracy called the varieties of democracy dataset which is based in the university of gothenburg and this is a step up from the usual indicators that we ve been using in political science and international relations which is freedom house and for example polity iv it s a step up because of the level of sophistication in dealing with potential measurement error is significant the other key part of the v dem dataset is that it has incredible detail so rather than just looking at general components of democracy suffrage free and fair elections free speech et cetera you can dive a lot deeper and look at specific signals of the health the democratic health of a state for example whether the electoral commission is autonomous from the government or not or whether the degree of vote buying that exists in each state so this is a really impressive dataset that has been put together as tom mentioned we adjust this we rely on core components of democracy free and fair suffrage freedom of association et cetera but we also add in a historical component to capture not just the ebb and flow of democracy across time but also how long a country has this level of democracy let s say so let s more capturing the kind of long lasting quality of democracy in each state rather than day to day fluctuations so perhaps i could briefly mention some of the trends in democracy that have emerged that we can observe from this new dataset so the good news is that fifteen countries transitioned to democracy between 1980 and 2000 as tom mentioned and we use this as part of one of our pieces of analysis and most countries have improved in terms of their democratic experience or democratic quality over time since 1990 so there s the positive and that is quite a big positive most countries in the world are democratic right now the worrying news is familiar to us already perhaps since 1970 fifty five countries have been entirely autocratic without interruption and there s growing concern about the democratic erosion in some states in the last two to three years there s the familiar cases such as russia or venezuela but also recently in the last two years perhaps even some more established democracies like brazil and india seem to be at risk of some democratic erosion one of the telltale signals for this might be from the v dem dataset is the autonomy of the electoral board how much interference the government has in terms of the electoral commission and you see in those states that it s actually degraded the last two to three years which is kind of telltale signal of a risk of further erosion perhaps as tom mentioned free and fair elections is what stands out for our study and this connects directly with this democratic erosion i just referred to so those countries that are eroding they tend to fit the category of what is now called electoral authoritarianism or competitive autocracy where you have the formal conditions for democracy regular elections opposition parties perhaps even multiple media outlets and yet the incumbent can stack the playing field to such a degree that the chances that they will be elected out of office are very very low so they can create the façade of democracy but in fact the idea of rotating leaders is empirically usually doesn t happen and the free and fair elections is the the façade is disappears at this point because if you control the media even if there s diverse media outlets if you control the electoral board if you can use vote buying in poorer neighborhoods effectively you can really determine the outcome of the elections to a large degree and this one element as i said is the key part of our study in a sense the part which directly connects with adult health and noncommunicable diseases ayres joe dieleman thanks simon so if you glanced at the bio you would have seen that i work at the institute for health metrics and evaluation which is in seattle washington part of the university of washington and i highlight that only to say that that s kind of my expertise that s what i think in many ways i can bring to the studies is thinking how we measure health and health outcomes and so in the few minutes of remarks i have here i m going to really focus on a couple characteristics of how we measure health i ll then kind of dovetail and talk very briefly about some of my own research as a health economist and then i ll kind of tie it all together hopefully so just starting with health data i tend to think that if you re thinking about mortality statistics or just health data in general there s kind of two camps the more traditional set of statistics are what we who do the statistics and the data collection call all cause statistics and that simply a metric like life expectancy or child mortality and those statistics are very valuable they can be compared across time they tell you a lot about an individual country or a state or a city wherever it s being measured but what they don t tell you about is the actual cause of death i think that s where a lot of the advances have taken place over the last two or three decades is on a global level but also a much more microlevel for states and provinces and even cities measuring the causes of death not just the death rate how many people die but more specifically how many people died from ischemic heart disease or how many people died from diabetes and i think that s an important distinction to make first of all the methods that you measure those things are quite distinct but from a more pragmatic policy perspective i think cause specific morality and cause specific health outcome data is quite a bit more actionable it s actionable first and foremost because you can think about the interventions needed to care for and treat the patients before mortality it s also actionable because you can start to think about prevention again when it s just all cause mortality it s very hard to know what people are dying from and hard to understand what maybe risk factors are leading to those deaths on the contrary when you re looking at cause specific mortality you can start to back out and understand what are the risk factors what are the conditions that are leading to mortality so for example we look at a very large set of modifiable risk factors those are things that we think can be changed and measure essentially how much mortality globally is attributable to those risk factors when i say risk factors i mean things like you re all familiar with and certainly see in the media and see in your own life use of tobacco diet obesity physical activity air pollution those sorts of things again from a pragmatic policy perspective you can start to think about interventions that prevent those risks and ultimately have an impact on changing mortality so ultimately my thesis is that really cause specific health estimates are of far more utility and that s really what the institute that i work for has essentially gained a fair amount of notoriety for is the measurement of the global burden of disease which is the world s currently the world s largest publishing scientific endeavor it includes over eight thousand researchers that are scattered throughout the world that essentially measure everything i just said measure mortality rates but not mortality that is all cause but instead look at mortality for like i said specific diseases diabetes hiv cardiovascular diseases breast cancer so on and so forth and really the last reason i want to point out the last kind of reason i think cause specific mortality and cause specific health outcomes are of great utility is because they can start to be connected to broader research endeavors or in lines with my own work it can be connected with health financing data so i mentioned before that i m a health economist by training my research is really revolved around research tracking just understanding how much money is being spent on health and as we evolve and kind of push forward this kind of discipline that the steps that we re taking is to measure health spending at a more granular level and part of that means just identifying what health conditions resources are being spent on so for example we have a research study in the united states that takes the 3 trillion spent on health care and just breaks that 3 trillion up into the diseases and the populations that that spending is coming from and it you know comes to a wide variety of conclusions about where the money s going and it s not always necessarily to the places that people think we re spending the most on one of the long standing research projects that i m involved in is tracking development assistance for health so development assistance for health is essentially international aid it s coming from in most cases high income countries some upper middle income countries as well oftentimes it goes through major development agencies such as bilateral aid agencies but also multilateral aid agencies such as the world bank or the global fund the u n system and whatnot and those resources are spent in low and middle income countries with the intent of improving or at least maintaining health care and that project has tracked development assistance for health from 1990 through the present and what we see over the course of that you know nearly thirty years is that there s been a five times increase in the amount of development assistance that s provided and in 2018 our most recent numbers actually not quite published yet but soon to be published we see that development assistance is just under 40 billion and if you look at the growth trends over time most of that increase in spending really was the first decade of the new millennium from 2000 to 2010 the growth rates in the amount of development assistance for health that was provided really skyrocketed and it was essentially in some ways a global commitment to global health and in particular towards infectious disease that led to a major increase in spending so i said our study starts in 1990 in 1990 over 50 percent of development assistance for health was for child health and maternal health a lot of money on vaccines and a number of other interventions specifically for safe pregnancy labor and delivery and for those first few months and ultimately years of a child s life if you fast forward to 2010 i told you that there s been a major surge in the amount of development assistance for health that s provided and most of that surge focused on hiv tb and malaria it was the essentially the genesis of a number of major organizations such as the global fund and others that provided resources focusing on those diseases and in the u s government here was the pepfar program that really took off and provided literally billions of dollars of development assistance so where in 1990 over half of the development assistance was for maternal and child health if you fast forward to 2010 roughly 50 percent of the development assistance was for hiv and malaria alone so you see a really major shift in the composition of the development assistance for health that was being provided by high income countries since it relates to this topic i ll highlight too that noncommunicable diseases which we also track and also development assistance for health targets is really relatively consistent about 2 percent so a very small fraction of development assistance for health targeting noncommunicable diseases so i said i d talk briefly about health data a little bit my own research and then now to try to pull it all together so the question is why do these things matter and how in my mind are they connected so two things come to mind right away the first tom already alluded to he without saying it was talking about what academics will call the epidemiological transition and so the epidemiological transition may sound a little fancy but the idea is that the epidemiology is essentially what are we dying from and the transition is the fact that what we are dying from is changing over time and the hypothesis of that epidemiological transition was highlighted in some of the slides that tom already showed but it is that over time there s movement away from infectious and communicable diseases towards noncommunicable diseases and i think my point as a a health scientist studying specifically metrics is that you really need that cause specific information to be able to test the hypothesis of the epidemiological transition and it s really only with cause specific information that we understand what people are dying from the other thing that i think is really interesting about the epidemiological transition is that the rate of this transition has been changing and i think that doubles back to some of the things that we talked about or i mentioned earlier related to development assistance for health and technology changes and so in the past where transitioning from high mortality related to infectious diseases and moving to noncommunicable diseases may have taken a set amount of time we see that more recently especially in low and lower middle income countries that transition is happening much faster and i think the consequence and the really important component of that is that change which moves faster isn t quite as dependent on economic development as it used to be and it s also not as dependent on the development of a domestic health system that is able to necessarily treat noncommunicable diseases i think that lends itself or at least leads to a very concerning problem where there s movement towards the primary causes of the noncommunicable diseases but there s not a health system necessarily that s been developed well to take care of noncommunicable diseases the second point of how this all comes together is simply it allows us to study things like we ve done in this paper that was published today again there s a history of looking at the relationship of democracy and health outcomes but really i think that story becomes much more nuanced and much more policy relevant if we can understand specifically which health outcomes are relevant to democracy and in particular some of the findings that and conclusions that we came to is that it s these noncommunicable diseases which again according to this transition are more and more prevalent are increasingly a function of democracy and relevant to democracy so to close i ll end with just three very salient points three things to take away number one i really believe infectious and communicable diseases are still a very big deal over ten million people die each year from communicable diseases that said noncommunicable diseases are an increasingly large component of the causes that lead to mortality and morbidity second point is that the health systems needed to treat those noncommunicable diseases are not self evidence and in many low and lower middle income countries those health systems have yet to be developed and then the third conclusion is that you really need health metrics that are at the cause level that are breaking out mortality morbidity and health financing for specific diseases in order to be able to track and understand these trends across time with that i ll conclude ayres thank you so i want to ask just a couple questions to get us going before we open it up to members here and i m hoping to actually pull more out on the issue of the linkage between the findings of democracy and its effect on developing health systems that can adequately treat noncommunicable diseases one of the things actually that struck me about the lancet paper was that there is an important component of transportation injuries this is not necessarily a this struck me as more of a governance issue not so much a health systems issue but it seemed that the most important causes of death that were in this study were cardiovascular disease and transport injuries and it goes on down but can you speak about this issue of democracy and its linkages to developing health systems either simon or joe who wants to take that wigley you re better on transport injuries but i think it was a direct so we you have to correct me if i m wrong so we had one of the pieces of analysis whether there was a direct impact of democratic government or an indirect impact via spending or economic growth and if i remember correctly the transport injuries was a direct result of policy speed limits seat belts drunk driving et cetera so if that s correct then it s a government democratic governments being more interventionist on this level directly rather than through spending perhaps but perhaps joe has a different take on this dieleman yeah so i mean i think you can think of curbing mortality and health burden morbidity associated with traffic injuries in two ways one you can prevent those injuries from happening in the first place and you can care more efficiently for people after they ve been hurt and i think the hypothesis here is that democracy certainly can impact both of those things democracy can impact prevention through many of the mechanisms that simon just mentioned and again through treatment essentially through health care system development and through health care spending which comes also with democracy or at least is encouraged by democracy we see that a health system would be more efficient and effective at dealing with patients after they ve been injured ayres can you speak a little about the feedback loop which is an important part of the argument that this article makes that democracy provides a feedback loop for voters to either reelect or kick out governments in power do you see that as necessarily requiring voters to make specific demands about health delivery service delivery health care systems or is it more a question of a kind of general sense of whether a government is being responsive to helping improve lives wigley so the feedback loop is just the signal through the voters or through civil society mobilization that s a and through the media so if there s a disease problem or a disease burden in a certain part of the population democracies have the greater means to receive that signal and to realize that policy intervention is required but also probably equally importantly to check whether the intervention is working so especially in a closed autocracy there s no kind of there s no such feedback mechanism and where free speech is limited it becomes equally even more problematic so some have argued that in the case of china they recognize this as a distinct problem so the so called firewall on social media is actually designed and this is based on research in harvard that it s designed not to stop complaints so to speak about bureaucrats but to stop mobilization so the filtering that s going on in terms of social media is about not preventing complaints or the signals that s something wrong but to prevent collective action so the chinese government if that s correct is recognizing the shortfall of autocratic or less than democratic states ayres joe dieleman no i don t have much to add i think simon and maybe the second panel are probably better at thinking about that feedback ayres when you worked to develop the database and to match the database with health systems and health outcomes findings can you speak a little bit about some observations from some of the countries that have gone through a democratic transition and experienced these improvements in health outcomes do you have some cases that the lancet article is very theoretical it doesn t give you a few of the cases that would be helpful to understanding how exactly this works wigley so the kind of stand out examples of significant improvement after transition so you do have two kinds of analysis in the background one in which we measure democracy in terms of the transition and sustained transition to democracy the other one is this democratic experience indicator the first one is a good way to pick out some cases because the model compares a country with itself so to speak so for example poland or brazil when compared with themselves have done remarkably well since the transition and bolivia as well so there s a few standout cases when you look at the curve or the gap between what would have been the case in poland versus the doppelganger poland you know this is roughly you know there s more than the 3 percent improvement in hiv free adult life expectancy because the 3 percent we were mentioning is the average across all these states so there s obviously variation so this you know the average equates to roughly two years of life expectancy after ten years so i think in the poland and brazil cases we could almost double that in these high profile cases yeah ayres that s really something joe comments dieleman well so simon just mentioned there s essentially two different ways to look at this the first analysis looked at distinct changes whereas the second uses statistics that look more at gradual changes or just changes across time and i think in that one what you don t really see are countries that stand out even though there are just the methods don t necessarily stand out but you start to be able to see the specific diseases and so while that first analysis focused more on life expectancy the second analysis and third really started to look at the causes and i think that list for me is particularly interesting understanding cardiovascular disease traffic injuries and whatnot as the real places where democracy can have a big impact ayres and so part of what you re also arguing is that getting a better understanding of where democracy and the feedback loop makes a difference helps in thinking about where there is a possibility for building strong health systems right i mean that s part of what we re talking about here because you can make interventions on infectious diseases that don t necessarily require more extensive health systems correct dieleman yeah yeah so i mentioned earlier the epidemiological transition folks that study health finance speak about a health financing transition and i think that transition is important to think about how you build and create and maintain and ultimately finance a health system and so the health financing transition says that low income countries if you look at countries with a low gross domestic product they tend to generally rely on out of pocket spending and development assistance so that s out of pocket spending at the point of care which generally doesn t lend itself to building a robust health system and as countries develop economically and if you look across as you move from low lower middle income countries to now upper middle and high income countries you see that most of the financing isn t out of pocket and development assistance but then it s prepaid normally through a government sometimes through private insurance but the point is that when it s pre paid it lends itself to be able to really build a health system that s sustainable that s reliable across time and doesn t deter people from accessing it out of pocket spending generally lends itself to the patient having to make a decision do i have this money now and if i don t i can t get the care i needed whereas pre paid financing lends itself again to a system that can accommodate people in the moment regardless of that decision not needing to ask do i have the resources for care now so i think the financing and where the money comes from is ultimately important in essentially how strong that health system can be ayres simon anything to add wigley no i think that s good i mean i should point out that we do have this kind of multiple methods approach which may be coming out from the discussion so far which is deliberate because we were worried about the weaknesses of each or the flaws that might be pointed out in some of the methods we re using so we deliberately used a mixture in so to leverage the advantage of each method to strengthen our ultimate claim which is why we have these threshold democracy measures as well as the measure that we use most of all which is this democratic experience measure ayres so we re going to open it up now to questions from members i am obligated to provide a reminder that this meeting is on the record please wait for the microphone we ve got some mics throughout the room here and speak directly into it and please stand state your name and affiliation and please also limit yourself to one question and keep it concise so we can have as many members as possible get the opportunity to ask a question yes ma am q elizabeth anderson with world justice project and i m interested in what you see in the data in terms of the relationship between democratic backsliding we talked about the transition to democracy but now we see it across the globe democratic plateauing and backsliding and how does that then shape health outcomes wigley so we didn t look specifically at the democratic erosion because that s a relatively recent phenomenon i know that in some countries that s not quite true so the countries i mentioned earlier that may be eroding or backsliding as recently as 2014 even later so we didn t have the option to sort of look at this really interesting case we looked at the reverse in a sense the transition to and sustained transition to rather than the degradation of democracy but this is something which obviously is very important and we can only infer this by free and fair elections is an important component as we find a country that degrades in terms of free and fair elections is not going to perform as well in terms of adult health and noncommunicable diseases yeah ayres sir you had a question right here q thank you karl hofmann with psi population services international i want to congratulate the authors i look forward to reading this because it s a fantastic i can tell i fantastic piece of work i wonder if the research included looking at something that is not a disease but which is nonetheless an important driver of morbidity and mortality and that s fertility the relationship between democracy and fertility ayres yes no laughter dieleman so i think the easy answer and this is what i would have added to the first question is we didn t focus on that there may be research on that that simon or the other panelists can highlight i m not an expert on that sorry ayres that s a no for simon wigley fertility i find tricky it seems to give competing results and i find mortality as an ultimate indicator is more clear cut but obviously that s not a very interesting reply laughter i apologize for that ayres we ll get a question back here q chris collins with friends of the global fight against aids tb and malaria thank you for this very interesting research and i m wondering if there s anything you could observe about possible effects from the other direction in other words over time do societies as they get healthier does that have impacts on governments wigley so obviously we didn t look at this directly but one could argue that that the development of human capital of all kinds including health and education may have a positive impact on not just the economy but also institutions so obviously there s a lot of theory that we would have to work through to position this so there s kind of you know the modernizing institutions for health the focus before might have been more on straightforward education but health and then now health in terms of the child for example but perhaps one implication of our study is the significance of adult health and noncommunicable disease on this issue the long run impact on democratic institutions is a very interesting question i think dieleman yeah all i would add to that is more emphasis on the concept of human capital in particular on the health side of the contributions to human capital the focus on childhood diseases things that interrupt the period of education and then also adult diseases that prevent laborers and workforce participants so again connecting back to health and economic development is something that certainly researchers continue to point towards and the science there continues to evolve so ayres i saw a question over here q hi i m alicia phillips mandaville i m from irex and this is just brilliant i used to run the scorecard country criteria system from mcc millennium challenge corporation and it used both democracy and health data so i appreciate the gulf between those datasets is not just wide but sometimes full of sharks laughs so i really enjoy this i m curious about whether you see in the results anything similar about the lag time between the moment of transition and the occurrence of the improvement in health outcomes because that would be an interesting way to look at kind of hypothesizing around what causes the transition to or the outcomes to change wigley well the analysis we looked at the so called synthetic control method which means as i implied before that you were comparing a country with itself if it hadn t transitioned if it had stayed autocratic what we find perhaps a little surprising for me at least is that the effect is almost immediate so it jumps to like 2 percent after five years but it s not a delayed response this is immediately shifting towards that 2 percent and you know this is not a clean break this is the intervention is not like a medical intervention this is usually transitions over a slow over time phenomena so this was a little surprising for me at least that actually the effect was based on our measurement of democratic transition was immediate ayres yes q thank you shanthi kalathil from the national endowment for democracy i m really interested in the element of elections versus other components of democracy and i was wondering if you could speak to i think the moderator mentioned that media freedom and freedom of expression was not statistically significant but elections seemed to be the decisive feature of democracy that matter and i was wondering given that you pointed to china s elements of media control and you specifically highlighted the expression elements why is it that elections in particular are so significant wigley so it s the share of the population that are potentially included is one part of this compared with an autocracy where the support base can be very narrow it could be the military it could be a business elite it could be an ethnic group so in theory there will be a larger slice of the population that are sending these vote signals that there is health problems i realized there s criticisms of this but the claim seems to have for me a lot of intuitive force but also we re assuming that media freedom is part of the package it s not just regular elections but there s also criticism through the media or civil society is included in the measurement so there s diverse sources of feedback coming from civil society and media and voters directly it is the case that free and fair elections seems to have an outsized impact but i think that s to do with the signaling it can be connected back to the signaling from the voters so if half the voters or the opposition is effectively not able to win the elections their signals are effectively eliminated in this case i should say that free expression was the second most significant but by a large shot it was more to do with free and fair elections yeah dieleman and real quick to just simply add to that is it s important to remember and maybe this didn t come out in the presentations that the best the largest impact was still the composite measure it was all the pieces put together that lead to the largest health change whereas then we took steps to really try to dive into it and said well what could be the second largest impact when you start pulling out different pieces and that s when we came to the conclusions that we re discussing now but still the most important largest impact was the package of all the components ayres sir question in the back q thank you carlos williams senator markey s office we look at now we have still a lot of low middle income countries almost 123 countries that are democratic in government and a lot of them are still low middle income is there any association with once you transition to democracy that opens the doorway in access to foreign assistance at a greater level therefore increasing health outcomes dieleman yeah so there has not been a lot of direct connection between democracy and the receipt of development assistance we ve seen in the past that there are characteristics that drive the receipt of development assistance but democracy or other governance indicators generally haven t shown a statistically significant effect and i think that s one of the takeaways from the paper at least the things we tried to question is moving forward in a world where development assistance for health i mentioned grew dramatically at the beginning of the millennium is now relatively flat the year over year growth is pretty small if even positive and asking the question where should that limited set of dollars be provided and what can it be a catalyst for ayres yes q i m lucy mize with the asia bureau at usaid i m curious if you disaggregated some of the national level indicators because if you look at a country like indonesia their health equity issues vary widely between papua and java and it s arguably a democracy so how did you address that in some of the bigger countries where there are such gross inequities dieleman great question so two thoughts one is in this study we simply didn t we used national level dataset and that s what we focused on but what you re drawing out my second point is that as far as the health statistics go and maybe simon can speak to democracy and local democracy versus national but as far as the national statistics go there s a huge push to measure these things at an increasingly granular level and so you used indonesia and india as examples both of those are countries that are increasingly we can measure health outcomes by state china as well brazil the united states u k these are countries that are large enough or have good enough data that we can take the set of outputs that we measure and measure at a quite granular level another project that we have isn t for all causes of illness but is for many and actually measures health outcomes at the five kilometer by five kilometer grid throughout sub saharan africa and that really tends to focus more on infectious diseases with the idea that you really need to know precisely where an infectious is taking place where is the vulnerable population and how is it spreading and so for all of sub saharan africa we can measure mortality due to infectious diseases and under five mortality as well at a really granular level to highlight some of the geographic inequality that we see ayres i saw two more hands i saw one here q thank you very much susan page sp i just wanted to go back to something that was said earlier i guess by thomas if the development assistance and other health care that has been provided by foreign aid has not really helped the health care systems in the countries to improve for noncommunicable diseases what accounts for that and does that mean that although the money that has been spent has helped to eradicate or diminish the number of communicable diseases why has the health care system itself not been strengthened thanks ayres i have a great book about that by the way laughter dieleman yeah and simply that i mean i think that s a very complex answer certainly something tom can speak more to and i think it is in my mind again maybe it s from an economist perspective but a lot of that comes down to efficiency as far as some of the treatments that are provided for infectious diseases to do so in a very vertical environment where you are simply giving vaccines and coordinating with a relatively small group of people that are also capable of delivering vaccines there s efficiency gains and i think you see that in some of the other communicable diseases that have received so much support from major donors the question is and this is a major conversation is how can the systems because there still needs to be a system to develop a vaccine it s just not necessarily integrated in the broader health system how can those systems that have largely been funded by donors be used to help build the local health system that can now respond to a broader set of health conditions and i think that is a major task and a major question that is asked both by recipient nations themselves but also something i think donors are increasingly grappling with ayres i saw one more question over yeah one over here and then we ll switch to the next panel q andrew o donohue from the carnegie endowment thanks for this panel one key point professor wigley mentioned is that the authoritarian regimes of today differ markedly from those of the cold war period and i was curious is there a variation over time within your data such that today s authoritarian regimes in which leaders such chavez and erdogan often dramatically expand social spending and health care spending are performing better in terms of health care outcomes than the often neoliberal military dictatorship at the start of your data in the 1980s wigley so the two pieces of analysis we have one about the transitions would include these earlier types of autocracy but the detail you know most of our analysis is from 1990 to 2016 so we re dealing with this new phenomenon primarily the closed autocracies you know one party regimes or theocracies or monarchies are still there but they re becoming a minority in the autocracy spectrum but because these fine grained distinctions we don t look at regime types apart from clearly democratic versus clearly autocratic because obviously this is an extremely interesting point but as i implied we do look at one of the key indicators of this new regime type which is the free and fair elections the electoral autocracies or authoritarian electoral authoritarian regimes they sustain themselves through this very factor right apart from controlling the media which is obviously important you know slanting the elections to ensure reelection is a key factor and so although we didn t split this into the sort of nuanced regime types that you re referring to it does seem that the one indicator that i ll come back to is an important factor in terms of adult health at least and noncommunicable diseases ayres with that please join me in thanking simon and joe applause we re going to transition now to panel two so we ll just go off the stage this way i think bollyky great well thank you for sitting through the transition and i ll thank my colleagues for that terrific job on the first panel we re going to shift gears a little bit and talk a little less about the specific study although if it comes up i m happy to have some responses in the q a or afterwards but we re going to talk primarily now is we ve put forward in the study a potential motivation to see more support for international democracy and government promotion so now we re going to talk to two of the leading experts about what that support looks like now both for the u s government and internationally what some of the differences are and maybe hopefully get to some ideas about how the reach and effectiveness of those programs can be increased as i mentioned at the outset we really have two ideal speakers for this topic to my immediate right is kate somvongsiri who is the deputy assistant administrator for the bureau of democracy conflict and humanitarian assistance at usaid to my further right just physically not necessarily politically is thomas carothers who is the senior vice president for studies at the carnegie endowment for peace and again you have their biographies in your materials and i m going to start with kate somvongsiri oh apologies i was i thought you were starting with tom but happy to happy to take the first crack at this so i ll spend a few minutes just at the top talking about what the state of play is for usg broadly but then focus most of my comments in terms of usaid s approach lay my biases right on the table at the outset i m approaching this obviously with usaid with a development practitioner s perspective i am a practitioner i ve spent most of my time in the field so we ll rely on the academics in this room to keep me honest on some of the data points and then the other the other bias is obviously this is democracy promotion is done in many places not necessarily from a development perspective but the perspective i m sharing obviously institutionally is that one and then wrap up with being a little self critical in terms of what some of the challenges are and what we can do to be better so starting out on the usg landscape broadly we usaid is the leading bilateral democracy assistance donor about 70 percent of usg assistance in this area is implemented by usaid the rest by the state department where we are today really over the past five years in this field there s been a steady increase or at least flat line not a decrease in terms of just the general amount of assistance from fy 15 it was at 1 9 billion dollars is our global democracy budget and this past this fiscal year 19 it went up to 2 4 billion dollars so i think that shows you kind of just the level of commitment i know talking in a room of a lot of health practitioners those numbers may not seem impressive but for the democracy community which you know twenty something years ago we were just basically struggling for our survival of even actually being taken seriously as something to do in the development field this is really i think quite heartening for us and that is really as a result of very strong bipartisan support on the hill with this global democracy directive in terms of how we work with usaid i think it s also important to point out structurally it differs from some other places because we re grounded with this development focus we have about four hundred democracy experts in the field in our field missions including local host country nationals and then we have about one hundred in washington and so the overall democracy strategy is really very knitted into what the overall development trajectory is in that country and i ll just a couple words on that approach anyone who you know i have aid colleagues in the room anyone who s heard anyone from aid speak in the past several months will not be new to the phrase journey to self reliance laughter so but for those who may be newer to it this what we think maybe i ve been in the bureaucracy too long but it does seem like a very it is a very bold thing for us to actually state that the goal of foreign assistance is to end the need for its existence so that and that s the idea behind the journey to self reliance is really defining the path a country need to take to strengthen its commitment as well as capacity to achieve its and manage its own development goals i think for us why this is important in the democracy conversation is as part of that journey we use a lot of metrics not quite mcc level but we do have a number of metrics that measure capacity commitment to be able to start that conversation with the countries and woven into those are a series of democracy related ones including those by v dem and many others measuring open and accountable governance inclusion civil society capacity so we ve really taken this as a commitment and the democracy promotion ethos is really woven tightly into the dna i think of the agency at this point so that s one thing in terms of our approach i think many of what we ve been talking about today is something that over twenty years our experience has shown that we re not doing it just because of the inherent value of democracy others may do it for that purpose right there s intrinsic moral value but for us as a development agency we have seen great potential to unlock sustainable improvements in people s lives higher level of economic innovation and to moderate social conflict and violence and because of that it s very much the bread and butter of what we do the second approach i ll mention in terms of where we are in this field in democracy promotion in aid is we ve undertaken over the past oh five to seven years a very very deliberate approach towards integrating democratic principles into other sectors including health health education economic growth principles that i think most in this room are familiar with participation inclusion transparency and what we found and again it won t be a surprise to many people but most of our colleagues who were working in some of these other social sectors have traditionally had a very technical approach not a criticism i think it s just the nature of the work technical approach to dealing with the social outcomes they re trying to get and what we ve really done as an agency is really brought a more political economy analysis lens to it and tried to integrate some democracy principles into the world so i think that s an important factor in the approach that we re taking i ll give a couple of concrete examples on this i think that will lend itself to this discussion and i will also say to confess that you know when we first started doing this we didn t really get a lot there were some really kind of thoughtful forward looking colleagues who really saw a lot of inherent value in this but really some of our other colleagues from some sectors would say you re only doing this because your democracy budget is small and our health budget is huge and so you re trying to leverage and integrate and in part that was true and i did find that laughter you know frankly smaller budgets cause us to innovate right i think we often say you know dollars is a sign of our commitment but when you have smaller budgets you are forced to integrate but i think over time many of our colleagues in other sectors have really seen the benefit of that one really small example of a program in senegal in rural areas there was in a rural area where we were working with our governance and peace program 44 percent of the children in the area did not have birth certificates it may not seem significant but that s what enabled people to access health care education other vital services so by having a program that specifically worked in four specific communes in rural areas to simplify and streamline a birth registration process and we had pretty dramatic effects 20 percent increase overall hundred percent increase in the health centers itself and that unlocked the potential to access health care i think one of the struggles for us and that is measuring it right i think we ve had difficulty in convincing some of the colleagues initially because they were being held to certain standards of you know you need to demonstrate very clearly numbers of you know reductions in certain diseases vaccinations et cetera and by doing the broader health systems strengthening that line was a little bit more attenuated so how can you really make that convincing argument this study i think should help go a long ways in that so those are two things in our approach and a big part of our approach is also continuing to try to learn from the evidence that s out there many of our speakers previously talked about the varieties of democracy approach and how much more rigorous it than previous ones we have a partnership with v dem now i ll highlight examples from two studies that have come out of there that i think will be interesting for the group one is a study late last year indicated that greater political empowerment of women is also significantly associated with lower infant mortality rates higher life expectancy and higher average years of education and then another study that just came out in august that countries with higher respect for civil liberties experience higher economic growth rates in particular civil liberties like protection of private property if you ask me any specific questions about those studies i will not be able to tell you answers laughs but they are available and i think it s really part of this broader trend of the research on this issue and what it s contributing to and then the last thing i ll end with in terms of where things are going and the challenges we re seeing now and what we can do better i think some of the previous panel started to talk about this one thing we re really grappling with especially within this administration and the work at this time is the rise of resurgent authoritarianism we ve been talking quite a bit about backsliding as a whole as a trend over the past decade but resurgent authoritarianism and some of what we ve talked about in the previous panels in terms of using authoritarians using the language and the cloak and the veneer of a democracy to legitimize their rules nobody you know maduro kabila nobody says no elections we re just going to you know stay in power there s an adoption a cooptation of the language of democracy and then the veneer of that and then how do we how do we counter that i think we haven t i think we need to make a lot more progress on that i think there s a lot of thinking on that issue that also coincides with just as we see the contestation of democratic institutions and processes and norms in the countries where we work we re seeing competing models of development as well i think again not a surprise to folks in this room but competing model development that prioritizes that s more transactional quick economic gains for a few in exchange for unsustainable debts i don t think we have to name any countries i think everyone is well aware but this convergence of resurgent authoritarianism while at the same time the shifting standard of development finance i think has brought greater urgency for us so let me stop there and then with the exception of just saying one key takeaway from this for us is let s divert some global health resources to the democracy sector laughter and we re going to be talking about how we can tackle this more in the future bollyky great tom carothers thank you i ve been asked to talk about the non u s side of the international community that works to support democracy there s such an ingrained habit in the united states of talking about the u s role in supporting democracy internationally as a kind of uniquely american endeavor but i d say it s an under developed intellectual and practical muscle in the u s foreign policy community to understand and then take action upon the fact that there s a much wider community of actors engaged in this if i said to you that there s an international community of actors working on global health you d say of course and you d probably already have a sense of what the dimensions of that are if i say to you there s an international community of actors working on democracy i suspect your mind might be blanker and you d have a harder time profiling what that community is first it consists of organizations at three different levels i ll be very schematic here the first is there are probably between twelve to fifteen other governments that are serious about this they range from canada and sweden and the netherlands and germany to the u k france japan in some ways and others within the oecd countries but then there s also some non western democracies that are also trying to give international support for democracy india brazil south africa indonesia are all engaged in different ways in that so one level is peer governments another level are intergovernmental organizations the european union the biggest and most important among them in terms of democracy support whose democracy support rivals that of the united states in dollar terms or euro terms but also another of other significant international organizations ranging from undp to the international institute for democracy and electoral assistance in sweden to a number of regional organizations and so forth and then the third level are international nongovernmental organizations there s many of these in the united states like betsy s group on world justice project but there s many international human rights groups and transparency groups anticorruption groups women s rights groups and so forth so this is a big complex community that exists out there the united states is monetary terms nobody can take the measure of it because it s impossible to calculate it s just the data isn t really available but the united states is probably somewhere between 15 and 20 percent of the funding of that community it has a couple of characteristics as a community one is that within the community people think they re doing very different things from each other and particularly from the united states if you go to germany and meet with the director of democracy policy or sweden or almost anywhere within that community the first thing they ll tell you is well we re not like the united states and they have a caricatured idea of the u s role in democracy which has two features to it one is that when we want to promote democracy we start by invading the country laughter that s sort of step one and then we see what we can do to help bring democracy and that step two is we then take the u s constitution and translate it into the local language and export our system and send congressmen over to lecture about how well the u s congress works laughter that isn t actually the case that isn t characteristic of u s democracy support but unfortunately that causes people in the international community to not want to sort of think that they re aligned with it but there s also beneath that the simple fact of kind of national accents in democracy support so germans put a very strong emphasis on rule of law support sweden puts a very strong emphasis on gender relations the u k is doing a lot on anticorruption every country has its view of what s most important but if you go beyond those differences and imagined differences the community is actually doing very similar things in those places and it s a myth that there s really significant differences you see that at the country level if you go to the democratic republic of congo and look over the last five years and say what s the community of action doing to support democracy in congo very similar things and at the country level they re often joining up in working fairly closely together it s at the next level up above the country where they don t imagine their working together and don t imagine they re doing the same kinds of things the other characteristic of the community is it lacks leadership there s no natural leader of this community nobody s in charge there s no preponderance in a sense of governing responsibility and sort of informally within the community and the united state has at various times over the last thirty years sometimes played a leadership role of a certain type but it hasn t been very much for a while now i would say in different ways and i don t mean just the last two years but before that as well so this is a community with a very foggy sense of itself as a community both in terms of what it does and how it acts as a community now next thing i would say is how is the community doing well it s in a funk it s in a fuck because at two different levels first because the major thrusts of work within this community have all over the last five to ten years hit some big walls let me describe the four big thrusts of this community are first work on free and fair elections and a lot of progress has been made in the sophistication of efforts to support free and fair elections but you run up against two walls one is that you do excellent work to support a free and fair election but then the results of that work are sort of steamrollered by local forces and it proves to not have been very significant the democratic republic of congo s a good example the last election there was actually a pretty bad election that turned out pretty badly but they decided to just go with it and all of the international efforts were just kind of steamrollered by local political reality and that happens with some frequency these days and the other wall is that governments in many places are extending terms against their own constitutions and overriding the electoral process so a country like bolivia which has made some encouraging developments in democratizing over the last twenty years is now stuck with a government that seems determined a president to extent into his fourth term despite an obvious constitutional prohibition on doing that and he s not the only one so elections have run against some walls the second is political parties a second big thrust of this area political parties thirty years into the big wave of democracy over the last thirty to forty years proved to be institutions that seem determine not to be able to reform themselves and to find a new grip on populations citizens around the world are very frustrated with their political parties they have been for a long time parties have had a hard time responding sitting here in this country this isn t a mystery to us parties are struggling as organizations to develop or maintain the kind of relations with individuals with citizens that they may used to have had at one point given that life has changed in many ways the third area that s been frustrating is civil society big mushrooming of civil society in the 1990s and early 2000s but then starting in the mid 2000s many governments in both non democratic but as well as some democratic countries began trying to put limits on what civil society does trying to co opt it trying to compromise it in various ways create their own quote civil societies and civil society has been under serious siege for the last ten years and you see this in many different ways and then the fourth sort of thrust or the democracy s main work on democratic governance systems and here an unfortunate number of democratizing countries have been stuck with pretty bad governance marked by state capture and systemic corruption think of south africa a democratizing country with some very encouraging political participation characteristics but deep state capture deep corruption and great citizen frustration as well and that s south africa which is you know a sophisticated country and state capacity terms compared to many other near democracies so you put those together elections are difficult political parties have trouble reforming getting traction civil society s under siege and a lot of governance is stuck in some pretty bad patterns of state capture that s one level of funk is that s our agenda what are we not doing right is the feeling within this community the second level of discouragement is at a is a broader level which is what kate referred to is the fact that the larger contest of democracy as both a political idea and a practical political system is facing greater competition and a greater sense in the world that it s not the only model on offer in the world and maybe there are alternatives that work better and even if they don t work better those who proffer them are more assertive or aggressive and successful at putting their ideas forward across borders and that s got different parts of the democracy community worried and again because it s not a community that functions in an integrated way there s no response from this community there s a lot of concern but it s not everyone looks around and says sort of to each other what are we going to do about this but nobody really knows in a sense how to tackle that whether to do it more at the sort of mezzo level of country by country or more at the sort of geopolitical level as a larger sort of effort by democracies and there s very little leadership or action in that regard i would say now finishing up i would say that as the community looks forward one of the biggest and most encouraging developments which again kate referred to and usaid has actually been an excellent actor in this area has been trying to connect the democracy transition process or the democracy agenda to developmental objectives given that citizens are very frustrated with what their democratic governments are producing for them in many countries the idea is let s connect more directly democratic change to developmental performance and delivery the reason why this has been difficult and only a few places within the community have really made progress usaid is one of them in this area is that the developmental side it isn t just i mean kate said politely that you know it s because they take a technical approach there are two deeper reasons why they re taking that technical approach one is that there s still a profound intellectual debate and disagreement over whether or not democratic governance produces better developmental outcomes and studies like yours and this is where i connect this tom are of fundamental importance in that debate because the democracy community has not won that debate and you know not long ago i was a year or two ago i was at the german development bank in germany and i gave a talk and you know the crowd was outraged how did i know that democracy would be good for development you know just prove it you know we have no commitment we are a development bank we have no reason to be interested in politics you know prove to us that your model can produce better growth rates and because they focus a lot on growth not just the german development bank but much of the development community it s a harder debate if you tried to write your paper or book on just growth in democracy although there is a debate over that but it s important when you get to the broader debate not just growth but development in a more general sense you can win parts of that argument in important ways and then the second reason why the development community is held back is a fear of quote being political and therefore not being able to work in sensitive political environments we wanted to work in the last 10 years in ethiopia and we were afraid if we raise our voice about human rights we would be kicked out of doing this great work on child mortality in ethiopia and so a desire to stay out of politics and that s where the technocratic impulse sort of comes in as well and so both these areas of debate are really the cutting edge of where we are in terms of integrating this agenda and that s why work like you do is so important and why leadership that usaid and a few others dfid and a couple of other organizations and the australians have also made some progress in this regard and some other of trying to integrate is really vitally important and so it isn t just about budgets although budgets are always important at some level and what s great about aid is they ve had significant capacity and technical thinking about democracy as well as other domains and the ability to talk within the agency about bringing these things together and they re starting to do so but it s amazing that thirty years forty years into this field that we re only starting to get serious about this conversation of connecting these two areas but better later than never bollyky great so those were two terrific presentations thank you for that a couple of things resonated with me with the remarks particularly that you just made i will tell you that getting this paper published required confronting two challenges one faces in the global health community or three really and these challenges are the same as the ones you ve identified the first challenge is that most people that we encountered through this research process on the global health side really do view democracy promotion as being focused on invading other nations and imposing democracy afterwards so there are some serious misconceptions around that second there is a also a general perception that perhaps democracy as a model is not offering very much to other nations right now given some of the political upheavals happening in many democracies and the last challenge is there s a complete lack of confidence that democracies would produce better on health so with that said i want to push back a little bit on the issue of elections and that s really for two reasons one obviously it s one of the results in our paper that stood out the most second i want to be clear about what we found because this issue came up in the first panel we didn t measure just free and fair elections on its own we took one piece out at a time from the larger democracy measure so the effects of the various components of democracy are synergistic you really do need all the elements of democracy we just measured what would happen if you took one component of that broader measure of democracy at a time and when you take out free and fair elections you see that overall health effects of democracy disappears so to be clear it s not that free and fair elections alone would deliver these health benefits it s that taking out free and fair elections eliminate those benefits which gets us to my question several people have commented on the global trend toward authoritarianism is driven by election fixing so let s stipulate just for the sake of argument not to associate you two with our paper findings that to produce these health gains it really is free and fair elections have to be present kate you spoke very powerfully on what can be done to try to increase participation and other good governance elements of health programs and tom you spoke a lot about who the community that support democracy promotion and it s the same donors u s government the u k japan and sweden that are also all big global health donors too if you accept this paper s results that the sustainability of our global health gains on which global donors have spent 40 billion per year to achieve those gains depend on more free and fair elections how do we achieve that somvongsiri yeah so i ll start with three comments related to that one which i think will be more difficult to do than perhaps the others is and tom alluded to this i think to the extent that we can clarify the misconceptions around our electoral assistance you will not be able to depoliticize election assistance that s just inherently incompatible but there is a misconception that and again i m going to talk from a usg perspective that usg electoral assistance is about trying to achieve a certain outcome we want it this is the horse we re backing our assistance is going to get so and so in power and what we strive to do over and over and sometimes less successfully than others is to clarify what we re trying to do is an electoral process that is transparent that s inclusive et cetera and that it is not about choosing winners and losers so we need to do a better job and i don t know how successful that s going to be but we do need to keep emphasizing that the second part of it i think we need to also expand i think most people who work in this community know it well and i think this is probably tied to your dataset elections we re not talking about an electoral event we re talking about the enabling environment in the lead up to elections which is years and years in advance and this may be i m completely speculating so this is dangerous territory but in terms of your data that may be why the election piece is so critical and significant because you need all these other pieces like the media environment freedom of expression et cetera to actually achieve that free and fair election so it may really be kind of so looking at that more broadly and then the third thing i would mention in this realm is i don t know what the v dem data actually looks like on this but i think it s very important to have a conversation about not only national level elections but subnational elections which is a big part of our work that doesn t get as much attention but my bet if i were to bet on the study would be to look at if you re going to look at linking the causality with the elections most national elections are not decided on whether how much the government is spending on health right but i would i would imagine that it s really more of the local elections which is much closer to the ground which is much closer to what the different citizens and response are that some of those linkages may be clearer that s what we found in local governance work broadly and which is why we invest so much in this so those would be three ideas carothers yeah as the international community focused on elections increasingly over the last thirty years it s kind of excuse the crudeness of the analogy but it s sort of a tube of toothpaste and the international community grabbed one end of it and all the toothpaste went to the other end what do i mean by that as we ve focused on helping countries hold better balloting and be more capable and about the tail end of the process the bad things move to the other end they are exclusion of candidates intimidation of candidates use of state resources and then dominance of the media space and disinformation manipulation going after a government that s doing those things is much harder than meeting with its electoral commission and saying you re going to need this many ballot boxes on election day because we ve helped you figure out the number of people who vote per hour and so forth both it s more political to get at those things and the standards are less clear what are the standards about you know how much money does each side have to spend you know you get into debates about the political financing and what s the right system what s the standard of media access well the u s has debates other countries don t have debates how do you you know and so you ve lost the certainty of standards that you have at the other end of the tube of toothpaste and so most of the bad things in elections are happening up there and then the second thing that s happened is governments then if they can t control it and end up losing then they go ahead and just trump the process like happened in congo and just sort of steamroller it and that takes the international community to say we really aren t kidding we re not going to deal with this new government in at least some significant ways or reduce our commitments to it as a result of that action and that s been you know there isn t because there isn t a very joined up international community governments know they can do that kind of thing and drc knows it s going to probably keep getting the international assistance it had before because deep down they feel like you know the client that owes so much money to the bank that the bank s going to keep lending them more money and so the international community needs to be more political in elections work in this way and more pointed and then more serious in a joined up way at the other end of the process that s what would really need to happen to make it better bollyky great i m going to ask one more two part question then i m going to turn it over to the audience so start thinking of your burning questions now and i will call you in the order that i see your hands so two things come to mind one is the kenya circumstance where you had an election that was originally certified and then found afterwards that perhaps it had been manipulated but in a more sophisticated way than elections had been manipulated there in the past and i m curious about our data and the tools we have to address that situation have we gotten better as an international community at identifying the more sophisticated ways of election rigging the second question is based on and this is a good opportunity for me to plug a book that tom wrote in 2013 or 14 in fact it s one of my favorite books on international development one of the suggestions that tom s book makes which we cite and reinforce in the paper is the notion that selective funding the mcc model may be the way forward on democracy promotion you often can t withdraw global health funding for instance you can t pull pepfar funding when people are on treatment and we re saving children s lives so it s only when donors are shifting funding to these new health causes that we could identify and favor those nations that are more promising based on their democratic status are we seeing that trend at all in global health is there a good example of where that s starting to occur somvongsiri i ll take the first part of your question in terms of the kenya example absolutely and i think this is what we re referring to in terms of the most sophisticated way like nobody s going around stuffing ballots well some people are but that s not really the very crude way right it s happening with the kenya example carothers north carolina laughter somvongsiri you could say that internationally in our development experience laughter we ve seen more sophisticated ways of stealing an election in the kenya example right the role of the court and is that going to set a precedent elsewhere so i do think the answer the short answer is in terms of our response it s half and half yes we ve gotten better at identifying these things we see observers who are faux observers and you know what are they actually documenting so we ve seen more and more about that so recognition is the first part of it in terms of our tools to actually address that i think we re still a long ways off in terms of actually addressing those effectively and that s what we really need help on in this community bollyky great tom carothers regarding your second question i d be curious alicia s here she asked a question before she had the long experience at the mcc of i think when the mcc was created we hoped that that approach kind of positive conditionality if you will giving more for doing better would spread in the international aid community because it can become exponentially more effective if it s not just the united states with a relatively modest mcc budget doing it but a joined up approach in which many do and that s part of the problem of the development community not working effectively often as the community by not being able to do that i just both on the experience of positive conditionality on whether and why it has become an approach that others have joined and she would be better to answer than me so maybe she can be handed the microphone at some point bollyky great well i will let her volunteer for that role but i am going to turn it over to the audience for questions so either on mcc in particular or to broader questions on democracy and health if you ll raise your hands i will call on you please q hi elizabeth anderson world justice project i was intrigued that you both kind of doubled down on integration and i say that as somebody who drank that kool aid and believed i believed that it s important and yet have hit my head against that wall and considered it really challenging and seen how difficult it s been and hearing about this paper i thought oh my gosh beyond integration we can be liberated now we have evidence that it s just elections we don t actually have to integrate anymore to see results here so i d been interested in your reaction to that thought somvongsiri absolutely not you re not liberated laughter no i think well i think one thing i want to be make sure i caveat the statement around is this is obviously very specific to certain specific health outcomes and the integration agenda is obviously more broadly across a range of social sectors so i would want to be careful about how i compare that the other thing i think in terms of integration is because the breadth of the work that we do in development is so large and i think we i think you re right in terms of we do have a long ways to go in terms of demonstrating the tangible impact of an integration agenda but i think there s a lot of this is the instrumental versus kind of intrinsic value of democracy argument that many of you are familiar with right i think there are many of us who would say there s inherent value in more participatory approaches towards whether it s education or health et cetera anyway so regardless obviously we d want it to lead to strong development outcomes as well but regardless of that i think we d say there s some value in that approach regardless carothers this gives me a chance to mention the title of my book that you mentioned in case you re interested it s called development aid confronts politics and the subtitle is the almost revolution about whether or not this attempt at integration will ever really revolutionize assistance and get over this gap between the political and the socioeconomic that s bedeviled the assistance community and i wrote the book at a time i was moderately pessimistic and i think i m still moderately pessimistic because the forces of that want to just keep doing development assistance in certain ways that are sort of nonpolitical in bad ways are powerful but on the other hand i d say that it s big changes in development work don t happen in five to seven years they take a long time to really change and so we shouldn t give up because it s the right it s one of the right fights to be fighting it s important to do this and i think it s just more that this study if he d found this across ten different core socioeconomic sectors maybe we could just have the big party and say it s over you know we ve won but we haven t you know it s one good study and such but there s the forces that both think that you know democratic governments are just freewheeling governments that spend money badly and you can t trust them you need the firm hand and then the larger sort of authoritarian development model is so strong these days that we re a long way from winning the battle at that level so we both have to fight it at that level but then also show that a good health program that thinks of why in this region is health spending lower than here oh because of the ethnic composition of this region is that and the president s family is disfavoring this ethnicity because of the political compact they have and so therefore a smart health program has to also deal with the political settlement in the country that s the level we ve got to get serious about and start really integrating political thinking into health education agricultural land housing et cetera bollyky great please q again thank you very much i wanted bollyky can you just remind them of your name here q susan page sp sorry so i want to go back a little bit to the way that you tom described sort of the community and in talking about the global community whether it s linked to democracy and health why hasn t there been a broader response to these undemocratic elections so whether from the u s government other countries or the united nations which has also just recently revamped its development assistance its development model along with the peace and security et cetera et cetera but nobody really came out against the elections in drc and in fact the secretary general basically said these were you know congratulations to the people in the population of drc for their good elections i mean this is from supposedly the you know the head of the global community how can we get back on track and i understand you know as a lawyer i understand the desire to sometimes be technical as to avoid getting involved in the politics which is impossible as you ve said in elections and other political issues but how can we gain back some sort of moral authority more collectively carothers what time is it laughter that s a big one look there are different reasons why what happened happened in drc in terms of international response the best argument is a functional one of there s just really no choice it would just unsettle things so much politically if the international community really just said no we don t want to deal with this government because we don t believe that it emerged victorious out of that election and there s the fear that would destabilize a country that s been through so much instability in damaging ways but there s another level up which is still the sovereignty argument of kind of we can tell them what we think went wrong but it s kind of up to them as a country which is true at one level but the sovereignty given that we are in an age when sovereignty is kind of having a comeback a bit we ve sort of lost that fight a bit even on human rights of saying they re universal rights that every country really has to respect if it wants to be a good standing member of the international community and so forth so i think it s both in some cases sometimes just a calculation country by country that ends up creating enough bad examples that others can point to but then we also have been slipping backwards in terms of winning the larger argument that you know actually there are standards that are really are meaningful both in instrumental and in intrinsic terms and unfortunately that has not done well in the last ten or fifteen years bollyky great so we have two minutes and one last question q lucy mize with the asia bureau usaid i would just like to make a point that if the global health community is going to benefit from gains in democracy the global health community needs to stop thinking about health as a disease process and our funding streams still come by mch hiv malaria aid but the fact of the matter is political development is political and global health gains come from outside the health system along with all the improvements in the health system that is a fundamental flaw in our thinking and i would just caveat that this is my personal opinion laughter bollyky all right great so we re out of time the one last thing i want to say about this i m hopeful this is a conversation between the global health and democracy sectors that can continue we talked a bit before about what the burden is of infectious disease and that it s ten million deaths a year cardiovascular diseases alone killed fourteen million people globally so these noncommunicable diseases are a big issue moving forward and i m hopeful that this paper but more importantly these events can start to lead to more dialogue between these communities on how we start to view global health also as a problem of governance and health systems as opposed to just diseases and discrete interventions such as vaccines thank you very much applause end this is a corrected transcript
chinese premier li keqiang speaks at a news conference following the closing session of the national people s congress at the great hall of the people in beijing china on friday reuters photo beijing the chinese government has additional monetary policy measures that it can take to support economic growth this year and will even cut its own flesh to help finance large scale tax cuts premier li keqiang said on friday china has promised billions of dollars in tax cuts and infrastructure spending to help businesses and protect jobs as economic momentum is expected to cool further due to softer domestic demand and the trade war with the united states li s comments suggest beijing is ready to roll out more stimulus measures to ensure the economy grows within a targeted range of 6 to 6 5 per cent gross domestic product grew 6 6 per cent in 2018 the least in 28 years shares on chinese stock exchanges climbed after the government reaffirmed its commitment to boosting growth the yuan recovered from a three week low against the dollar after li s comments of course we are faced with many uncertain factors this year we have to prepare more and we have reserved policy room li told a news conference after the annual parliament meeting ended moreover we can deploy quantity based or price based policy tools such as reserve requirements and interest rates this is not monetary easing but to more effectively support the real economy the support measures rolled out so far are taking time to kick in and most analysts believe activity may not convincingly stabilise until the middle of the year the central bank has cut banks reserve requirement ratios rrr five times over the past year with a two stage rrr cut in january releasing a total of 1 5 trillion yuan 223 23 billion into the financial system further cuts in rrr had been widely expected this year after fresh data pointed to persistently soft demand in the asian economic giant raising fears of a sharper slowdown sources told reuters in february that the central bank is not yet ready to cut benchmark interest rates to spur the slowing economy but is likely to cut market based rates the premier said the government would take multiple measures to lower funding costs for small and micro firms by 1 percentage point this year an across the board cut in borrowing costs could also risk another flare up in debt and speculative activity like that in the wake of the 2008 9 global financial crisis cutting taxes slitting wrists to help finance the tax cuts the government would need to tighten its belt li said china will bolster its national coffers by collecting more of the profits earned by some financial institutions and centrally owned firms while general expenditure will be cut li said that will collectively cover 1 trillion yuan of the government s planned tax cuts he said large scale tax cuts and fee reductions would affect the government cutting its own flesh li said this kind of reform is equivalent to turning one s blade inward and slitting one s wrist promised cuts in value added tax vat for manufacturing and other sectors will take effect from april 1 while social security fees will be reduced from may 1 li said the premier announced on march 5 that the vat for the manufacturing sector would be cut to 13 per cent from 16 per cent vat for the transport and construction sectors will be reduced to 9 per cent from 10 per cent li s comments reconfirm a consistent pro growth stance with clarity on fiscal easing and an earlier than expected effective date for tax cuts morgan stanley said in a note adding that it expects improved growth from the second quarter beijing s tax cut efforts have focused on the manufacturing sector and small businesses that are vital for economic growth and employment li said the government hopes to create 13 million jobs this year the same as last year not allowing the economy to slip out of a reasonable range that is to say we will not allow waves of layoffs said li adding the government will provide support to firms creating the most jobs data on thursday showed that china s survey based jobless rate rose to 5 3 per cent in february from 4 9 per cent in december partly due to job shedding by export oriented companies trade war china is still negotiating with the united states to resolve their trade frictions li said adding both sides have far more shared interests than conflicts and it would be unrealistic to decouple the world s two largest economies we hope that the consultations will be fruitful and will achieve mutual benefit and win win i believe that this is also the expectation of the world li said a summit to seal a trade deal between us president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping will not happen at the end of march as previously discussed treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on thursday washington and beijing have been locked in a tit for tat tariff battle as us presses china for an end to practices and policies it argues have given chinese firms unfair advantages including subsidising of industry limits on access for foreign companies and alleged theft of intellectual property on friday china s parliament approved a new foreign investment law that promises to create a transparent environment for foreign firms though there is scepticism about its enforceability the law designed to ease concerns among foreign companies about the difficulties they face in china will ban forced technology transfer and illegal government interference in foreign business practices li stressed that china did not and would never ask chinese companies to spy on other countries his comments came after increased international scrutiny of chinese telecommunications giant huawei technologies co ltd which has been caught in the cross fire as trade tensions ratcheted up
in a press conference held earlier this month the president of the european central bank mario draghi unveiled a significant change in the european central bank s economic outlook for the eurozone draghi said that the bloc s economic growth is experiencing a slowdown and consequently the ecb has to amend its monetary policy accordingly the change to a more dovish tone which is in line with the american federal reserve s decision to temporarily pause rate hikes is based on weak economic data this data ultimately led to a revision of the ecb s annual gdp growth forecast from the previous 1 7 per cent to a 1 1 per cent for 2019 as a result the ecb has decided to ease its monetary stance in a bid to stimulate the economy once more this conflicts with ecb s direction in 2018 during which it seemed to tighten its monetary policy after years of monetary stimulus this can be quite alarming when one considers the fact that the ecb had been practically handing money to banks for years now through its expansionary monetary policy however it seems that not even this multi trillion dollar gift by the ecb was enough to resuscitate the economy to take this into context let s go back to 2012 the eurozone was hit by the second recession in three years partly as a result of the austerity policies which had been put in place to combat the effects of the credit crisis in march of 2015 as part of the recovery from the 2012 recession the european central bank started a drastic asset purchasing programme for the first time in its history also known as quantitative easing in simple terms through this programme the ecb would be buying sovereign and corporate bonds therefore pushing the prices upwards and creating money in the banking system as a consequence of this increased liquidity interest rates fall and loans become cheaper thus encouraging more borrowing and boosting consumption and investment in december 2018 the ecb issued a widely anticipated announcement that the bond buying programme shall be coming to a close during the four years of the programme the ecb had pumped a massive 2 6 trillion in the eurozone in an effort to revive the bloc s economy in view of all this this month s announcement of new stimulus was somewhat surprising as it comes just months after the conclusion of the massive asset purchase programme the ecb had previously stated that interest rates shall remain at their present record low levels through the summer but it has gone on to rule out a rate hike at least through the end of 2019 this has confirmed that draghi whose term as president ends in october will see out his tenure without ever having raised interest rates since the last rate hike in the eurozone was back in april 2011 two months before draghi was appointed president additionally the ecb has launched a new series of targeted longer term refinancing operations tltro iii effective on september in simpler terms the ecb has offered banks a new round of cheap loans the aim of this funding is to reduce the burden on banks to avoid a credit squeeze this means that around 720 billion worth of debt from the first series of tltro which are approaching maturity will now be eligible to be rolled over draghi attributed the weak economic performance to geo political factors including international trade concerns uncertainty over brexit and weakness in emerging markets some even argue that the ecb s downgraded growth forecast is still too optimistic and that the ecb might actually have to restart the asset purchasing programme in our current climate of geo political uncertainty there is only so much the ecb can do on such matters it is up to the european commission and the countries governments to sort out these issues which have been the source of volatility in financial markets and fear among investors this month s announcement of new stimulus was somewhat surprising even in this regard however choosing the appropriate measure is no straightforward task since after years of stimulus the tools at the ecb s disposal are becoming increasingly limited for example when trying to provide cheaper funding to banks the fact that the interest rates are already so low might render such a policy ineffective considering the path which the ecb had seemed to be following the recent change in rhetoric was a surprise for the markets in the aftermath of the announcement the euro dropped about 0 7 per cent against the us dollar as expected german bund yields drifted lower even though they were already close to zero as investors lowered their expectations of higher yields any time soon for example the german 10 year yields fell by one basis point to the lowest level since october 2016 to 0 06 per cent italian bonds prices also rose on the announcement of the new option for cheap funding banking stocks had an interesting reaction to the news as they initially posted gains before trading lower once it became clear that the terms of the new loan might be less favourable than the original ones with regards to sovereign debt instruments malta was no exception as the recently launched mse malta government stocks total return index was up 0 57 per cent in two days following the press conference the reaction of the local corporate bonds was less clear if there was even a reaction at all the mse malta corporate bonds total return index climbed 0 2 per cent the day after the announcement before fully erasing the gain within three days an alternate view on the revised ecb monetary policy is that it is not a u turn on the previous direction but rather a transitional phase in the same direction some economists are arguing that if the idea of the new ecb policies was to generate extra stimulus these measures are insufficient this is mainly due to the fact that the new lending to banks will be on less generous terms than in the past years for starters new loans will have a term to maturity of two years compared to the previous loan periods of four years furthermore the rate of this debt will be indexed to the ecb s main refinancing rate which is currently set at zero previously the loans could have been as low as the deposit rate which is currently in negative territory another interesting decision is that this programme shall start in september meaning that certain restrictions of the programme will exclude around 400 billion worth of loans from having the possibility of being rolled over by using the tltro iii programme in light of this the move might indicate that the actual motivation behind these policy decisions is in fact to slowly reduce the dependence of the banking system on the ecb investors who take this view might perceive this month s press conference as a smaller than expected step in the same direction rather than a complete step back on the ecb s original path to recovery this article was prepared by andrew borg b com hons banking and finance melit trader at

chinese premier li keqiang speaks at a news conference following the closing session of the national people s congress at the great hall of the people in beijing china on friday reuters photo beijing the chinese government has additional monetary policy measures that it can take to support economic growth this year and will even cut its own flesh to help finance large scale tax cuts premier li keqiang said on friday china has promised billions of dollars in tax cuts and infrastructure spending to help businesses and protect jobs as economic momentum is expected to cool further due to softer domestic demand and the trade war with the united states li s comments suggest beijing is ready to roll out more stimulus measures to ensure the economy grows within a targeted range of 6 to 6 5 per cent gross domestic product grew 6 6 per cent in 2018 the least in 28 years shares on chinese stock exchanges climbed after the government reaffirmed its commitment to boosting growth the yuan recovered from a three week low against the dollar after li s comments of course we are faced with many uncertain factors this year we have to prepare more and we have reserved policy room li told a news conference after the annual parliament meeting ended moreover we can deploy quantity based or price based policy tools such as reserve requirements and interest rates this is not monetary easing but to more effectively support the real economy the support measures rolled out so far are taking time to kick in and most analysts believe activity may not convincingly stabilise until the middle of the year the central bank has cut banks reserve requirement ratios rrr five times over the past year with a two stage rrr cut in january releasing a total of 1 5 trillion yuan 223 23 billion into the financial system further cuts in rrr had been widely expected this year after fresh data pointed to persistently soft demand in the asian economic giant raising fears of a sharper slowdown sources told reuters in february that the central bank is not yet ready to cut benchmark interest rates to spur the slowing economy but is likely to cut market based rates the premier said the government would take multiple measures to lower funding costs for small and micro firms by 1 percentage point this year an across the board cut in borrowing costs could also risk another flare up in debt and speculative activity like that in the wake of the 2008 9 global financial crisis cutting taxes slitting wrists to help finance the tax cuts the government would need to tighten its belt li said china will bolster its national coffers by collecting more of the profits earned by some financial institutions and centrally owned firms while general expenditure will be cut li said that will collectively cover 1 trillion yuan of the government s planned tax cuts he said large scale tax cuts and fee reductions would affect the government cutting its own flesh li said this kind of reform is equivalent to turning one s blade inward and slitting one s wrist promised cuts in value added tax vat for manufacturing and other sectors will take effect from april 1 while social security fees will be reduced from may 1 li said the premier announced on march 5 that the vat for the manufacturing sector would be cut to 13 per cent from 16 per cent vat for the transport and construction sectors will be reduced to 9 per cent from 10 per cent li s comments reconfirm a consistent pro growth stance with clarity on fiscal easing and an earlier than expected effective date for tax cuts morgan stanley said in a note adding that it expects improved growth from the second quarter beijing s tax cut efforts have focused on the manufacturing sector and small businesses that are vital for economic growth and employment li said the government hopes to create 13 million jobs this year the same as last year not allowing the economy to slip out of a reasonable range that is to say we will not allow waves of layoffs said li adding the government will provide support to firms creating the most jobs data on thursday showed that china s survey based jobless rate rose to 5 3 per cent in february from 4 9 per cent in december partly due to job shedding by export oriented companies trade war china is still negotiating with the united states to resolve their trade frictions li said adding both sides have far more shared interests than conflicts and it would be unrealistic to decouple the world s two largest economies we hope that the consultations will be fruitful and will achieve mutual benefit and win win i believe that this is also the expectation of the world li said a summit to seal a trade deal between us president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping will not happen at the end of march as previously discussed treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on thursday washington and beijing have been locked in a tit for tat tariff battle as us presses china for an end to practices and policies it argues have given chinese firms unfair advantages including subsidising of industry limits on access for foreign companies and alleged theft of intellectual property on friday china s parliament approved a new foreign investment law that promises to create a transparent environment for foreign firms though there is scepticism about its enforceability the law designed to ease concerns among foreign companies about the difficulties they face in china will ban forced technology transfer and illegal government interference in foreign business practices li stressed that china did not and would never ask chinese companies to spy on other countries his comments came after increased international scrutiny of chinese telecommunications giant huawei technologies co ltd which has been caught in the cross fire as trade tensions ratcheted up
this article is more than 5 years old as we continue to enjoy the yellen gold standard now in its powell phase who knows how long it will last let s look at why the gold standard system worked so well for so many centuries including nearly two centuries of u s history before the rupture in 1971 during which time the united states became the wealthiest country in the history of world in 1971 the economist arthur laffer he was the chief economist of the office of management and budget at the time was asked what he thought the consequences would be of nixon s closing of the gold window which effectively ended the bretton woods period when the dollar s value was fixed at 35 ounce of gold it won t be as much fun to be an american anymore laffer reportedly replied and he was right but why why is it that the collective intelligence let s be generous of today s central bankers and indeed all the central bankers since 1971 cannot outperform a yellow rock this probably strikes some as bizarre but it has always been thus way back in 1928 in a book called the intelligent woman s guide to socialism and capitalism george bernard shaw declared you have to choose between trusting to the natural stability of gold and the natural stability of the honesty and intelligence of the members of the government and with due respect for these gentlemen i advise you as long as the capitalist system lasts to vote for gold it s the same today these things never change ninety years ago intelligent women understood these things to understand why gold works as a standard of monetary value you have to understand what makes good money today s cryptocurrency enthusiasts are rediscovering what monetary thinkers have always known that the best money is stable money or as i like to term it stable money money that is stable in value after learning that bitcoin and its ilk make splendid devices for gambling the continued popularity of places like las vegas and macau show that there remains a large interest in such things but a rather poor currency exactly as i said would happen some years ago the cryptocurrency engineers are now focusing their energies on developing stablecoins ideally a currency would be perfectly stable in value the market economy is organized via prices profit margins returns on capital and interest rates changes in the value of the currency derange this process creating chaos and havoc john maynard keynes described in 1923 cannot work properly if the money which they assume as a stable measuring rod is undependable unemployment the precarious life of the worker the disappointment of expectation the sudden loss of savings the excessive windfalls to individuals the speculator the profiteer all proceed in large measure from the instability of the standard of value in the scandal of money 2016 george gilder updated this insight using the tools of modern information theory casting a shroud of uncertainty over all valuation monetary manipulations shorten the time horizons of the economy in information theory the dominant science of our age when a medium sends a message of its own static on the line it s called noise noise in the channel reduces the channel s capacity to transmit accurate information in practice such idealized perfection is not quite possible so we have to go with the next best thing the next best thing is gold the thing that most closely approximates this ideal of stability of value president james madison summed up succinctly the only adequate guarantee for the uniform and stable value of a paper currency is its convertibility into specie the least fluctuating and the only universal currency james madison understood this and the united states became one of the most successful countries in the history of the world because people like james madison understood it and adhered to this principle from 1789 to 1971 in this single sentence madison touched on some important political truths you might argue that ideally smart people could get together and create some better that is more stable foundation for money than gold but you might also notice that nobody actually does this they don t even try and never have in the past five decades of floating fiat money one reason for this is that they are human consequently they crumble to political pressures while gold does not even if you could invent some statistical concoction that is a better measure of stable value than gold although no human ever has arguably no human institution could ever implement it for any length of time just look at how statistical concoctions like the consumer price index have been continually altered each time in response to political pressures and to serve political ends this is one reason why as madison asserted gold remains the only adequate guarantee for the uniform and stable value of a paper currency related to this is the fact that gold is the only universal currency it is the only thing along with its adjunct silver that all people have agreed to use as the basis of money which then allows fixed exchange rates between countries vastly simplifying trade and investment in the pre 1914 era most major governments participated in the world gold standard which was simply the extension of many centuries of gold and silver coinage used throughout the world this system was reassembled during the 1920s and again in 1944 at bretton woods we have had no difficulty establishing world monetary systems based on gold contrary to popular belief most countries today do not have freely floating currencies according to the international monetary fund about half of all countries actively anchor their currencies to something else usually a major international currency like the dollar or euro in other words they have fixed exchange rates another 25 of all currencies are stabilized against a major international currency which remains the reference although exchange rates are allowed to drift somewhat either anchored or stabilized most currencies today are part of the dollar or euro currency blocs the only significant difference between the euro currency bloc and the prior world currency bloc based on gold is the standard of value gold or the floating fiat euro despite this enthusiasm for fixed exchange rates a form of stable money there is little interest today in establishing a unified world currency bloc we could for example form a world currency bloc around the euro and the imf has long promoted such solutions then the world would be free of the difficulties of floating currencies the dollar euro exchange rate would be fixed along with the pound euro yen euro and other exchange rates the simple reason is that nobody would trust the european central bank i wouldn t because the ecb is subject to political pressures or other agendas to which gold is immune the ecb can also serve as a means of imposing political pressures actually the world did have a system like this it was called the bretton woods arrangement the british pound german mark japanese yen french franc and all other world currencies were nominally linked to the u s dollar the reason why they agreed to this is that the u s dollar was also linked to gold at 35 oz when the dollar left gold in 1971 nobody was interested in remaining linked to the dollar and currencies floated they still float today gold s performance as a standard of stable value has been exemplary it is actually a lot better than one might rationally expect the things that the gold standard made possible such as the extraordinary stability of bond yields during the nineteenth century have never been replicated under fiat currencies just look at those results achieved without market manipulation and tell me which central bank wiseguy give me a name of a real person that you think could accomplish this and then explain if that is true why they haven t done so already nathan lewis economies work best when currencies are stable in value once we know what the goal is we then look for a way to achieve it and the best way has always been to base a currency on gold nobody has found a better way even in the form of a proposal and nobody has ever needed to find a better way because gold has always worked very well

gold â us dollar vs us dollar index when it comes to analysis of gold the u s dollar index finds nearly universal acceptance or rather when most analysts refer to comparison correlation of the u s dollar to gold they usually illustrate their point with a chart of the u s dollar index while they won t say it straight out most of them see the u s dollar index as a proxy for the u s dollar but is it from wikipedia the u s dollar index usdx dxy dx is an index or measure of the value of the united states dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies often referred to as a basket of u s trade partners currencies the index goes up when the u s dollar gains strength value when compared to other currencies the basket of foreign currencies used are euro japanese yen pound sterling canadian dollar swedish krona swiss franc nowhere is there any reference to gold the only thing the u s dollar index tells us is how the u s dollar compares to a select group of other currencies it tells us nothing about gold below is a chart of dxy reflecting its price over the past ten years in february 2014 point a on the chart dxy u s dollar index was priced at 80 the price of gold at that time was 1328 00 per ounce more than three years later in august 2016 point b the dxy had increased by more than seventeen percent to 94 logically one would assume that over that period of time a change of such significance in the u s dollar index would be reflected in the price of gold in this particular example the increase in the relative dollar value is expected to be reflected by a lower price for gold however that was not the case gold in august 2016 was priced at 1328 00 per ounce the same price as three years earlier in february 2018 point c just over one year ago dxy had retreated to 88 but the price of gold was again at 1328 00 per ounce just recently point d dxy has increased to a nearly two year high of 97 gold s price at the time you guessed it 1328 00 per ounce for the entire five year period from point a to point d there is an increase in dxy from 80 to 97 or twenty one percent even so the price of gold net of all expectations changes and volatility remains unchanged at 1328 00 per ounce what does this tell us about gold absolutely nothing which is the point the u s dollar index tells us nothing about gold it only reflects changes in the exchange rate of the u s dollar versus a mix of other paper currencies if we truly want to know how the u s dollar is doing relative to gold all we need to do is look at the price of gold itself the price of gold at any given moment tells us exactly what the value of the u s dollar is and how much it has declined over the years and gold s price includes people s cumulative current perceptions of and expectations for the u s dollar furthermore that is all that the price of gold tells us gold s price is the inverse reflection of what is happening to the value of the u s dollar and since the u s dollar is continually declining over time the price of gold in u s dollars continues to rise over time there are periods of relative strength and stability in the u s dollar during such periods of time the price of gold will decline we are in one of those periods now and have been since august 2011 no matter what your expectation for the price of gold it will only come to pass if your expectations are consistent with changes in value of the u s dollar lf you are convinced that gold s price is going higher then it will only happen to the degree that the u s dollar declines in value if you are expecting stable or lower gold prices then it will occur only if the u s dollar maintains or improves its relative strength the u s dollar is terminally ill it is currently in a state of remission which can will reverse at any time with a vengeance but it may surprise you how long its current strength and stability lasts also see gold it s still all about the u s dollar kelsey williams is the author of two books inflation what it is what it isn t and who s responsible for it and all hail the fed by kelsey williams kelsey williams is a retired financial professional living in southern utah his website kelsey s gold facts contains self authored articles written for the purpose of educating others about gold within an historical context 2019 copyright kelsey williams all rights reserved disclaimer the above is a matter of opinion provided for general information purposes only and is not intended as investment advice information and analysis above are derived from sources and utilising methods believed to be reliable but we cannot accept responsibility for any losses you may incur as a result of this analysis individuals should consult with their personal financial advisors 2005 2022 the market oracle is a free daily financial markets analysis forecasting online publication
purpose i look at the high frequency weekly indicators because while they can be very noisy they provide a good nowcast of the economy and will telegraph the maintenance or change in the economy well before monthly or quarterly data is available they also are an excellent way to mark your beliefs to market in general i go in order of long leading indicators then short leading indicators then coincident indicators a note on methodology data is presented in a just the facts ma am format with a minimum of commentary so that bias is minimized where relevant i include 12 month highs and lows in the data in parentheses to the right all data taken from st louis fred unless otherwise linked a few items e g financial conditions indexes regional fed indexes stock prices the yield curve have their own metrics based on long term studies of their behavior where data is seasonally adjusted generally it s scored positively if it s within the top 1 3 of that range negative in the bottom 1 3 and neutral in between where it is not seasonally adjusted and there are seasonal issues waiting for the yoy change to change sign will lag the turning point thus i make use of a convention data is scored neutral if it s less than 1 2 as positive negative as at its 12 month extreme with long leading indicators which by definition turn at least 12 months before a turning point in the economy as a whole there s an additional rule data is automatically negative if during an expansion it has not made a new peak in the past year with the sole exception that it s scored neutral if it s moving in the right direction and is close to making a new high recap of monthly reports february data included a flatline on jobs but a big decrease in un and under employment rates as government employees returned to their jobs the ism non manufacturing index remained strongly positive january housing starts and permits both improved although single family housing permits fell to a 16 month low

this week harpex made multi year lows in early 2017 and after oscillating improved to new multi year highs earlier in 2018 but recently enough to rate negative this week it has rebounded enough to be

source sa to sit in next critical zim treasury meetings the zimbabwe independent march 15 2019 in an unprecedented move zimbabwe has agreed to allow south africa the continent s most developed economy and powerhouse to sit in official ministry of finance meetings to oversee harare s debt clearance strategy tied to the country s prospects of securing new funding its reform agenda and economic recovery plan confidential documents show by andrew kunambura confidential minutes of tuesday s south africa zimbabwe bi national commission exclusively obtained by the zimbabwe independent show south africa will participate in stakeholders meetings which zimbabwe s finance minister mthuli ncube holds on a regular basis during which feedback is provided on the state of the economy and policy measures by government the move by south africa to monitor zimbabwe s economic affairs came after pretoria demanded to know what was happening on the local economy and to get latest updates if it was to help engage creditors and countries suffocating the struggling harare now increasingly becoming a pariah state again after losing the support of the international community which it had reclaimed following the fall of former president robert mugabe in a november 2017 military coup zimbabwe has been sent scurrying for refuge and support from its neighbours so far botswana and south africa have shown willingness to come to its rescue mozambique is also helping as shown by a us 25 million facility from its central bank and power supplies zimbabwe is unable to get new funding and lines of credit largely because of the arrears lack of a workable economic recovery plan slow reforms and political instability as well as human rights rule of law property rights and huge democratic deficit problems these difficulties are also discouraging foreign direct investment keeping investors at bay and sometimes triggering capital flight the minutes also reveal zimbabwe s national debt has ballooned to us 18 billion from us 17 6 billion as the country sinks deeper into debt and arrears the debt moved from us 16 9 billion in october last year to us 17 6 billion by end of year and now to us 18 billion half of that being external obligations the minutes say harare owes international financial institutions the world bank african development bank and the european investment bank eib us 2 4 billion it owes the world bank arrears us 1 3 billion afdb us 650 million and eib us 450 million while the updated world bank figure is us 1 3 billion afbd arrears vary between two official figures us 650 million and us 680 million the eib arrears are sometimes officially reported to be us 308 million or us 450 million zimbabwe only repaid the international monetary fund imf us 107 9 million arrears in november 2016 presenting an update on the lima debt and arrears clearance strategy to the imf world bank annual meetings in bali indonesia between october 8 14 last year ncube at the time said the national debt was us 16 9 billion with external debt accounting for approximately us 7 4 billion out of this approximately us 5 6 billion was in arrears zimbabwe also owes the paris club us 2 7 billion and non paris club creditors us 700 million harare has asked pretoria for a us 1 2 billion bailout which is still under discussion officials who attended this week s meetings say the move by pretoria to supervise harare s arrears clearance plan and the economy diplomatically couched as an invitation in the minutes shows south africa s growing leverage over zimbabwe hegemonic influence and its determination to ensure its proposed different funding facilities are not squandered by harare s extravagant rulers there are several facilities under discussion which include a renewed standing facility between the two countries central banks south african banks funding of the zimbabwean private sector sovereign guarantees and other financial options the two countries have 45 memoranda of understanding however officials who attended this week s summit told the independent south africa is agonising over the rescue package due to zimbabwe s debts and arrears profile record of reckless spending lack of meaningful progress on reforms and viable political dialogue this was despite ramaphosa and his team noting some progress on zimbabwe s reform agenda and reconstruction plans the manoeuvre by pretoria to supervise harare s economic affairs which an official described as extraordinary is seen in diplomatic circles as a reflection of south africa s regional hegemony and zimbabwe s desperation to clear its arrears secure new funding and get a financial bailout ramaphosa has taken a firmer position to build closer relations between south africa and zimbabwe than his predecessors as a way of trying to reinforce his control over the situation help out harare and stabilise the country while containing huge problems the local crisis is causing south of the limpopo one well briefed official told the independent he really wants to help his administration realises that south african can only contain problems zimbabwe is causing in its backyard and in the region by stabilising it and assisting it recover this is a much more sustainable solution than allowing zimbabwe to sink become south africa s poor 10th province or take advantage of its problems to tap into its labour reservoir shrinking market and resources already zimbabwe is like a huge south african warehouse but ramaphosa wants to help with a sustainable solution it is both in south africa and zimbabwe s national interest at the end of the harare meetings ramaphosa said south africa stands ready to render support to zimbabwe within our means in your quest for economic renewal for his part mnangagwa said he was grateful and acknowledged he did not take south african support for granted while south africa was unable to provide a rescue package its finance minister tito mboweni s delegation the minutes show agreed to help zimbabwe to engage key international financial institutions such as the imf world bank and afdb as well as the paris club and other creditors to deal with the arrears problem and new funding given the importance of investor perceptions in the success of any paris club resolutions the commission agreed that communication with key stakeholders on economic updates and progress by the zimbabwean government was required the minutes say additionally zimbabwe should share information with south africa to ensure that both countries speak with one voice when engaging the various stakeholders around the clearance of arrears pretoria is also going to help harare fight mainly united states sanctions which were renewed last week ramaphosa has been vocal on sanctions and the need for re engagement this week he said zimbabwe deserves support to get out of the current economic doldrums the ministers also agreed that they would work together on re engagement with international co operating partners in support of zimbabwe s economic reform and debt arrears clearance agenda south africa will continue lending its voice and support within the various international forums for the clearance of debt arrears the minutes say zimbabwe is to extend an invitation to south africa to participate in stakeholder meetings which zimbabwe s finance minister holds on a regular basis during which feedback is provided on the state of the economy and policy measures by the government of zimbabwe going forward the two ministers agreed to work together on engagements with international partners to provide support towards the economic reform agenda of zimbabwe besides financial cooperation the summit agreed on non financial assistance on issues like debt management public private partnerships budget decentralisation macro economic policy frameworks regional integration and macro economic convergence at that level and fintech developments to enable banking and financial services the minister of finance and economic development for zimbabwe hon prof m ncube and his south african counterpart hon t mboweni and their delegates as part of the third session of the bnc met and exchanged views on the progress regarding the policy reform agenda being undertaken by zimbabwe the minutes say the main thrust of the reform programme is macroeconomic stabilisation attracting investment re integrating the country into the global community of nations and laying a strong foundation for shared and sustained inclusive growth the minutes further indicate that ncube and mboweni received an update regarding progress on the ongoing discussions for expanding the standing revolving facility arrangement between the two countries respective central banks to this extent the parties are exploring options of supporting the expansion of the standing facility the minutes say south africa is zimbabwe s largest trading partner and home to millions of zimbabwean immigrants who have flocked to the country running away from political instability economic meltdown and seeking greener pastures

here are the answers with discussion for this weekend s quiz the information provided should help you work out why you missed a question or three if you haven t already done the quiz from yesterday then have a go at it before you read the answers i hope this helps you develop an understanding of modern monetary theory mmt and its application to macroeconomic thinking comments as usual welcome especially if i have made an error question 1 the only way that unbalanced external accounts across nations some countries with surpluses and other deficits can exist is because the surplus countries desire to hold financial assets denominated in the currency of the deficit countries the answer is true many economists do not fully understand how to interpret the balance of payments in a fiat monetary system for example most will associate the rise in the current account deficit exports less than imports plus net invisibles with an outflow of capital they then argue that the only way australia if we use it as an example can counter this is if australian financial institutions borrow from abroad they then assume that this is a problem because it means allegedly that australia is living beyond its means it it true that the higher the level of australian foreign debt the more its economy becomes linked to changing conditions in international credit markets but the way this situation is usually constructed is dubious first exports are a cost a nation has to give something real to foreigners that it we could use domestically so there is an opportunity cost involved in exports second imports are a benefit they represent foreigners giving a nation something real that they could use themselves but which the local economy will benefit from having the opportunity cost is all theirs so on balance if a nation can persuade foreigners to send more ships filled with things than it has to send in return net export deficit then that is a net material benefit to the local economy we say the real terms of trade are in the importing nations favour i am abstracting from all the arguments valid mostly that says we cannot measure welfare in a material way i know all the arguments that support that position and largely agree with them so how can we have a situation where foreigners are giving up more real things than they get from the local economy in a macroeconomic sense the answer lies in the fact that the local nation s current account deficit finances the desire of foreigners to accumulate net financial claims denominated in auds think about that carefully the standard conception is exactly the opposite that the foreigners finance the local economy s profligate spending patterns in fact the local trade deficit allows the foreigners to accumulate these financial assets claims on the local economy the local economy gains in real terms more ships full coming in than leave and foreigners achieve their desired financial portfolio so in general that seems like a good outcome for all the problem is that if the foreigners change their desire to accumulate financial assets in the local currency then they will become unwilling to allow the real terms of trade ships going and coming with real things to remain in the local nation s favour then the local econmy has to adjust its export and import behaviour accordingly if this transition is sudden then some disruptions can occur in general these adjustments are not sudden this bi lateral example extends to multi lateral situations which become more complicated in terms of who is holding what but the underlying principle is the same a net exporting must be desiring to accumulate financial assets denominated in the currencies of the nations it runs surpluses with it may then trade these assets for other claims not necessarily in the original currency but that doesn t alter the basic motivation the following blogs may be of further interest to you question 2 like anything in abundance it is true that when there is more money in the economy its value declines the answer is false while there are rare situations where the statement might hold the categorical it is true is incorrect the question requires you to a understand the difference between bank reserves and the money supply and b understand the quantity theory of money the mainstream macroeconomics text book argument that increasing the money supply will cause inflation is based on the quatity theory of money first expanding bank reserves will put more base money into the economy but not increase the aggregates that drive the alleged causality in the quantity theory of money that is the various estimates of the money supply second even if the money supply is increasing the economy may still adjust to that via output and income increases up to full capacity over time as investment expands the productive capacity of the economy aggregate demand growth can support the utilisation of that increased capacity without there being inflation in this situation an increasing money supply which is really not a very useful aggregate at all which signals expanding credit will not be inflationary so the maybe relates to the situation that might arise if nominal demand kept increasing beyond the capacity of the real economy to absorb it via increased production then you would get inflation and the value of the dollar would start to decline the quantity theory of money which in symbols is mv pq but means that the money stock times the turnover per period v is equal to the price level p times real output q the mainstream assume that v is fixed despite empirically it moving all over the place and q is always at full employment as a result of market adjustments in applying this theory the mainstream deny the existence of unemployment the more reasonable mainstream economists admit that short run deviations in the predictions of the quantity theory of money can occur but in the long run all the frictions causing unemployment will disappear and the theory will apply in general the monetarists the most recent group to revive the quantity theory of money claim that with v and q fixed then changes in m cause changes in p which is the basic monetarist claim that expanding the money supply is inflationary they say that excess monetary growth creates a situation where too much money is chasing too few goods and the only adjustment that is possible is nominal that is inflation one of the contributions of keynes was to show the quantity theory of money could not be correct he observed price level changes independent of monetary supply movements and vice versa which changed his own perception of the way the monetary system operated further with high rates of capacity and labour underutilisation at various times including now one can hardly seriously maintain the view that q is fixed there is always scope for real adjustments that is increasing output to match nominal growth in aggregate demand so if increased credit became available and borrowers used the deposits that were created by the loans to purchase goods and services it is likely that firms with excess capacity will react to the increased nominal demand by increasing output the mainstream have related the current non standard monetary policy efforts the so called quantitative easing to the quantity theory of money and predicted hyperinflation will arise so it is the modern belief in the quantity theory of money is behind the hysteria about the level of bank reserves at present it has to be inflationary they say because there is all this money lying around and it will flood the economy textbook like that of mankiw mislead their students into thinking that there is a direct relationship between the monetary base and the money supply they claim that the central bank controls the money supply by buying and selling government bonds in open market operations and that the private banks then create multiples of the base via credit creation students are familiar with the pages of textbook space wasted on explaining the erroneous concept of the money multiplier where a banks are alleged to loan out some of its reserves and create money as i have indicated several times the depiction of the fractional reserve money multiplier process in textbooks like mankiw exemplifies the mainstream misunderstanding of banking operations please read my blog post money multiplier and other myths for more discussion on this point the idea that the monetary base the sum of bank reserves and currency leads to a change in the money supply via some multiple is not a valid representation of the way the monetary system operates even though it appears in all mainstream macroeconomics textbooks and is relentlessly rammed down the throats of unsuspecting economic students the money multiplier myth leads students to think that as the central bank can control the monetary base then it can control the money supply further given that inflation is allegedly the result of the money supply growing too fast then the blame is sheeted home to the government the central bank in this case the reality is that the central bank does not have the capacity to control the money supply we have regularly traversed this point in the world we live in bank loans create deposits and are made without reference to the reserve positions of the banks the bank then ensures its reserve positions are legally compliant as a separate process knowing that it can always get the reserves from the central bank the only way that the central bank can influence credit creation in this setting is via the price of the reserves it provides on demand to the commercial banks so when we talk about quantitative easing we must first understand that it requires the short term interest rate to be at zero or close to it otherwise the central bank would not be able to maintain control of a positive interest rate target because the excess reserves would invoke a competitive process in the interbank market which would effectively drive the interest rate down quantitative easing then involves the central bank buying assets from the private sector government bonds and high quality corporate debt so what the central bank is doing is swapping financial assets with the banks they sell their financial assets and receive back in return extra reserves so the central bank is buying one type of financial asset private holdings of bonds company paper and exchanging it for another reserve balances at the central bank the net financial assets in the private sector are in fact unchanged although the portfolio composition of those assets is altered maturity substitution which changes yields and returns in terms of changing portfolio compositions quantitative easing increases central bank demand for long maturity assets held in the private sector which reduces interest rates at the longer end of the yield curve these are traditionally thought of as the investment rates this might increase aggregate demand given the cost of investment funds is likely to drop but on the other hand the lower rates reduce the interest income of savers who will reduce consumption demand accordingly how these opposing effects balance out is unclear but the evidence suggests there is not very much impact at all for the monetary aggregates outside of base money to increase the banks would then have to increase their lending and create deposits this is at the heart of the mainstream belief is that quantitative easing will stimulate the economy sufficiently to put a brake on the downward spiral of lost production and the increasing unemployment the recent experience and that of japan in 2001 showed that quantitative easing does not succeed in doing this this should come as no surprise at all if you understand modern monetary theory mmt the mainstream view is based on the erroneous belief that the banks need reserves before they can lend and that quantitative easing provides those reserves that is a major misrepresentation of the way the banking system actually operates but the mainstream position asserts wrongly that banks only lend if they have prior reserves the illusion is that a bank is an institution that accepts deposits to build up reserves and then on lends them at a margin to make money the conceptualisation suggests that if it doesn t have adequate reserves then it cannot lend so the presupposition is that by adding to bank reserves quantitative easing will help lending but banks do not operate like this bank lending is not reserve constrained banks lend to any credit worthy customer they can find and then worry about their reserve positions afterwards if they are short of reserves their reserve accounts have to be in positive balance each day and in some countries central banks require certain ratios to be maintained then they borrow from each other in the interbank market or ultimately they will borrow from the central bank through the so called discount window they are reluctant to use the latter facility because it carries a penalty higher interest cost the point is that building bank reserves will not increase the bank s capacity to lend loans create deposits which generate reserves those that claim that quantitative easing will expose the economy to uncontrollable inflation are just harking back to the old and flawed quantity theory of money this theory has no application in a modern monetary economy and proponents of it have to explain why economies with huge excess capacity to produce idle capital and high proportions of unused labour cannot expand production when the orders for goods and services increase should quantitative easing actually stimulate spending then the depressed economies will likely respond by increasing output not prices so the fact that large scale quantitative easing conducted by central banks in japan in 2001 and now in the uk and the usa has not caused inflation does not provide a strong refutation of the mainstream quantity theory of money because it has not impacted on the monetary aggregates the fact that is hasn t is not surprising if you understand how the monetary system operates but it has certainly bedazzled the easily dazzled mainstream economists the following blogs may be of further interest to you question 3 the imposition of a fiscal rule at the national government level that the fiscal position is required to be in balance at all times would eliminate fiscal swings driven by the automatic stabilisers the answer is false the final fiscal outcome is the difference between total federal revenue and total federal outlays so if total revenue is greater than outlays the fiscal position is in surplus and vice versa it is a simple matter of accounting with no theory involved however the fiscal balance is used by all and sundry to indicate the fiscal stance of the government so if the fiscal position is in surplus it is often concluded that the fiscal impact of government is contractionary withdrawing net spending and if the fiscal position is in deficit we say the fiscal impact expansionary adding net spending further a rising deficit falling surplus is often considered to be reflecting an expansionary policy stance and vice versa what we know is that a rising deficit may in fact indicate a contractionary fiscal stance which in turn creates such income losses that the automatic stabilisers start driving the fiscal position back towards or into deficit so the complication is that we cannot conclude that changes in the fiscal impact reflect discretionary policy changes the reason for this uncertainty clearly relates to the operation of the automatic stabilisers to see this the most simple model of the fiscal balance we might think of can be written as budget balance revenue spending tax revenue other revenue welfare payments other spending we know that tax revenue and welfare payments move inversely with respect to each other with the latter rising when gdp growth falls and the former rises with gdp growth these components of the fiscal balance are the so called automatic stabilisers in other words without any discretionary policy changes the fiscal balance will vary over the course of the business cycle when the economy is weak tax revenue falls and welfare payments rise and so the fiscal balance moves towards deficit or an increasing deficit when the economy is stronger tax revenue rises and welfare payments fall and the fiscal balance becomes increasingly positive automatic stabilisers attenuate the amplitude in the business cycle by expanding the fiscal position in a recession and contracting it in a boom so just because the fiscal position goes into deficit doesn t allow us to conclude that the government has suddenly become of an expansionary mind in other words the presence of automatic stabilisers make it hard to discern whether the fiscal policy stance chosen by the government is contractionary or expansionary at any particular point in time the first point to always be clear about then is that the fiscal balance is not determined by the government its discretionary policy stance certainly is an influence but the final outcome will reflect non government spending decisions in other words the concept of a fiscal rule where the government can set a desired balance in the case of the question zero and achieve that at all times is fraught it is likely that in attempting to achieve a balanced fiscal position the government will set its discretionary policy settings counter to the best interests of the economy either too contractionary or too expansionary if there was a balanced fiscal rule and private spending fell dramatically then the automatic stabilisers would push the fiscal position into the direction of deficit the final outcome would depend on net exports and whether the private sector was saving overall or not assume that net exports were in deficit typical case and private saving overall was positive then private spending declines in this case the actual fiscal outcome would be a deficit equal to the sum of the other two balances then in attempting to apply the fiscal rule the discretionary component of the fiscal position would have to contract this contraction would further reduce aggregate demand and the automatic stabilisers loss of tax revenue and increased welfare payments would be working against the discretionary policy choice in that case the application of the fiscal rule would be undermining production and employment and probably not succeeding in getting the fiscal position into balance but every time a discretionary policy change was

letters to the editor proposition s a small sacrifice for children s future my wife and i lived 20 years in poplar bluff before moving to the st louis area in 2000 immediately after retiring in june 2017 we took a one year trip around the country visiting 50 states in 50 weeks to determine where we planned to live for the duration we wanted to live where we could benefit from big city amenities like st louis but with the small town flavor like that of poplar bluff springfield won the prize another draw was our perception of springfield being the ozarks mecca of recreational activities including festivals sports the outdoors and a good mix of cultural activities provided by the citizenry and the city s three outstanding institutions of higher learning a community that prided itself by promoting education which included public schools was very important to us on tuesday april 2 springfield will vote on proposition s if passed it will provide new elementary schools and necessary renovations to others including essential safety and security measures to help keep our children safe new school buildings and renovations either have a direct or indirect influence on educational achievement students who enter the doors of a new or newly refurbished building have a better sense of pride for their school and will respond with a greater appreciation and determination to perform well why do businesses like banks or churches and grocery stores doll up their campuses to project a successful and positive image and people respond accordingly in closing we are retired and on a fixed income as are many people our age our children have long since left home we have no grandchildren granted if proposition s passes our taxes will minimally increase we understand this and even welcome the opportunity to leave an imprint on springfield s children even if they are not physically our very own i feel we owe a yes vote for the future sometimes making a sacrifice for the common good of one s community and especially the children is the true mark of unselfish devotion to generations to come vote yes for proposition s rod dollins springfield june noble is wrong death penalty is not a deterrent the headline on ms noble s letter death sentence makes sense as deterrent is nonsense the death penalty makes absolutely no sense as a deterrent states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it missouri has three times the murder rate than iowa a non death penalty state states that abolished the death penalty did not have an increase in murder rates after canada abolished the death penalty murder rates have gone down every year eighty eight percent of criminologists say the death penalty is not a deterrent death penalty information center as for her comment about taxes to feed and house the death penalty is far more expensive than life without parole study dpic her comment what if it was your son or daughter there are many families of murder victims that oppose the death penalty one organization murdered victims families for reconciliation whose motto is don t kill in our name we all feel terrible about hailey owens while the evidence against craig wood is substantial there are many who were sentenced to death on evidence not so open and shut one hundred sixty four people have been proven innocent and released from death row some came within hours of being executed robert oliver nixa sps bond issue lacks critical needs the proposed sps 168 million bond issue has three major flaws first it is not phase one of a multimillion dollar plan as stated by a board a member in the news leader of 11 30 18 the only thing we re voting on tonight is the 168 million and the projects that are listed up there period the end clearly the task force did not come up with a long term plan for sps school buildings second in the same news leader a board member said this is fundamentally an investment in equity one small elementary school will be built new in its neighborhood apparently in concert with the concept of maintaining small neighborhood elementary schools however portland elementary will be demolished and students sent to an expanded sunshine elementary clearly portland and sunshine are not being treated equally the third flaw is the absence of dollars and a plan for the backlog of maintenance and major repairs the news leader of 3 24 17 states that 49 percent of sps schools are in poor or unsatisfactory condition roofs ceilings floors playgrounds and heating and cooling systems must be maintained and upgraded the bond issue of 2017 was rejected by voters but it did have a plan the plan was to build large campus sites with an elementary and middle school attached at the kitchen the 2017 plan destroyed the small elementary school and was rejected by voters in my opinion letter of 9 17 2016 i suggested small elementary schools are best for student performance based on studies by several organizations and cities however i am prepared and i think most parents and grandparents are prepared to accept the elementary plus middle school large campus if that s best for some neighborhoods we need to have that discussion keeping in mind something david harrison as a board member would often say if it s not broke don t fix it but first we need to pass a no tax increase bond issue and fix the 49 percent of schools in poor condition and build safer entrances at 31 schools with the objective of safe and well maintained schools for all students kirby nelson springfield greene county assets have better uses than crime based media using greene county assets to generate media content focusing on crime and criminals in the county which will be on tv and the internet is an extremely poor decision does the county commission have the authority and or the political will to put a stop to this rick matz springfield the bible a good source for education i write in response to john havel s opinion published in the saturday march 9 2019 springfield news leader keep bible courses out of public schools many years ago i had the opportunity to teach the bible as literature as an elective course offered to high school students the course had four major objectives 1 to introduce many of the major stories of the bible in a factual reporter like fashion students learned the who what where when and why of the story and sometimes the what next we were teaching primarily the plot of the story without exploring deeper elements such as symbolism 2 to acquaint students with common words and phrases from bible stories that have made their way into everyday language when students read that something fell into their laps like manna from heaven or hear the handwriting is really on the wall for that guy they know where the phrase came from and can better understand how it is being used in the text or speech 3 to expose students to classic works of art based on biblical stories so they learn to recognize the original work such as michelangelo s creation of adam from the ceiling of the sistine chapel this work of art was recently used by taco bell in a burrito campaign 4 to help students become more aware of the thousands of modern day books plays movies and works of art based on biblical stories and themes such as a time to kill by john grisham by the skin of our teeth by thornton wilder and absalom absalom by william faulkner to name just a few learning more about the most widely read most popular and arguably the most influential book in the world in this way can only serve to produce more well rounded thoughtful and better educated people sadly many students today neither read the bible at home or attend a church and even if they do this course holds insights for them as well i am not at all familiar with the curtis trent bill referenced by john haven but the bible as literature elective course i do know is a great idea as is mr havel s idea for a comparative religions course sally reese nixa universal basic income solution to america s economic problems universal basic income as duly noted by elon musk is not just a policy we need to consider it is an inevitability and as such should be considered a right the sooner the better ubi should have been introduced in america president nixon proposed it congress refused to comply when the world first went off the gold standard which paved the way for creating an unlimited money supply however ubi is finally a feasible policy as the result of centuries of work to form the foundations of a capitalist system capable of sustaining an affluent lifestyle for every human being not just for the idle money trading rich those who make the claim that universal basic income is a threat to the american way of life are being ridiculous ignorant or evil people need to realize that we all can be made rich but only after the implementation of a universal basic income provides the floor to build that new wealth we just need to decide if the majority of americans should be middle class or continue down the road of economic inequality that the current rules of the money creation system guarantee us you won t find an economist alive who would argue that 1 000 a month for every american would cause sustained inflation or that the infrastructure would fail due to increased demand and forget about paying for ubi with new taxes that s not the way to pay for ubi ubi should be paid for by injecting new free money printed by the government think of ubi as quantitative easing for the masses why does the u s have a giant national debt and politicians run around wailing flailing their arms claiming our debts and deficits will bankrupt us because they refuse to admit to the american people that we can print free money any time we want to we can pay our national debt any time we are willing to do it now is the time to start printing that free money to pay down the national debt we can t just print all our new money by creating new debt and expect to ever have a way for that debt to be paid the numbers just don t add up for every dollar of new money created by debt a dollar of free money should be printed and placed into the economy to pay for that debt ubi is the method by which that debt canceling free money needs to come into existence wake up america your poverty is self imposed greg rubottom springfield

country report on human rights practices for 2018 panama by the us department of state executive summary panama is a multiparty constitutional democracy in 2014 voters chose juan carlos varela rodriguez as president in national elections that international and domestic observers considered generally free and fair civilian authorities maintained effective control over the security forces human rights issues included undue restrictions on free expression the press and the internet including censorship site blocking and criminal libel and widespread corruption the varela administration and the public ministry continued investigations into allegations of corruption against public officials section 1 respect for the integrity of the person including freedom from a arbitrary deprivation of life and other unlawful or politically motivated killings there were no reports the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings b disappearance there were no reports of disappearances by or on behalf of government authorities c torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment the constitution prohibits such practices and there were no reports that government officials employed them in 2017 civilian correctional officers used batons and tear gas to control inmates who refused to be transported penitentiary system authorities investigated the incident and dismissed the case citing evidence that showed standard procedures were enforced due to serious misconduct by the inmates in may the ombudsman s office decried the possible use of excessive force and the conclusion of the penitentiary authorities prison and detention center conditions prison conditions remained harsh due primarily to overcrowding a shortage of prison guards and inadequate medical services and sanitary conditions physical conditions as of august the prison system with an intended capacity of 14 842 inmates held 16 069 prisoners pretrial detainees shared cells with convicted prisoners due to space constraints prison conditions for women were generally better than for men but conditions for both populations remained poor with some overcrowded facilities poor inmate security and medical care and a lack of basic supplies for personal hygiene female inmates had access to more rehabilitation programs than male inmates there were 1 170 prison guards nationwide including 60 new guards hired during the year officials estimated however the system required 2 870 guards to staff the prisons adequately according to international standards authorities acknowledged that staff shortages limited exercise time for inmates on certain days juvenile pretrial and custodial detention centers also suffered from a lack of prison officials authorities acknowledged that staff shortages limited exercise time for inmates on certain days juvenile pretrial and custodial detention centers also suffered from an insufficient number of prison officials one prison punta coco falls under the control of the ministry of public security rather than the ministry of government s national directorate of the penitentiary system dgsp in march the inter american commission on human rights iachr reiterated its request to close punta coco due to the lack of appropriate medical attention for inmates lawyers and relatives of the inmates had to travel 66 miles by boat to reach the prison located on an island in august authorities transferred 12 inmates temporarily from the punta coco facility to a panama city prison while they upgraded it to international prison standards by orders of the supreme court of justice it was reopened on december 6 and the 12 prisoners were transferred back to the facility the ministry of health conducted fewer vaccination campaigns in prisons compared with previous years hiv aids treatment was available but insulin was scarce throughout the country which affected provisions for inmates prison medical care overall was inadequate due to the lack of personnel transportation and medical resources sixty percent of complaints received by the ombudsman s office from january through august related to the lack of access to medical attention and medications authorities permitted relatives of inmates to bring medicine although there were reports that some relatives paid bribes to prison personnel including police agents to bypass the required clearances authorities transferred patients with serious illnesses to public clinics but there were constant difficulties arranging inmate transportation inmates often missed medical appointments with specialized physicians because the dgsp did not have ambulances inmates were transported in police vehicles or in emergency services ambulances when available emergency services ambulances staff were reluctant to service the prisons lack of prison guards also affected the transfers as of august 17 male inmates had died in custody most from natural causes or disease one inmate died due to inmate on inmate violence administration authorities conducted proper investigations of credible allegations of mistreatment independent monitoring the government permitted prison monitoring by independent nongovernmental observers the ombudsman s office conducted unannounced visits to the prisons without restrictions human rights nongovernmental organizations ngos seeking access to prisons during visiting hours were required to send a written request to the dgsp 15 days in advance improvements during the year a new centrally based system for better tracking of prisoners and statistics was implemented and the data was published on a public website d arbitrary arrest or detention the law prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention and provides for the right of any person to challenge the lawfulness of his or her arrest or detention in court and the government generally observed these prohibitions role of the police and security apparatus the country has no military forces the panama national police pnp is principally responsible for internal law enforcement and public order civilian authorities in the ministry of public security and the ministry of the presidency maintained effective control over all police investigative border air maritime and migration services in the country the government has mechanisms to investigate and punish abuse and corruption but information on the process and results of investigations were rarely made public penitentiary authorities remained concerned over internal corruption since unannounced inspections during the year resulted in findings of larger than usual amounts of drugs and illegal items in inmates possession due to the insufficient number of prison guards the pnp was sometimes responsible for security both outside and inside the prisons pnp leadership expressed concern over insufficient training and equipment arrest procedures and treatment of detainees the law requires arresting officers to inform detainees immediately of the reasons for arrest or detention and of the right to immediate legal counsel detainees gained prompt access to legal counsel and family members and the government provided indigent defendants with a lawyer the country completed its transition to an accusatory justice system in 2016 but cases opened prior to the transition continued to be processed under the previous inquisitorial system known for its vulnerability to corruption inefficiencies and bureaucratic hurdles under the accusatorial system bail exists but was rarely granted because of the implementation of a less costly provisional release system under the inquisitorial system a functioning bail procedure existed for a limited number of crimes but was largely unused most bail proceedings were at the discretion of the prosecutor s office and could not be independently initiated by detainees or their legal counsel bail was granted in high profile corruption cases which prompted complaints by civil society about the public ministry s administering selective justice the law prohibits police from detaining adult suspects for more than 48 hours but allows authorities to detain minor suspects for 72 hours in the accusatorial system arrests and detention decisions were made on a probable cause basis pretrial detention under the inquisitorial system the government regularly imprisoned inmates for more than one year before a pretrial hearing and in some cases pretrial detention exceeded the minimum sentence for the alleged crime according to the dgsp director 52 percent of inmates were pretrial detainees as of july some observers criticized the judiciary for applying unequal pretrial restrictive measures for individuals facing substantially similar charges prosecutors also reported internal pressure from the public ministry to prevent release of those accused of crimes pending trial e denial of fair public trial while the law provides for an independent judiciary the judicial system was inefficient and susceptible to corruption as well as internal and external influence and it faced allegations of manipulation by the executive branch in august a judge dismissed corruption charges against 22 government officials among the accused were individuals who had considerable influence in the community court proceedings for cases in process under the inquisitorial system were not publicly available while accusatory system cases were as a result nonparties to the inquisitorial case proceedings did not have access to these proceedings until a verdict was reached under the inquisitorial system judges could decide to hold private hearings and did so in high profile cases consequently the judiciary sometimes faced accusations particularly in high profile cases of procedural irregularities since most of these cases had not reached conclusion however the records remained under seal interested parties generally did not face gag orders but because of this mechanism it was difficult to verify facts trial procedures the law provides for the right to a fair and public trial and the judiciary generally enforced this right the law provides that all citizens charged with crimes enjoy the right to a presumption of innocence they have the right to be informed promptly and in detail of the charges with free interpretation as necessary for non spanish speaking inmates to have a trial without undue delay to have counsel of their choice and adequate time and facilities to prepare a defense to refrain from incriminating themselves or close relatives and to be tried only once for a given offense the accused may be present with counsel during the investigative phase of proceedings during the year new criminal cases were tried under the accusatory system under this system trials were open to the public all trials must be completed in less than 18 months judges may order the presence of pretrial detainees for providing or expanding upon statements or for confronting witnesses trials are conducted based on evidence presented by the public prosecutor defendants have the right to be present at trial and to consult with an attorney in a timely manner along with the right to enter into a plea deal defendants may confront or question adverse witnesses and present their own witnesses and evidence defendants have a right of appeal the judiciary generally enforced these rights the judiciary complained that many hearings were canceled due to inmates failure to appear especially those involving inmates processed under the old inquisitorial system this was usually due to administrative shortcomings such as a dearth of pnp agents to transfer the inmates to the courts authorities were also aware that available correctional officers and pnp agents focused more on inmates tried under the new accusatory system because the law fines police and correctional officers 100 balboas one balboa is equal to one us dollar for failing to deliver an inmate to a hearing the judiciary continued to promote videoconference hearings judges were receptive to using this tool and during the year the government continued to add video conference and hearing rooms to prison facilities political prisoners and detainees there were no credible reports of political prisoners or detainees civil judicial procedures and remedies citizens have access to the courts to bring lawsuits seeking damages for or cessation of human rights violations although most do not pursue such lawsuits due to the length of the process there are administrative and judicial remedies for alleged wrongs and authorities often granted them to citizens who followed through with the process the court can order civil remedies including fair compensation to the individual injured individuals or organizations may initiate cases involving violations of an individual s human rights by submitting petitions to the iachr the 2016 community justice system which provides another path for citizens to seek redress for human rights violations entered into effect in january although peace judges were appointed lack of municipal funds throughout the country prevented the assignment of professional level salaries for the judges as well as the relocation of the facilities for administrative or community justice to be served the peace judges replaced the 679 corregidores under the 77 mayors nationwide the corregidor system a leftover of the military regime was considered for years an unfair process that violated human rights through unjustified imprisonment imposed by unqualified politically influenced judges training for national police agents and judicial investigative agents on the new system was also insufficient f arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy family home or correspondence the law prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy family home or correspondence and the government generally respected

necessary the decree increases the frequency of the approval board meetings and reduces wait times for final decisions through improved processing and the implementation of a computerized application process international organizations and ngos criticized the new decree because it did not include the cartagena declaration definition of refugee nor did it provide applicants with work permits the new decree also stipulates a six month waiting period after entering the country before applying for refugee status and it establishes a summary proceeding to deny refugees who have manifestly unfounded claims as determined by onpar in august the government issued a resolution detailing which claims will be considered manifestly unfounded ngos believed this would further limit access to

panamanians newly arrived venezuelans noted prejudice in popular culture and in recent laws passed by the legislature restricting labor participation and length of visa stays cultural and language differences and immigration status hindered the integration of immigrant and first generation individuals from china india and the middle east into mainstream society additionally some members of

october iachr hearing but the government requested more documentation and clarification of the specifics of the land claim the ngabe and bugle continued to oppose the barro blanco dam project which became operational in april 2017 there were no plans by the government to halt dam operations the ngabe bugle and the government continued to negotiate details of the dam s operation although the

discrimination against indigenous persons was widespread employers frequently denied indigenous workers basic rights provided by law such as a minimum wage social security benefits termination pay and job security laborers on the country s agricultural plantations the majority of whom were indigenous persons continued to work in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions the ministry of labor conducted limited oversight of working conditions in remote areas education deficiencies continued in the comarcas especially beyond the primary grades there were not enough teachers in these remote and inaccessible areas with many multigrade schools often poorly constructed and lacking running water in april teachers and indigenous communities in the ngabe comarca began periodically protesting the poor roads and education in the comarca by closing the interamerican highway as well as other roads in september a group of ngabe closed the highway for more than 10 hours to protest the delay in the construction of a road to their communities that would connect the 1 200 inhabitants and 12 schools police forcibly removed the protesters from the highway nine police officers were injured and 12 ngabe arrested some with injuries this sparked a 60 day strike in 43 of the schools in the comarca as teachers demanded better work conditions including safety bonuses better life insurance and improved roads access to health care was a significant problem in the indigenous comarcas despite government investment in more health infrastructure and staff this was reflected in high rates of maternal and infant mortality and malnutrition the government continued to execute the indigenous development plan jointly developed with indigenous leaders in 2013 acts of violence discrimination and other abuses based on sexual orientation and gender identity the law does not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation there was societal discrimination based on sexual orientation and

institution and permits no more than one chapter per province forty public servants are required to form an association the national federation of public servants fenasep an umbrella federation of 25 public sector worker associations advocates for adequate treatment of the public sector as a sector with established rights like that of private sector unionized groups fenasep contended there was no

strike the law prohibits federations and confederations from calling strikes as well as strikes against the government s economic and social policy individual associations under fenasep may negotiate on behalf of their members fenasep leaders noted that collective bargaining claims were heard and recognized but they reported a lack of change afterwards particularly regarding dismissals without

the workers association and a third member chosen by the first two if the dispute cannot be resolved it is referred to a tribunal under the board observers however said the ministry of the presidency had not designated the tribunal judges the alternative to the board is the civil court system cases presented in the courts tended to favor the employer fenasep noted one public sector institution had appealed more than 100 complaints to the supreme court only two of which were ruled in favor of the public sector employee supreme court decisions are final two major strikes occurred during the year the panama canal tugboat union ucoc claimed unsafe work conditions led to three collisions in the panama canal beginning in august the ucoc periodically went on strike mostly over safety reasons ucoc

had 69 general inspectors and 118 safety inspectors for construction sites the number of inspectors was insufficient to enforce labor laws adequately as of july the ministry of labor had conducted 9 929 safety inspections nationwide fines were low and generally insufficient to deter violations during the year however the government levied fines according to the number of workers affected resulting in larger overall fines reports of violations relating to hours of work were frequent especially in the maritime sector where unions reported shifts of 14 to 24 hours these long shifts reportedly resulted in fatigue based occupational safety and health risks reports also indicated that neither the maritime authority nor the labor ministry conducted inspections regarding working conditions in the maritime sector canal zone unions and workers experienced difficulties accessing the justice system to adjudicate complaints due to delays and other deficiencies of the labor relations board which is the court of first instance on labor matters in the canal zone reports also indicated violations relating to hours of work for coffee harvest workers who often lacked formal contracts and were vulnerable to coercion from the employer employers often hired employees under short term contracts to avoid paying benefits that accrue to long term employees employers in the maritime sector also commonly hired workers continuously on short term contracts but did not convert them to permanent employees as required by law the law states that employers have the right to dismiss any employee without justifiable cause before the two year tenure term as a result employers frequently hired workers for one year and 11 months and subsequently laid them off to circumvent laws that make firing employees more difficult after two years of employment this practice is illegal if the same employee is rehired as a temporary worker after being laid off although employees rarely reported the practice inspectors from the ministry of labor and the occupational health section of the social security administration reported conducting periodic inspections of hazardous employment sites the law requires the resident engineer and a ministry construction industry inspector to remain on construction sites establish fines for noncompliance and identify a tripartite group composed of the chamber of construction suntracs and the ministry to regulate adherence some construction workers and their employers were occasionally lax about basic safety measures frequently due to their perception that it reduced productivity equipment was often outdated broken or lacking safety devices due in large part to a fear that the replacement cost would be prohibitive
circa 2005 hundreds of journalists gathered at the dhirubhai ambani knowledge city dakc tech park at kopar khairne in navi mumbai on a sunday at the behest of the media relations cell of anil ambani the younger scion of the reliance empire no one seemed to mind that they had been called in for a press conference on a sunday after all both anil and elder brother mukesh ambani had had several such meet ups over issues that ultimately led them to split the family business finally anil seemed to have got what he wanted the new age telecom business along with the financial services and energy business which held a lot more promise than the bread and butter petrochemicals operations which formed the core of the group this went to mukesh that day anil an avid marathoner then in his mid 40s was brimming with confidence as he laid down his plans in telecom advertisement he looked like a go getter ready to tap into the potential of the indian mobile telecom revolution and along with it take the fortunes of his group adag or the anil dhirubhai ambani group as it was then known to great heights cut to 2019 reliance communications rcom anil s mobile telephony venture has all but wound up even as he owes lenders rs 48 000 crore his businesses have shrunk to fixed line communications data centre services and enterprise solutions with revenues of rs 4 684 crore in fiscal 2018 a far cry from the rs 19 000 crore logged in 2008 market capitalisation a measure of the company size and shareholder appeal has plunged from a peak valuation of rs 1 65 917 crore in january 2008 to just over 1 per cent of that value at rs 1 687 crore on february 18 2019 over the cliff the total worth of reliance group companies has eroded dramatically in the past decade total market cap of the top 5 reliance group companies in rs crore source ace equity the combined valuation of anil s listed firms stood at rs 24 922 crore as on february 22 2018 by comparison mukesh s reliance industries limited ril had a market cap of rs 7 70 592 crore on february 18 last year rcom said it will exit the telecom business but on february 2 this year it shocked investors by proposing a debt resolution plan to the national company law tribunal nclt and said it expected substantial unsustainable debt and liabilities to stand extinguished under the nclt process shares of rcom plunged 48 per cent and six other firms of the group also saw their shares plummet anil alleged that two of rcom s 11 lenders l t finance holdings and edelweiss had illegally sold some of the group companies shares pledged with them triggering a domino effect he later reached an in principle standstill understanding with more than 90 per cent of the lenders who agreed not to sell any of the promoters pledged shares till september 30 this year giving group firms a reprieve leading to an uptick in their share prices advertisement meanwhile anil had to face the ignominy of being threatened with a jail term by the supreme court on february 20 over the rs 550 crore he owed rcom s one time vendor ericsson for the managed services the swedish firm provided its telecom business the apex court said that anil and two directors reliance telecom chairman satish seth and reliance infratel chairperson chhaya virani had to pay rs 453 crore the remainder after part payment earlier to ericsson india in four weeks failing which they could be jailed for at least three months rcom is expected to use income tax refunds of around rs 400 crore in its account to make the payment the warring inheritors the rise and fall of one of india s most talked about businessmen in a little over a decade is a textbook study on how unbridled ambition spreading oneself too thin in business and high leveraging of debt to fuel expansions can bring down business empires especially if the business environment also turns adverse when dhirubhai ambani father of mukesh and anil died intestate after a massive stroke in july 2002 the rs 28 000 crore business empire he had built over 25 years and which had made him a darling of the capital markets following ril s public listing in 1977 looked set to move seamlessly into the hands of his two sons advertisement the two had shared responsibilities when the senior ambani was still chairman after he died mukesh a chemical engineer with a management degree from stanford became ril chairman and anil an mba from wharton its managing director the brothers were expected to run the business together it was their father s legacy after all one built from scratch by dhirubhai once a petrol pump assistant in yemen through a series of backward and forward integration moves in petrochemicals reliance became the country s largest manufacturer of fibre a raw material for the textile industry however it soon became clear that the transition from deceased father to sons would be anything but smooth the first signs of discord between the brothers appeared in early 2005 with a section of the media reporting without giving names of an impending split in the family the spat between the brothers continued until their mother kokilaben stepped in and brokered a peace pact in april 2005 supported by external negotiators such as chartered accountant s gurumurthy and banker k v kamath advertisement as per the agreement made public again on a sunday the petrochemicals business under reliance industries would go to mukesh while the telecom business which mukesh had nurtured so far would go to anil the brothers also signed a no compete agreement mukesh would not enter the telecom business while anil would steer clear of energy and petrochemicals overweening ambition anil s flamboyant ways were evident right from the time he took charge as chairman of the reliance anil dhirubhai ambani group or r adag it was later renamed the reliance group but the former acronym stuck in mainstream media more media savvy than his brother he addressed press conference after press conference again mostly on sundays with elan savouring the media attention he received the joke doing the rounds then was that anil would call a presser to announce even a new product addition to his telecom business getting his executives to make elaborate presentations on announcements that could have been faxed or e mailed to journalists the fact that he flew in his helicopter from his south mumbai home to the dhirubhai ambani knowledge city in navi mumbai a few kilometres away twice a week was just one of the things his admirers would gush about his proximity to bollywood celebrities such as amitabh bachchan and politicians such as samajwadi party leader amar singh would make tongues wag anil s political connections were seen in a bad light by the larger public especially his proximity to the controversial singh says an industry observer anil was always drawn to bollywood right from the time he wooed the then leading actress tina munim and married her in 1991 it was not surprising then that one of his expansions was in the entertainment business through a tie up with hollywood filmmaker steven spielberg s dreamworks studios making films for the global audience anil also bought multiplex chain adlabs from entrepreneur manmohan shetty for rs 350 crore in 2005 becoming the largest multiplex owner by 2008 with 700 screens in india and abroad the most risky investments he made however were in power and infrastructure driven by cheap capital in the 2000s a host of businessmen including gautam adani the ruias of essar hyderabad based businessmen g m rao of gmr group and g v k reddy of the gvk group and the tata group were driving huge investments in these sectors aggressively bidding for new projects not to be left behind anil secured three of the major ultra mega power projects auctioned by the government in 2008 and 2009 at sasan in madhya pradesh tilaiya in jharkhand and krishnapatnam in andhra pradesh meanwhile reliance infrastructure was bidding for projects in railways power and roads cash hungry businesses nothing describes anil s current predicament better than the words of his counsel mukul rohatgi on his behalf during the ericsson hearing in the supreme court this february no one likes to lose his company unfortunately rcom has fallen on bad days i tried to save it but couldn t rohatgi told the court now it s up to the irp interim resolution professional who will be appointed for the insolvency process i am like any other person who has lost his company rohatgi read out from his client s statement even as the younger ambani stood and watched the proceedings his lawyer seemed to be making a case for him to be seen not as someone who squandered away his wealth but one who was a victim of an adverse business environment where a range of external factors from stiff competition to betting on the wrong technology to an economic slowdown had gone against him observers say anil was prone to taking up capital guzzling projects immediately after the family split his decisions did not come out of a carefully crafted strategy they were driven by ambition charges a stock market analyst who did not wish to be named it was fashionable to bid for huge projects which were financed by public sector banks psbs at the behest of politicians says another observer coming before the economic slowdown that followed the crash of lehman brothers in 2008 businesses were in a mood to splurge over acquisitions and expansions both at home and abroad however the environment would see a sea change after the slowdown psbs that had amassed huge non performing assets after indiscriminately bankrolling infrastructure and power projects were reluctant to fund the sectors any more even as many projects turned non starters owing to land acquisition issues or problems with fuel linkages for power plants towards the end of the second term of the upa government nearly rs 2 lakh crore worth of projects were stuck after the bureaucracy went into a policy logjam following the 2g spectrum controversy in which the then telecom minister a raja of the dmk was accused of out of turn allocation of spectrum to many companies some with no experience in the sector and coalgate where similar charges were made regarding allocation of coal mining rights anil too was drawn into the 2g accusations with the cbi questioning him in 2011 amid allegations that raja favoured his group on dual technology permits and rcom s association with swan telecom which was being investigated for alleged diversion of funds to kalaignar television owned by the dmk as if all this were not enough anil entered into a long drawn legal battle with mukesh over the price of gas from mukesh s oil fields in the k g basin to fuel anil s proposed 4 000 mw power plant in dadri uttar pradesh in 2010 the apex court ruled that the two brothers renegotiate the family deal and gave the government control over setting the gas prices the new contract had to abide by a government price of 4 2 per million metric british thermal unit mmbtu compared with 2 34 per mmbtu for 17 years the brothers had agreed on in 2005 observers say that besides sending the wrong signal to the international community regarding the pricing of natural resources the legal spat deepened their estrangement in 2014 anil withdrew from the dadri project citing issues in obtaining land and gas supply although the media savoured anil s occasional unions with mukesh be it at business conferences or at family functions including the most recent wedding of mukesh s son akash ambani with shloka mehta daughter of diamantaire russell mehta mukesh apparently never forgave anil the legal spat so when the non compete clause was scrapped in may 2010 mukesh wasted no time entering the telecom business starting with the acquisition of infotel broadband in 2010 for rs 4 800 crore mukesh laid the foundation for what would be the biggest disruption ever in the telecom space with its superior 4g technology backed by 2 7 lakh kilometres of fibre optic lines jio s entry in october 2016 shook up all incumbents rcom airtel and vodafone an agreement to buy anil s telecom business was seen as a positive gesture from mukesh but the way mukesh allowed the deal to fall through by refusing to be a guarantor for his brother s dues again demonstrated his tough stance on business relationships with anil mukesh will not even offer a straw to bail out anil says an analyst the case of siblings reuniting in indian business families is very rare he says adding that the rivalry goes beyond the brothers and deeper into the family anil s habit of seeking legal recourse at the drop of a hat has made him enemies outside his family too he has issued several lawsuits worth thousands of crores including defamation suits against journalists and analysts apart from litigation on the business front wrong number what went wrong with rcom when it started out as reliance infocomm in 2002 it chose cdma code division multiple access an emerging technology that promised similar output to the gsm global system for mobile platform used by rival operators such as airtel and hutchison max however cdma was limited to 2g and 3g second and third generation telephony when the tide turned in favour of 4g in india and 5g for the future rcom began to lose out with the company now planning to exit telecom the group will focus on real estate enterprise business and the submarine cable unit global cloud xchange we have decided we will not proceed in this sector many other companies have taken a similar call this is very much the writing on the wall anil told rcom shareholders at its 14th annual general meeting in september 2018 as we have moved out of the mobile sector we will monetise our enterprise business at an appropriate stage reliance realty will be the engine of growth for the future of this company this includes monetising 30 million square feet of commercial space at dakc the latest trigger for rcom s troubles was the failure of a potential deal anil struck to sell the telecom assets to mukesh s reliance jio for rs 18 000 crore the deal collapsed after the department of telecommunications insisted that jio accept rcom s arrears too which jio was unwilling to do in a statement rcom said despite the passage of over 18 months lenders have received zero proceeds from the proposed asset monetisation plans and the overall debt resolution process is yet to make any headway accordingly the board decided that the company will seek fast track resolution through nclt the debt pile up cornered in his telecom business and challenged by a tough business environment in his other ventures anil had no option but to start selling assets he was forced to consider selling off reliance power assets because huge projects worth thousands of crores were left hanging fire either for lack of financial closure or availability of raw material the firm s 24 000 mw of power generation plants are shut due to non availability of gas investments to the tune of nearly rs 1 2 lakh crore are stuck anil told reliance power shareholders in september 2018 the defence business he entered in 2015 by buying pipavav defence and offshore engineering for rs 2 082 crore is mired in controversy the opposition congress has accused anil of having unduly benefitted in the 8 billion rafale fighter jet offsets deal the only business that seems to be doing relatively well is the financial services business under reliance capital consisting of firms dealing with asset management life and general insurance home finance and wealth management the real trouble started around 2014 when the group companies began to feel the brunt of its gargantuan debt total group companies debt stood at rs 1 72 lakh crore as on september 2018 it then began to sell off assets and sometimes entire businesses in august 2018 reliance infrastructure which had prestigious projects including the airport express metro corridor in new delhi under its belt sold the mumbai city power distribution business to fellow industrialist adani for rs 18 800 crore this transaction was expected to bolster reliance infra s financials by repaying part of its over rs 23 000 crore debt although reliance power had been awarded contracts to build three plants it could build only one at sasan in mp it has argued in the courts that it needs permission to mine more coal for the project without which it may incur losses and may have to abandon the project in 2014 reliance entertainment sold its once acclaimed multiplex chain big cinemas to pare its debt queries sent to the reliance group on group companies plans to pare debt and their future outlook went unanswered all the company would share was a press release on rcom about its standstill agreement with lenders mentioned earlier what next did anil s companies suffer business downturns or were they mismanaged observers believe both these factors were in the mix they also spoke of a lack of vision and focus if you have a really deep vision you keep things coming and want to keep yourself liquid enough for the next step of investment and participation in business says consultant ashvin parekh most of the businesses anil inherited were cash hungry ones and demanded complete innovation and investments on a periodic basis that is particularly true of telecom for financial services it is a story of leveraging and the quality of your portfolios mukesh on the other hand has not only kept a deep focus on his core businesses but also added energy retail and telecom over the years creating a business behemoth through a disruptive process he has also surrounded himself with close aides and trusted profes sionals including manoj modi nikhil and hital meswani sons of rasiklal meswani a founding director of reliance industries and p m s prasad each business has its own challenges says shriram subramanian founder and ceo of ingovern a proxy advisory firm there have been sectoral issues in power and infrastructure but there was also unbridled ambition and growth plans that came to nought when funding came easy group companies raised huge debts but they were unable to repay them as businesses faced slowdowns today cash is hard to get making doing business all the more tough subramanian explains what next for anil ambani where does he go from here subramanian feels there will be a consolidation within the group some of the other firms that are doing badly reliance infra and reliance power may meet rcom s fate and opt for the insolvency route he says some others including asset management firm reliance nippon life asset management have better prospects ahead but prospects can change and anil who brought in his elder son anmol as a director at the financial services business in 2016 will have to ensure that he is both nimble and circumspect in grabbing the next big opportunity that comes his way
this article was originally published on etftrends com by nottingham advisors the 35 day us government shutdown that ended on january 25th skewed much of the economic data that came out in february

moved marginally higher 4 8 basis points in a roughly parallel shift the minor inversion putting the 12 month treasury yield slightly higher than the 2 3 and 5 year yields became less pronounced as the 12 month yield stood still as those around it rose the greater concern lies with a possible inversion of the 2 year yield vs the 10 year yield or even the 3 month yield vs the 10 year yield it has not occurred in this cycle to date and we have moved slightly away from the possibility with the 2y10y curve steepening back to almost 20 basis points vs 10 bps at year end the longer portion of the

cogwriter voice of america reported the following russia slams hypocrisy of new western sanctions russia on saturday slammed the hypocrisy of new western sanctions against its officials over their role in a naval confrontation with ukraine last year and vowed to respond to the unfriendly move the united states canada and the european union friday slapped new sanctions on more than a dozen russian officials and businesses in response to moscow s continued aggression in ukraine the pretext for including our countrymen in the illegitimate sanctions list of the eu astounds with hypocrisy and cynicism the russian foreign ministry said in a previous statement late on friday it said russia will not leave the unfriendly act of the eu without a response and accused brussels of siding with kyiv on the eve of its presidential election due on march 31 it cannot be ignored that the decision came not long before the presidential election in ukraine it said it also accused washington and ottawa of russophobia and said the sanctions will not lead to the results the u s and canada want a u s treasury statement friday said six russian officials six defense firms and two energy and construction firms had been targeted either over the seizure of ukrainian vessels in the kerch straight last november or for their activities in russian annexed crimea or separatist eastern ukraine the u s sanctions freeze all property and interests in property belonging to the designated individuals and entities and prohibit u s persons from transacting with them four of the individuals are border guard or coast guard officials singled out for their role in a november 25 2018 naval confrontation in which russian ships fired on and seized three ukrainian vessels in the narrow kerch strait the two countries share the four were targeted jointly with the eu and canada according to the state department twenty four ukrainian crew members were detained in the naval incident in the statement on saturday russia said its border guards were bravely fulfilling their duty to defend the state borders of our country and that the confrontation was the result of a provocation by the ukrainian side it said moscow was acting within the norms of international law in arresting the ukrainians russia has said the sailors will go on trial for violating its maritime borders they face up to six years in prison for illegally crossing russian borders lawyers have said russia has apparently expected this as the following from two days ago indicates 14 march 2019 leading russian banks are working on plans to help each other retain at least short term access to the global financial system in the event that they are hit by fresh u s sanctions sources familiar with the matter told reuters sberbank vtb gazprombank and others are examining how they can provide each other with access to u s dollars or other major foreign currencies by using so called correspondent accounts the sources said banks access financial services in different jurisdictions and provide cross border payment services to customers in various currencies through correspondent banking relationships the new scheme which banks started to draft with russia s finance ministry and the central bank last year would be unlikely to work indefinitely but could help avoid a panic if one or several big banks are cut off from dollar transactions the russians also have their own alternative to swift in place now last fall russia encouraged foreign banks to use it russia welcomes foreign banks to join its money transfer alternative to swift october 19 2018 foreign banks will soon be able to become part of russia s money transfer network which serves as an alternative to the traditional swift society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication system non residents will start connecting to us this year people are already turning to us said first deputy governor of the central bank of russia olga skorobogatova earlier the official said that by using the alternative payment system foreign firms would be able to do business with sanctioned russian companies as of september 416 russian companies have joined the system for transfer of financial messages spfs including the russian federal treasury and large state corporations including gazprom neft rosneft and others the central bank said the potential exclusion of russia from swift worried the country s banks in 2014 when the eu and the us introduced the first round of international sanctions against moscow over alleged involvement in the ukraine crisis and the reunification with crimea swift has said it remains neutral in the political conflict there have been reports that despite such claims the us has enough power to block transactions through swift swift is a financial network that provides high value cross border transfers for members across the world it is based in belgium but its board includes executives from us banks with us federal law allowing the administration to act against banks and regulators across the globe notice also that the europeans are also working on an alternative to swift the internationally acknowledged banking center has joined the voices from across europe about creating an independent analog for the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication swift amid us anti iran sanctions russia which has already created its own system voiced readiness to cooperate within a euro swift system swiss ambassador to moscow yves rossier has affirmed that his country can join other states in setting up an independent alternative the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication swift if there are any new developments in the financial sector we will closely monitor them but this is clearly a matter for reflection in the eu not in switzerland but if a new payment system appears every country will take part in it including us of course why not the diplomat told sputnik the german government is working together with the eeas and european commission as well as france and the united kingdom on maintaining financial payment channels with iran the spokesperson noted adding the negotiations on this are intensive and ongoing there are different models under consideration cited by politico russia ready to join russian finance minister anton siluanov commenting on the recent statements has expressed moscow s readiness to cooperate within some kind of euro swift system to process operations among european banks and financial institutions including oil and other resources payments we are ready to join such offers that s why it seems to me that this would be a way out and response to these restrictions the us is imposing on companies and financial institutions using dollars for settlements he told the russian broadcaster rossiya 24 the brussels based international interbank payment system swift created in the 70s is now used by nearly 11 000 organizations in more than 200 countries criticized for sharing some information with the us government following the 9 11 attacks the system in 2014 stated that it s been put under pressure by some countries insisting on its joining the sanctions against russia 10 05 18 brussels and european union states seem ready to stage a battle with washington over an obscure but important financial service network against europe s own interests the looming brouhaha concerns swift swift is particularly prone to u s pressure because the american financial system looms so large in the world swift s board includes representatives of european and american banks and many messages across its network travel to or from the u s some europeans believe washington wields too much influence over a network they think should operate on a multilateral consensus like a financial eu 10 17 18 notice also two headlines from a while back germany urges swift end to us payments dominance 08 27 18 eu looking to sidestep u s sanctions with payments system plan currently the usa benefits from most international trade as most of the time nations use us dollars for trade every time a nation stops doing that or reduces doing that it has a negative effect on the economy of the usa as i have written before there is a price to pay for us sanctions and they do affect the dollar world events continue to confirm items posted here as well as in our videos here are two such videos a recent headline was is trump pushing germany to russia there have been comments by german and russian leaders that they have aligned interests that donald trump opposes and need to take financial military and other steps to assist europe russia and the eu european union still support the iran nuclear deal paris climate accords and the world trade organization despite donald trump s actions against them have there been comments to replace the usa s swift system by the russians and germans what is russia s mir payment system what about talks for the eu to have trade and other arrangements with the eaeu eurasian economic union did the old radio church of god foretell of the development of a russian and german plan to eliminate the usa has russia indicated that it wants alaska back is the giving of usa territories to russia by a coming european leader consistent with a prophecy in the book of daniel here is a link to our video is donald trump pushing europe to russia furthermore china also has been trying to come up with systems including with gold backing to avoid the us dollar watch us dollar being challenged by gold petro yuan the usa has been pushing countries away from its currency and while the europeans joined in these sanctions many in europe do not like this and believe that the us has pushed them into sanctions against russia and iran usa sanctions are pushing the gentile nations to come up with something that the usa will not like the russians called us actions hypocritical the bible tells of destruction coming to an hypocritical nation isaiah 10 6 kjv the usa does not seem to realize that it is undermining its position as the world s primary reserve currency through its sanctions and other policies this is an unintended consequence of us sanctions policies the bible points to the end coming to the usa cf daniel 11 39

u s review economic data reinforce fed patience several indicators released this week signaled a moderation in the pace of economic growth and provided further reinforcement for patience from the fed on further monetary policy tightening retail sales rebounded in january but the gain wasn t enough to completely wash out the weak readings in december suggesting a slow start to the year for consumer spending prices continue to increase only modestly and with core inflation measures at or near the fed s target of 2 increased risk of a break out to the upside remains limited economic data reinforce fed patience several indicators released this week signaled a moderation in the pace of u s economic growth and provided further reinforcement for patience from the fed on further monetary policy tightening the week opened with the january retail sales report which showed a bounce back in consumer spending after what was the worst month for retailers since the great recession stripping away volatile components food autos gas and building materials the control group measure fared even worse in december declining 2 3 or the largest monthly decline since 2000 given that this measure is a good proxy for the goods portion of personal consumption expenditures in the gdp report the 1 1 rebound in january calmed fears of a prolonged retrenchment in spending that said while we suspect the weak december was due to transitory factors q1 spending is dented december a key shopping period for consumers was plagued by a market sell off which cramped consumer confidence and reduced household wealth but with financial markets having regained all of the ground they gave up in december and confidence measures trending higher spending doesn t appear to be falling off a cliff but it will be weaker in the first quarter prices data for february remained more or less in check the consumer price index edged up in february but lower energy prices over the past year have held down the headline index on a year over year basis with core inflation running at a 2 1 annualized pace over the past three months and on a year overyear basis the underlying price trend remains at the fed s target suggesting there is little need from an inflation perspective for it to move swiftly on further rate hikes in last week s payroll report we learned that average hourly earnings hit a new cycle high in february but such heating labor costs have only modestly passed through to consumer inflation stronger productivity growth and historically high profit margins present some scope for companies to eat

core ppi inflation moderated to 2 3 year over year the recent trend here has remained consistent with that seen from consumer prices and further affirms that a renewed gain in inflation remains

the fomc to have altered its stance since then financial conditions have eased further but a number of other cross currents chair powell noted have not abated core inflation has eased up a touch and inflation expectations have edged down the labor market remains tight but initial jobless claims and payrolls suggest it is improving at a slower pace headwinds from overseas persist with signs of global growth slowing further next week s meeting will include updated economic projections we anticipate estimates for gdp growth and inflation will be revised down a bit the fed s markedly more

has lost some momentum in recent months the index has virtually stalled since september including an unchanged reading in january we expect to see a modest increase in february however more building permits higher equity prices stronger capital goods orders and a rebound in consumer expectations should all add to the index partially offsetting those gains however look to be fewer hours worked in the manufacturing sector alongside a pullback in the ism new orders index even with a gain in february the lei points to slowing growth in the economy as fiscal stimulus wanes and monetary policy

over in 2018 but we expect to see the start of a modest rebound in february mortgage rates have come down about 50 bps since last november helping buyers on the affordability front home price growth has also been moderating while stronger wage growth has narrowed the gulf between costs and income already there are signs of demand picking back up pending home sales which lead existing home sales by one to two months jumped 4 6 in january while mortgage purchase applications have risen since the fourth quarter winter is a slow season for the housing market which generates the possibility of seasonal factors exaggerating february s print as a result we do not expect this month s existing home sales to have much bearing on the fed in isolation but will offer another clue as to how much

its december fall but it is unclear how long that growth pace will persist the u k parliament voted this week to delay the brexit date extending uncertainty and likely pushing back bank of england hikes u k starts strong in 2019 but will it continue after a subdued finish to 2018 the u k economy started 2019 on a stronger footing this week s january gdp figures showed the economy grew 0 5 month over month more than reversing the 0 4 decline from december the key services sector which accounts for the majority of u k economic activity rose 0 3 while the monthly increase in gdp was also helped by a 0 6 gain in industrial output and a 2 8 gain in construction output on an annual basis gdp growth firmed to 1 4 year over year in january from 1 0 in december however we believe it is unlikely the u k economy will sustain this strong pace of growth through the early part of this year in fact just this week u k lawmakers voted to request an extension to the deadline for the u k to formally leave the european union it s not yet assured whether that extension will be approved by the other european union countries and in any event it simply prolongs the current uncertainty as a result we have pushed back the timing of our bank of england rate hike by one quarter to q3 2019 and q1 2020 bank of japan keeps monetary policy on hold the bank of japan once again held monetary policy steady this week keeping its policy rate at 0 10 and maintaining a target for 10 year japanese government bond yields of around 0 with an unchanged tolerance band in fact with japan s economic backdrop still relatively subdued we no longer expect the central bank will adjust monetary policy in a less accommodative direction in the second quarter although we still expect the government to proceed with its consumption tax increase in october as scheduled the mixed nature of japan s activity data offers a good indication of why we believe the central bank will keep monetary policy on hold japan s core private machinery orders slumped 5 4 month over month in january not exactly an encouraging sign for business capital spending see middle chart the tertiary industry index a measure of service sector activity did rise 0 4 in january but that did not fully reverse the 0 5 decline from december with cpi inflation still well short of the bank of japan s goal we expect monetary policy to stay on hold for some time china hard data hard landing the first hard activity data for china relating to 2019 were released this week and although they point to a continued slowdown they do not in our view point to a chinese hard landing january february retail sales rose 8 2 year over year matching the consensus forecast and in line with the annual growth rate from december 2018 industrial output for the first two months of the year rose 5 3 not only a downside surprise but also below the 5 7 year over year gain from december the relative stability in retail sales along with the gradual slowdown in industrial output suggests that china s economic slowdown should remain orderly especially given continued monetary and fiscal policy support for calendar 2019 we expect a modest slowdown in china s

for uncertainty surrounding the u k s exit from the european union to dissipate following this week s political developments that uncertainty has not yet lifted and is still not clear whether a brexit

economy grew at just a 0 7 annualized pace in h2 2018 with manufacturing especially soft and the service sector also subdued against that backdrop the european central bank made a dovish shift at its march announcement saying interest rates would remain at low levels for longer and announcing a new round of targeted long term loans in this environment the eurozone pmi surveys are being particularly closely scrutinized for clues on the path of the economy february was a mixed bag with the manufacturing pmi falling further to 49 3 but the services pmi rose for the first time in five months to 52 8 the march figures could offer insight on whether that was temporary relief or a sustained improvement the consensus expects the services pmi to ease to 52 7 while the manufacturing pmi

a trend that we believe will continue with the february reading we expect headline inflation to firm slightly to 1 6 year over year comfortably within the bank of canada s 1 3 target range meanwhile measures of core inflation are likely to remain just below 2 where they have been for the past several months although the bank of canada seems comfortable with recent inflation outcomes economic

view interest rate watch fed balance sheet comes into view in addition to the updated economic and dot plot projections expected from the fomc next wednesday policymakers may also provide some additional color on the outlook for the fed s balance sheet thus far much of the focus has been on when and at what size the balance sheet unwind will conclude based on our analysis and reading of the tea leaves we believe this has already been more or less established while the exact timing is unclear we believe the fed will likely stop shrinking its balance sheet at some point later this year however there are still several outstanding questions that need answers first after the unwind comes to an end will the fed immediately begin growing its balance sheet again over time the fed s balance sheet should grow in line with its major liabilities namely currency in circulation and bank reserves that said some participants have suggested that the fed could hold the size of the balance sheet steady for a period of time allowing them to patiently monitor whether reserves have truly reached a level that is no larger than needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively second the composition of the balance sheet going forward remains unclear will the fed continue to allow mortgage backed securities mbs to roll off and if so at what pace if mbs continue to roll off as we expect the fed will need to begin buying a healthy chunk of treasury securities both to replace mbs and to account for organic balance sheet growth this then raises yet another question where along the treasury curve will the fed buy in our view the most market neutral approach would be to buy in proportion to how the treasury is issuing on a net basis which at the moment is roughly 30 t bills and 70 notes and bonds these questions are in addition to several other issues under consideration at the fed such as potentially introducing a standing repo facility or adopting a new main policy rate such as the overnight bank funding rate a close relative of the fed funds rate while we doubt all of these issues will be addressed in full at next week s meeting there will likely be plenty to digest credit market insights china still buying u s cre china remained a net buyer of u s commercial properties in 2018 despite a popular narrative of rapid divesture amidst an escalating bilateral trade dispute and broader restrictions on outbound chinese capital to be sure chinese sales of american properties shot up over 200 in 2018 to 8 1 billion and purchases fell over 50 yet with purchases still totaling 11 2 billion china remained a net investor the united states remains the favored destination for chinese investment despite government efforts to regulate and divert the flow of funds elsewhere the economic outperformance of the united states relative to the rest of the developed world over the past couple of years as well the expectation for 2019 and ongoing strength in cre fundamentals have kept demand for properties buoyant moreover the relative stability of the united states amidst slowing growth in the eurozone and japan and a trade exacerbated secular slowdown in china bolster the attractiveness of u s cre as a store of value for now china continues to buy u s properties fears of widespread disposals potentially as one front of a trade war have not been fully realized rapid chinese selling of u s treasuries causing yields to spike has also not occurred a potential trade deal still not quite in the offing should loom over any potential cross border investment decision for the foreseeable future topic of the week could the fed go negative our forecast for the u s economy does not currently include a recession any time in the near future but when the next downturn comes around fed policymakers are likely to reassess their toolkit for stimulating economic activity could negative interest rate policy nirp become part of that toolkit in the next downturn central banks in other major developed countries have implemented nirp in recent years including the eurozone i e the ecb denmark japan sweden and switzerland in general these countries have seemingly had mixed success with negative rates but the purported downside effects have also not been all that significant let us start with the effects of nirp on the banking sector in theory negative interest rates could be passed on to consumers and lead to large scale deposit flight but in practice deposits have been stable in countries employing nirp meanwhile bank profitability and lending activity do not seem to have been meaningfully hampered by the implementation of negative rates in other countries money market mutual funds mmmfs have also seemingly not been significantly harmed or disrupted despite concerns over the theoretical impact of negative rates on fund inflows finally nirp has in general not seemingly led to bubble like behavior in financial markets and in areas where asset prices have become frothier amid negative interest rates authorities have responded with policies to discourage speculative activity and contain price appreciation in short nirp does not seem to have the degree of negative impact on the economy that theory suggests yet the efficacy of negative rates in other countries is far from clear as economies in the eurozone japan and switzerland that have implemented negative rates continue to struggle with lackluster rates of economic growth and lingering deflationary concerns thus the fed may be hesitant to implement nirp unless the next downturn is particularly severe and moreover policymakers may employ other policies such as qe in conjunction with nirp to jumpstart the economy
it was a battle of the bands for the fate of the bolivarian revolution billionaire richard branson founder of the massive multinational virgin group ltd squared off against embattled venezuelan president nicolás maduro last month with a spectacular venezuela aid live concert in colombia to contest a benefit concert held by the venezuelan government on the same day among the wealthy businessman s distinguished concert going guests was none other than juan guaidó maduro s rival guaidó s bizarre exit from venezuela while he was also trying to take it over in a foreign backed coup underlines the absurd scrambling of national borders wrought by the histories of colonialism capitalist imperialism and neoliberal globalization boredom however is a bourgeois privilege branson s mega concert was nothing other than a skirmish in a border war defined by the projects of neoliberal expansion in latin america in this context borders obstruct flows of human capital and they can be selectively activated or deactivated for the flow of commodities e g using sanctions trade agreements etc in order to maximize private profits by supporting guaidó s self proclaimed presidency and by assisting the u s in its efforts to force aid into the country branson continues to play the role once assigned to him by margaret thatcher the little tsar of neoliberalism this time on a global tour the rise of branson and punk brandon was unofficially appointed little tsar of britain in the 1980s he rose to prominence by capitalizing on the disaffection and rebelliousness resulting from years of austerity and social atomization distilled in punk subculture his label virgin records made a statement by signing controversial bands such as the sex pistols and its stores became popular hangouts for hippies and rockers to burn their discretionary time smoking pot and ingesting new music the culture industry s commodification of punk proved a profitable means of containing the otherwise diffuse dissent of a working class haunted by a loss of social cohesion by 1984 the contradictions of culture and class in the u k were so intense that the airwaves were split between thatcher s battle against the nationwide miners strike and billy joel s live at wembley in june frankie goes to hollywood s two tribes started a nine week stay on top of the u k singles charts just two days before the famous battle of orgreave saw a violent clash between over 6 000 police and 5 000 picketers outside a british steel corporation coking plant in south yorkshire only the very wealthiest could afford a cosmopolitan interest in rock or pop while caribbean rhythms remained more popular among the masses police repression was the cornerstone of thatcher s strategy for dealing with the strike coupled with the double imperative to stockpile as much coal and to keep as many miners at work as possible yet the destruction of the miners and with them the wrought iron ruins of the postwar consensus was only the most media visible of the pacification strategies kapital was deploying and in many ways the least significant wrote mark fisher the late writer and cultural theorist also known as k punk punk in britain was born as the reaction of a highly developed urban working class to the flight of its industrial backbone amid the implementation of new international export markets and global supply chains this created a new class of workers paradoxically defined by lack of work that is by consumption rather than productivity british youth had more discretionary time precisely because they possessed fewer economic opportunities boredom however is a bourgeois privilege frustration and anger were more characteristic responses from an alienated urban working class to the shrivelling up of the local industrial economy in its inception punk in britain was as much an opposition to authority as it was the expression of a deep dissatisfaction with the emerging economic configurations punk comes late to venezuela punk in latin america on the other hand emerged in a more complex fashion both independently of and in response to punk as it is often framed it took off in the 1970s in countries such as mexico and argentina where relatively higher levels of economic development allowed for the existence of a minority of young people wealthy enough to travel and bring back influences from abroad less developed countries such as venezuela had fewer cultural contagions trickling down to the working class from abroad only the very wealthiest could afford a cosmopolitan interest in rock or pop while caribbean rhythms remained more popular among the masses drugs were quickly stamped out due to the extreme militancy of the left permeating the punk scene at the same time punk music began to take shape in latin america during the 1970s as a response to shared histories of exploitation and repression u s imperialism and foreign backed dictatorships brazil mexico colombia and argentina each of which had active circuits in the early days of latin american punk all share such histories of course this is a truism in latin america where almost every country has been subjected to the destructive foibles of u s imperialism at some time or another under the pérez dictatorship 1952 58 in venezuela the strong gdp growth buoyed by a petroleum based export economy exacerbated existing economic inequality poor and working class venezuelans eventually saw dividends in the form of increased social spending throughout the 1960s and 1970s especially on health care transportation education and food programs however the overreliance on oil caused a complete reversal in the country s economic fortunes once prices collapsed in the 1980s causing mass inflation and social upheavals over the course of the decades to come this collapse was the result of a crisis of overproduction in the newly globalized oil sector which ensured both that venezuelans would lack any real political or economic sovereignty over key national resources and industries and that the venezuelan economy would remain precariously overdependent on oil and foreign investment thus venezuelans were in the midst of an economic upsurge at the time that punk was taking off in other latin american countries venezuelan punk got off to a slow start the first punk festival in venezuela was held in caracas in 1983 featuring bands like la seguridad nacional national security enigma pp s el oso william bear william and dead feeling the first foreign punk or metal band to play in the country was garrote vil based out of barcelona in 1996 fighting the system and each other yet the lack of an economic basis analogous to that which gave rise to punk in the u k and elsewhere didn t mean that venezuela was without its own proto punk influences la seguridad nacional formed in 1979 is considered to be the pioneer of punk in venezuela taking their name from that of the militarized police force under pérez they surrounded themselves with an aura of rebellion scandal and excess their sound was experimental with tones ranging from hardcore what members of the group referred to as organized noise or anarcho porno to post punk the group recorded only a single album together documento de actitud document of attitude in 1991 but continue to be regarded as underground pioneers of punk in the country having paved the way for the first wave of venezuelan punk bands in the 1990s first wave punk bands in venezuela mostly coming out of east caracas formed much in the same way as those in countries like mexico and argentina had in earlier decades youth who had the means to travel were the first to become aware of the punk genre and the first to be able to buy musical instruments and practise with them ultimately the projects of neoliberal expansion stifled punk in venezuela at the same time that the music was growing in popularity in neighbouring countries and abroad precisely by keeping the country underdeveloped and heavily repressed punk music was typically a response to various forms of repression as seen in the u k but it still required enough economic development in the country for there to be a significant proportion of the working class with both an interest in culture and subcultures and sufficient free time to be able to pick up musical instruments and learn a few chords it is easy to see how the rhetoric surrounding humanitarian aid obfuscates that it is only intended as aid for global financial markets not venezuelans if punk in venezuela struggled to be born against the unlikely odds of economic underdevelopment and political repression then it would take a decidedly different shape than its counterparts by the end of the 1990s drugs were quickly stamped out due to the extreme militancy of the left permeating the punk scene and punks who attended university during the 90s participated in clashes against the police over the implementation of neoliberal economic reforms known as the caracazo uprisings in one such clash on june 2 1992 josé gregorio romero known by the alias flecha was killed by police flecha was later memorialized in a song by the same name written by oktavo pasajero fewer subcultures under the punk umbrella existed in venezuela due to the diminutive stature of the scene but those that did exist punks skinheads metalheads and goths los darks expended nearly as much energy on music as they did fighting each other veiling personal conflicts with thin ideological justifications because the scene remained small and tainted by infighting punk in venezuela naturally failed to manifest any substantial political opposition at the cultural level obviously punk music doesn t lead directly to political opposition vis à vis working class consciousness but one can still compare the combined and uneven development of punk in the u k and in venezuela as an instructive example of how class consciousness stuttered and started to develop in countries across the world through and against the projects of neoliberal expansion and the left wing governments supposed to serve as a bastion against them in the early 90s punk militancy fluctuated from support for the marxist leninist parties to insurrectionary anarchism by the end of the decade and after hugo chávez won power in 1998 many former punks who had been chavistas began working for the state chávez s government even started to promote its own punk shows with security provided by the military flying in the face of its diy culture and anti state tendencies this cooptation of punk subculture by the governing forces would seem to many to be nothing short of a cruel joke aid and economic warfare while there is certainly something punk about venezuela s staunch opposition to u s imperialism and neoliberal globalization matters aren t so simple as to be able to say that the maduro regime is punk while branson and his ilk aren t indeed the attempted cooptation of punk by the chavistas is in many ways a warped reflection of the very same tack that made branson famous and famously wealthy above all neoliberalism requires consensus against this punk manifests as a radical dissensus in a world where everything political is depoliticized in the name of the economy which is governed by rational calculation punk is the ineliminable anger that festers the more it is systematically ignored in the decisions made by technocratic elites as fisher argued the proletariat is the disgruntled scream or fuzz of a distorted guitar in an otherwise noise free polis when it moves it creates waves of interference in the form of positive feedback loops that resonate through the destruction of existing systems like the eardrum splitting wail of a guitar pickup run back through an electric amplifier above all punk is a cry of creative affirmation which threatens to cancel all systems of power degradation and economic exploitation as things stand currently guaidó is back in venezuela where he has incited further anti government protests by cynically taking advantage of the recent blackouts in the country while colombians and venezuelans may dance to the same rhythm they remain a people divided by the contradictions of the capitalist system ultimately from the neoliberal perspective it doesn t really matter who s in power so long as the country remains in a state of permanent instability rather than needing to put troops on the ground in order to extract oil for the global market the u s can simultaneously conduct economic warfare while pilfering profits from pdvsa venezuela s state owned oil and natural gas company using sanctions pdvsa accounts for about 95 per cent of the country s national revenue since u s sanctions its exports have plummeted by 40 per cent while 7 billion in u s assets owned by the company remain inaccessible with a projected 11 billion loss over the next year it is precisely this kind of warfare that has plunged the country into such a deep economic crisis furthermore these tactics are continuous with decades of devastating policies imposed on the country by the projects of neoliberal expansion taking this into account it is easy to see how the rhetoric surrounding humanitarian aid obfuscates that it is only intended as aid for global financial markets not venezuelans to hear a new sound branson is a seasoned veteran in the manipulation of such rhetoric just weeks before venezuela aid live he gained plaudits in the mainstream media for stating his support for progressive taxation however his home in the british virgin islands is a recognized tax haven branson has often touted an employees first policy for his businesses but the business model for virgin group ltd has been to seed competition in key industries under the virgin brand before flipping those companies and licensing rights to the very domestic competitors whose industries those companies were ostensibly intended to disrupt and the elders a human rights organization was born partly as the result of conversations in the 90s between branson nelson mandela and peter gabriel critically speaking the organization s animating ideals are not the advancement of human rights but rather the substitution of anger by expertise of mass forms of political organization by technocratic elitism characteristic of the neoliberal model today the punk thing to do would be to follow bolívar s example the respective concerts held by branson and the maduro regime in colombia and venezuela respectively played out as a virtual who s who of artists intersected by the national and ideological contradictions that have long scarred the landscape of latin america while colombians and venezuelans may dance to the same rhythm they remain a people divided by the contradictions of the capitalist system before the era of u s imperialism simón bolívar liberated the colonies of venezuela bolivia colombia ecuador peru and panama from the spanish empire today the punk thing to do would be to follow bolívar s example not by falling on either side of national borders or post ideological political ideologies but by calling for their dissolution punk points us beyond the political oppositions of the day by refusing to accept the conditions presented by each side of a given power hierarchy whether capital and the working class or peoples on either side of a national border the promise of punk today is to see past the impasses of the end of history to hear a new sound in the anarchic noise and screams of an absolute dissatisfaction a possible space of creativity or organization

yves here this post on the green new deal highlights an issue that hasn t come close to getting the attention it warrants the operational and organizational demands however it s odd that the author does not consider revenue sharing a program launched by that great american socialist richard nixon nixon believed that the federal government was better at collecting taxes but states and local governments could often spend money better by virtue of being closer to needs in their communities and often having smaller and therefore less costly bureaucracies by rob macquarie an economist working on the financial system and its links to sustainability democracy and inequality he tweets rjmacquarie originally published at opendemocracy thanks to the formidable advocacy of alexandria ocasio cortez the idea of a green new deal has attracted widespread attention on both sides of the atlantic billed as a new national social industrial and economic mobilization on a scale not seen since world war ii it is perhaps unsurprising that critics have focused on the price tag in response many green new deal proponents cite the ideas of modern monetary theory mmt although mmt has been quietly growing in prominence for many years the school of thought s association with the green new deal has propelled it into the limelight mmt holds that money is a creature of the state and that a sovereign government with its own currency and central bank faces no financial constraints on spending other limits do exist most notably inflation but also political and administrative constraints but money itself is no object mmt scholars contend that the green new deal is a perfect opportunity to mobilise underused resources through deficit spending simultaneously transforming the economy and improving living standards they pour scorn on those who argue that we can t afford a green transition as robert hockett a professor at cornell university has argued where were the pay fors for bush s 5 trillion wars and tax cuts or for last year s 2 trillion tax giveaway to billionaires mmt also recognises the links between climate change and inequality and suggests that a smarter approach to public spending can combat both in particular a job guarantee whereby the public sector will employ anyone willing and able to work at a fixed wage alleviating unemployment and insecure work is associated with several prominent mmt thinkers in britain the labour party is developing its own plan for a green transition rebecca long bailey the shadow minister for business energy and industrial strategy recently announcedan unprecedented call for evidence on how a surge in green investment could help local communities and economies in recent months labour has come under increasing pressure to embrace mmt thinking but while mmt offers an empowering narrative its insights must be accompanied by some pragmatism a successful green transition will require much more than increased government spending and there is no escaping hard choices towards a new political economy in order to succeed any green new deal must be rooted in good governance but there is currently a gap in political economy terms between the idea that the state can centrally fund the green transition and an emerging consensus that viable sustainable societies of the future will be characterised by a broad distribution of power and resources the task of commandeering the fiscal power of the nation state while also responding to local needs gives rise to a number of practical challenges one of these relates to taxation from an mmt perspective tax destroys money by taking it out of the economy changes to taxation levels are thus the preferred policy lever with which to manage demand and control inflation however taxation also serves many other purposes which it would be naïve to think will always align neatly with controlling inflation richard murphy a member of the original british green new deal group and one of the main uk based proponents of mmt describes several functions for tax including penalising bads redistributing income and wealth and improving democratic representation in practice policymakers may find it difficult to harmonise these different functions of taxation while also funding a just and sustainable transition for example a high and consistent carbon price will likely be needed to disincentivize polluting activity even while the state undertakes a vast public works programme to build alternative energy systems taxation of dirty vehicles will be required to incentivise people to switch to electric consumption taxes will need to be carefully calibrated to reduce our over use of resources without popping the consumer credit bubble our economy currently relies on careful institutional design will be required to ensure that these trade offs are managed while inflation is controlled this is just as important as mmt s central observation that the state can always pay its debts but thinking around these institutional questions is far less developed secondly there is the issue of how mmt might work with theories of democracy and ownership an area of particular interest to the labour leadership several different concepts of the role of the state have been discussed in the context of the sustainable transition writing in the new statesman the journalist paul mason has argued that for a post capitalist economy to take off it has to work as spontaneously as the market does this requires the state to be an enabler and rule setter for a diverse ecosystem but for the transition itself especially if driven by mmt style fiscal policy the state will need to take on a more commanding role which mason forebodingly terms capitalist stalinism these are radically different modes of governance and striking a balance or transitioning between them will pose major challenges for our democratic system those advocating an activist role for central government must be candid about its limitations and could seek lessons from distributed energy and participatory budgeting thirdly a green new deal is often presented as an exercise in coalition building with the state sitting at the centre the ocasio cortez resolution calls for transparent and inclusive consultation collaboration and partnership with frontline and vulnerable communities labor unions worker cooperatives civil society groups academia and businesses careful thought must be given as to how these seemingly diverse priorities and interests can be balanced building a coalition involves compromises and the experience of other european countries is instructive in france the gilets jaunes are a recent exampleof what can happen when climate policy is badly designed having first mobilised in order to protest new fuel duties it is at least conceivable that a similar backlash could make it politically difficult for a government trying to implement a green new deal to raise taxes to control inflation germany has had greater success with its renewable policies for instance by allowing households to profit by selling excess energy back to the grid nevertheless it has unfortunately struggled to uproot the last vestiges of coal power from its energy network today german coal jobs are relatively few but their existence is inconsistent with achieving paris consistent decarbonisation crucially however they are well unionised a fact that highlights how the interests of trade unions and the sustainable transition are not perfectly aligned it also remains unclear how exactly a federal job guarantee can be reconciled with empowering local communities if central government guarantees a job for a newly unemployed coal plant worker might that worker be forced to move to a region or locality where there is spare capacity in say retrofitting other people s homes does the final say over how real resources are allocated as opposed to financial resources rest with washington or whitehall with local authorities or with worker owned local businesses and how might the scheme as a whole respond to a reduced working week finally the rediscovery of the state s spending power does not mean green campaigners can forget about private investment hyman minsky whom many mmt scholars cite as a key influence went to great lengths to emphasise the importance of private finance writers like robert hockett uphold that legacy today but this is often lost in tit for tat debates about public debt although many activists highlight the role that private finance plays in carbon capitalism often the contribution it must make to turbo charging a green transition is overlooked globally the task of greening private finance lies with the taskforce for climate related financial disclosures central banks and financial regulators are currently mulling proposalsto ask firms to release information about the risks they face from climate change more and better information should help markets allocate investment more efficiently a green new deal platform would be more credible and more likely to succeed with a plan to map and leverage the power of private investment flows in the uk the labour party could state its intention to make disclosure of climate related risk mandatory for all reasonably sized firms at a particular date in the near future however central banks are rightly cautious over the financial risks posed by both sides of the climate investment dilemma while carbon intensive stranded assets could result in large financial and economic shocks rapidly increasing green investment produces risk in the form of unproven technologies and business models an mmt inspired plan to bring the federal reserve or bank of england under direct government control will merely shift responsibility for this delicate balancing act overall current plans for a green new deal leave many questions unanswered even when we acknowledge that financing is no barrier critics are queuing up to dismiss the deal as a utopian idea that doesn t address real world trade offs it s up to us to prove them wrong
with more than two years of largely futile in fighting agonising and speculating behind it britain is set to leave the european union in two weeks time those who encouraged this look on uneasily recklessly and with false promises they uncorked the bottle and released the brexit genie meanwhile the remainers prepare to flee or brace themselves to face a future at best uncertain at worst catastrophic a crypto communist government waits in the wings looking for an opportunity to seize power this near catatonic state of national navel gazing is dangerous it must stop and it needs leadership and purpose to stop it i cannot do much about the need for leadership but i can encourage a sense of purpose if britain could only wake up to its strengths the international respect in which it is held its historic role as a counter balance to an over mighty european power its leading position in nato its language its rule of law its convenient location on the greenwich meridian and its currency then it could regain its status as a leading world power while simultaneously increasing its importance in preserving the peace and enhancing the prosperity of the european continent did i say currency am i suggesting that the pound sterling a currency historically prone to devaluation and weakness is a strength yes i am and i will explain why at the end of world war ii the british pound was second only to the us dollar as a global reserve currency a collection of countries as diverse as iran and australia including much of the african continent and the middle east and even parts of southern europe all linked their currencies directly to the pound this system was known as the sterling area within it all currencies were freely convertible to sterling at fixed exchange rates it lasted for 30 years and was abandoned in 1972 when it proved unequal to the oil price shocks of the time how is this relevant today well i suggest that with the united states turning in on itself and germany increasingly dominant in continental europe many countries seek a third alternative the dollar works for the americas yes but not worldwide the euro which is little less than the old deutschmark in different guise may be suitable for france germany and benelux but it hinders many less prosperous european countries britain and its pound sterling offer the perfect compromise for let us not think that all is well in the euro block greece malta cyprus italy portugal and ireland are all suffering various degrees of economic discomfort caused by the traditionalist dirigisme of the european central bank certain countries including poland have wisely stayed out of the euro but let s be honest the polish zloty hardly qualifies as a global currency confidence breeds confidence a confident britain attracts investors who appreciate its natural and historic advantages none of the countries i have mentioned is a natural ally of germany folk memories are long and friends beyond their immediate borders are needed this is where britain comes in for a country and its currency to prosper it must be confident confidence breeds confidence a confident britain attracts investors who appreciate its natural and historic advantages brexit has induced a worrying pessimism a brexit brought on not by underlying weaknesses but by knaves making a trap for fools to quote from kipling s if even so i suggest there would have been no brexit had germany not frightened many uk voters by its uncontrolled admission of approximately one million refugees in 2015 and had weaker eu members like austria cyprus and malta all historically hostile to the ottoman but fearful of the franco german axis spoken out and nailed the lie that turkey would soon be joining i was sorry britain voted to leave the eu but that is in the past now it is time to seize the opportunity to restore britain to its position as the great european alternative in the words of winston churchill we should brace ourselves to our task not thankfully to wage war nor to sit around in a welter of moping self pity but to restore the nation s status as a great liberal economic powerhouse leading our historic european allies attracting investors from worldwide and providing them all with a safe stable alternative a relaunched sterling area with the member countries of southern europe exiting the euro in favour of resurrected national currencies new drachmas liras escudos pesetas and so on linked to and supported by the british pound could be the key to this with the new sterling area resolutely economic and non political dare i suggest that even turkey could be a candidate for membership some readers will dismiss this idea as unworkable ridiculous or even a spoof unworkable possibly ridiculous or a spoof it is neither we live in a time of fracturing conventionality orthodox thinking is increasingly challenged extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures the crowns

officer thank you jen good afternoon everyone we delivered our third consecutive quarter of enterprise level comparable sales growth with second quarter comp up 2 while we were pleased with continued traction at the enterprise level performance was again mixed across our portfolio our premium segment continued its momentum with double digit comp sales supported by key growth initiatives our value segment while still operating at an unacceptable level of profitability delivered operating income improvement for the year ago period for the first time since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 unfortunately setback at our plus and kids segments this past quarter and we must deliver more consistent execution to get enterprise financials back to levels that we consider appropriate we experienced loss of 0 26 per share which was in line with revised guidance we issued at the icr conference in january we remain on track with all cost takeout and capability building components of our change for growth transformation program we expect to realize 300 million in run rate savings by this coming july and continue to aggressively roll out capability enhancements marketing and merchandise planning functions to drive top line and margin rate improvement the third and most critical component of our transformation program is growth from our core we have made progress here over the past three quarters but february performance was very challenging and as a result we are well off our planned trajectory for top line growth while we believe the challenging selling environment is a result of macro headwinds also impacting others in our sector our third quarter outlook represents an unacceptable profit shortfall to the expectations we shared at the beginning of our fiscal year as a result we are working to accelerate plans that were already in development to take much more fundamental action to address our cost structure as part of our overall transformation work we continue our efforts to explore opportunities to sell third party services on our platform we have completed our internal readiness review and are fully prepared to support external relationship that we are working to develop over the coming quarter securing third party relationships will reduce the cost base for our brands while allowing us to diversify our sources of revenue additionally we have identified plans for an incremental 150 million in savings beyond our existing change for growth program target which will help drive operating margin rate expansion our objective is to maintain a cost control program that is able to offset inflationary pressure on an ongoing basis to allow flow through on top line growth and protect our profitability when macro challenges arrive while we expect near term conditions will improve as the customers shift their mindset this spring we are acting with the appropriate sense of urgency to implement our new cost takeout activity and accelerate realization of savings near term we are committed to getting ascena s financial performance back on track and continue to explore opportunities within our portfolio that can allow us to focus capital and management attention on those brands that we believe can deliver sustained growth and profitability by maintaining a differentiated position in the marketplace with that i ll hand things over to gary to discuss key developments across our brand portfolio gary gary muto president and chief executive officer thanks david the second quarter represented another strong quarter at our premium segment loft delivered double digit comp sales and merchandise market growth with comp growth in both its bricks and mortar and direct channels growth was driven by average dollar sale with strong product acceptance resulting in increasing both average selling price and units per transaction transactions were up low single digits for the quarter driven by the direct channel and specifically the new loft outlet site which is approaching high teen penetration less than one year after launch at loft we benefited from our warehouse winter strategy and we saw strength across more categories most notably in sweaters dresses and denim we continue to learn and refine loft s newly launched plus assortment based on initial store pilot this past season we remain optimistic that the plus offering represents a meaningful growth opportunity at loft going forward ann taylor also delivered double digit comp sales and margin growth for the quarter with comp growth driven by its direct channel strong assortment performance resulted in increase in both average selling price and units per transaction transaction growth was driven by the direct channel and specifically the new ann taylor factory type which has achieved mid teen penetration less than one year after launch while product acceptance had been broad based we are specifically pleased with our performance in our tops dresses and petite categories moving on to justice and lane bryant we were extremely disappointed with performance at both brands this past quarter at justice we believe the issues are short term in nature but the impact was significant this past quarter our apparel assortment continue to resonate through the second quarter with apparel comp sales up 4 and while our specialty assortment delivered flat comps for the quarter it experienced significantly high clearance selling which hurt overall margin we made some overly aggressive chase decisions in september when the brand was delivering double digit comp sales and traffic growth and as a result we were overbought in specialty inventory and the liquidation is highly seasonal assortment had a greater impact than expected impact than expected on margin we took action post holiday to deal with the overbuy and exited to the second quarter in good shape from an inventory carryover standpoint looking ahead to spring we are pleased with initial reads we are seeing from our new fashion assortment in some warmer weather regions at lane bryant the issues are a bit deeper as i mentioned last quarter we have been addressing lane bryant s market positioning since this past summer we are rolling out new brand marketing that highlights the core attributes we need to build upon and become famous for with our existing and potential customer base lane bryant must enhance its emotional connection with the core customer and get credit for its functional benefit instead our new brand positioning and marketing is targeted to address these priorities moving forward specific to the assortment performance we had a significant fashion miss in our kohl assortment starting with our september tops delivery and performance continues to erode as we move through our second quarter candidly our team missed the appropriate edit point for our customer we took fashion a step too far and overdesigned many of our tops we cannot have these misses go forward and have instituted new product hardware while tops underperformed we continue to build on strength in dresses and denim which comp positive in the second quarter we expect the top assortment performance will improve as we move deeper into spring aside from the apparel challenges at lane bryant performance at cacique was also down for last year reflecting the current dynamics in the intimate sector we low performance in more basic part of our bra assortment which was the largest contributing factor to our negative comps we are effectively working to adjust and shift our inventory toward more differentiated fashion which has seen stronger performance in parallel we ve expanded our bra offering online and now have an inclusive range covering band sizes 32 to 50 and cup sizes a to k we believe cacique represents a meaningful long term growth opportunity and are investing incremental marketing dollars to expand awareness and drive customer growth on a stand alone basis and finally at our value segment while the new dressbarn leadership team has delivered improved year on year performance the brand is operating at unacceptable level of profitability due to the significant new leverage from fiscal 2018 we are exploring all options to address the overall level of brand profitability including various customer contact and promotional strategies along with additional cost takeout maurices delivered a modest positive comp for the quarter on the back of very strong e commerce performance which was up 24 coming out of the summer season we made adjustments to our assortment strategy to narrow its waist count and increase inventory depth in and saw improvements in both average selling price and unit velocity these positive developments were mostly offset by continued store traffic headwinds we continue to test new promotional strategies utilize our loyalty program and leverage localized online marketing to mitigate through a traffic decline as david referenced a moment ago quarter to date performance has been challenging across our portfolio we are taking what we believe is a prudent approach by not aggressively promoting in low traffic environment which we ve been experiencing we are adjusting our forward promotional strategies to maximize our opportunity in high sales period close and anticipate we will see a balance in overall traffic as the customer mindset shifts to spring we are disappointed with our performance out of the gate in february but we are focused on maintaining the momentum we have at loft and ann taylor getting justice back on track and at lane bryant with that i ll hand it off to brian for a brief update on our transformation work brian lynch president and chief operating officer thanks gary and good afternoon everyone we are nearing the end of the change for growth transformation program and are focused on delivering the final components of our road map namely our localized planning to build on customer experience management ecosystem markdown optimization and size and pack optimization are fully implemented at all brands localized planning is going well at our premium and kids segments and we are rolling out to the plus segment next month we remain on course with development of our customer experience management ecosystem as we completed foundational customer data and analytics work this spring the new enterprise marketing tool set including workflow as well as asset and campaign management capabilities will be implemented in all brands by the end of the calendar year enabling wise messaging and at scale and more effective use of our marketing dollars we have seen our new loyalty program at justice drive incremental sales and we are scheduled to launch programs in our plus and premium segments in april and may respectively we believe delivery of the remaining capabilities from our transformation program road map will help our brands gain share in an increasing fragmented competitive space one industry macro issue that had been moving has been getting inventory through our ports of long beach new york and new jersey as many companies rush to get merchandise from china into the u s before tariff increases went into effect combined with timing of chinese new year as a result we have had to expedite transportation from port to our distribution and fulfillment centers this pressure has continued into the early part of the third quarter but we are seeing conditions begin to improve during this period we have incurred additional expense to ensure delivery of goods in support of floor set timing at our brands we are continuing to explore strategies to more proactively mitigate these challenges using a dynamic delivery metrics going forward including options such as expedited vessels we are on track to realize our 300 million cost takeout figure and are developing further structural cost initiatives for fiscal 2020 and beyond to improve profitability we have line of sight to an additional 150 million in targeted areas including expansion of our fleet optimization program demand management for non merchandise spend and operating model efficiencies across the organization our goal is to improve profitability with these meaningful cost takeouts as david commented earlier we are acting with the appropriate urgency to implement and with that here is robb robb giammatteo chief financial officer thanks brian and good afternoon everyone please note that the comments on this call will reference non gaap results which exclude restructuring expenses in the extra week recorded in the year ago period at our segment that affect year on year comparability in addition there were two timing related items in our results that affect year on year comparability but are included in our non gaap results first the 53rd week in our prior fiscal year which moved a low margin clearance to our fiscal second quarter this year and second adoption of the new revenue recognition standard which changed the timing of private label credit card revenues across this fiscal year consistent with past practice we have posted a supplemental earnings package to our ir website and attached it to our 8 k to provide additional context on performance for the quarter i will reference this document in my prepared remarks and may reference it as well during q a turning to results our second quarter loss of 0 26 per share resulted from merchandise margin rate erosion at our plus and kids segments 53rd week timing shift partially offset by flow through of positive comp sales growth slide 10 of our supplemental slide package presents operating income loss versus year ago period for reference enterprise comps were up 2 driven by average dollar sale total transactions were essentially flat to last year with 17 transaction growth in the direct channel offset by a 4 drop in store count second quarter direct penetration was approximately 35 of net sales reflecting an approximate 4 percentage point increase from fiscal 2018 driven in part by the new digital channels for ann taylor factory and loft outlet total revenue was essentially flat to the year ago period with comparable sales growth and benefit related to the new revenue recognition standard offset by a lower store count resulting from our fleet optimization work and the unfavorable impact of the 53rd week timing shift gross margin rate of 52 2 was down 190 basis points last year caused primarily by justice comps where an overly aggressive chase strategy in specialty goods required significantly higher markdowns to right size inventory levels remainder of the rate decline was caused by product acceptance challenges at lane bryant along with an increased freight expense resulting from higher direct channel penetration across all brands these factors were partially offset by a rate improvement at dressbarn which was up 270 basis points from last year operating expense of 837 million was down 5 million or 0 6 for the quarter reflecting transformation related savings from store closures mostly offset by inflationary pressure channel shift and investment in growth initiatives specific to our transformation program we ve realized 26 million in savings in the second quarter driven by fleet optimization savings and it efficiencies touching briefly on our fleet optimization program we ended the second quarter with 4 486 stores reflecting 110 net closures in the quarter turning to our balance sheet we ended the second quarter with 215 million in cash and cash equivalents and total debt of 1 372 billion representing the balance of our term loan our next scheduled amortization payment is not due until november 2020 and our asset base revolver was undrawn at quarter end between revolver availability and cash we had 595 million in liquidity at quarter end regarding our capital structure net debt was 2 9 times trailing 12 month ebitda and our trailing 12 month ebitda is 4 2 times our annual interest obligation from the capital allocation perspective we continue to believe debt reduction is the best path to generate shareholder value at this time and are exploring options to maximize the impact related to potential use of current balance sheet cash and remaining fiscal 2019 free cash flow on our existing capital structure at the total company level we exited the second quarter with inventory of 693 million which was up 15 from the year ago period approximately half the increase was caused by floor set timing receipt flow related to the 53rd week shift and the impact of new revenue recognition guidelines excluding these items inventory levels were up approximately 7 inclusive of higher all season stock levels supporting key denim and bra launches please reference slide 5 of our supplemental slide package for additional inventory details capital expenditures for the second quarter were 34 million turning to our performance to date has been challenging and we are currently operating with reduced forward visibility on sales trends due largely to what we believe are macro factors impacting the general retail environment as with past practice we typically guide comps based on our trailing 13 week trend however given the slow start to the quarter we are basing guidance off quarter to date actuals and the trailing 13 week trend for the remainder of the quarter this framework does not contemplate any favorable trend change in april and we believe it represents an appropriately conservative stance based on current conditions our outlook translates to an expected third quarter loss of 0 35 to 0 45 per share supported by the following assumptions net sales of 1 43 billion to 1 46 billion with comps sales down 4 to down 2 the decline in net sales is expected to be generally in line with comp sales decline with the unfavorable impact of ongoing store closures mostly offset by the beneficial impact of the 53rd week shift detail related to the impact of the 53rd week by quarter throughout fiscal 2019 is highlighted on slide of our supplemental earnings package gross margin rate of 57 to 58 with the midpoint down approximately 120 basis points from the year ago period the planned rate reflects merchandise margin rate erosion resulting in the february selling across our portfolio and expectations for continued headwinds from the channel shift toward direct these factors are expected to be offset in part by normalization of rate at our value segment driven by planned improvement at dressbarn which was down over 800 basis points versus historical levels in the year ago period expense growth of approximately 4 reflecting inflationary pressure initiative spending and channel shift partially offset by store closures and transformation related savings and the third quarter comparative will be negatively impacted by the reversal of incentive compensation accruals in the year ago period which depress the prior year base for full year fiscal 2019 we continue to expect operating expense will be flat at 1 key assumptions related to our third quarter guide are presented on slide 9 of our supplemental slide package third quarter earnings will be favorably impacted by the timing shifts related to the 53rd week in our prior fiscal year and the impact of the new revenue recognition standard together resulting in an approximate benefit of 18 million in operating income versus the year ago period this benefit is more than offset by the combined impact of our negative comp outlook lower gross margin increased operating expense due to reduced visibility of current trend we are not issuing full year guidance at this time for reference our current guide through the third quarter would translate to a year to date loss of approximately 0 60 compared to a 0 10 loss that was reflected in our original annual guidance for the first through third quarter period with most of that shortfall coming in the third quarter the decline versus our original guidance for the first through third quarters is primarily related to lower than expected performance at our justice and lane bryant brands in conclusion while we believe the recent slowdown in trend is largely macro related we are aggressively managing the items within our control our ongoing cost takeout activity has allowed us to continue to invest in key areas across our portfolio while offsetting inflationary pressures and we are accelerating activity in this effort to recover from what we believe is a near term pocket our transformation efforts have created a more capable enterprise and we now must deliver sustained comp growth across our brand portfolio to leverage our leaner cost structure that concludes our prepared remarks we ll open it up for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of susan anderson with b riley fbr your line is now open susan anderson b riley fbr analyst hi good evening thanks for taking my question nice to see the good performance at ann taylor and loft i guess i wanted to maybe touch on justice i think that the underperformance there was mainly related to overinventory on the accessories part but i guess maybe if you could touch on just the apparel and how that performed in the fourth quarter and going into first quarter and then if you re seeing any impact at all from the gymboree liquidations which maybe a little bit younger there but just curious if you re seeing anything there gary muto president and chief executive officer yes it s gary i mentioned the apparel comp was plus 4 in the quarter so we were fairly pleased with the progress that we re making there as far as the impact of gymboree we really haven t seen anything i would say current outlook i think it s just been very uneven there s just been a whole kind of just drop in store traffic we ve experienced across our entire portfolio so we remain cautious for the outlook of the season we believe that hopefully will improve as spring break starts to happen and we get closer to easter susan anderson b riley fbr analyst got it and are you expecting the inventory mix between apparel and accessories to be more balanced in first quarter is it going to take longer than that to get the proper balance there gary muto president and chief executive officer we took all our or we corrected all our inventory issues in the quarter susan anderson b riley fbr analyst got it ok that s helpful and then i guess yes so just i m not sure if i heard you right but did you say the third quarter to date trends really the weaker trends there are mainly coming from justice and lane bryant or is it did you see kind of a drop off across all the formats gary muto president and chief executive officer we ve seen a drop off across the entire portfolio david jaffe chief executive officer we still see the premium brands are still outperforming the legacies but there s step down across all the portfolio its traffic base susan anderson b riley fbr analyst got it ok and then i guess just from what you could gather i think a lot of retailers have seen a slow start to the quarter but do you think it s weather related macro i guess meaning tax refunds or is there do you think there s a bigger broader theme going on there with the slowdown in consumer spending david jaffe chief executive officer susan i think it s all of those things and probably more the late easter i think does have an impact as well and until we get to warmer weather and easter we re not really going to be able to tell if there is an across the board slowdown in consumer apparel spending so right now we re just going to wait and see susan anderson b riley fbr analyst got it ok and then one last one if i get through in there on lane bryant i guess just curious on your thoughts you guys are obviously rolling out plus size to your other formats including ann taylor and we re seeing a lot of your competitors also roll out plus size so i guess how do you compete with the lane bryant s format in just as much more highly competitive environment now going forward gary muto president and chief executive officer this is gary what we ve seen with loft the rollout of loft is that loft while we ve seen success in loft we ve really seen it around fashion print and pattern and that customer to be their reaction to the product is very much how the loft customer reacts to the product i think lane bryant s customer is lane bryant s customer clearly there s a lot more competition out there but we ve seen success in bottoms specifically denim and in pants and in dresses we have a top assortment issue that i believe a good portion of that was self inflicted by us not really being clearly understanding what our customer wanted from us we re taking quick action to remediate that but we feel very confident that we will get that business back on track susan anderson b riley fbr analyst got it ok great thanks so much good luck next quarter david jaffe chief executive officer thanks susan operator we have a question from the line of steve marotta with cl king associates your line is now open steve marotta cl king and associates analyst good morning everybody i just oh good afternoon excuse me robb i have one quick question for you i want to put a finer point on the comparable store sales guidance for the third quarter down 4 to down 2 you re saying that that is based on quarter to date actual as well as the trailing 12 week trend and doesn t account for any acceleration over the next six weeks is that accurate robb giammatteo chief financial officer so that s correct the 13 week trend for the go forward period and by default that except that is ignoring the recent challenges in february right so february has been down mid single digits and our trailing 13 week trend was i believe around 1 so by default we are assuming things get better but we were not assuming a step change in april above that run rate steve marotta cl king and associates analyst ok can you please remind us what i know you don t give monthly comps but maybe if you can directionally talk a little bit about march april of last year just specifically march and april of last year robb giammatteo chief financial officer so march and april last year steve represented about 75 of the quarter steve marotta cl king and associates analyst and what was the again i know you don t give monthly comps but can you talk a little bit about

there is a certain trend of opinion amongst the liberal left particularly in the us which never felt very comfortable with the bolivarian revolution now in the midst of a serious and well organised attempt by washington to remove maduro s government they insist on equally blaming both sides for the crisis one which in their view can be resolved through negotiations between the government and the opposition a chief representative of this point of view is gabriel hetland who has written several articles on venezuela for the nation jacobin and other left wing publications his latest article venezuela s deadly blackout highlights the need for a negotiated resolution of the crisis sums up this argument neatly so it is useful to analyse it in some detail the article is full of inaccuracies and half truths but its main flaw is a mistaken analysis of the situation in venezuela one that avoids a class approach to the different forces involved from which hetland derives a completely utopian solution the devil s in the details let s start with some of the factual inaccuracies the caption of the picture illustrating the articles reads people collect water from a leaking pipeline along the guaire river the same line is then used within the article for effect it is false during the blackout there was lack of water supply as a result people resorted to collecting water from springs coming down the avila mountain some of these springs are canalised and then end up in the guaire river people were collecting water from two such springs on the side of the guaire not from a leaking pipe water pipes were actually not carrying water this might seem like a small detail but it has a certain importance the headlines in many of the newspapers claimed people were collecting water from the guaire river itself which is extremely polluted el nuevo herald in miami said desperate venezuelans collect rotten water in the midst of blackout the mass media exaggerates and sometimes publishes straight lies in order to fit into a narrative of harrowing crisis in venezuela in order to justify the need for foreign intervention or in any case regime change hetland is not new to this business and should know he needs to check all the details he uses in his story another one in the opening paragraph of his article hetland seeks to draw attention to how bad and long lasting the blackout was he does mention how power was intermittently restored on sunday and monday in parts of caracas and elsewhere but then ends the paragraph with a mention of the new york times headline with the new york times on monday publishing an article titled no end in sight to venezuela s blackout experts warn what s the conclusion he wants the reader to draw that the blackout is far from over in fact we don t know when power will be restored at all there is just a small detail it does not coincide with the facts by midnight 11 march power had been restored in merida zulia and táchira the last remaining states affected by the blackout hetland s article carries the date of 13 march when the blackout was already over and there were only a few smaller towns left affected in paragraph two hetland states the most alarming aspect of the blackout is the lack of power in hospitals of course the lack of power in hospitals is alarming and very dangerous however all hospitals in the country have their own independent power generators that activate in the event of an emergency a report by the opposition aligned ngo médicos por la salud published on 11 march in the evening a list of all 32 of the country s hospitals with a detailed explanation of their situation in all of them their own power plants were working with the exception of one where it was working intermittently heltand then adds to be blunt people are dying and more will die the longer the blackout continues to back up his assertion he links to a reuters report which quotes from medicos por la salud saying that 17 people have died as a result of problems with electricity supply when you then look at the ngo s own report the picture is less clear in the report about the state of hospitals which i quoted above of the 32 hospitals listed all bar two are marked as no deceased and the other two account for a total of three people dead in a separate report by the same ngo about the number of people who died during the blackout 24 are listed but no details are given as to the causes of death so these could be people who would have died regardless of the blackout again this might seem a small detail but details are important because they are what build a story a story can be constructed in two ways one would say hospitals dealt with the blackout by using their own emergency generators which greatly minimised the dangerous impact of lack of electricity the other says the most alarming aspect of the blackout is the lack of power in hospitals to be blunt people are dying and more will die you are more likely to write the second if you rely largely or solely on material from reuters and other such agencies and you are also more likely to stray from the truth what caused the blackout of course heltand s article is built around the blackout and so an explanation of the causes for it should be given what does he tell us about it he starts by saying there are two competing narratives a word i particularly hate but neither he goes on does justice to venezuela s reality in heltand s opinion the blackout and the broader crisis are not entirely the fault of maduro nor of the united states and the domestic opposition the urgency of the situation demands recognition of shared responsibility for the crisis heltand s article is built around the blackout and so an explanation of the causes for it should be given but he doesn t provide one image telesur but then hetland states that only the most myopic analysis could ignore the government s clear responsibility for the perilous state of venezuela s electric grid and goes on to give as an example the scandal of the tacoma hydro plant a project that was never finished as a result of corruption even here he gets some facts wrong by using a report that is now outdated however the question is how does a non functioning power plant relate to the current blackout everyone government and opposition agrees that something went wrong inside the control centre for the el guri hydro complex the dispute is about what caused the fault the opposition says it was a wildfire under the main high power line out of el guri while the government claims it was a cyber attack affecting the scada system that regulates the plant which produces 80 percent of venezuela s power what is heltand s opinion about this he does not say though he of course mentions the possibility of a cyberattack quoting an article from forbes he does not go into any of the details and his conclusion is clear available evidence suggests that the blackout was not caused by sabotage but by the electric grid being pushed to the brink by years of increased use and a lack of investment and maintenance available evidence perhaps heltand knows more than everyone else because so far neither the government nor the opposition have provided much if any evidence to back up their stories their arguments are mostly based on circumstantial evidence the opposition has not provided any evidence of the mysterious wildfire that they say affected the 765kv power line and then caused the el guri system to shut down which should be relatively simple if such a fire had occurred furthermore guaidó rejected the idea of a cyber attack as he alleged that the el guri hydro complex was controlled analogically something that is a straight lie all of these things are being widely discussed in venezuela with claims and counter claims being made heltand ignores all of this and simply claims that available evidence suggests that the blackout was not caused by sabotage without even mentioning what is this available evidence he bases himself upon or providing any useful links as a reference in fact he has already decided on an explanation that fits his narrative and has written a story that ignores the available evidence just to cover himself after having declared what the cause of the blackout is he adds getting to the bottom of the blackout is important journalists based in venezuela should investigate the possible causes yes mr hetland getting to the bottom of the blackout is important jumpìng to conclusions based on preconceived ideas does not help journalists based in venezuela have already done a very good job of attempting to establish what actually happened and this article in 15 y último is perhaps one of the best efforts it was published on 11 march two days before hetland s article was published in the nation the path of negotiation however the main problem with heltand s article lies in the conclusions he draws calls for military intervention must be rejected one must recognize however the untenability of the status quo the combination of maduro s repressive and inept rule and debilitating us sanctions has brought venezuela to the edge of catastrophe the longer the situation continues the worse things will get yes on one thing we can certainly agree the situation in venezuela is bad and has significantly worsened over the last four or five years but what is the plausible path for resolving venezuela s crisis that he proposes first of all he accepts the premise that a peaceful transition needs to take place and this must be through free and fair elections here we see how our liberal critic in fact accepts all of the premises of regime change on which us imperialism bases its current assault on venezuela washington too says it is for a peaceful transition and above all for free elections in fact this is precisely what nominally they are trying to achieve with their policy of diplomatic pressure sanctions and the threat of military intervention hetland therefore assumes without explaining why that the presidential elections in 2018 were not free and fair and that therefore maduro is an illegitimate president otherwise why should there be new elections when he was just sworn in in january our liberal friend finds himself firmly in the camp of the venezuelan opposition and us imperialism his disagreement with imperialism seems to be just tactical he does not think that this outcome can or should be achieved through sanctions or military action he seems to will the ends but not the means how does he think this can be achieved then the only real hope for venezuela s future is the path of negotiations between the government and the opposition this is completely utopian and ignores venezuela s recent past in fact over the years there have been many negotiations between the government and the opposition the current attempt by imperialism is not the first already in april 2002 the opposition carried out a us backed coup barely three years into the chavez government when president chavez was returned to power by a mass movement of the poor what did he do he called on the opposition to the negotiating table how did they respond by immediately starting to prepare for another coup this time in the form of the sabotage of the oil industry and a bosses lockout which lasted from december 2002 until february 2003 and nearly crippled the economy the opposition does not want negotiations they want to crush the bolivarian revolution by any means necessary if they think they can achieve this via negotiations they will not object as long as their objectives are guaranteed hetland says the only real hope for venezuela s future is the path of negotiations between the government and the opposition this is completely utopian image flickr the white house the most recent attempt at negotiations was the 2016 17 talks in the dominican republic brokered amongst others by the former social democratic president of spain zapatero the main demand of the opposition in those talks was precisely free and fair early presidential elections when it seemed that an agreeable compromise had been reached and even a date for the elections had been fixed then the opposition under pressure from bogotá and washington decided to walk out of the talks zapatero was fuming and he advised the government to go ahead with the elections on the agreed date the election in which a section of the opposition led by henri falcon participated did take place maduro won and zapatero who acted as an observer vouched for the process but all of this appears to be a closed book to hetland and who is the government supposed to negotiate with throughout his article and in other writings hetland insists on establishing a difference between radical sectors of the opposition or sectors of the far right opposition and the opposition as a whole in practice on the ground such a difference does not exist the current coup attempt led in venezuela by guaidó is backed by all the opposition parties represented in the national assembly the 2016 violent riots which hetland mentions in his article were also part of a joint and united campaign by the opposition as a whole the bulk of the opposition under pressure from washington boycotted the presidential election and expelled henri falcón from the mud democratic unity roundtable for taking part in it in any case how are these negotiations going to happen the government has said repeatedly that it is prepared to negotiate even with trump but the opposition has rejected any advances hetland suggests that perhaps the eu s international contact group could make this happen this is either naïve or seriously dangerous the main eu countries are completely subordinate to washington s strategy on venezuela it was spanish president sanchez who issued an eight day ultimatum to maduro to call presidential elections he was then joined by france the uk germany and the majority of eu members who went on to recognise guaidó as the legitimate president of venezuela the icg was only created in order to destroy mexico s independent initiative to find a negotiated solution when the icg representatives arrived in montevideo the uruguayan government under pressure abandoned its independent position and left mexico on its own you cannot have half a revolution to add to hetland s mythical unicorn of a democratic opposition he then adds that once the us is removed from the equation how by whom then we can hope hope springs eternal in the liberal breasts for a growth of a much broader opposition movement one in which the voices of the popular classes could have much more weight this is perhaps the crux of the matter the main problem in hetland s approach is the lack of any discussion of the class nature of this conflict the venezuelan opposition and behind it washington represents the interests of the country s oligarchy the rich and wealthy families that have ruled venezuela for over a 100 years and playing a subordinate role to us imperialism their mass base of support is mainly drawn from the middle class and upper middle class areas in the east of caracas and other major cities chavismo has its roots amongst the working class the poor peasants and the urban poor the opposition supporters have an irrational hatred a primal fear of the chavista masses during the violent opposition rioting in 2016 a young man orlando figuera was burnt alive and died as a result his crime being dark skinned and therefore looking both poor and like a chavista certainly in this opposition the voices of the popular classes have no weight for good reason most of the venezuelan poor and the working class have a healthy class instinct and they reject an opposition that they correctly see as representing los amos del valle the age old oligarchy abiding by the interests of imperialism the maduro government s policy of attempting to compromise with and make concessions to the ruling class has eroded popular support for the bolivarian revolution image public domain the maduro government has had a policy of attempting to compromise with and make concessions to the ruling class this has eroded popular support for the bolivarian revolution what progressives need to discuss is the root cause of the crisis in venezuela and on that basis discuss a solution that benefits the country s working people the frightful economic crisis from which venezuela is suffering was triggered in 2014 by the collapse in the price of oil and has been aggravated by some of the government s policy decisions deficit financing paying the foreign debt widespread corruption and us sanctions but its root cause are the well meaning attempts of the bolivarian government to regulate the capitalist economy through price and foreign exchange controls and robust labour and trade union legislation in order to protect the interests of the many this does not work capitalism cannot be regulated if such a thing is attempted capitalists resort to any measures necessary legal or illegal to circumvent such controls establish systems by which they end up benefiting from them foreign currency speculation black marketeering hoarding and generally resort to sabotage investment strikes and capital flight venezuela is a textbook case of this there are therefore only two solutions to the untenable status quo hetland talks about one resolves the crisis in the benefit of the capitalist class and imperialism that is the one advocated by guaidó in his plan país with the backing of the us it involves privatising state owned companies opening up the public sector to private capital and above all opening up the oil industry which is what john bolton demanded this would mean making the poor and workers pay the full price of the crisis that is the opposition s programme and it certainly does not give any weight to the voices of the popular classes the other solution would be based on pursuing genuine revolutionary policies in the benefit of the majority a return to the tasks that chavez announced but left unfinished a socialist economy and a communal state a socialist economy would require the expropriation of the multinationals and the main capitalist groups in venezuela as well as the latifundia in order to create a democratic plan of production under workers control to satisfy the needs of the majority a communal state would imply putting power in the hands of workers committees peasant committees and neighbourhood councils so that the people can rule hetland seems to perceive only a handful of actors in venezuela the us the far right opposition a mythical democratic opposition and the maduro government however there is also a chavista revolutionary movement which is not the same as the government this can be found in the el maizal in organisations like alexis vive in the few remaining experiences of workers control and in the tens of thousands of poor and working class venezuelans who have come out in the last few weeks to oppose imperialist intervention but you will not find it in the pages of the mass media in the us they are in different degrees critical of the maduro government as a whole or at least of some of its worst aspects corruption bureaucracy etc but they know full well that the coming to power of guaidó on the back of an imperialist intervention would be a major disaster what progressives in the us should do is first and foremost oppose the imperialist policies of their government including sanctions and military intervention this should be done not just through writing articles but by organising a mass campaign in the streets and a mass education campaign amongst students and workers that campaign must distance itself from and challenge the main premises that imperialism is using to justify its intervention it does not mean suspending criticism of the maduro government but that criticism should be made from the point of view of the interests of venezuelan workers and peasants not with a view to pleasing liberal academics in the usa of course such a campaign needs to offer an analysis of what has gone wrong in venezuela but that analysis needs to be firmly based on a class perspective not on the utopian idea that eu brokered talks can somehow resolve the conflict between the interests of the venezuelan workers and poor and those of the oligarchy and imperialism

chief financial officer thank you and i would now like to turn the call over to david david jaffe chief executive officer advertisement advertisement thank you jen good afternoon everyone we delivered our third consecutive quarter of enterprise level comparable sales growth with second quarter comp up 2 while we were pleased with continued traction at the enterprise level performance was again mixed across our portfolio our premium segment continued its momentum with double digit comp sales supported by key growth initiatives our value segment while still operating at an unacceptable level of profitability delivered operating income improvement for the year ago period for the first time since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 unfortunately setback at our plus and kids segments this past quarter and we must deliver more consistent execution to get enterprise financials back to levels that we consider appropriate we experienced loss of 0 26 per share which was in line with revised guidance we issued at the icr conference in january we remain on track with all cost takeout and capability building components of our change for growth transformation program we expect to realize 300 million in run rate savings by this coming july and continue to aggressively roll out capability enhancements marketing and merchandise planning functions to drive top line and margin rate improvement the third and most critical component of our transformation program is growth from our core we have made progress here over the past three quarters but february performance was very challenging and as a result we are well off our planned trajectory for top line growth while we believe the challenging selling environment is a result of macro headwinds also impacting others in our sector our third quarter outlook represents an unacceptable profit shortfall to the expectations we shared at the beginning of our fiscal year as a result we are working to accelerate plans that were already in development to take much more fundamental action to address our cost structure as part of our overall transformation work we continue our efforts to explore opportunities to sell third party services on our platform we have completed our internal readiness review and are fully prepared to support external relationship that we are working to develop over the coming quarter advertisement advertisement securing third party relationships will reduce the cost base for our brands while allowing us to diversify our sources of revenue additionally we have identified plans for an incremental 150 million in savings beyond our existing change for growth program target which will help drive operating margin rate expansion our objective is to maintain a cost control program that is able to offset inflationary pressure on an ongoing basis to allow flow through on top line growth and protect our profitability when macro challenges arrive while we expect near term conditions will improve as the customers shift their mindset this spring we are acting with the appropriate sense of urgency to implement our new cost takeout activity and accelerate realization of savings near term we are committed to getting ascena s financial performance back on track and continue to explore opportunities within our portfolio that can allow us to focus capital and management attention on those brands that we believe can deliver sustained growth and profitability by maintaining a differentiated position in the marketplace with that i ll hand things over to gary to discuss key developments across our brand portfolio gary gary muto president and chief executive officer thanks david the second quarter represented another strong quarter at our premium segment loft delivered double digit comp sales and merchandise market growth with comp growth in both its bricks and mortar and direct channels growth was driven by average dollar sale with strong product acceptance resulting in increasing both average selling price and units per transaction advertisement advertisement transactions were up low single digits for the quarter driven by the direct channel and specifically the new loft outlet site which is approaching high teen penetration less than one year after launch at loft we benefited from our warehouse winter strategy and we saw strength across more categories most notably in sweaters dresses and denim we continue to learn and refine loft s newly launched plus assortment based on initial store pilot this past season we remain optimistic that the plus offering represents a meaningful growth opportunity at loft going forward ann taylor also delivered double digit comp sales and margin growth for the quarter with comp growth driven by its direct channel strong assortment performance resulted in increase in both average selling price and units per transaction transaction growth was driven by the direct channel and specifically the new ann taylor factory type which has achieved mid teen penetration less than one year after launch while product acceptance had been broad based we are specifically pleased with our performance in our tops dresses and petite categories moving on to justice and lane bryant we were extremely disappointed with performance at both brands this past quarter at justice we believe the issues are short term in nature but the impact was significant this past quarter our apparel assortment continue to resonate through the second quarter with apparel comp sales up 4 and while our specialty assortment delivered flat comps for the quarter it experienced significantly high clearance selling which hurt overall margin we made some overly aggressive chase decisions in september when the brand was delivering double digit comp sales and traffic growth and as a result we were overbought in specialty inventory and the liquidation is highly seasonal assortment had a greater impact than expected impact than expected on margin we took action post holiday to deal with the overbuy and exited to the second quarter in good shape from an inventory carryover standpoint looking ahead to spring we are pleased with initial reads we are seeing from our new fashion assortment in some warmer weather regions at lane bryant the issues are a bit deeper as i mentioned last quarter we have been addressing lane bryant s market positioning since this past summer advertisement advertisement we are rolling out new brand marketing that highlights the core attributes we need to build upon and become famous for with our existing and potential customer base lane bryant must enhance its emotional connection with the core customer and get credit for its functional benefit instead our new brand positioning and marketing is targeted to address these priorities moving forward specific to the assortment performance we had a significant fashion miss in our kohl assortment starting with our september tops delivery and performance continues to erode as we move through our second quarter candidly our team missed the appropriate edit point for our customer we took fashion a step too far and overdesigned many of our tops we cannot have these misses go forward and have instituted new product hardware while tops underperformed we continue to build on strength in dresses and denim which comp positive in the second quarter we expect the top assortment performance will improve as we move deeper into spring aside from the apparel challenges at lane bryant performance at cacique was also down for last year reflecting the current dynamics in the intimate sector we low performance in more basic part of our bra assortment which was the largest contributing factor to our negative comps we are effectively working to adjust and shift our inventory toward more differentiated fashion which has seen stronger performance in parallel we ve expanded our bra offering online and now have an inclusive range covering band sizes 32 to 50 and cup sizes a to k we believe cacique represents a meaningful long term growth opportunity and are investing incremental marketing dollars to expand awareness and drive customer growth on a stand alone basis and finally at our value segment while the new dressbarn leadership team has delivered improved year on year performance the brand is operating at unacceptable level of profitability due to the significant new leverage from fiscal 2018 advertisement advertisement we are exploring all options to address the overall level of brand profitability including various customer contact and promotional strategies along with additional cost takeout maurices delivered a modest positive comp for the quarter on the back of very strong e commerce performance which was up 24 coming out of the summer season we made adjustments to our assortment strategy to narrow its waist count and increase inventory depth in and saw improvements in both average selling price and unit velocity these positive developments were mostly offset by continued store traffic headwinds we continue to test new promotional strategies utilize our loyalty program and leverage localized online marketing to mitigate through a traffic decline as david referenced a moment ago quarter to date performance has been challenging across our portfolio we are taking what we believe is a prudent approach by not aggressively promoting in low traffic environment which we ve been experiencing we are adjusting our forward promotional strategies to maximize our opportunity in high sales period close and anticipate we will see a balance in overall traffic as the customer mindset shifts to spring we are disappointed with our performance out of the gate in february but we are focused on maintaining the momentum we have at loft and ann taylor getting justice back on track and at lane bryant with that i ll hand it off to brian for a brief update on our transformation work brian lynch president and chief operating officer advertisement advertisement thanks gary and good afternoon everyone we are nearing the end of the change for growth transformation program and are focused on delivering the final components of our road map namely our localized planning to build on customer experience management ecosystem markdown optimization and size and pack optimization are fully implemented at all brands localized planning is going well at our premium and kids segments and we are rolling out to the plus segment next month we remain on course with development of our customer experience management ecosystem as we completed foundational customer data and analytics work this spring the new enterprise marketing tool set including workflow as well as asset and campaign management capabilities will be implemented in all brands by the end of the calendar year enabling wise messaging and at scale and more effective use of our marketing dollars we have seen our new loyalty program at justice drive incremental sales and we are scheduled to launch programs in our plus and premium segments in april and may respectively we believe delivery of the remaining capabilities from our transformation program road map will help our brands gain share in an increasing fragmented competitive space one industry macro issue that had been moving has been getting inventory through our ports of long beach new york and new jersey as many companies rush to get merchandise from china into the u s before tariff increases went into effect combined with timing of chinese new year as a result we have had to expedite transportation from port to our distribution and fulfillment centers this pressure has continued into the early part of the third quarter but we are seeing conditions begin to improve during this period we have incurred additional expense to ensure delivery of goods in support of floor set timing at our brands we are continuing to explore strategies to more proactively mitigate these challenges using a dynamic delivery metrics going forward including options such as expedited vessels we are on track to realize our 300 million cost takeout figure and are developing further structural cost initiatives for fiscal 2020 and beyond to improve profitability we have line of sight to an additional 150 million in targeted areas including expansion of our fleet optimization program demand management for non merchandise spend and operating model efficiencies across the organization advertisement advertisement our goal is to improve profitability with these meaningful cost takeouts as david commented earlier we are acting with the appropriate urgency to implement and with that here is robb robb giammatteo chief financial officer thanks brian and good afternoon everyone please note that the comments on this call will reference non gaap results which exclude restructuring expenses in the extra week recorded in the year ago period at our segment that affect year on year comparability in addition there were two timing related items in our results that affect year on year comparability but are included in our non gaap results first the 53rd week in our prior fiscal year which moved a low margin clearance to our fiscal second quarter this year and second adoption of the new revenue recognition standard which changed the timing of private label credit card revenues across this fiscal year consistent with past practice we have posted a supplemental earnings package to our ir website and attached it to our 8 k to provide additional context on performance for the quarter i will reference this document in my prepared remarks and may reference it as well during q a turning to results our second quarter loss of 0 26 per share resulted from merchandise margin rate erosion at our plus and kids segments 53rd week timing shift partially offset by flow through of positive comp sales growth slide 10 of our supplemental slide package presents operating income loss versus year ago period for reference enterprise comps were up 2 driven by average dollar sale total transactions were essentially flat to last year with 17 transaction growth in the direct channel offset by a 4 drop in store count second quarter direct penetration was approximately 35 of net sales reflecting an approximate 4 percentage point increase from fiscal 2018 driven in part by the new digital channels for ann taylor factory and loft outlet total revenue was essentially flat to the year ago period with comparable sales growth and benefit related to the new revenue recognition standard offset by a lower store count resulting from our fleet optimization work and the unfavorable impact of the 53rd week timing shift gross margin rate of 52 2 was down 190 basis points last year caused primarily by justice comps where an overly aggressive chase strategy in specialty goods required significantly higher markdowns to right size inventory levels remainder of the rate decline was caused by product acceptance challenges at lane bryant along with an increased freight expense resulting from higher direct channel penetration across all brands these factors were partially offset by a rate improvement at dressbarn which was up 270 basis points from last year operating expense of 837 million was down 5 million or 0 6 for the quarter reflecting transformation related savings from store closures mostly offset by inflationary pressure channel shift and investment in growth initiatives specific to our transformation program we ve realized 26 million in savings in the second quarter driven by fleet optimization savings and it efficiencies touching briefly on our fleet optimization program we ended the second quarter with 4 486 stores reflecting 110 net closures in the quarter turning to our balance sheet we ended the second quarter with 215 million in cash and cash equivalents and total debt of 1 372 billion representing the balance of our term loan our next scheduled amortization payment is not due until november 2020 and our asset base revolver was undrawn at quarter end between revolver availability and cash we had 595 million in liquidity at quarter end regarding our capital structure net debt was 2 9 times trailing 12 month ebitda and our trailing 12 month ebitda is 4 2 times our annual interest obligation from the capital allocation perspective we continue to believe debt reduction is the best path to generate shareholder value at this time and are exploring options to maximize the impact related to potential use of current balance sheet cash and remaining fiscal 2019 free cash flow on our existing capital structure at the total company level we exited the second quarter with inventory of 693 million which was up 15 from the year ago period approximately half the increase was caused by floor set timing receipt flow related to the 53rd week shift and the impact of new revenue recognition guidelines excluding these items inventory levels were up approximately 7 inclusive of higher all season stock levels supporting key denim and bra launches please reference slide 5 of our supplemental slide package for additional inventory details capital expenditures for the second quarter were 34 million turning to our performance to date has been challenging and we are currently operating with reduced forward visibility on sales trends due largely to what we believe are macro factors impacting the general retail environment as with past practice we typically guide comps based on our trailing 13 week trend however given the slow start to the quarter we are basing guidance off quarter to date actuals and the trailing 13 week trend for the remainder of the quarter this framework does not contemplate any favorable trend change in april and we believe it represents an appropriately conservative stance based on current conditions our outlook translates to an expected third quarter loss of 0 35 to 0 45 per share supported by the following assumptions net sales of 1 43 billion to 1 46 billion with comps sales down 4 to down 2 the decline in net sales is expected to be generally in line with comp sales decline with the unfavorable impact of ongoing store closures mostly offset by the beneficial impact of the 53rd week shift detail related to the impact of the 53rd week by quarter throughout fiscal 2019 is highlighted on slide of our supplemental earnings package gross margin rate of 57 to 58 with the midpoint down approximately 120 basis points from the year ago period the planned rate reflects merchandise margin rate erosion resulting in the february selling across our portfolio and expectations for continued headwinds from the channel shift toward direct these factors are expected to be offset in part by normalization of rate at our value segment driven by planned improvement at dressbarn which was down over 800 basis points versus historical levels in the year ago period expense growth of approximately 4 reflecting inflationary pressure initiative spending and channel shift partially offset by store closures and transformation related savings and the third quarter comparative will be negatively impacted by the reversal of incentive compensation accruals in the year ago period which depress the prior year base for full year fiscal 2019 we continue to expect operating expense will be flat at 1 key assumptions related to our third quarter guide are presented on slide 9 of our supplemental slide package third quarter earnings will be favorably impacted by the timing shifts related to the 53rd week in our prior fiscal year and the impact of the new revenue recognition standard together resulting in an approximate benefit of 18 million in operating income versus the year ago period this benefit is more than offset by the combined impact of our negative comp outlook lower gross margin increased operating expense due to reduced visibility of current trend we are not issuing full year guidance at this time for reference our current guide through the third quarter would translate to a year to date loss of approximately 0 60 compared to a 0 10 loss that was reflected in our original annual guidance for the first through third quarter period with most of that shortfall coming in the third quarter the decline versus our original guidance for the first through third quarters is primarily related to lower than expected performance at our justice and lane bryant brands in conclusion while we believe the recent slowdown in trend is largely macro related we are aggressively managing the items within our control our ongoing cost takeout activity has allowed us to continue to invest in key areas across our portfolio while offsetting inflationary pressures and we are accelerating activity in this effort to recover from what we believe is a near term pocket our transformation efforts have created a more capable enterprise and we now must deliver sustained comp growth across our brand portfolio to leverage our leaner cost structure that concludes our prepared remarks we ll open it up for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of susan anderson with b riley fbr your line is now open susan anderson b riley fbr analyst hi good evening thanks for taking my question nice to see the good performance at ann taylor and loft i guess i wanted to maybe touch on justice i think that the underperformance there was mainly related to overinventory on the accessories part but i guess maybe if you could touch on just the apparel and how that performed in the fourth quarter and going into first quarter and then if you re seeing any impact at all from the gymboree liquidations which maybe a little bit younger there but just curious if you re seeing anything there gary muto president and chief executive officer yes it s gary i mentioned the apparel comp was plus 4 in the quarter so we were fairly pleased with the progress that we re making there as far as the impact of gymboree we really haven t seen anything i would say current outlook i think it s just been very uneven there s just been a whole kind of just drop in store traffic we ve experienced across our entire portfolio so we remain cautious for the outlook of the season we believe that hopefully will improve as spring break starts to happen and we get closer to easter susan anderson b riley fbr analyst got it and are you expecting the inventory mix between apparel and accessories to be more balanced in first quarter is it going to take longer than that to get the proper balance there gary muto president and chief executive officer we took all our or we corrected all our inventory issues in the quarter susan anderson b riley fbr analyst got it ok that s helpful and then i guess yes so just i m not sure if i heard you right but did you say the third quarter to date trends really the weaker trends there are mainly coming from justice and lane bryant or is it did you see kind of a drop off across all the formats gary muto president and chief executive officer we ve seen a drop off across the entire portfolio david jaffe chief executive officer we still see the premium brands are still outperforming the legacies but there s step down across all the portfolio its traffic base susan anderson b riley fbr analyst got it ok and then i guess just from what you could gather i think a lot of retailers have seen a slow start to the quarter but do you think it s weather related macro i guess meaning tax refunds or is there do you think there s a bigger broader theme going on there with the slowdown in consumer spending david jaffe chief executive officer susan i think it s all of those things and probably more the late easter i think does have an impact as well and until we get to warmer weather and easter we re not really going to be able to tell if there is an across the board slowdown in consumer apparel spending so right now we re just going to wait and see susan anderson b riley fbr analyst got it ok and then one last one if i get through in there on lane bryant i guess just curious on your thoughts you guys are obviously rolling out plus size to your other formats including ann taylor and we re seeing a lot of your competitors also roll out plus size so i guess how do you compete with the lane bryant s format in just as much more highly competitive environment now going forward gary muto president and chief executive officer this is gary what we ve seen with loft the rollout of loft is that loft while we ve seen success in loft we ve really seen it around fashion print and pattern and that customer to be their reaction to the product is very much how the loft customer reacts to the product i think lane bryant s customer is lane bryant s customer clearly there s a lot more competition out there but we ve seen success in bottoms specifically denim and in pants and in dresses we have a top assortment issue that i believe a good portion of that was self inflicted by us not really being clearly understanding what our customer wanted from us we re taking quick action to remediate that but we feel very confident that we will get that business back on track susan anderson b riley fbr analyst got it ok great thanks so much good luck next quarter david jaffe chief executive officer thanks susan operator we have a question from the line of steve marotta with cl king associates your line is now open steve marotta cl king and associates analyst good morning everybody i just oh good afternoon excuse me robb i have one quick question for you i want to put a finer point on the comparable store sales guidance for the third quarter down 4 to down 2 you re saying that that is based on quarter to date actual as well as the trailing 12 week trend and doesn t account for any acceleration over the next six weeks is that accurate robb giammatteo chief financial officer so that s correct the 13 week trend for the go forward period and by default that except that is ignoring the recent challenges in february right so february has been down mid single digits and our trailing 13 week trend was i believe around 1 so by default we are assuming things get better but we were not assuming a step change in april above that run rate steve marotta cl king and associates analyst ok can you please remind us what i know you don t give monthly comps but maybe if you can directionally talk a little bit about march april of last year just specifically march and april of last year robb giammatteo chief financial officer so march and april last year steve represented about 75 of the quarter steve marotta cl king and associates analyst and what was the again i know you don t give monthly comps but can you talk a little bit about what the comp was like during that window robb giammatteo chief financial officer i recall march last year was very challenging from a weather standpoint steve i don t have that material on me but it s yeah i can follow that with you on that afterwards steve marotta cl king and associates analyst no trouble we ll take that offline thank you very much operator i m showing no further phone questions at this time i d like to turn the call back to mr jaffe for closing remarks david jaffe chief executive officer thank you everyone for your interest and we look forward to speak with you next quarter have a good evening operator duration 30 minutes call

london march 15 a host of central banks meet next week but with a global economic slowdown underway alongside political and trade strife they are unlikely to tinker much if at all with policy an escalation in the us china trade war would trigger a sharper downturn economists say putting major central banks on a more cautious path just as they want to wind down crisis measures on wednesday the united states federal reserve will release its updated forecasts for the us economy and its latest dot plots will probably point either to no more interest rate rises this year or to one more at most the fed is currently in a holding pattern and its chief jerome powell signalled at the conclusion of the last meeting in january it may be at the end of its policy tightening cycle and would be patient before making any further moves advertisement we believe the word patient is likely to appear in the march policy statement again as it did in january hsbc economists told clients this would imply in our view that the target funds rate will be kept unchanged for at least the two subsequent policy meetings we look for one 25 basis point rate increase in the federal funds rate this year in september a reuters poll pointed to one rate increase in the third quarter before it calls a halt advertisement on march 21 the bank of england is almost certain to sit on its hands british lawmakers voted overwhelmingly yesterday in favour of delaying britain s exit from the european union which had been due at the end of the month prime minister theresa may will now try for a third time to get parliament s approval for her proposed deal on leaving the eu lawmakers must decide whether to back a deal they feel does not offer a clean break from the eu or reject it and accept brexit could be watered down or even thwarted by a long delay this looks set to keep the bank rate firmly on hold at 0 75 per cent the committee is very unlikely to raise rates again until it has a clearer line of sight on brexit said victoria clarke at investec britain s economy came close to stagnating again in february amid brexit nerves and sluggish global growth a picture repeated in the euro zone where a series of weak economic reports have confirmed a slowdown the european central bank may have missed its opportunity to raise interest rates before the next downturn according to a reuters poll that showed a majority of central bank policy watchers aren t confident they will earlier this month the ecb pushed back until at least 2020 the timing of its first post crisis rate increase it also offered banks a new round of cheap loans to help revive the euro zone economy it was a similar scene in asia where growth is also slowing central banks in indonesia the philippines taiwan and thailand all have monetary policy meetings in the week the market is interested in what indonesia and the philippines central banks will do and look for any signs of easing after their aggressive policy hikes in 2018 said prakash sakpal at ing all 13 economists polled by reuters said the philippines central bank would leave policy alone and probably wait until inflation is within its target before it looks to ease indonesia s central bank will also remain on hold and wait for further moves from the fed a reuters poll suggested we think bank indonesia will remain on hold until late q3 when we expect it to hike another 25 basis points to maintain balance with fed hikes noted credit suisse economists bucking the trend norway s central bank is expected to raise its key rate on march 21 and continue to tighten later this year amid solid growth and rising inflation a reuters poll found on friday norway s fourth quarter growth exceeded expectations as did february inflation the crown s weakness and a rising price for crude oil the country s main export also point to tighter policy reuters
reuters kcna jim rogers and george soros the eurasian boom a huge money making opportunity defending the open society from korean socialism the first historic summit between us president donald trump and chairman kim jong un of north korea took place in the prosperous asian city state of singapore the city is also the home of one of the leading voices championing a possible entrepreneurial boom on the korean peninsula legendary investor jim rogers jim rogers is currently the chairman of rogers holdings and beeland interests inc he explained to south korean tv important opportunities are coming in the korean peninsula and north korea is going to be the most exciting country in the world for the next decade or two he went on to say north korea today is where china was in 1981 north korea is a copy he has been opening up the country just as deng xiaoping did in an appearance on fox news rogers emphasized the fact that the population of the dprk is highly educated making them more highly skilled than other people throughout the developing world rogers is associated with republican and libertarian circles and has admitted that the austrian school with its hands off approach is closest to his view of how the state should handle the economy despite his personal libertarian bent rogers seems to embrace the highly authoritarian government of his current country of residence however an old business partner of his seems to hold the opposite view not just about singapore but about north korea trump and everything else back in 1973 jim rogers and the hungarian billionaire george soros launched the quantum group of funds this was a network of hedge funds based in london new york curaçao and the cayman islands eventually the obama administration s dodd frank reform act forced quantum funds to return all outside money and reduce itself to a soros family investment group but rogers had already left in 1980 long before it seems pretty clear that rogers and soros are no longer friends rogers diplomatically answered a reporter from forbes who asked him about soros saying i left 37 years ago and have not had contact since we were both dedicated and passionate about our work he was a great market timer i have no idea what he has been doing these days but back when we worked together i did a lot of the research and reasoning for a position while any personal disagreement between the two billionaire investors remains unknown they clearly occupy opposite ends of the political spectrum rogers is associated with republicans and libertarians soros has become a funder of liberal democratic party activism and is the favorite bogeyman of the american right wing and while jim rogers seems to be a beloved resident of singapore in 2018 george soros open society foundation was officially barred from setting up shop in the lion city soros linked human rights organizations have long been harshly critical of singapore s political system while jim rogers continues to celebrate the possibility of hope for economic development on the korean peninsula democrats and liberals in the usa are less optimistic in fact the lack of results following the second meeting in hanoi was widely praised by nancy pelosi and other figures that are normally harshly critical of the trump administration in order to understand what is really driving these divisions within the ruling circles of the united states one must understand what is happening on the other side of the planet especially on the eurasian continent this is a golden era and in the eurasian continent we re seeing a lot of power accumulating we re seeing roads cities train networks snaking through the post soviet wilderness and creating a fabulous amount of wealth and dynamism said asle toje of the norwegian nobel institute he was speaking at the 2017 summit of the valdai discussion club in sochi russia what he was describing is real in every way russia s eurasian economic union and china s one belt one road initiative have lit up the region both russia and china have state controlled economies russia s economic model involves two state controlled energy giants gazprom and rosneft propping up a diverse economy involving mineral extraction steel production along with a low rate of taxation in order to create a good environment for business china s economy involves state run steel manufacturing the biggest telecommunications manufacturers in the world cutting edge technology breakthroughs and lots of oil and gas imported to keep the big machine rolling surrounding the two eurasian superpowers are a number of smaller countries that have long suffered from chronic underdevelopment much like living spaces that are not cleaned can soon become infested by pests regions that remain in chronic poverty can soon become hotbeds of drug dealing sex trafficking and terrorism a policy of win win cooperation making the region more stable and economically prosperous is a matter of security for both russia and china russia s far eastern region has long been underdeveloped the recent 2018 far eastern economic forum in vladivistock featured an interaction by xi jinping and vladimir putin and plans to bring the golden era to this part of the russian federation that is ripe for an economic boom however a big road closed sign stands blocking the way of russia and china s vision of economic development in the russian far east and the eurasian hemisphere overall the barricade holding back economic development is sanctions on the democratic peoples republic of korea for its nuclear proliferation the dprk has expressed a readiness to open up for foreign investment and more thoroughly integrate itself with the emerging eurasian economy as well as bring in western investors speaking at the 2019 world economic forum in davos george soros blasted the chinese government saying china isn t the only authoritarian regime in the world but it s undoubtedly the wealthiest strongest and most developed in machine learning and artificial intelligence this makes xi jinping the most dangerous opponent of those who believe in the concept of open society but xi isn t alone authoritarian regimes are proliferating all over the world and if they succeed they will become totalitarian as the founder of the open society foundations i ve devoted my life to fighting totalizing extremist ideologies which falsely claim that the ends justify the means i believe that the desire of people for freedom can t be repressed forever but i also recognize that open societies are profoundly endangered at present soros specifically highlighted china s social credit system for criticism according to soros logic facebook google and other us tech monopolies that work with intelligence agencies should be able to monitor people and predict their behavior but the chinese communist party should never employ such methods in its own defense soros open society vision is really a society that is open for business with no strong state apparatus to hold back the wealthy defacto rulers soros would prefer that all totalizing extremist ideologies that offer moral codes and protection to those less powerful than he gradually fade away and be replaced with his own shady moral relativism accompanying a law of the jungle in society at large millions of women across eastern europe saw the harsh reality of soros vision when they went from having guaranteed jobs and maternity leave under the marxist leninist governments to being impoverished victims of sex trafficking after capitalism was restored soros imposed his ideology on eastern europe in the aftermath of the soviet union s demise financing jeffrey sachs to oversee the looting of the former eastern bloc putin s rise in russia is largely credited with having ended the demented free market experiment described in the pages of naomi klein s 2007 book shock doctrine since then soros has become more critical of excessive neoliberalism but his worldview favoring an open international system and free market capitalism has not changed the ideology espoused by jim roger s beloved austrian school of economics is not much different in its ultimate goal though soros now pushes a more watered down and pragmatic brand george soros probably representing the wealthier and more entrenched circles of wealth in the usa is thinking of the long term interest of capitalism and western liberalism much like it did in china during the 1980s a reform and opening up in north korea would likely strengthen the socialist foundations of the economy soros most likely sees allowing north korea s ruling workers party to raise living standards and bring its highly loyal population into the global economy as a big mistake however jim rogers and the crowd of lower level billionaires and millionaires grouped around trump seem to think a potential investing bonanza on the korean peninsula is in their rational self interest they would prefer the un sanctions be lifted so they can go in and make a killing trump thundered with optimism prior to the hanoi summit tweeting out north korea under the leadership of kim jong un will become a great economic powerhouse he may surprise some but he won t surprise me because i have gotten to know him fully understand how capable he is north korea will become a different kind of rocket an economic one these divisions of strategy and direct financial interests seem to be underlying the confusion in washington dc as a third trump kim summit is said to be in the works

in his latest newsletter commodities analyst jay taylor notes that a very important date is approaching in 2018 central banks added nearly 23 million ounces of gold up 74 from 2017 this is the highest annual purchase rate increase since 1971 and the second highest rate in history russia was the biggest buyer and not surprisingly the lion s share of gold is flowing into central banks of countries that are in the sights of america s killing machine the military industrial complex that eisenhower warned us about in 1958 the bank for international settlements bis located in basal switzerland is often referred to as the central bankers bank related to this issue of central bank hoarding of gold is the fact that on march 29 the bis will permit central banks to count the physical gold it holds marked to market as a reserve asset just the same as it allows cash and sovereign debt instruments to be counted there has been a long term view that china and other nations dishoarding dollars in favor of gold have been quite happy about western banks trashing the gold price through the synthetic paper markets but one has to wonder if that might not change once physical gold is marked to market for the sake of enlarging bank balance sheets this also raises the question with regard to how much gold the u s actually holds as opposed to what it claims to hold james sinclair has always argued that the only way the world can overcome the debt that is strangling the global economy is to remonetize gold on the balance sheets of central banks at a price in many thousands of dollars higher this would mean a major change in the global monetary system away from the dollar as china has been pushing for the last decade or so if banks own and possess gold bullion they can use that asset as equity and thus this will enable them to print more money it may be no coincidence that as march 29th has been approaching banks around the world have been buying huge amounts of physical gold and taking delivery for the first time in 50 years central banks bought over 640 tons of gold bars last year almost twice as much as in 2017 and the highest level raised since 1971 when president nixon closed the gold window and forced the world onto a floating rate currency system but as chris powell of gata noted that in itself is not news the move toward making gold equal to cash and bonds was anticipated several years ago however what is news is the realization by a major italian newspaper ii sole 24 ore that synthetic gold or paper gold has been used to suppress the price of gold thus enabling countries and their central banks to continue to buy gold and build up their reserves at lower and lower prices as massive amounts of artificially created synthetic gold triggers layer upon layer of artificially lower priced gold as unaware private investors panic out of their positions the paper concludes that in recent years but especially in 2018 a jump in the price of gold would have been the normal order of things on the contrary gold closed last year with a 7 percent downturn and a negative financial return how do you explain this while the central banks raided real gold bars behind the scenes they pushed and coordinated the offer of hundreds of tons of synthetic gold on the london and new york exchanges where 90 percent of the trading of metals takes place the excess supply of gold derivatives obviously served to knock down the price of gold forcing investors to liquidate positions to limit large losses accumulated on futures thus the more gold futures prices fell the more investors sold synthetic gold triggering bearish spirals exploited by central banks to buy physical gold at ever lower prices the only way governments can manage the levels of debt that threaten the financial survival of the western world is to inflate debase their currencies the ability to count gold as a reserve from which banks can create monetary inflation is not only to allow gold to become a reserve on the balance sheet of banks but to have a much much higher gold price to build up equity in line with the massive debt in the system
in the middle of the 2008 housing crisis i traveled to nevada to hear from people who had lost their homes one of the people who spoke that day was mr estrada he wore a jacket over his t shirt and had on a red u s marine corps baseball cap he and his wife both worked and they had stretched their budget to get their two girls into a good school and buy a home their home meant everything to them it was right across the street from the school so they could see their girls playing outside when they opened their garage door but when the payments on their mortgage jumped they fell behind mr estrada tried to negotiate with the bank but then suddenly the bank sold his home at auction mr estrada said that his six year old daughter had come home the other day with a sheet of paper with all of her friends names on it she told him that these were the people who would miss her because she was going to have to move away he responded i don t care if i have to live in a van you re still going to be able to go to this school as mr estrada told his story he had tears in his eyes i did too and i still think about his story because it s a powerful reminder of what housing means housing is not just the biggest expense for most american families or the biggest purchase most americans will make in their lifetimes it also affects the jobs you can get the schools your children can go to and the kinds of communities you can live in that s why it s so important that government gets housing policy right but government at all levels hasn t done enough to tackle our housing problems over the past few decades the federal government has reduced investments in housing for middle class and lower income families even as rents continue to rise many state and local governments have layered on needless rules that drive up construction costs and lock families out of neighborhoods with better schools and job opportunities meanwhile homeownership is out of reach for too many families especially black families decades of outright discrimination by the federal government denied black families the same kinds of homeownership subsidies available to white families then government regulators ignored warning signs as predatory financial institutions targeted minority communities with subprime mortgages that sucked billions of dollars in wealth out of those communities the black homeownership rate today is nearly the same as it was when housing discrimination was legal we re not going to solve our housing crisis by nibbling at the edges we need to tackle it head on with big comprehensive solutions that match the size of the problems we have that s what my housing plan for america does bringing down rental costs my housing plan starts by attacking the growing cost of rent in america millions of american families are spending more than 30 of their income on rent my plan will bring down rental costs by 10 by addressing the root causes of the problem a severe lack of affordable housing supply and state and local land use rules that needlessly drive up housing costs the rising cost of rent reflects a basic supply and demand problem there aren t enough places to rent that are affordable to lower income families that s because developers can usually turn bigger profits by building fancier new units targeted at higher income families rather than units targeted at lower income families the result is a huge hole in the marketplace that hole ends up raising costs for everyone without enough affordable options lower income families have to stretch their budgets to try to find housing they end up taking units that would otherwise go to middle class families middle class families in turn have to stretch their budgets to secure housing that might otherwise go to even richer families to fix this problem we need to fill in the hole in the marketplace and that s what my plan does the centerpiece of my plan is the american housing and economic mobility act which i introduced for the first time in the senate last year and reintroduced this week i m proud that my bill has the support of two of my senate colleagues and i m proud that an inspiring set of leaders including representatives cedric richmond of louisiana barbara lee of california gwen moore of wisconsin and elijah cummings of maryland has introduced the same legislation in the house my bill makes historic federal investments to increase housing supply it invests 500 billion over the next ten years to build preserve and rehab units that will be affordable to lower income families a big chunk of that investment leverages private dollars so that taxpayers get the most bang for their buck by building millions of new units my plan will reduce the cost of rent for everyone an independent analysis from mark zandi the chief economist at moody s analytics found that my plan would reduce rental costs by 10 over the next ten years and because my plan invests in housing construction and rehabilitation the moody s analysis also finds that it would create 1 5 million new jobs how would we pay for this new investment simple currently an heir doesn t pay a dollar of estate taxes until they inherit a fortune of 22 million or more i would lower that threshold to 7 million which is where it was when president george w bush left office and raise the tax rates above that threshold so ultra millionaires and billionaires pay a larger share those changes affect only 14 000 of the wealthiest families each year but according to the moody s analysis they fully cover the cost of my plan think about that by asking 14 000 wealthy families a year to pay a bit more we can reduce rents by 10 for millions of families and create 1 5 million good new jobs my bill also makes additional targeted investments in communities that desperately need it it invests half a billion dollars in rural housing programs it invests 2 5 billion in the indian housing block grant and the native hawaiian housing block grant to build or rehab 200 000 homes on tribal land and it invests 4 billion in a new middle class housing emergency fund which will support the construction of new housing catering to middle class renters in communities with severe housing supply shortages these investments are one big and necessary way that we can reduce rental costs but there s another driver of expensive housing costs some state and local zoning rules needlessly drive up the cost of construction these aren t necessary rules that protect the environment or ensure that homes meet safety codes these are rules like minimum lot sizes or mandatory parking requirements these kinds of rules raise the costs of building new housing and keep families from moving into areas with better career and school choices my bill gives state and local governments a real incentive to eliminate these unnecessary rules it puts 10 billion into a new competitive grant program states regions and cities can use the new grant money to build infrastructure parks roads or schools but to even apply for these grants they must reform land use rules to allow for the construction of additional well located affordable housing units and to protect tenants from rent spikes and eviction similar efforts have resulted in states making serious changes in the hopes of securing valuable federal grants together these changes will help the economy grow the cost of housing is a real obstacle to families looking to move to cities with better job opportunities my plan creates more affordable housing in these communities and it lets people find affordable options closer to downtown areas so that they don t need to commute as far reducing a drag on productivity reducing rents by 10 creating 1 5 million new jobs promoting economic growth my plan will be a big win for america s families a first step to addressing the black white wealth gap for decades the federal government discriminated against black families by denying them access to the same kind of federal housing subsidies that white families received to purchase a home a practice known as redlining the federal government officially ended that form of discrimination in the 1960s and passed the fair housing act yet the gap between white homeownership rates and black homeownership rates today is about 30 bigger than it was in 1960 when housing discrimination was legal this enormous gap is a moral stain on our country and because the government bears a big part of the blame for it the government should take real steps to fix it my housing bill takes a first step by creating a first of its kind down payment assistance program the people eligible for assistance must be first time homebuyers who live in a formerly redlined neighborhoods or communities that were segregated by law and are still currently low income if they qualify they are entitled to a substantial grant they can put towards a down payment on a home anywhere in the country the program will provide thousands of families with a real chance to buy a home the same opportunities the government denied to previous generations of residents of the area professors mehrsa baradaran and darrick hamilton have said this proposal is the first since the fair housing act with the explicit intent of redressing the iterative effects of our nation s sordid history of housing discrimination and that it has the potential to make a substantive dent in closing our enormous and persistent racial wealth gap removing barriers to affordable housing my bill also removes unnecessary barriers that prevent people from finding affordable housing one existing barrier is discrimination the fair housing act bars certain forms of discrimination and we must ensure that the act is not weakened or diminished either by congress or by regulators and that it is fully and fairly enforced but there are other forms of discrimination that are not currently covered by the act that s why my bill prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation gender identity marital status veteran status and the source of one s income like a housing voucher landlords shouldn t be able to reject tenants based on what they look like how they identify or who they love my bill removes another barrier lack of access to credit for creditworthy borrowers looking to buy a home in the 1970s congress passed a law called the community reinvestment act cra which required banks to make loans in communities where they took deposits before the law went into effect banks often took deposits in minority neighborhoods but only made mortgages and other loans in white communities the cra rules are important but they could be doing a better job of ensuring that financial institutions meet the credit needs of all the communities they serve my bill extends the law to cover non bank mortgage lenders promotes more investment in activities that help low and moderate income communities strengthens sanctions against institutions that fail to follow the rules and imposes new requirements on banks that want to merge these changes will make it easier for creditworthy borrowers to find an affordable mortgage no matter where they live a final barrier is that many homeowners are still underwater on their mortgages since the 2008 financial crisis typically these homeowners are in areas often rural areas where housing prices have not rebounded since the 2008 crisis my bill invests 2 billion to support underwater borrowers in these areas so they can build more economic security empowering communities rather than wall street i also want to empower communities to make decisions that protect their best interests for example my bill reforms a government program that puts the interests of hedge funds and private equity firms ahead of the interests of borrowers and the communities they live in the federal housing administration fha the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac have auctioned off thousands of delinquent mortgages in the first few years of these auctions nearly all of the mortgages sold were purchased by for profit entities mostly private equity and hedge funds rather than providing a second chance for families the new wall street owners often foreclosed quickly and failed to maintain the properties i pushed fha and the federal housing finance agency which oversees fannie mae and freddie mac to improve its practices and the agencies did take some steps to improve the program but we need to do more that s why my bill will put strict new requirements on the sale program limiting the situations in which the agencies are allowed to sell mortgages and imposing requirements on buyers to make sure they protect distressed homeowners and the neighborhoods they live in the changes will allow more people to stay in their homes and prevent private equity funds from scooping up properties and turning around to charge people exorbitant rents my administration will also take whatever legal steps it can to stop states from preempting local efforts to enact tenant protection laws more than 30 states have passed laws that explicitly prohibit cities from adopting rent control efforts to repeal these state preemption laws have been met with fierce opposition from real estate and private equity giants who have shelled out massive sums of money to block these proposals just last year firms like new york based private equity giant blackstone group contributed to a 65 million war chest to defeat a ballot initiative in california that would have repealed a state law making it harder for cities to control housing costs these state laws effectively permit wall street to decide what s best for cities and towns instead of the residents of those places choosing for themselves it s wrong and as president i will do whatever i can to stop and reverse these industry backed efforts to take power away from cities and towns my plan will lower rents take a first step towards closing the racial wealth gap and make it easier for americans to access affordable housing enacting the plan will be a top priority of my administration because every american deserves a safe decent and affordable place to live
image friends of the earth twitter its proponents are absolutely correct on the merits by dr jeffrey d sachs university professor of of sustainable development columbia university there are three main ideas of the green new deal resolution introduced by congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez and senator ed markey the first is to decarbonize the us energy system that is to end the emissions of carbon dioxide co2 from burning coal oil and natural gas in order to stop global warming the second is to guarantee lower cost high quality health coverage for all the third is to ensure decent jobs and living standards for all americans in part by making colleges and vocational schools affordable for all the right wing and corporate lobbies are already hyperventilating it is unachievable it will bankrupt us it will make us into venezuela these claims are dead wrong the green new deal agenda is both feasible and affordable this will become clear as the agenda is turned into specific legislation for energy health care higher education and more the green new deal combines ideas across several parts of the economy because the ultimate goal is sustainable development that means an economy that delivers a package deal good incomes social fairness and environmental sustainability around the world governments are aiming for the same end a triple bottom line of economic social and environmental objectives in the us the economy is feeding the wealth of billionaires while leaving tens of millions of households with no financial cushion at all meanwhile the fossil fuel lobby continues to endanger the planet by promoting the use of fuels that contribute to climate change raising the risk of mega floods droughts hurricanes and heat waves claiming many lives and costing the us more than 450 billion during 2016 18 or more than 150 billion per year on average the key ideas of the green new deal decarbonization lower cost health care and decent living standards for the working class have been studied for years the green new deal resolution is the opportunity finally to put that vast knowledge into effect what is absolutely clear is that the green new deal is affordable the claims about the unaffordability of these goals are pure hype the detailed plans that will emerge in the coming months will expose the bluster decarbonizing energy consider the challenge of decarbonizing the energy system as noted in the green new deal resolution the recent report of the inter governmental panel on climate change calls for global decarbonization by 2050 an achievable goal that requires coherent and accelerated actions by the us and other nations the green new deal is the occasion to put america s utilities builders and automakers to the challenge of accelerating their technological overhauls to complete decarbonization by 2050 or earlier the resolution calls for a 10 year mobilization effort to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions but not for a precise timeline for completing decarbonization the timing will depend on the pace of new zero carbon investments and the phase out of existing fossil fuel based technologies decarbonization will include the following measures electricity generation will shift from coal and natural gas to wind solar hydro and other zero carbon technologies cars and trucks will shift from gasoline to electricity using batteries or fuel cells with hydrogen manufactured by electrolysis planes will use electricity for short flights and advanced zero carbon fuels for longer flights buildings will be heated by electricity such as heat pumps rather than boilers and furnaces the costs of renewable energy are plummeting making decarbonization eminently feasible detailed estimates put the costs of substantial decarbonization 80 or more by 2050 at around 1 of gdp per year or less see here for one recent study in many cases renewable energy is already at grid parity meaning that it is at a cost point comparable to fossil fuels most of the modest costs of decarbonization will never hit the federal budget as they will be absorbed by the utility industry the automobile producers and other parts of the private economy decarbonization is already underway in the us just not yet with the pace and scale required us utilities are no longer building coal fired power plants many are now scrapping plans for gas fired plants in favor of renewable energy investors and in house lawyers are warning companies not to invest in fossil fuels as these investments would be stranded in future years automobile companies are rapidly shifting to electric vehicles new buildings are going electric with tough efficiency codes these transformations are being driven mainly by environmental regulations integrated resource planning by utilities and market forces not by federal outlays medicare for all lower cost high quality health care for all for example through medicare for all is also within reach as with decarbonization the right wing and corporate lobbies are using scare tactics to hide the basic fact health care costs in the us can be cut considerably while improving services the us spends around 17 of its gross domestic product gdp on health care coverage while other countries spend 10 12 the main difference lies with the high prices of us health care for drugs hospital stays medical procedures and other goods and services rather than with greater utilization of health services these high prices have resulted in part from the rising concentration and market power of health care providers at the metropolitan level the result is outlandish salaries bloated administration heavy costs of advertising and other inefficiencies that result in high incomes for the health care industry and exorbitant costs for taxpayers and for workers paying for private health care plans the question is therefore not whether we can afford medicare for all but whether we will get there before the private health care industry bankrupts us as one approach the private insurance premiums now flowing to private health insurers could be re directed to a medicare account that would reimburse the health providers at medicare rates with much lower management salaries and administrative costs the nationwide cost savings of medicare for all hundreds of billions of dollars per year could be remitted to taxpayers or used to reduce the federal budget deficit college for all similar budget analyses demonstrate the feasibility of other parts of the green new deal can debt free higher education for all be achieved the other rich countries all accomplish it one proposal for college for all presented by senator bernie sanders would cost around one quarter of 1 of gdp a price point that is tiny compared with the burdens of a society weighed down by student debts that create lifelong anxieties until retirement years the green new deal proponents are absolutely correct on the merits decarbonization medicare for all debt free higher education and other social benefits are feasible affordable and smart they will deliver great savings in the case of health care environmental benefits in the case of decarbonization and renewed social mobility in the case of debt free higher education as a next step the green new deal ideas should be turned into legislation plans and budgets when the federal interstate highway system was being debated in 1955 every congressman received a booklet with detailed maps showing how their district would benefit from an interstate highway system it s now important to provide a roadmap of the green new deal showing for each part of the country how the green new deal package can be accomplished at low cost and with

ambev s a nyse abev is a well run company that is highly levered to the global economy and global commodity markets in particular with the majority of its activities in south and central america the company is also subject to currency inflation and political risks with headwinds in front of it in 2019 including a slowing global economy and high inflation in some of its key markets e g brazil and argentina the company is currently a hold in my view introduction a brazil based company abev is the largest of the latin american brewers by total beverage volume and the third largest in the world abev is also a marketer and distributor of carbonated products juices teas and other drink products across the americas abev s activities are primarily divided into three segments 1 latin america north including operations in brazil dominican republic saint vincent antigua dominica guatemala el salvador nicaragua and cuba 2 latin america south including operations in argentina bolivia paraguay uruguay chile ecuador peru and colombia and 3 canada which primarily comprises sales of labatt in canada abev markets products under various brand names a full list of the company s brands being found here notably abev owns two of the world s largest beer brands by volume brahma and skol skol is sold solely in south america abev is 62 owned by anheuser busch inbev bud which affords abev exclusive distribution rights to bud s portfolio which includes major brands such as budweiser corona and stella artois among others in brazil abev s brahma is a premium brand with a loyal customer base overall with brahma budweiser stella artois and corona in its stable abev appears well positioned for the future particularly if the south american economies can stabilize and strengthen in this regard with the premium beer segment representing just 5 of brazil s beer volume compared to approximately 15 in argentina and chile abev s portfolio of premium brands may have a growth runway in brazil going forward very brief history brahma a beer brand owned and managed by 3g capital 3g a private equity firm that has partnered with warren buffett and berkshire hathaway brk b from time to time merged with antarctica of argentina in 1999 post merger the surviving company controlled by 3g changed its name to ambev with 3g backing abev then proceeded to buy up brewers throughout central and south america the resulting present day company has impressive volume market share in several large south american markets abev is and has been a highly profitable business which is part and parcel of 3g s disciplined approach and culture abev s hegemony in its primary markets reduces manufacturing costs leverages the firm s high fixed cost base and results in the company s relatively low average cost of production recent results overall 2018 was a relatively poor year for abev with volume down 2 6 from the q 4 2018 earnings call transcript on a consolidated basis in the fourth quarter top line was up 5 3 as volume drop 3 8 was more than offset by the growth in net revenue per hectoliter of 9 4 in the full year net revenue was up 6 9 with volume declining 2 6 and net revenue per hectoliter growing 9 7 normalized net profit was brl3 7 billion 17 3 lower than in q4 2017 in the full year normalized profit was brl11 6 billion 5 lower than 2017 guidance for 2019 was not particularly impressive either high cost inflation in brazil and argentina will likely eat into margins as the company will have difficulty passing the increased costs along to consumers with respect to brazil management noted that on the cost side we expect the full year cash total cogs per hectoliter in brazil to increase by mid teens as we will face pressure from currency depreciation and commodity prices our average hedging rate for 2019 is of 3 61 brl usd versus 3 16 brl usd in 2018 for 2019 the high inflation and currency depreciation will likely only continue a negative trend that has been in place since 2012 when abev s gross margins peaked at 68 only to fall below 62 in 2018 the entrance of heineken otcqx heiny into the brazil market will not help abev either going forward and this competition could also eat into margins nonetheless these margins are still relatively high even if trending in the wrong direction management see link above has also acknowledged recent difficulties but contend that they are investing for the long term our ownership mentality requires a focus on long term sustainable value creation even if temporary volatility has put pressure on our results in the short term we are not satisfied with our performance in the year and we are committed to improving results based on the execution of our clear strategy our plan is supported by i our robust and unique portfolio which allows us to play in all the segments of the brazilian beer market reaching a more balanced top line growth between volume and revenue ii our unmatched distribution capability iii exciting innovations we have in the pipeline iv commercial investments targeted to improve consumer experience and v our people abev is working hard to contain costs and had success in the fourth quarter of 2018 as administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were down by brl 250 million and by 70 basis points moreover with respect to the competition abev does maintain a cost advantage over its competitors including heineken specifically according to morningstar in 2018 it incurred total operating costs of brl 209 per hectoliter of beer produced just over half of the brl 357 at a euro real exchange rate of 4 30 incurred by heineken a brewer with comparable volume but a different geographic mix for a regional comparison heineken s latin american arm ccu produced 28 5 million hectoliters of beverage in 2018 at an average operating cost of brl 263 per hectoliter at a real chilean peso rate of 175 abev s cost advantage actually provides a relatively largely economic moat for the company thus according to morningstar abev is ranked number one in brazil 68 argentina 81 bolivia 96 paraguay 90 and uruguay 95 in terms of market share volume risks 1 with such a dominant position already in south and central america ambev s sales volume is very sensitive to the region s gdp growth gdp growth in the region particularly in brazil is very dependent on global demand for commodities with global growth slowing this appears to me to be a very important risk at the present time 2 with most more than 80 of its 2018 revenue coming from south and central america ambev has very limited geographic diversification 3 canada approximately 14 of 2018 revenue is not as profitable as the other segments and it is hard to see where the canadian segment fits into the company s future plans 4 currency depreciation inflation and political risks abound in south and central america 5 with the 3g disciplined management culture in place for almost two decades margin upside is likely now limited as the easiest cost cutting and efficiency measures have already been taken valuation concluding thoughts according to morningstar abev trades at a forward pe of near 21 a trailing pe of approximately 24 and a price to free cash flow of 18 2 meanwhile the brazilian stock market as a whole trades at a forward pe of 12 a trailing pe of 14 and a price to free cash flow of 12 while abev is a solid company with growth limited for the reasons addressed above and with uncertainty in global markets relatively high the premium afforded the company as successful as it has been seems too high i do think some premium is warranted however in addition as a company with a market capitalization of near 70 billion growth is just not going to come as easy as it once did particularly with the company having such high market penetration rates in its primary markets keeping the above risks in mind and with my admittedly very conservative outlook for global growth and with an abev valuation that appears a little rich i reiterate my view noted above that abev is a hold if abev shares retest 4 or fall below 4 however i could get interested saãºde cheers
ever since common core standards ccs for the rest of this article cirriculum was implemented in public schools in most states there has been outrage by teachers students and parents the push for common core began in the united nations bill gates threw many thousands of dollars at this initiative he and his wife didn t care the schools where their children attended did not have ccs i wrote my first article on ccs in 2015 common core standards your child is being taught to be an obedient globalist click to read article excerpts from the article by now most people have heard of common core many students and families have been negatively impacted by this so called national education initiative kids who were a and b students before common core was implemented in their schools are now struggling and their grades falling this has hit our family personally our grandson who is 15 and very smart has been struggling with the new curriculum since it came out he was an honor roll student up to that point and has been talking to me for a couple of years about his frustrations today while speaking with my grandson he told me that it s all over social media about common core i have researched common core and my findings though shocking and despicable should not really surprise those of us who know what is happening in this incredibly evil world and as many of my articles have shown this too is traced back to the united nations common core was put in place for kids to fail that s a pretty strong statement right i will prove this to be true on january 22 of this year the washington post ran a story on a teacher who is finally speaking out about common core jennifer rickert is a 6th grade teacher of 22 years in ny state she has had it with the curriculum and she is speaking her mind she may very well pay a high price for doing so i have the utmost respect for this woman the title of the article in the washington post is teacher common core test set kids up to fail clearly this is a set up for the kids to fail as students learn they make sense out of new information through schema schemata are cognitive frameworks to which they can add to or modify as they learn new information one could compare the requirement for children to understand these passages to expecting them to master algebra before establishing number sense there is no foundation to build knowledge upon over the last few years i have seen many parents cry about their child s new york state test scores and i have seen students cry because they can t complete the tests i began to question the validity of the assessments as they became more and more daunting for my students but i believed that if i continued to incorporate the common core learning standards and provide the highest quality instruction my students would be evaluated fairly during this period i kept the faith in our great state of new york and our educational leaders hoping that there would be a fair resolution for the children optimistically i thought that if i remained professional continuing to comply with the mandates eventually things would change so i remained quiet today i am a broken woman source common core green global and so politically correct as the obama administration bill gates the united nations and other forces seek to finalize the decades old effort to nationalize and even globalize education by bribing and bludgeoning state governments to impose common core one of the key agendas behind the deeply controversial standards has been largely overlooked in essence official un documents and statements by top administration officials reveal a plan to transform american children and students around the globe into what globalists refer to as global citizens ready for the coming green and sustainable world order source molding the children of america to be globalists you see common core is all about molding and re shaping the children of america to be obedient globalists the rights and interests of the individual are pushed aside and the students are being indoctrinated and brainwashed to believe that they must only consider themselves part of the greater good we know that this greater good is the coming new world order global warming and green energy are merely a means to an end the end here refers to the sustainable world order a world where the population is controlled under 500 million and the minds of the people are also controlled by the coming one world government this is why faith in god is in direct conflict with agenda 21 and common core initiative why would a government which plans to control the people want to compete with a belief in and allegiance to god that is why all communist governments demand that their people be atheists they want complete control over the masses to prepare humanity for their vision however requires a new form of education globalists admit unesco calls it education for sustainable development on its website unesco the self styled global education agency actually boasts of its plans the un decade of education for sustainable development 2005 2014 seeks to mobilize the educational resources of the world to help create a more sustainable future the un outfit explains many paths to sustainability exist and are mentioned in the 40 chapters of agenda 21 the official document of the 1992 earth summit education is one of these paths education alone cannot achieve a more sustainable future however without education and learning for sustainable development we will not be able to reach that goal before the term sustainability was in vogue the late un deputy secretary general robert muller the architect of unesco s world core curriculum also offered some insight into the purpose of un led globalized pseudo education the goals assisting the child in becoming an integrated individual who can deal with personal experience while seeing himself as a part of the greater whole in other words promote growth of the group idea so that group good group understanding group interrelations and group goodwill replace all limited self centered objectives leading to group consciousness put another way smash individualism and notions of individual rights replacing them with collectivism source why would the u n want children to fail in a stunning admission posted directly on unesco s website in a document about the agency s education for sustainable development machinations the outfit makes that abundantly clear generally more highly educated people who have higher incomes consume more resources than poorly educated people who tend to have lower incomes the un toolkit for global sustainable education explains in this case more education increases the threat to sustainability read that sentence again and again more education threatens their vision of sustainability as do freedom prosperity humans and more are you beginning to see the vision of the u n and the horrific impact it is already having on children in our public schools brethren the evil of this shakes me to my core no pun intended i wrote this article in hopes that people wake up go to your pta meeting and open up a dialogue about common core write letters to the board of education of your school district write to your state senators write letters to the editor of your town newspapers if you clicked on my whole article you will find that many videos i embedded in that piece have been scrubbed from the internet that is incriminating to the u n and bill gates and all others pushing this nwo garbage down the throats of our children and grandchildren after all who do you think scrubbed the videos source from the federalist com nine years into common core test scores are down and indoctrination up common core sucked all the energy money and motivation right out of desperately needed potential reforms to u s public schools for a decade and for nothing it s been about nine years since the obama administration lured states into adopting common core sight unseen with promises it would improve student achievement like president obama s other big promises if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor this one s been proven a scam if you set and enforce rigorous and challenging standards and assessments if you put outstanding teachers at the front of the classroom if you turn around failing schools your state can win a race to the top grant that will not only help students outcompete workers around the world but let them fulfill their god given potential president obama said in july 2009 he went on to state his faith that common core at that point unwritten would not only make america s entire education system the envy of the world but we will launch a race to the top that will prepare every child everywhere in america for the challenges of the 21st century race to the top was a 4 billion money pot inside the 2009 stimulus that helped bribe states into common core so here we are nine years later common core has been officially rolled out into u s public and even many private schools for at least three to five years now are american children increasingly prepared for the the challenges of the 21st century we re actually seeing the opposite they re increasingly less prepared and there s mounting evidence that common core deserves some of the blame student achievement largely down or flat act scores released earlier this month show that students math achievement is at a 20 year low the latest english act scores are slightly down since 2007 and students readiness for college level english was at its lowest level since act s creators began measuring that item in 2002 students preparedness for college level math is at its lowest point since 2004 sat scores also dropped post common core until it fully implemented a new version tailored for common core how convenient even after the test was overhauled to match common core average test scores increased by 0 7 percent in the most recent results it represents almost no difference to pre common core results and the public can t know exactly how the scores were recentered and altered either in all the previous sat overhauls average scores technically went up but statistical analyses show they ve actually been steadily losing ground over the past 60 years in other words the sat has a history of score inflation and common core is doing nothing to reverse that almost a year ago i wrote about the latest round of international tests that publish every five years they showed u s fourth graders declining on reading achievement the 2015 results on the most reliable nationwide u s test showed the first ever significant decline of 2 3 points about a quarter of a grade level worth in mathematics at both grades 4 and 8 and in grade 4 reading the next iteration of that test showed no gains again during the obama administration writes harvard professor paul peterson no substantively significant nationwide gains were registered for any of the three racial and ethnic groupings in math or reading at either 4th or 8th grade they told us common core would fix this problem we were promised that common core would reverse these trends think tankers michael petrilli and robert pondiscio wrote to west virginians in 2015 that the common core should help to boost college readiness and college completion by significantly raising expectations jeb bush wrote in national review in 2013 to compete with the rest of the world we must produce competitive high school graduates that means we have to make sure that the skills they are learning are aligned with what employers and colleges expect high school graduates to know the common core state standards set an ambitious and voluntary goal line if young people today are to be productive adults in the knowledge economy they need standards that truly prepare them for college and careers obama education secretary arne duncan said in a 2010 speech touting common core we will end what has become a race to the bottom in our schools and instead spur a race to the top by encouraging better standards and assessments president obama said in 2009 standards is jargon for common core in fact common core supporters used the same fail rates we still have almost a decade post common core as a key argument to justify adopting then keeping common core for example bush and former new york city schools chancellor joel klein argued in the wall street journal in 2011 that common core would help address act data showing three fourths of the young men and women entering colleges were not adequately prepared academically for first year college courses instead however the evidence indicates that at best common core made negligible improvements and at worst it s reducedstudent achievement all while soaking up huge amounts of time and money the years of small but visible achievement growth under george w bush have been replaced by zero growth under and after obama the best evidence available indicates american kids have gotten all the academic boost they re going to get out of common core already learning hasn t improved but indoctrination is amped so if u s taxpayers spent billions of dollars and countless public employees man hours switching schools to common core what are we getting out of it certainly not academic achievement growth what we do seem to be getting is plenty of political indoctrination just recently rick hess and grant addison wrote about what s happened to people who have worked for and led organizations that received millions from obama s common core grants and from the bill and melinda gates foundation which also bankrolled common core at its annual standards institute a prominent conference to teach teachers how to teach common core the organization unbounded slathers its common core workshops with race based rancor and junk science providing a snapshot into the ongoing transformation of school reform to keep their teaching licenses many teachers have to regularly attend conferences like these for usually taxpayer sponsored professional development nowadays teacher licensing mandates often specifically require teachers to learn common core themed things so basically to keep their jobs teachers have to learn more about common core the standards institute helps them fulfill that job requirement it did so this year by using common core as a trojan horse to insert wildly leftist arguably racist indoctrination here s hess and addison describing some of their materials unbounded s training in reading and math instruction is grounded in conversations about the roles that race bias and prejudice play in our schools and classrooms its standards institute prepares educators to be equity change agents to become one participants are told they must first acknowledge that we are part of a systematically racist system of education if you are under the impression that there are good white people and bad white people you re wrong unbounded ceo kate gerson told the teachers this year according to hess and addison gerson informed her charges that racial biases are pervasive universal and something you cannot be cured from gerson used to be directly employed by new york taxpayers within the new york department of education s project to create common core compliant curriculum engageny the curricula she helped create didn t stay in new york however it s reached across the country because the obama administration funded it to create one of the few earliest available and widely endorsed set of common core compliant materials so if you re a taxpayer you funded this under the guise of common core funding racism in the name of common core items from engageny s library of common core curricula had been downloaded 45 million times by 2016 education week reported 44 percent of elementary math teachers and 30 percent of secondary teachers in common core states are using materials from engageny after its 28 million in federal funds dried up which only took a few years natch engageny s curriculum bank was spun off into unbounded s control so this organization now peddling wildly inflammatory and divisive political views has affected a third to a half of the country s teachers all oiled by packs of taxpayer cash once upon a time common core critics were roundly mocked for fearing that the reading and math standards would somehow serve to promote sweeping ideological agendas today gerson and her team are doing their best to vindicate those concerns write hess and addison to be sure american education s mediocrity and politicization predate common core and would be present today if common core had never happened but we were sold common core with the promise that it would improve learning for american kids just as the few independent analysts predicted despite costing billions of dollars common core has proven to be of no overall benefit to children teachers families or taxpayers common core sucked all the energy money and motivation right out of desperately needed potential reforms to u s public schools for a decade and for nothing it s more money right down our nation s gigantic debt hole another generation lost to sickening ignorance another set of corrupt bureaucrats careers and bank accounts built out of the wreckage of american minds yet obama went on stage last week and yukked it up about how donald trump goes around blatantly repeatedly baldly shamelessly lying the man who sold us common core who knew we couldn t keep our doctors and kept on promising we could who lied umpteen ways to sunday about his iran deal and myriad other policies he s sure got a lot of nerve and obviously not a lick of self awareness yet alone shame remember this utter debacle next time somebody comes knocking with the next big idea for your kids and wallets hide them both and run the huckster outta town source so brethren many children are in the same predicament as our grandson ethan was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and almost died then common core came to his school and the once honor roll student began floundering and asking why this was happening i m angry over this but i m sure that there are many angry people i try to give this to the lord every day i know that he is in control and i know that he sees the nwo right around the corner from us we must keep our eyes on him our grandson is now in a community college where he is still struggling would you pray for him how can i be saved shalom b

the trump administration just delivered a massive budget to congress a look at the numbers and the talking points drafted to defend it confirms that budgets favor politics over policy this also confirms that it really doesn t really matter who is in the white house big spenders will spend and then dissemble to cover up their fiscal irresponsibility the fiscal year 2020 budget proposes spending 4 7 trillion that s up from 4 5 trillion last year and 4 1 trillion in fy 2018 meanwhile assuming that the tax cuts set to expire in 2025 do not expire tax revenue will grow to 3 6 trillion in fy 2020 up from 3 4 trillion last year and 3 3 trillion in fy 2018 spending between fy 2020 and fy 2029 will grow by 40 percent and thanks to projected gdp growth averaging 3 percent over the next decade revenue may grow by 72 percent during that time despite a growing economy relative peace in the world and no recent national emergencies the annual deficit will reach 1 1 trillion in fy 2020 also 2 trillion has been added to the debt during the last two years while the deficit is projected to be cut in half over the next decade and the debt may stabilize as we shall see these numbers carry little credibility the prediction of 72 percent growth in revenue is propped up by very unrealistic economic growth rates and should put to bed the notion that economic growth rates alone even fallacious ones can get us out of this fiscal mess we are in that s because this deficit is not driven by a lack of economic growth or a shortage of revenues but by constant overspending if you lift the optimistic growth projections the reality looks grimmer according to the committee for a responsible federal budget absent these rapid growth assumptions debt under the president s budget would likely be about 2 trillion higher by 2029 and debt as a share of gdp would reach roughly 85 to 90 percent that means a public debt of 27 77 trillion up from this year s 16 9 trillion it s worth noting that this year s gross debt totals 22 trillion in spite of these numbers the administration claims that the budget promotes fiscal responsibility russ vought acting director for the office of management and budget said look we re 22 trillion in debt we have trillion dollar deficits that are far as the eye can see and we need to do something about it and to be fair the budget does propose 2 7 trillion in spending reduction over the next 10 years but as the numbers above make clear for the most part these spending cuts are not actually cuts in spending they re a reduction to the growth in spending while many of these spending reform proposals are worth implementing they simply aren t realistic the administration s proposed reforms for food stamps student loans disability payments obamacare subsidies or medicare cost controls are great but have no chance of seeing the light of day with a democrat controlled house they have also little chance of being approved because half of them apply to the non defense discretionary side of the budget the budget proposes cutting these expenditures 9 percent between this year and next and 26 percent over the next 10 years i have no objections to cutting non defense spending or cutting it as much as the proposed budget does however cuts of this size are dead on arrival because the amount that the administration cuts from non defense is almost entirely given to national defense what s more the administration uses an old trick practiced by previous administrations it simply increases non war spending through the overseas contingency operations fund which will grow from 69 billion in fy 2019 to 165 billion for fy 2020 this is particularly annoying when considering that many members of this administration understand full well this is a blatant accounting gimmick apparently republicans don t learn from their past mistakes fiscal responsibility can never be achieved on the back of non defense spending alone especially if it s offset by massive growth to defense spending veronique de rugy is a senior research fellow at the mercatus center at george mason university a columnist for reason magazine and the washington examiner and blogs about ecomomics for national review click here to contact her and follow her on twitter veroderugy click here to read previous columns the opinions expressed are her own related stories
the importance of social security in relation to the financial well being of our nation s retired workforce simply can t be overstated when the program was concocted in the mid 1930s it was designed to provide benefits for elderly workers who could no longer provide for themselves back then this was a relatively small group of workers and the average life expectancy was considerably lower today 63 million people receive a monthly benefit check nearly 44 million of whom are retired workers and the average 65 year old is on track to live another two decades in other words social security has very much become a vital income stream for our nation s elderly for what s often an extended period of time two social security cards partially covering a hundred dollar bill image source getty images where you live can make a big difference however the income stream the average beneficiary receives from social security could seem like a pot of gold or a pittance depending on where they live within the united states according to data released in february by the social security administration the average retired worker was netting almost 1 464 a month in benefits meanwhile the average nondisabled survivor benefit to widows or widowers and to disabled workers clocked in at 1 390 and 1 234 respectively if we were to average all of the 63 million benefit checks issued monthly the average social security benefit is 1 344 38 a month or about 16 133 a year this amount is enough to pull more than 15 million elderly americans out of poverty each year but it s also just 29 higher than the federal poverty level of 12 490 in earned income for 2019 one of the biggest differentiating factors with regard to how far your social security dollars will stretch is the state you call home that s because 1 in one state may not buy you the same amount of goods and services in another with this in mind i turned to 2016 data provided by the bureau of economic analysis bea that compared income and cost of living in all 50 states using a base value of 100 to signify an average value for a specific cost across the country the bea was able to rank each state from highest to lowest in terms of cost story continues an elderly man counting a fanned pile of cash bills in his hands image source getty images however rather than just accept the bea s rankings which focus on all american households i homed in on one spending category rent that s because housing costs are easily the highest expenditure for our nation s senior citizens even more so than for working age americans as a percentage of expenditures and more seniors than ever have been turning to renting or entering retirement with mortgage debt than ever before utilizing the bea s real purchasing power index for rental costs the following 10 states should allow the average social security benefit to stretch the farthest alabama 63 2 west virginia 63 2 arkansas 63 8 mississippi 65 0 kentucky 67 1 south dakota 69 3 oklahoma 70 1 ohio 72 8 missouri 73 1 indiana 73 9 the percentages next to each state represent the real purchasing power of that item in this case rent relative to regional price parities in english it just means that states like alabama and west virginia offer average rental rates that are almost 37 100 minus 63 2 below the national average living in any of the above states would allow a social security beneficiary to pay rent that s at minimum 26 below the national average a for rent sign placed on the front lawn in front of a single family home image source getty images another study similar results i cross referenced the bea s results with those of abodo which examined average monthly one bedroom rental rates for all 50 states in 2018 listed in the same order as above here are abodo s rental rate statistics from last year alabama 711 west virginia 713 arkansas 582 mississippi 812 kentucky 736 south dakota 526 oklahoma 613 ohio 682 missouri 710 indiana 685 as you might have expected the figures don t perfectly line up with those from the bea however with an average rental rate of 1 025 nationally all 10 of these states are significantly below that figure in fact with the exception of mississippi which is still 21 below the national average according to abodo rental costs in none of these states would consume more than 55 of the average social security benefit check or 50 of the average retired worker s monthly payout from social security in short these states help your social security income go farther a social security card wedged between irs tax forms image source getty images but wait there s more of course there s more that current and future beneficiaries should be aware of if they re looking to get the most out of their benefits this is especially true of the 62 of current retirees that lean on the program for at least half of their monthly income for example both current and future retirees should be aware of possible state level tax implications on their benefits it might be a surprise to learn that your social security benefits become taxable at the federal level if as a single taxpayer your modified adjusted gross income plus one half of your benefits exceeds 25 000 for married couples filing jointly this figure is 32 000 these thresholds are the same no matter where you live however 13 states also tax social security benefits to some varying degree eight of the 10 states listed above don t tax social security benefits which is a good thing but if you re considering west virginia or missouri you ll want to do a little more homework of the 13 states that do tax benefits none has a larger income exemption than missouri at 85 000 for single taxpayers and 100 000 for couples filing jointly you d need to be quite well off to owe tax on your social security benefits in the show me state comparatively west virginia is one of a select few states that mirrors the federal tax schedule for social security benefits this means that even though rent is cheap you could easily be subjected to double taxation in the mountain state you should also take into consideration that your cost of living regardless of which state you decide to call home is likely to rise over time that s because the purchasing power of social security dollars is on a fairly steady decline the program s inflationary tether the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers cpi w doesn t do a very good job of measuring the costs that seniors are facing namely because it s an index focused on urban and clerical workers as a result important expenses like housing and medical care are underweighted in the calculation leading to insufficient cost of living adjustments ultimately your social security benefit was never designed to replace more than 40 of your income but for those of you who are or may be more reliant on the program deciding where to retire can make a big difference on how far your social

part i of this series tackled the value of gold as a portfolio hedge in this article les nemethy and sergey glekov discuss the very limited stock of gold within the world and the supply and demand of gold elements an investor should also understand before investing is gold this article and also part iii will highlight the low stock and supply of gold coupled with possible spikes in demand that have the potential to create substantial appreciation in gold prices supply the total amount of gold mined in the history of the world is approximately 193 000 tones according to the world gold council estimates of the global amount of gold differ a recent bbc article estimates it at 171 300 tonnes this represents a cube of 20 7 meters on each side when you think about it an incredibly small amount furthermore there does not seem to be that much new supply coming onto the market only about 3 000 tonnes per year in addition to a smaller amount that is recycled the amount mined is quite constant against that backdrop the u s geological survey estimates there are only 52 000 tonnes of minable gold in the world of course more could be identified but environmentalists are also making it much more difficult for new mines to be approved china is the leading gold producing country however a production growth pattern changed to decline in 2017 2018 and is likely to continue due to stricter environmental regulations these regulations particularly related to cyanide in tailings have had a dramatic impact on national gold production however gold supply could increase from russia given a large number of new projects under development mining com notes in short it seems the stock of gold is finite and only limited supply is being added annually to the stock demand demand for gold at a very macro level is best summed up by the following chart gold demand in 2018 tonnes and percentage source world gold council jewelry in 2018 jewelry was by far the largest source of demand particularly in asia india and china gold demand in china tripled between 2004 and 2013 the world gold council says there is potential for further increase in gold demand in china and india due to the fact that reverence for gold seems culturally ingrained and rising affluence and growing middle classes in both countries gold demand has also been growing in other asian countries like indonesia and vietnam central banks another source of demand and recently a growing one has been central banks according to the imf official world gold holdings are almost 33 9 thousand tons as of february 2019 the united states and germany have the highest official holding as gold exceeds 70 of their reserves demand from central banks has recently been increasing significantly from 9 of total gold demand in 2017 to 15 in 2018 the wgc says some past and future potential sources for central bank demand both russia and china have been diversifying away from us dollar reserves de dollarising for these countries holding dollar reserves is a likely source of vulnerability given the tensions with the united states gold represents a safe haven and also a portfolio diversifier according to the world gold council survey 76 of central banks view gold s role as a safe haven asset as highly relevant while 59 cited its effectiveness as a portfolio diversifier china also seeks a greater global role for its currency the yuan central banks of smaller countries also actively purchased gold last year including hungary and poland following article 7 proceedings that were launched by the eu against the two countries hungary increased its gold reserves by ten times to 31 5 tonnes to hedge against future structural changes in the international financial system and because of its lack of counterparty or credit risk polish gold reserves rose by 25 7 tones in 2018 according to john reade chief market strategist at the world gold council reserve asset managers at central banks recognize that they have a very high proportion of their foreign reserves is held in u s dollars if you are looking for an alternative to the u s dollar then i think gold looks more attractive than it did ten or 15 years ago if you look at alternative reserve currencies there are issues with all of them technology the technology sector and especially electronics is a third source of gold demand because of its physical properties pliability corrosion and tarnish resistance it is ideal for coatings for connectors and contacts and gold bonding wire within semiconductor packages due to cheaper alternatives gold s share of the wire bonding market has significantly dropped since 2010 however in 2017 gold use in technology rose by 3 the first year on year increase since 2010 in 2018 this rose by another percentage point reaching 334 6 tonnes the strong demand for consumer electronics and ongoing electrification in the automotive sector drove this annual growth there are also many new uses that may drive demand for gold in the automotive electronics industrial healthcare particularly related to gold in nanoparticulate form and telecommunications e g 5g sectors investment demand for gold has been the most volatile area this includes gold bar and coin gold backed etf s demand goes up when investors require a safe haven as the world economy has done well perception of risk has been low and the price of gold has performed poorly the opposite is also true if financial markets were to become even more volatile or demand for safe haven investments would increase gold has the potential to perform extremely well to summarize analysis of supply and demand for gold shows that the fundamentals may be in place for a rise in gold prices the third and last article in this series will focus on the demand for gold for investment purposes and summarize the case for investing a portion of one s portfolio in gold disclosure les nemethy is long on gold coin gold miners and gold royalties the authors

talk of socialism is suddenly everywhere the journey from a free society to socialism however does not occur overnight it s a stepped process that begins slowly and ends with a rush here are those steps step 1 massive government spending socialist states have government at the center of their economies and feature enormous spending programs bernie sanders will be the democratic nominee here are five reasons why in early 1990s sweden often cited as a socialist state government spending exceeded 70 percent of its economy under president jefferson government spending was approximately 2 to 3 percent of the economy today we are at 36 percent sweden now walking away from socialism has reduced its spending share to just over 50 percent government education retirement and medical care nearly cradle to grave spending are three cornerstones of future socialist states obama once said you can create a governing majority of those dependent on government elizabeth warren is now promoting universal child care which would extend that dependence step 2 massive tax systems that reduce incentives increased tax burdens go hand in hand with spending throughout history tax systems start out simple and wind up complex and burdensome by the end of rome s socialism under diocletian according to the historian will durant taxation rose to such heights that men lost the incentive to work or earn and an erosive context began between lawyers finding devices to evade taxes and lawyers formulating laws to prevent evasion which led romans to flee seeking refuge among the barbarians we have a tax code so complicated and long that few can do their own taxes not satisfied politicians threaten massive income tax hikes wealth tax confiscation and penalties for those who want to leave the country step 3 reduced growth leading to economic stagnation over the last 20 years the european union which featured socialist and semi socialist states had almost zero economic growth over the last 60 years while our governments grew to 36 percent of the economy and imposed trillions in regulation our growth slipped from an average of 4 percent to 2 percent step 4 deficits in semi socialist greece once on the brink of being a failed state government debt as a percentage of the economy is nearly 180 percent that would be like you having credit card debt nearly double your income in the u s that debt ratio has exploded in the last decade rising to nearly 106 percent step 5 governments print money undeterred by deficits or debt governments print money to pay for programs inflation is the result of governments increasing the money supply beyond the needs of economic growth in socialist venezuela inflation is expected to be at least one million percent in 2019 in other words its money isn t worth the paper on which it s printed step 6 government fixes prices and declares when goods can be sold diocletian set wage and price controls for socialist rome in venezuela people can only shop on certain days and shopping malls can only be open two days a week free of that today in the 1970s we had gas rationing and double digit inflation step 7 underground economies rise the more crushing taxation spending inflation and regulations are the larger the underground economy people turn to a barter system because paper money becomes worthless in greece the underground economy is said to exceed 20 percent of the economy america s by contrast is around 5 6 percent step 8 class warfare begins tearing the fabric of society historically class warfare the fight between classes of haves and have nots begins in earnest as economies stagnate that reaches a dangerous apex during prolonged economic stagnation if accompanied by significant wealth inequality of ancient greece plato described two cities one the city of the poor the other of the rich the one at war with the other according to durant the poor schemed to despoil the rich by legislation and revolution the rich organized for protection against the poor ancient greece s bitter class warfare included not only government redistribution but a distrust of democracy as empowered envy a certain outcome in the u s if we abandon the electoral college step 9 total societal discord also in ancient greece debtors when the legislative ransoming of the rich s wealth was not enough murdered creditors as in mytilene today venezuela is in near total societal breakdown as tens of thousands seek to flee the country amidst a socialist dictatorship a growing police state empty store shelves little medicine and even less order those are the steps they don t necessarily occur in order often occur in tandem and don t have a timetable while they take time to develop the rush at the end can be quite rapid as we have seen in venezuela all along the way the power of government grows and rights correspondingly diminish often initiated by a seduced vote of the people in time socialism is maintained by force the united states is not currently a socialist nation our economic vitality remains greatly decentralized a necessity for a stable republic however we have massive government programs if spending increases at the rate it has in the last 20 years socialism will come into view the adoption of medicare for all estimated to yearly cost 3 2 trillion would push our spending as a percent of gdp well above 50 percent and explode our debt even more history of course is not a pre determined straight line wise leaders have steered civilizations away from bad decisions as they have in sweden today click here to get the fox news app on the other hand the fall of the roman republic and greek democracy still serve as harsh warnings to large governments like our own altogether only a fool would rush into more government spending and irretrievable government dependence the wise should rather seek to reduce government in the hopes of avoiding the socialist mistakes of the past
the news out of venezuela today is deeply rooted in u s foreign policy towards central and south america since the end of world war ii caracas venezuela the united states various forms of intervention in venezuela have generally been dressed up and sold to the american public in pro democracy and humanitarian costumes the high minded rhetoric notwithstanding here are the top five real reasons the u s wants regime change in venezuela 1 venezuela is a bolivarian socialist republic the united states has never much liked a socialist cuba less than a hundred miles from its border even worse is much bigger resource rich socialist venezuela just over a thousand miles from florida however it isn t a military invasion that washington fears rather it s that the ruling party the united socialist party of venezuela is far from the u s ideology that benefits western corporations this socialism in practice keeps the u s and other western nations companies from carving up venezuela s natural resources for plunder instead the policies of former president hugo chavez and current president nicolás maduro concerning oil and minerals have been to nationalize the industries so that the venezuelan people can benefit from them not other nations or foreign corporations this keeps the profits within the country benefiting the venezuelan populace and far from the pocketbooks of western companies this policy is alive in neighboring bolivia it has recently existed in ecuador and brazil but coups in recent years have ensured that right wing leaders are now in power there in the past half decade the u s has put pressure on the maduro regime with sanctions washington s purpose was to keep maduro from attaining the socioeconomic success and cult of personality that chavez had the ultimate goal was to overthrow his government 2 venezuela s alliance with russia and iran against u s hegemony venezuelan allies include russia china and iran all of these countries are strongly opposed by washington which hardly shrinks from meddling in other nations affairs or from economic sabotage both russia and china have interests in venezuelan oil they wish to buy it at a fair price which the u s doesn t while the u s has an enduring policy of increasingly brutal sanctions against venezuela russia has an enduring policy of bailing venezuela out china has 60 billion worth of loans and interests in maduro s government in the 2000s the u s and nato allies engaged in military actions in numerous countries and went unchecked however in the past half dozen years russia has become more active in the military sphere most notably in syria this hindrance to the u s military agenda in the middle east can lead washington to lash out against other russian allies especially if they are closer to the u s the reason for the alliance of russia china iran and venezuela is simply that they oppose washington s policy of world domination via the dollar as the world reserve currency and the economic warfare propagated by the u s other opponents of world domination by means of the u s dollar have been syria under assad which caused military intervention by the u s first washington decried assad then the official stance of the u s was that it was there fighting isis but also wanted to replace assad even stronger opposition came from the late leader of libya muammar qaddafi who was the last leader to be executed by forces backed by the u s and its eu allies the u s is targeting russian investments in the venezuelan oil sector venezuela owes rosneft the state backed oil company of russia 2 3 billion it was revealed to the media that there were calls to get investors to raise the money to pay off the loan then rosneft would be required to terminate the loan and transfer it to investors more friendly to the west according to a businessman speaking to reuters under the condition of anonymity the administration should recognize that if it doesn t do something pro active here it will face limited options under almost any scenario whether it is an attempt to foreclose by the current lienholder further restrictions on venezuelan crude oil imports into the u s or even in the event there is a positive political change in caracas this is a private sector solution to a public policy problem 3 oil resources venezuela has vast amounts of oil owning 25 percent of the world s reserves of crude in their nationalization efforts venezuelan governments have disrupted the abilities of western gas companies to be active in venezuela citgo is owned by the state owned oil company of venezuela pdvsa in the early 20th century chavez used high oil prices to collect profits he fairly redistributed the oil wealth to his citizenry and gained widespread support the collapse of oil prices coupled with the death of chavez led to a much more uncertain future for the venezuelan economy despite maduro s best efforts in trade deals the economy has struggled throughout his presidency leading to food and basic necessity scarcity this has allowed western forces to exploit the crisis and throw support behind juan guaidó and his armed opposition the u s government barely hides that it operates for the benefit of its corporations especially when it comes to its foreign policies in a press conference u s national security advisor john bolton said we re in conversation with major american companies now it would make a difference if we could have american companies produce the oil in venezuela we both have a lot at stake here this is history repeating itself in a more blatant fashion than in the 20th century the essequibo region on the eastern edge of venezuela claimed by both venezuela and guyana has been of strategic interest to exxon mobil hoping to steal oil from pdvsa on behalf of guyana in addition to oil venezuela has vast mining resources the government in caracas has been embroiled in legal battles with canadian companies rusuro and crystallex a more business friendly venezuelan government would surely lessen these expensive legal battles 4 imf and world bank financial control upon his election in 1999 former president hugo chavez reaped massive gains for the venezuelan people by nationalizing the oil and gas sector and redistributing the wealth to bring fairness opportunity and a high quality of life to the populace before his election mass privatization of every industry all owned by western based firms reigned supreme the 1990s were immeasurably worse for venezuelans than were the chavez years the u s had corporate interests thwarted by chavez this continued under maduro the u s had no mind to play fair neither did its allies u s ally saudi arabia unnecessarily flooded the market with cheap oil in 2014 engaging in economic warfare with countries with state owned oil companies as a petrostate the venezuelan market took a massive hit and the country has had a ramping up of unrest since then culminating in the crisis we see today in 2007 chavez severed ties with the world bank claiming he wanted no part in institutions dominated by u s imperialism after taking power chavez paid loans off at a rapid pace finishing five years ahead of schedule while doing so he was removing conocophillips chevron exxon mobil and bp from his country and placing the oil and gas sector under state control he and other leftist leaders of the same time period in latin america criticized the lending policies of the u s dominated institution as predatory and perpetuating the poverty of their respective countries for latin america the 1980s were often referred to as the lost decade during the 1970s market shocks in the oil and gas sector created massive deficits for venezuela during the decade the amount owed by latin american countries rose from 29 billion to 327 billion ten years after ties with the world bank were severed the world bank announced that it was ready to help if asked maduro refused to go back to the well that had left the region impoverished for decades 5 expanding u s empire the occupation of latin america the u s has attempted to overthrow the government of venezuela in an even cruder way in the recent past in 2002 the bush administration orchestrated and attempted a coup against then president hugo chavez a gambit that ultimately failed as chavez regained control of the country the news out of venezuela today is deeply rooted in u s foreign policy towards central and south america since the end of world war ii the eisenhower administration overthrew the guatemalan government in 1954 kennedy s administration enacted the bay of pigs invasion in cuba the 1965 military invasion of the dominican republic was orchestrated by lyndon johnson richard nixon installed pinochet in chile in 1973 ronald reagan armed the contras in nicaragua leading to a massive scandal in addition there were also brief invasions of grenada and panama in 1983 and 1989 respectively the u s has had mixed success in its attempts at destabilizing countries arming right wing militias overthrowing leftist governments and installing puppet regimes in the region that policy seems good enough for trump s washington as it keeps to the same path in venezuela now according to the venezuelan government maduro has survived three assassination attempts one where he was to be kidnapped at his presidential palace was named operation constitution and another where he would be assassinated at a military parade was called operation armageddon top photo an anti government protester holds a shield brandished with photos of

the unfolding events in haiti are a despairing call for social and economic justice in the absence of rule of law the folks in the streets who kept haiti on lockdown since february 7th are clear about their demands as miami herald s jacqueline charles has reported they want the 58th president jovenel moïse to vacate his post because they have no confidence in his leadership since he took office in 2017 moise an outsider to the political machine but with the support of the united states and the core group has failed to deliver on promises to alleviate the suffering of the nation and his administration is accused of perpetuating the kleptocratic practices of predecessor michel martelly founder of phtk bald head party both were brought to power by elections contested by haitian institutions including an election observer commission but ultimately validated by the international community what is seemingly uniting the protesters is staunch determination to completely uproot the corruption infesting public administration they seek to put an end to the impunity that continues to protect those who are culpable and eradicate a state system beholden to the oligarchy and an international community that habitually interferes in haitian affairs in that sense the call to oust this president is a yearning for systemic change with the hopes of addressing an on going structural crisis that dates back to the haitian revolution this ultimatum which has been brewing for some time began to erupt volcanically in july 2018 its most recent spark was the petro caribe corruption scandal involving the disappearance of nearly 4 billion from venezuela intended for public works and social service projects which prompted the where did the money go campaign in woy magazine a kreyòl online venue filmmaker etant dupain adds more context to the unrest he wrote july 5 7 a part of the haitian population that is frustrated tired and feel they are neglected took to the streets and caused a lot of damage people died people were hurt property was lost in this spontaneous movement that gave a clear signal if everyone got the message it does not seem to have reached jovenel moise last year those who know haiti intimately issued warnings they insisted the country was especially ripe for a sociopolitical revolution as organizer ilio durandis proclaimed unless government became proactive more unrest would inevitably follow as the institute for justice and democracy for haiti director brian concannon penned to no surprise protesters took to the streets again in november and this past historic week february 7th 1986 marked the end of the duvalier dictatorship as i have written elsewhere anything you have read about haiti thus far will remind you of an all too common and limited narrative the first black republic is the poorest nation in the western hemisphere what almost none of them will mention is that haiti also has one of the highest numbers of millionaires per capita in the region ninety percent of the country s wealth is held by only 2 of its population rapper k lib mapou lyrically meditates on this acute inequality in petwopozisyon non with a sample of a crooning edith piaf k lib remarks ten million people with less than two dollars and just a few hundred holding 3 billion doctors and nurses without a salary while their wives and mistresses are giving birth overseas the haitian business elite once dubbed morally repugnant remains an indifferent class that pays no taxes and lives in luxury many participate in a patronage system that supports local gangs which are predisposed to use their poorest compatriots especially during times of unrest in their on going wrestling match for power amongst themselves along with the state machinery the elite has historically engaged in what is called a politique de doublure the exchange and reinforcement of economic and political power for their own benefit at the expense of the masses historically both have had to contend with persistent foreign intervention u s occupation and minustah and relations with international monetary institutions that undermine the republic s sovereignty the disenfranchised majority population remains perpetually caught between this socio economic extreme with its anti blackness practices and this predatory state with disdain for restavèk or servant leadership the state not only refuses a social contract with the nation government provided services remain non existent throughout the country but abdicated its responsibility to its people relegating them to christian and other ngos moreover in the haitian diaspora we know and feel this our remittances which according to a world bank is one third of the economy functions as the only social welfare net this reality is obscured by a façade of calmness that is assumed whenever haiti is not in the news yet daily life continues to be expensive for example the haitian gourde which had been stable for nearly a decade has been on a downward spiral the last year plunged earlier this month lavi che the high cost of living is another kreyòl expression that explains the desperation of a vulnerable population that must cope with crisis after crisis as a result of both natural and manmade disasters in a global economy that favors the wealthy whether it is hurricanes earthquakes botched development projects excessive waste of resources for carnivals and abuses by un peacekeepers cholera and or missionaries with impunity oppressed haitians routinely express their dissatisfaction those in power simply don t want to hear since haiti has always been at the avant garde of debates concerning atlantic freedom what we are witnessing in the palatable anger and violence on the streets is perhaps the tipping point of dynamics that go back to the inception of the republic centuries ago simply put haiti is in the midst of an ongoing class war unlike previous democratic crises from the fall of the 28 year duvalier dictatorship or coups against jean bertrand aristide the current regime s opposition which remains a complex and fragile amalgamation of im possible alliances with many grasping for power it includes an internet savvy younger population as well as former middle class people who are fed up with inheriting discontent and hopelessness frankly they know it is structurally impossible for them to make a generative life under these subhuman conditions the current manifestations taking place are in part enactments of an oppressed majority s outright refusal to be casualties of a vampiric system in which they are nothing more than cheap labor if that since unemployment is staggering it is a system that has rendered the country invivab unlivable as it continues to dehumanize the majority population and deny youths a future pèp la bouke is the saying in kreyòl people are tired still without dismissing historical particularities this uprising must be understood as part of a global phenomenon of popular responses to an ever increasing wealth gap that makes a mockery of the gilded age poor people all over the world are revolting against big capital whether it is south africa mexico pakistan turkey venezuela france or the united states in that regard haiti is no exception what we are seeing is the absolute failure of what late haitian anthropologist michel rolph trouillot called the longest neocolonial experiment in the history of the west this tumultuous class struggle is a remnant of the unfinished business of the only successful slave revolution in the world the first black republic remains at the crossroads president moïse s response after eight days of silence did little to quell the protesters travel advisories are on highest alert as the international community is fleeing local journalists are standing firm denouncing the government s turn to even more repressive tactics outright killing protesters who are seeking a hopeful and sustainable life to realize the elusive revolutionary ideals of liberté fraternité egalité it is difficult to tell what is next for my beloved homeland it is clear that no concrete change will come unless the path ahead confronts the persistent unequal distribution that characterizes haitian life nou rete nap gade we wait and we watch
it s a federal program that sends millions of dollars a year to communities for everything from housing repairs to street paving local leaders say they can t do without the community development block grant program president trump on the other hand wants to get rid of it he left the 3 3 billion program out of his budget proposal this week just like he did in 2017 and like last time it will likely be restored he typically reduces it significantly cuts it out altogether perhaps knowing that congress will restore it said rep brian higgins d buffalo congress i am confident will restore this cut but the program created in 1974 already is a shadow of its former self when higgins was on the buffalo common council 25 years ago the federal program provided the city nearly 30 million a year last year buffalo received about 13 7 million trump contends state governments not washington are better positioned to fund local projects the program s supporters say its fate matters to a city like buffalo where 31 percent of residents and 47 percent of children live below the poverty level according to census figures this is not slush fund money pork barrel money said buffalo common council president darius pridgen this is money that is going directly into some of the most devastated communities wasteful and ineffective the trump administration doubts the program s effectiveness and it s not the first administration to believe so the obama administration reduced the cdbg program since 1980 and most recently in 2013 hud studies found that cdbg is not well targeted to the poorest communities and has not demonstrated a measurable impact on communities housing and urban development spokeswoman olga alvarez said the cdbg program was created in 1974 when then president nixon asked congress to combine federal anti poverty programs into block grants the fight over the block grant program erupts regularly usually when an administration seeks to reduce or cut the program steven malanga a fellow at the manhattan institute has called the program one of the nation s most wasteful and ineffective domestic spending programs the 42 year old institute bills itself as a leading voice of free market ideas which seeks to foster greater economic choice and individual responsibility malanga said the anti poverty focus has largely been lost in new york state they ve given it to little towns to fix up their city halls malanga told the news they give it to after school programs and what s been lost over the years is that these are supposed to be anti poverty programs malanga said it s not surprising now that someone like trump would say let s get rid of it malanga said the program is vulnerable because for years adherents of the program have resisted efforts to measure the results of the groups that get funding to bring accountability to the program but its political backers broadened the program s base of support by making more middle class communities eligible malanga said investigative reporting and hud audits have revealed serious problems with how local governments have administered the block grants buffalo has received hundreds of millions of dollars in cdbg funding over the decades but reporting by the buffalo news and investigative post as well as analyses by hud have shown limited results in 2004 a news investigation showed much of the money was squandered through city hall mismanagement such as loans that were never repaid for development of the theatre district and other efforts that did little to reduce poverty a 2009 hud report said buffalo wasted block grants on top heavy bureaucracy and by directing the money to upscale housing projects a 2011 audit confirmed problems with job creation and delinquent loans the development corporation s job creation goal was 120 for 2008 and 2009 but only 46 jobs were added as a result of its lending program malanga cited buffalo s troubled record in a 2017 article he wrote for city journal among the most troubled cdbg funded efforts as buffalo s example underscores are loans to help businesses in lower income neighborhoods he wrote other cities have had similarly lousy loan experiences the cdbg has sent some 150 billion to impoverished neighborhoods in baltimore buffalo newark and other struggling cities with little or nothing positive to show for it he wrote worse the cdbg has created a local patronage racket funding politically connected nonprofits that do little to spur economic development a staple of development local government leaders vehemently disagree with the criticism and oppose any cuts in a word it would be devastating said jamestown mayor sam teresi whose city received almost 1 5 million last year in cdbg and other grants from hud it would be a fool s errand to propose and then to approve the elimination of these critically important and staple community development initiatives teresi said this is one of those things that from the perspective of mayors all across the country is shocking and we believe just illogical said niagara falls mayor paul a dyster whose city received more than 2 8 million in 2018 if these funds are cut any more than they are now they really need to be increased we can count on some communities not seeing the growth that is needed pridgen said hud determines the grants based on a formula that uses population median income and even the age of housing stock those community block grants are an integral part of the revitalization of our neighborhoods pridgen said we depend on them especially in the lower income areas of our city if those dollars go away it s going to be very very difficult to continue the infrastructure and programming needs of those communities the latest edition of buffalo s annual action plan for using cdbg funds is 294 pages long it includes 2 3 million for community center improvements almost 1 48 million to repair more than 100 streets 1 78 million for sidewalk improvements and 912 500 for parks and swimming pools we have roads that have seen better days community centers in areas that have no other recreation pridgen said for instance in the ellicott district block grants helped the friends of the elderly building to do some repairs and additions including the pratt community center these projects are important especially to areas where you have high rates of poverty the city uses grants for everything from demolition of abandoned houses to after school programs for at risk youth and senior citizen activities despite trump s effort to kill the program buffalo actually received a 1 2 million increase for 2018 19 in the main cdbg program it also received 3 25 million in the companion home program a 950 000 increase communities use home often in partnership with not for profit entities to directly subsidize rents for low income people or to buy build or maintain low income housing in buffalo home money has been used to help create parkview apartments in the former school 59 on best street and the mount aaron missionary baptist church senior facility on genesee street to name two worthy projects erie county and the towns of amherst cheektowaga hamburg and tonawanda also received block grants in 2018 elsewhere in western new york niagara falls jamestown and dunkirk received cdbg money erie county executive mark poloncarz parceled out some of erie county s 3 million cdbg grant primarily in 100 000 chunks to communities that otherwise wouldn t have received cdbg funding the current lineup of projects includes street repaving in lackawanna and west seneca park restroom upgrades in boston and sardinia senior center improvements in lancaster brant and evans water projects in springville and north collins and renovations to the hollywood theater in gowanda in the absence of a major infrastructure bill these 100 000 contributions to various community improvement projects become very substantial higgins said it lessens the reliance on the property tax at the local level to fund those kinds of things niagara falls has set up a participatory budgeting process in which residents can vote on how to spend the federal money since 2012 niagara falls has used cdbg money to assist nearly 400 home buyers and homeowners along with more than 80 demolitions 20 commercial facade renovations 15 park improvement projects and an average of three youth programs per year there s always more worthy projects asking for that funding than you could possibly fund in any given year dyster said hud rules require the money to be spent only in portions of a community that meet low to moderate income thresholds for example hamburg supervisor james m shaw said his town s 407 000 in 2018 cdbg funds could be used only in blasdell and woodlawn in a small part of the village of hamburg and in rural areas along the town s borders with eden and boston shaw said the grants enabled hamburg to repave roads and make infrastructure repairs in those areas it took a tremendous strain off our local budget shaw said it really helped in the geographic areas where we needed the help most cheektowaga has a housing assistance program but community and economic development director rich willis said the town also uses its 1 million in cdbg money to fund summertime police foot patrols in low income neighborhoods a domestic violence program and a summer day camp for children in amherst the bulk of the town s 575 000 cdbg program goes into a homeowner rehab program where homeowners can access zero percent loans on their homes to do rehab work said laurie stillwell who coordinates the town s cdbg program in a town of 125 000 people you re going to have poverty situations where people are in need of extra support amherst supervisor brian j kulpa said a lot of it goes to emergency repairs stillwell said the seniors who take advantage of it a lot of them are house poor right now our waiting list has about 60 people on it it s a six to eight month wait if it s not an emergency situation the town wouldn t have the wherewithal to offset construction costs for homeowners who need help with housing rehabilitation kulpa said
tens of thousands of australian high school students participated in strikes yesterday demanding immediate action to address climate change and environmental destruction the rallies were part of a series of protests around the world including across europe and in the united states the demonstrations were the largest in australia involving high school students since at least 2003 when there were mass protests against the illegal us led invasion of iraq an estimated 30 000 participated in sydney with similar numbers in melbourne around 10 000 protested in brisbane the state capital of queensland while thousands rallied in perth adelaide and hobart in newcastle a working class regional city north of sydney at least 2 000 demonstrated dozens of smaller protests were held in country towns and regional centres across the country the size of the rallies makes clear that young people who have grown up amid endless war soaring inequality and an assault on the working class are being propelled into political struggle they are animated not only by concern over the destruction of the environment but also the dominance of the banks and corporations over every aspect of social and political life the rise of militarism and the turn to authoritarianism by governments around the world in the lead up to the strike senior politicians and the corporate press expressed the fear and hostility of the political establishment at the emergence of a movement among young people members of the federal liberal national coalition government denounced the students as truants while the murdoch media ran a stream of articles claiming that the protests were the result of left wing indoctrination in high schools teachers who publicly supported the rallies were threatened with punitive measures bill shorten the federal labor leader also condemned the protests demanding that students demonstrate outside of school hours his comments underscored the fact that labor and the trade unions are no less hostile to independent political action by young people and workers than their liberal national counterparts other politicians however including nsw labor leader michael daley and leading greens representatives declared their support for the rallies this was one expression of a coordinated attempt by labor the greens the unions and middle class environmental groups to subordinate the movement of high school students to the very parties that are responsible for environmental degradation these efforts were on display at the rally in sydney which was tightly controlled by the australian youth climate coalition aycc a non government organisation with close ties to labor the greens and the union bureaucracy the aycc was established ten years ago it is closely linked to getup an organisation that operates as a campaign lobby group for labor and the greens getup was founded prior to the 2007 federal election to channel mass hostility to the federal coalition government of john howard behind the election of a big business labor government like getup the aycc has substantial financial resources and a full time staff of at least 68 people high school students who addressed the sydney rally condemned the continuing use of coal including the establishment of the carmichael mine in central queensland by multinational corporation adani they denounced the close ties between the major parties and the coal industry some denounced labor mps for refusing to commit to ending the expansion of coal mining and to action to stem climate change others spoke powerfully on the devastating impact of climate change on the pacific islands and on the dire plight of aboriginal communities partly resulting from environmental degradation and a lack of clean water sources reflecting the influence of the aycc however the student speakers called on young people to pressure the official political parties including by calling and texting bill shorten s office the official line of the rally and of the aycc was most graphically demonstrated by the decision to introduce sydney lord mayor clover moore as the keynote speaker moore has been mayor since 2004 she was previously an independent member of the new south wales legislative assembly from 1988 to 2012 moore is part of the political establishment with the closest of ties to labor the greens and the unions she has built a base of support among privileged layers of the upper middle class on the basis of identity politics race gender and sexual orientation and by posturing as a defender of the environment moore s speech centred on calls for the ouster of the liberal nationals in the upcoming new south wales and federal elections she noted that most of the students present were not old enough to vote but pathetically called upon them to appeal to relatives to cast a ballot against the coalition moore touted a recent court ruling blocking the establishment of a new mine and absurdly claimed that limited reductions in carbon emissions by sydney city council pointed the way forward in the fight against climate change moore s implicit claim that greens backed labor governments would resolve the environmental crisis are an utter fraud labor and the greens are as responsible for the failure to address climate change as the liberal national coalition the greens backed federal labor government of julia gillard did nothing to stem carbon emissions when it was in office from 2010 2013 under its signature carbon tax policy australia s carbon emissions actually increased according to labor s own 2012 modelling if the tax had remained in place from 2012 to 2020 annual national carbon emissions would have grown from 582 to 621 million tonnes by 2020 emissions trading schemes promoted by the greens are just as worthless where they have been introduced in europe and elsewhere they have succeeded only in establishing lucrative opportunities for green businesses and creating new markets for financial swindlers and speculators to exploit moreover a federal labor government would deepen australia s alignment with the us drive to war including against nuclear armed china while implementing austerity measures aimed at making the working class pay for the deepening economic crisis a labor government would also continue australia s role in the persecution of wikileaks publisher julian assange for exposing us led war crimes mass surveillance and diplomatic intrigues and would expand moves towards a police state the sharpest expression of the aycc s role in seeking to suppress any discussion of the broader issues confronting young people and an alternative perspective was its attempts to censor the international youth and students for social equality iysse the youth wing of the socialist equality party at the sydney and melbourne rallies at both demonstrations aycc operatives approached iysse campaigners and demanded that they cease distributing leaflets iysse representatives insisted on their democratic right to disseminate political material and continued to campaign in melbourne a group of students who witnessed the aycc s actions encouraged the iysse to continue campaigning and took a large bundle of leaflets the attempts by the political establishment to co opt the climate strike movement must be resisted climate change is a product of the profit system and the irrational division of the globe into competing capitalist nation states what is required is a turn to the working class and the construction of a mass socialist movement against war inequality and authoritarianism only by establishing a world socialist society based on social need not private profit can the scourges of climate change poverty and the threat of nuclear war be ended
architect and north sider jamil ford has helped design numerous buildings that went up in north minneapolis in the last decade in a few months he will lead a development of his own several entrepreneurs such as ford and nonprofit organizations are working to bolster local ownership and affordable leasing of commercial properties in north minneapolis especially local businesses led by people of color who they fear could be displaced as the area develops you talk to anybody on the north side and they can feel the change said jeff washburne executive director of the city of lakes community land trust one of the organizations involved in the effort it s racially it s economically it s containers on the street people rehabbing homes it s flipping quick and values are going up all these guys that have been holding onto these properties along broadway that price point is going to get to the right point and they are going to start selling and the community will have no say in what happens earlier this month protesters at a city council meeting voiced their concerns over the upper harbor terminal project a 48 acre redevelopment of an industrial stretch along the mississippi river which some fear will lead to the gentrification of the surrounding north minneapolis neighborhoods the area has already begun to price out some small businesses and community advocates said it s best to be proactive before more development dollars begin to trickle in the directors of the city of lakes community land trust voted last month to start a pilot land trust program for commercial properties similar to what it has done for more than 200 families to buy homes with the help of about 200 000 of seed money provided by the jay rose phillips family foundation the commercial land trust would purchase and redevelop a commercial property for possible lease or eventual sale to midsize businesses from the community if the building is sold the commercial land trust would provide a renewable ground lease for the property similar to the residential land trust the commercial land trust would be made up of members from the community who elect an advisory board that makes decisions about properties thereby safeguarding the community s interests this is an opportunity to provide community members and residents a way to impact real estate outside of planning and zoning said erin jerabek heelan who worked as a consultant for the project the real power is whoever owns the land more funding from other potential partners such as government entities like the city of minneapolis would be needed and the group also wants to hire a director for the program by midsummer the land trust is a fine strategy but if we are going to want solutions we are going to need a lot more strategies said john francis bueche executive director of the west broadway business and area coalition high vacancy rate on the west broadway commercial corridor only 17 percent of business owners own the space they are occupying according to a 2018 report for the coalition completed by the university of minnesota about 22 percent of commercial spaces on west broadway sit vacant and many buildings need substantial renovations due to deferred maintenance for new developments which have higher lease rates national retail chains with proven track records often are more appealing to property owners than local businesses there aren t enough spaces that are affordable said warren mclean president of the northside economic opportunity network neon which has offices on west broadway in 2016 neon opened a business incubator that offers members co working space as well as private offices the space is busy although mclean said he is concerned about the vacancies on other parts of west broadway it is a drive through and not a destination he said of the corridor the challenge is that it needs to be in the right hands neon is exploring the idea of creating a fund to redevelop commercial property in north minneapolis mclean said the community reinvestment fund crf which is based in minneapolis is working to establish an opportunity zone fund that could funnel development dollars into north minneapolis and other areas opportunity funds are designed to spur economic development in economically distressed areas by allowing investors to delay or avoid paying capital gains taxes if they invest in one our vision is to create a fund that will be a source of friendly equity capital sort of like people have when they have a rich relative said frank altman co founder and chief executive of crf with construction prices and other costs on the rise it can often take a variety of financial resources to get a commercial development off the ground in north minneapolis said shannon rusk senior vice president of development for oppidan investment co you need to look at the demographics and build to the needs of that market said rusk who was part of the team who oversaw the recent development of the north market grocery store which was a project of nonprofit pillsbury united communities owning their dreams across the street from the north market entrepreneur houston white has his own vision of success his barbershop coffee joint clothing store h white men s room hwmr is the center of his idea to create a commercial hub of the webber camden neighborhood which he has dubbed camden town white wants to create a node of other small businesses in an expansion he plans to build on his corner of n 44th and n humboldt avenues the development would have a larger barber shop patio restaurant maker s space ice cream shop wine bar and possibly micro apartments on an upper level this corner is black excellence white said using a term that he emblazons on the clothing he sells that s what we do here we aren t dependent on any one part of the business white who used to build luxury homes said he believes in the free market over programs such as land trusts which he said don t generate enough wealth for the purchaser who never really owns the property i m not against nonprofits but you have to invest in us and get out of the way white said you aren t going to own our dreams chris webley chief executive of co working and event venue new rules thinks there can be a middle ground between private and public financing for development he has partnered with the phillips family foundation and black owned tri construction to own and develop a more than century old building at 927 w broadway and an addition for offices a gallery and food pop up space maker s space and music venue last year the city awarded the group exclusive development rights for the 5 million redevelopment with the trio expecting to break ground in august the long term goal is for tri construction and new rules to eventually refinance the project s debt and buy out the foundation s interest the same processes that developers have been using to date aren t working in terms of the issues of lack of ownership and lack of affordable spaces said webley who also owns new rules current space on lowry avenue ford who grew up on the north side said north minneapolis residents and stakeholders should be at the forefront of the area s revitalization rather than hoping the right developer comes along we are the people that have the answers he said in an interview last week ford co founded mobilize design and architecture and plans with his ideal development group to redevelop two vacant city owned buildings on n fremont avenue into baldwin square a complex inspired by writer and playwright james baldwin baldwin square will consist of a bookstore art gallery restaurant second floor offices and a black box theater which ford said he hopes will provide guests with an intimate experience that raises the bar for what amenities are currently offered in the area we want to change the perception of north minneapolis nicole norfleet 612 673 4495 twitter nicolenorfleet

gross margin from sales of battery packs zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager total operating expenses in 2018 were 21 9 million a decrease of 45 9 from 40 4 million during 2017 the decrease in total operating expenses was due to the largely decreased research and development expenses in 2018 zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager gaap net loss in 2018 was 5 7 million or 0 11 loss per fully diluted share compared with gaap net loss of 28 3 million or 0 59 loss per fully diluted share in 2017 the decreased in net loss was primarily attributable to the increased gross profit the decrease in r d expenses and the increased government grants the company received this year zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager income before income tax in 2018 was 2 1 million compared to loss of before income tax of 31 6 million in 2017 the increased income tax expense is many due to the 6 0 million valuation allowance of hainan facility s deferred tax assets because of three year accumulated loss in its construction period after other income tax adjustments the income tax expense in 2018 was 7 8 million zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager non gaap net loss in

zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager operator we are ready to take some questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions we will now take our first question from ted schwartz please go ahead ted schwartz tas associates analyst i notice that you re having an income tax expense of 7 7 million whereas both the joint venture and kandi itself showed a loss i don t understand where that 7 7 million income tax expense came in could you explain that kewa luo investor relations manager i m sorry can you just repeat one more time your phone is a little skipping ted schwartz tas associates analyst pardon me kewa luo investor relations manager hello would you please repeat your question one more time your phone is little skipping ted schwartz tas associates analyst i don t understand how there could be a 7 7 million income tax expense when both the joint venture and kandi showed a loss zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager okay this actually is not the income tax that we paid but however has to be accounted as expense in our financial statements but most of the part is due to the 6 million valuation allowance of hainan facility deferred tax asset because the hainan facility s bringing accumulated loss in its construction period and the rest of 1 7 million is from other subsidiaries who is profitable altogether 7 7 million was accounted for the income tax expenses ted schwartz tas associates analyst what models of cars are there presently are presently in production multiple speakers the 22s the 27 the ex3 and what about the k23 in hainan kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language okay right now there are k23 k22 and ex3 are presently in production and in march we have plans of 300 k23 stacked up ev parts for the production in hainan facility ted schwartz tas associates analyst would you be producing and selling in hainan in march kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager right now since we still rely on geely s manufacturing license so it s going to be sales of the ev part sets hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager so if we plan to have these 300 sets of ev parts produced this month so the sales probably will happen next month ted schwartz tas associates analyst all right thank you very much not sure i understand it but kewa thank you take the next question kewa luo investor relations manager thank you operator we can take next question operator thank you our next question comes from frank vladermann please go ahead frank vladermann analyst yes and good morning can you hear me ok kewa luo investor relations manager yes go ahead frank vladermann analyst okay i have a question involving carbon credits trading i believe that carbon credit trading maybe an important source of revenue for the joint venture going forward can you give us a present status of this program how is this being looked at and implemented in china or has that not yet been fully decided kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager carbon credit trading policy is still in the planning stages we don t know the details of the benefits until the policy is released we have heard a lot of news regarding to it but we haven t seen any final policy that being released frank vladermann analyst okay very good thank you very much i may have another question later please take the next questioner kewa luo investor relations manager thank you operator we will now take our next question from li ghou ph please go ahead li ghou analyst good evening to hu and good morning kewa my question is about the 2019 the production and sales so what was basic inaudible for the 2019 car production and sales is it because of the subsidy delay or it is something else it is something else then what s the steps the company is going to do to resolve this issue if this was the subsidy delay do you have a transfer in when the subsidy might get to be paid foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager due to the changes in the subsidy policy also the delay in the payment sales will definitely be affected as for now the subsidies from 2015 and 2016 already in the process of clearing and we anticipate that we re going to receive this part of the subsidy payment very soon and we re also being told that the subsidy from 2017 and 2018 will be start clearing and start paying very soon as well and so the company is seeking breakthroughs in the government credit online ride haling vehicle market and in the us we have been doing a lot of work and we believe that 2019 we re going to have very promising result li ghou analyst i have another question this is about the cars being produced so mr hu just mentioned that the cars are being produced mostly k22 k27 and ex3 so where are they produced now foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language li ghou analyst actually i heard some news cars are being moved to be produced in rugao is there any particular reason and what is your plan for the plant in shanghai factor or somewhere else foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language li ghou analyst thank you kewa luo investor relations manager let me translate what mr hu just said first of all the first question where are k27 k22 and ex3 being produced the answer is all these cars are being produced at jiangsu rugao so the gentleman is asking why we produce all these cars at one location on the jiangsu rugao instead of spread out them in different locations for example in shanghai and mr hu s answer is because we used to rely on geely s manufacturing license but however right now rugao already has the production license so rugao can produce all these vehicles at one location to save the cost and also to centralize all the production at one place in the past we used to produce k10 at zhejiang factory and k11 at shanghai but since right now we don t have a lot of volume so we centralized everything at the jiangsu rugao and some for some k23 ev parts we do separate in hainan li ghou analyst i have one more question i think the management needs to clarify to the western investors who are often confused by the process actually i am super clear about that this is just for clarification so people are really confused about that process of the manufacturing licence approval currently kandi has the approval from the ndrc the national development and reform commission so and as mr hu just mentioned we are waiting for the speculative approval from miit so when do you expect that to happen foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language li ghou analyst foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language li ghou analyst foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager okay sure so and this question is regarding to the dual production license that we mentioned earlier and mr hu would like to further clarify what this means to us and we believe there has been some confusion regarding the approval of this license issued by the development and reform commission and actually the ndrc approved enterprise to build the factory so that s the first license and the next step is the acceptance of the factory by the ministry of industry and information technology as a result once miit approves the company and the company factory will be able to produce the cars and that s the second license and together it s called dual production license that company is applying and usually there are three steps which is the car has to be included in the include in the directory in order to be registered in china to be able to be driven on the road so basically those are three steps in order for you sell the car and then the car will be finally available in the market and this is the same procedure for all the manufacturers in china and for kandi we have already sent our application for getting the miit approval in the beginning of march and we expect to hear from them in the beginning of april li ghou analyst thank you kewa thank you mr hu kewa luo investor relations manager thank you operator we will now take our next question from john destefano ph please go ahead john destefano analyst good evening my question is in regard to export to the united states of the k22 and ex3 my understanding from what i gathered from your opening and what i read in the press release is that approval is still pending for sale in california so if that is correct are dealerships in place ready to go in california once the approval has been obtained and what ports do you expect to export the automobiles to in california in the us and my understanding multiple speakers excuse me my understanding also is from your opening that you plan to export these automobiles to the us later this year is that correct kewa luo investor relations manager let me translate first foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager these two models can be sold in the us nationwide so it s not just in california so there was no any awaiting application to be not waiting any application in california right now we re in the process of forming a sales force team and the company anticipates that we re going to import 50 evs to 100 evs by the end of may with regards to which ports will be used for importing vehicles into the us i think the us sales team is working on it to choose the most cost efficient one john destefano analyst okay thank you very much kewa luo investor relations manager thank you operator we will now take our next question from mike pfeffer from oppenheimer please go ahead mr pfeffer your line is now open please go ahead it appears he may have stepped away from his headset we will now take our next question from beth mozan ph please go ahead beth mozan analyst i understand that the k23 is going to be designed for the ride hailing business has the hainan factory started meaningful production and if not can you let me know when it might start and the reason and second part have there been discussions with hainan about their emulating the rmb730 million low interest loan program as is in place with jiangsu province kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager we have already planned 300 k23 sets of ev parts for production in march at hainan factory in regarding to the discussions with the government about the supply chain finance support program there haven t been any discussions yet because in hainan we are just producing the parts but in jiangsu rugao we already started producing the evs beth mozan analyst thank you kewa luo investor relations manager thank you we will now take our next question from steve miller please go ahead steve miller analyst thank you two related questions for 2019 this year what are you anticipating to be the revenue for the jv and kandi from the 300 000 ev framework agreement and the 20 000 ev co operation agreement that were announced earlier this year and related to that i understand there is the 20 000 kilometer requirement to be reached by vehicles in the car share program before you can apply for subsidy payment is that going to negatively affect the jv s ability to produce these vehicles that s it kewa luo investor relations manager so first question is about on the revenue for jv right the second question is whether the 20 000 kilometers mileage will be the requirement for the ride hailing program steve miller analyst my first question i guess is what revenues are you anticipating from both agreements and then the second question is whatever cars that are sold in connection with those agreements do they have to comply with that 20 000 kilometer requirement in order to be able for you guys to be able to apply for the subsidy payment kewa luo investor relations manager okay thank you foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager this contract was signed in order to serve the implementation of the 300 000 government credit online ride hailing vehicle alliance program we expect the program to begin in april i don t think there will be any impact on the 20 000 kilometers requirement for the subsidy because each vehicle that is used for online ride hailing service usually runs 8 000 kilometers per month on average so in three months they will be well exceed the 20 000 kilometer requirement operator we will now take our next question from mark kahnau from swiss liquid future please go ahead mark kahnau swiss liquid future analyst yes good morning hello and good evening everybody it seems to me that for the first nine months the jv was effectively breakeven kandi wrote off only 43 000 but by the end of the year there was an after tax loss of 17 8 million that means for me the joint venture must have written off about 35 million in the fourth quarter is that correct and if it s correct for what reason kewa luo investor relations manager i m sorry can you just say slowly one more time so i can translate mark kahnau swiss liquid future analyst through the first nine months of the year the joint venture effectively was breakeven that s what that we could read in the figures kandi wrote off 43 000 by the year end share of loss after tax of the joint venture was 17 8 million but that means to me that the joint venture must have written off 35 million in the fourth quarter is this correct and if it s correct for what reason kewa luo investor relations manager okay foreign language zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager okay okay this is due to in q4 there is rmb160 million research r d expenses for jv in q4 mark kahnau swiss liquid future analyst okay i get that okay very good that s it from me for today kewa luo investor relations manager okay thank you operator we will now take our next question from harris goldman please go ahead harris goldman analyst hello it s been a long time since i talked to mr hu we made the trip i organized the trip in 2014 when we were having quite a few detractors saying that we never existed and of course we proved that wrong anyway my question is i m a little confused and need a little clarification regarding the guidance for this year i see in mr hu s statement we re projecting 20 000 units now my confusion is we have a framework agreement for 300 000 over five years and we have the other 20 000 on accredited units is mr hu taking a very conservative stance regarding jv production this year or would he provide a clarification on why he s only guiding to 20 000 units kewa luo investor relations manager okay foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager well as i mentioned earlier that for 2018 we are glad that we were able to survive and for 2019 we want to look forward to do a revival so in this year even though we have these contracts laid out for 300 000 ev contract we are the primary provider so we don t want to over promise the market and under deliver and for this year we want to take one thing at one step and laid out the groundwork for more growth going forward so and additionally we also want to focus on the quality of our products and be able to deliver better results going forward harris goldman analyst okay so if i understand this is a very conservative guidance this year because from what i ve heard and what i ve read yes this will be a revival year but we can reasonably expect if we receive the subsidies because that s been our problem it appears to me that we ve experienced all along we were we have basically been subsidizing the subsidies and that has curtailed our production and sale so therefore from what i m hearing now from mr hu i m much more optimistic about this revival year than what was said earlier in terms of a 20 000 unit guidance for this year okay that s it thank you kewa luo investor relations manager thank you foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager mr hu says thank you we ll work hard to deliver good business results we can take next question operator we will now take our next question from mike pfeffer from oppenheimer please go ahead mike pfeffer oppenheimer analyst hi thanks for taking my question the press release titled kandi pure electric vehicles project received approval was confusing to many in the us particularly when mentioned along with approval for 50 000 evs in rugao even a bloomberg reporter was confused and said you mr hu said it was approval to build a facility in rugao where kandi jv already had one can you confirm for all that this is the license we have waited several years for allowing kandi to now make and sell its own evs as well as for others and secondly what is the significance of the 50 000 number in the press release thank you kewa luo investor relations manager okay can you ok i ve got your question foreign language zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager thank you for your question i want to once again clarify which i also discussed earlier on the call with regarding to the manufacturing license there are actually three steps in total first is approval from national development and reform commission that they approved the company to build the factory which is what we received earlier and what we announced and the next step is acceptance of the factory by the ministry of industry and information technology and once we get approval from miit then the factory is entitled to produce cars and as a result this is so called dual production license and once this has been obtained the company will be able to not just build a factory and the factory will be able to produce the vehicles and the first step is the miit will have to approve that model to be able to register and we think that by in april we should be able to get all these steps ready and by then we will make announcements the next question is that you asked about 50 000 units that we mentioned in the press release so when you apply to the ndrc for the license to build a factory you have to include your capacity in the factory you re building and you have to at least achieve 80 of capacity in order to build another location factory so for example we applied 50 000 capacity for this factory we can go over that number to produce there 100 000 but if we want to build another factory in a different location we have to at least achieve 80 of 50 000 which is 40 000 so we just it s a number that you give in your application so with that i hope i clarified what you have just asked mike pfeffer oppenheimer analyst thank you operator we will now take our next question from arthur porcari from corporate strategies please go ahead arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst thank you mr hu congratulations and thanks for all shareholders in your year of improvement of 2018 to 2019 and based on public announcements sounds like an incredible start for the 2019 forward long awaited breakout witnessed by amazing string of announcements just since january 4th interesting side note based on just today s numbers so it appears that kandi itself would have had a pre tax profit of almost 20 million for the full year where if not for having to consolidate that 17 8 million share of the jv r d loss in the fourth quarter as a prior caller said the jv was actually at breakeven through the the first three quarters just an observation which you can address in a moment if you want to with this said i d like to address an expanded series of questions mostly limited to two major areas announced more on the five year 300 000 ev for the china resources ride hailing program i mean the five year 300 000 and the three year 20 000 ev cao cao ride hailing program then i want to wrap it up and to see how the jv expects to finance the cost to deliver this potential 5 billion to 6 billion worth of evs over the next five years i pass that on to mr hu and i ll then ask the questions kewa luo investor relations manager hi arthur can you repeat what you asked in the first part about the jv would you just arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst okay what i was ok no i was just saying that this is an add on because of the numbers with which i m saying this but i said this is a side observation i don t think we were expecting the 35 million 36 million fourth quarter writedown in the jv for all that onetime r d expense which caused kandi to actually take an additional 17 8 million loss in the fourth quarter without that it seems like the kandi s pre tax profit which was already at over 2 million if they add that back in we would have almost 20 million for kandi itself i realized that this shows how well kandi itself is performing independently of the jv that s the only point i wanted to make ok and do you need me to repeat the rest of it or do you have the rest of it kewa luo investor relations manager okay i do foreign language go ahead with your question arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst okay first question is after 20 000 cao cao puts an all ev ride hailing program from what i understand so it s good to see that this china unicorn which is a high end ride club uber like chauffeur ev ride hailing program currently has 30 000 high end geely and volvo evs and this was put together by kandi s jv partner li shufu and his geely holdings in the kandi announcement it states that the parties have agreed to collaborate in exploring new and innovative models for an online ride hailing business with their combined resources and market advantage now the question is does this mean kandi will be developing new ev models over and above what we already have to fulfill get into this high end program or will the ex3 get released k23 be used and will the quick battery exchange be used with cao cao as well kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager mr hu is saying now there are a lot of questions so i will just go one by one first the 300 000 cars signed with alliance which is going to be serving for all these online ride hailing platforms not just on the cao cao zhuan che platform going to be for example didi or other platform and this is going to be initiated by our company joint venture hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager because there s requirement for the wheel base that required by the ride hailing services so the ex3 s wheel base is not meeting the requirement therefore we are going to launch the k23 and the other developing car is called k8 b class which is the high end car for the online ride hailing platform arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst and kandi is going to be developing that new k8 or kandi jv kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager yeah together with geely and the joint venture arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst that s breaking news okay let me move on to the 300 000 ev program five year announcement now this was quite a stunning announcement though it had seemed to have no effect on the stock at the time potential to the kandi jv for this over the life of it could exceed 5 billion and as the jv primary parts and battery provider maybe an additional 2 billion directly to kandi i based this on the assumption that the required battery exchange feature addressed in the announcement is the kandi owned and patented qbx which requires four battery packs instead of two as for the consumer plug in versions so i have two questions short questions that have to do with this based on this quote from the announcement the jv company will be the primary vehicle supplier in the accredited vehicle alliance can we assume that all of the 300 000 evs which have the quick battery exchange feature will come will have to have the quick battery exchange feature and if true likely all the evs will then be kandi provided and the second question is how many current service station locations does china resources have across the 25 provinces in china and are they still growing and will the quick battery exchange locations to be exclusive for the alliance members or will they also future be used for any kandi ev which has quick battery exchange feature kewa luo investor relations manager okay foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager okay let me try to cover all the information mr hu just provided first of all kandi will surely be the primary ev provider in the alliance in providing the ev and the battery and the china resources zhejiang they used to they have many locations throughout china and at this point i don t know i don t have a number how many they have but however we think that since these locations always are providing the gasoline to the vehicles and based on the demand of the electric vehicles some of them may also going to be available for the battery exchange and giving a strategic partnering with them and they are going to be in charge of investment and operations of all these credit vehicle alliance vehicle battery exchange business but the specific detail plan of building required services sites will be depending on the demand from the credit vehicle in the alliance program and i think this is going to be gradually delivered within five years and the quick battery exchange feature will surely be used for all these future kandi evs arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst okay good certainly looking at only about 18 000 a car i would think 5 billion is probably a conservative number then anyway let s press on here to get into my next section a little bit here has to do with financing just a short comment first since cao cao is controlled by a kandi jv inaudible 50 partner china resources the alliance with the government enterprise the credibility factor toward the buyer following through on these deals would seem to be quite high but to rapidly address these projects alone i would think that kandi would require the jv to have at least 1 billion in cash to get started so far our partner of the jv has not raised any outside equity since formation so as evidenced on how the hot ev market is in china recently discovered the 7 china ev unicorn start ups each less than three years old and only two to include dl have not sold any evs to date as negatively i m sorry two have sold the other five have not as negatively compared to the kandi jv none of them have any stage of licenses not even first stage and only one has a facility yet together they ve raised over rmb80 billion or 11 6 billion or between 1 billion to 3 4 billion each and to give a total perceived value to all these a 24 billion this is as early as 2016 that kandi jv has publicly announced its intention to go public likely in china this subject has again come up with positive company response in recent conference call go ahead and translate all that for mr hu so far then i will get into the question kewa luo investor relations manager okay foreign language go ahead as i have summarized what you just said arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst okay fine the three year old nio with much less infrastructure and hard assets than the five year old kandi five year old kandi jv recently came public in the us with a 7 billion market cap after raising 2 4 billion private equity in china would it be reasonable to assume that the kandi jv could quickly raise maybe 200 million private equity in china at about a 2 billion cap and then follow up with maybe another 0 5 billion raised at a 3 billion cap inaudible the last part of the press release which you put in today kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager i think i want to answer in two parts first you mentioned a lot of development at nio i want to say that nio s business we really don t need to compare nio with kandi and for now it s not time yet for kandi to discuss jv company s evaluation secondly for jv company what you have plan like i mentioned earlier in my remarks that the jv company s management is working on evaluate for the optimal time to restructure the jv company s equity in order to unlock the shareholder value of the jv company once we have significant progress we will update the market at the proper time arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst okay and then get down to my last question here it would seem to me without before i even hit the question with kandi s 380 million market cap market is saying kandi is worth a zero and the jv is only worth around 700 million i would think that mr hu would argue with that and that s why he s talking about unlocking the value of the jv but when you divide it by two or whatever you can get a real value what kandi should be trading at but with that said the last question has to do with the ipo venue in the past as i assume that ipo is route they might want to go in the past the announced intention was to bring the jv public in china however china asia listings require three consecutive years of positive earnings it s recently been announced with much excitement that the new shanghai tech board similar to nasdaq will start trading later this year without the earnings requirement could the jv consider this new listing for an actual ipo or would the company consider bringing in the jv public even in the united states kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager i think whether it is shanghai tech board or in the us i think these all can be possible and right now still too early to discuss but once we have made a decision we will report to the market arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst excellent i really appreciate mr hu s patience with long series of questions but considering that kandi had less than a 400 million market cap and 50 partner and without a doubt the largest in the ev agreement and in the 300 000 car agreement announced in china by any ev maker needed some expanded discussion and again thank mr hu very much and look forward to once again beating beating his forecast by at least 35 to 40 as he did a few years back when he used to give forecast thank you kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language

fresh off a strike in erie pa the united electrical workers are a model of the working class internationalism that can build a more just world after nine days of picketing in below freezing temperatures striking workers in erie pennsylvania returned to work recently under a 90 day agreement the 1 700 strong united electrical radio and machine workers of america ue strike quickly drew national attention senator bernie sanders declared his support for the union and even invited the president of the local to speak at his campaign rally as the first major u s manufacturing strike of the trump era according to the nation erie brought renewed focus to the struggles of american industrial workers who have faced job loss wage stagnation and weakened bargaining power as a result of corporate globalization but erie isn t just a reminder of the problem it also points us toward the solution for decades ue has been a leading example of global labor solidarity the union s commitment to internationalism offers our greatest hope for an alternative to the existing global system since the 1980s policymakers and the corporate interests that they represent have designed a globalized world that places profit before people and planet this neoliberal global system allows capital but not people to move freely across borders because corporations can shop around for the most exploitable labor and environmental conditions countries desperate for investment are pitted against one another in a global race to the bottom while right wingers like donald trump have tried to paint this as a contest between america and the rest of the world the true struggle is between capital and the working class regardless of nation the key to victory is therefore to unite workers across borders ue does just that ue was one of the first unions to recognize and respond to the threat of neoliberal globalization during the run up to the north american free trade agreement nafta it built a unique alliance with the frente autentico del trabajo fat of mexico that has served as an exemplar of transnational labor solidarity ever since ue and the fat remain structurally independent but play active roles in each other s strikes campaigns and organizing drives they exchange rank and file members to promote dialogue between countries launched a joint education center along the u s mexico border and have even run mutual fundraising campaigns most innovatively ue and the fat have leveraged the nafta side accord on labor to pressure each other s countries on labor legislation along with other partners in mexico and canada the fat submitted a complaint to the mexican government that north carolina s restrictions on public sector collective bargaining violate nafta though existing trade agreements are far from supportive of workers rights the ue fat alliance points to ways to leverage the meager protections that do exist ue also recognizes that working class interests go beyond the narrow set of demands that can be won from management at the negotiating table it played an active role in the multi issue global justice movement participating in multiple world social fora and sitting for some time on the coordinating committee for the grassroots global justice alliance continuing the fight for global justice today ue opposes the trump administration s nafta 2 0 citing not only weak enforcement of labor protections but also the extension of drug patent provisions that increase the costs of lifesaving medicine inadequate reforms of the investor state dispute settlement mechanism and lack of protections for women indigenous communities and the environment in contrast to the afl cio s dismal if slightly improving record ue has also consistently opposed u s imperial ventures abroad it is an active member of u s labor against the war founded in 2003 in response to the invasion of iraq has vocally opposed american interference in venezuela and was the first national u s union to endorse the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign against israel while other unions have fallen into the self defeating trap of responding to neoliberal globalization with a return to nationalist protectionism ue remains committed to building an alternative internationalist model the united steel workers for example welcomed the trump administration s decision to implement steel and aluminum tariffs ue condemned the move we are not opposed to tariffs or trade agreements in all circumstances however we firmly oppose using them as a cudgel to extract concessions from trading partners and allies and to bolster corporate profits at the expense of workers living standards and the health and safety of our communities ue s deep commitment to internationalism is worthy of replication but to do so requires learning another lesson from ue s record global solidarity is not dictated it s built ue does this in many ways the internationalist perspective is baked into all communications and political education initiatives regular collaborative campaigns build solidarity through action and exchange visits between rank and file members encourage relationship building at the grassroots level recognizing the singular role of immigrants in building global solidarity ue makes concerted efforts to connect members of partner unions with workers of similar national origin in the united states in one instance the visit of an fat organizer was the deciding factor in the successful unionization of a factory composed mostly of workers of mexican origin ue is not perfect but its record of solidarity and the steps that it takes to build that solidarity at the rank and file level are valuable models while the strike in erie is over for now the wider conditions that led to it a model of globalization that seeks to divide and conquer the working class live on to win that battle will require more than a single strike it will require the construction of a global movement based in solidarity of the working class and other oppressed groups that transcends borders it won t be easy but ue s history of committed internationalism shows us the path forward michael galant is a recent graduate of the master of public policy program at the harvard kennedy school of government he is interested in building global solidarity for left alternatives to neoliberal models of globalization and development and can be found on twitter at michael_galant originally published in foreign policy in focus

this piece was originally published as part of the brookings future development blog series entitled job opportunities for youth in kosovo 2 steps forward 1 step back for several years in a row western balkan labor market conditions have been improving unemployment rates are declining reaching historic lows in most countries employment rates are rising and the gap with eu countries is gradually shrinking the last year was no different although job creation slowed the quality of newly created jobs improved as found by the forthcoming western balkans labor market trends 2019 report but behind these positive trends fundamental problems persist the shares of those in vulnerable and informal employment remain elevated indicating that the quality of employment is still a major concern kosovo still faces the greatest challenges it has taken two steps forward one step back following a steep rise in 2017 employment fell by 4 5 percent in the second quarter of 2018 current improvements in the western balkan labor markets are most likely cyclical and dependent on the state of european economy through two main channels first and in the context of a relatively strong eu economy goods and services from the western balkans are in higher demand and this also boosts western balkan labor markets second however this also means that the eu is attracting additional migrant workers a trend which will only accelerate as the large cohort of baby boomers will retire in the coming years for the sending countries such as kosovo the eu pull reduces the region s resident labor force and working age population in this case the employment rates in the region improve not due to an increase in the numerator but to a decrease in the denominator for kosovo the only youth bulge country and for albania the only country currently reaping demographic dividend this is not necessarily a bad thing in the short run nevertheless all countries are increasingly concerned about the effects of accelerated emigration in the region the key driver of emigration from the region is low wages as branko milanovic recently calculated if you fly from vienna to belgrade and if the flight lasts one hour every 15 minutes you lose 30 percent of your income thus it is far better to fly from belgrade to vienna where you get a premium on your income unlike employment and unemployment rates wages in the western balkans are not converging with eu levels for over half a decade regional to eu wages have remained at below 40 percent in purchasing power parity ppp terms and at as little as below 20 percent in euros if there is some convergence it is within the region with wages in albania and kosovo catching up somewhat with the rest of the region across the region the advantages from emigration are strongest in kosovo if calculated as wage differential times the probability of finding a good job youth unemployment is above 50 percent and one quarter of young people 15 24 years report that they are not in employment education or training neet not surprisingly young women are more likely to identify as neet 30 percent than young men eight out of 10 employees in kosovo including young workers hold a temporary contract the difference in average wages among entry level positions in kosovo and eu countries is staggering among young workers ages 15 29 the highest entry level wages in kosovo are obtained in public administration with an annual wage of around 5 000 eur the lowest wages are accrued in entry level positions in commerce manufacturing construction public utilities and agriculture ranging from 3 000 to 3 700 eur based on survey estimates in contrast reported entry position annual wages in it telecommunications are between 30 000 and 44 000 eur in austria germany and the uk compared to a broad estimate of 5 000 eur in kosovo as a result of high unemployment a lack of good job opportunities a dissatisfaction with the economic situation at home but also the pull from eu economies young people continue to leave kosovo or contemplate doing so in the near future two recent surveys gallup and undp found that around 50 60 percent of young respondents considered leaving kosovo in the near future thus potentially depleting the country of its young talent figure 1 kosovo stands out as the western balkan country with the lowest employment and highest unemployment rate among youth 15 24 years old source world bank western balkan labor market trends 2019 based on data provided by national statistical offices and eurostat 2nd quarter 2018 note employment rate is defined as share of 15 24 years old in employment unemployment rate is defined as share of 15 24 years old in employment among active 15 24 years old kosovo has the youngest population in europe with a median age of 29 5 years and youth are the country s great asset the last decade has seen a significant increase in the number of young people attending university finding a good job upon graduation is an important milestone for young people but the transition to employment in kosovo often comes with many challenges finding solutions to improve educational and employment opportunities for young people is essential to kosovo s development this will require a better understanding of the aspirations of youth and challenges in their transition from education to employment to that end if you are a university student in kosovo join the national dialogue by speaking up about your goals hopes and fears related to finding employment stefanie brodmann is a senior

via raul ilargi meijer s automatic earth blog there are days though all too scarce when very nice surprises come my way case in point yesterday i received a mail from david holmgren after a long period of radio silence australia s david is one of the fathers of permaculture along with bill mollison for those few who don t know him they first started writing about the concept in the 1970s and never stopped dave calls himself permaculture co originator these days hmm someone says one of the pioneers of modern ecological thinking that s better no doubt there these guys taught many many thousands of people how to be self sufficient permaculture is a simple but intricate approach to making sure that the life in your garden or backyard and thereby your own life moves towards balance my face to face history with david is limited we spent some time together on two occasions only i think in 2012 a day at his home farm in australia and in 2015 a week in penguin tasmania at a permaculture conference where the automatic earth s nicole foss was one of the key speakers along with dave still despite the limited time together i see him as a good and dear friend simply because he s such a kind and gracious and wise man in his mail david asked if i would publish this article which he originally posted on his own site just yesterday under the name the apology from baby boomers to the handicapped generations i went for a shorter title it s just our format but of course i will dave has been an avid reader of the automatic earth for the past 11 years we sort of keep his feet on the ground when they re not planted and soaking in that same ground reading tae has helped me keep up to date in light of the children s climate protests today which i have yet to voice my qualms about and i have a few it only makes sense to put into words a baby boomer s apology to have that phrased by someone with the intellect and integrity of david should have everyone sit up and pay attention if you ask me and perhaps it would be good if more people would try and do the same apologize to those kids here s my formidable friend david holmgren david holmgren it is time for us baby boomers to honestly acknowledge what we did and didn t do with the gifts given to us by our forebears and be clear about our legacy with which we have saddled the next and succeeding generations by baby boomers i mean those of us born in the affluent nations of the western world between 1945 and 1965 in these countries the majority of the population became middle class beneficiaries of mass affluence i think of the high birth rate of those times as a product of collective optimism about the future and the abundant and cheap resources to support growing families by many measures the benefits of global industrial civilisation peaked in our youth but for most middle class baby boomers of the affluent countries the continuing experience of those benefits has tended to blind us to the constriction of opportunities faced by the next generations unaffordable housing and land access ecological overshoot and climate chaos amongst a host of other challenges i am a white middle class man born in 1955 in australia one of the richest nations of the western world in the middle of the baby boom so i consider myself well placed to articulate an apology on behalf of my generation in the life of a baby boomer born in 1950 and dying in 2025 a premature death according to the expectations of our generation the best half the world s endowment of oil the potent resource that made industrial civilisation possible will have been burnt this is tens of millions of years of stored sunlight from a special geological epoch of extraordinary biological productivity beyond our basic needs we have been the recipients of manufactured wants and desires to varying degrees we have also suffered the innumerable downsides addictions and alienations that have come with fossil fuelled consumer capitalism it is also true that our generation has used the genie of fossil fuels to create wonders of technology organisation and art and a diversity of lifestyles and ideas some of the unintended consequences of our way of life ranging from antibiotic resistance to bubble economics should have been obvious while others such as the depression epidemic in rich countries were harder to foresee our travel around the world has broadened our minds but global tourism has contaminated the amazing diversity of nature and traditional cultures at an accelerating pace we have the excuse that innovations always have pluses and minuses but it seems we have got a larger share of the pluses and handballed more of the minuses to the world s poorest countries and to our children and grandchildren we were the first generation to have the clear scientific evidence that emergent global civilisation was on an unsustainable path that would precipitate an unravelling of both nature and society through the 21st century although climate chaos was a less obvious outcome than the no brainer of resource depletion international recognition of the reality of climate change came way back in 1988 just as we were beginning to get our hands on the levers of power and we have presided over decades of policies that have accelerated the problem over the years since the adverse outcomes have shifted from distant risks to lived realities these impact hardest on the most vulnerable peoples of the world who have yet to taste the benefits of the carbon bonanza that has driven the accelerating climate catastrophe for the failure to share those benefits globally and curb our own consumption we must be truly sorry david holmgren in the 1960s and 70s during our coming of age a significant proportion of us were critical of what was being passed down to us by our parent s generation who were also the beneficiaries of the western world system which some of us baby boomers recognised as a global empire but our grandparents and parents had been shaped by the rigours and grief of the first global depression of the 1890s the first world war the great depression of the 1930s and of course the second world war aside from those who served in vietnam we have cruised through life avoiding the worst threats of nuclear annihilation and economic depression even as people in other countries suffered the consequences of superpower proxy wars coups and economic and environmental catastrophes while some of us were burnt by personal and global events we have mostly led a charmed existence and had the privilege to question our upbringing and culture we were the first generation in history to experience an extended adolescence of experimentation and privilege with little concern or responsibility for our future our kin or our country most baby boomers were raised in families where commuting was the norm for our fathers but a home based lifestyle was still a role model we got from our mothers in our enthusiasm for women to have equal access to productive work in the monetary economy few of us noticed that without work to keep the household economy humming we lost much of our household autonomy to market forces by our daily commutes mostly alone in our cars we entrenched this massively wasteful and destructive action as normal and inevitable as we came into our power in middle age the new technology of the internet workshop tool miniaturisation and other innovations provided more options to participate in the monetary economy without the need to commute but our generation continued with this insane collective addiction in australia we faithfully followed the american model of not investing in public transport which moderated the adverse impacts of commuting in european and other countries not so structurally addicted to road transport by failing to build decent public transport and the opportunities for home based work and wasting wealth in a frenzy of freeway building that has choked our cities our generation has consumed our grandchildren s inheritance of high quality transport fuels and accelerated the onset of climate chaos for this we are truly sorry in pioneering the double income family some of us set the pattern for the next generation s habit of outsourcing the care of children at a young age making commuting five days a week an early childhood experience this has left the next generation unable to imagine a life that doesn t involve leaving home each day these patterns are part of a larger crisis created by the double income debt laden households with close to 100 dependence on the monetary economy without robust and productive household economies our children and grandchildren s generations will become the victims of savage disruptions and downturns in the monetary economy for failing to maintain and strengthen the threads of self provision frugality and self reliance most of us inherited from our parents we should be truly sorry some of us felt in our hearts that we needed to create a different and better world some of us saw the writing on the walls of the world calling for global justice some of us read the evidence mostly clearly in the 1972 limits to growth that attempting to run continuous material growth on finite planet would end in more than tears some of us even rejected the legacy of previous generations of radicals direct action against the problems of the world and instead decided we would boldly create the world we wanted by living it each day in doing so we experienced hard won lessons and even created some hopeful models for succeeding generations to improve on in more difficult conditions that our efforts at novel solutions often created more sound than substance or that we flitted from one issue to another rather than doing the hard yards necessary to pass on truly robust design solutions for a world of less leaves some of us with regrets for which we might also feel the need to apologise these experiences are shared to some degree by a minority in all generations but there is significant evidence that the 1960s and 70s was a time when awareness of the need for change was stronger unfortunately a sequence of titanic geopolitical struggles that few of us understand even today a debt fuelled version of consumer capitalism and propaganda against both the limits to growth and the values of the counterculture saw most of us following the neoliberal agenda like sheep into the 1980s and beyond after having played with the privilege of free tertiary education most of us fell for the propaganda and sent our children off to accumulate debts and doubtful benefits in the corporatised businesses that universities became we convinced our children they needed more specialised knowledge poured down their throats rather than using their best years to build the skills and resilience for the challenges our generation was bequeathing to them for this we must be truly sorry many of us have been the beneficiaries of buying real estate before the credit fuelled final stages of casino capitalism made that option a recipe for debt slavery for our children without understanding its mechanics we have contributed to and fuelled with our faith a bubble economy on a vast scale that can only end in pain and suffering for the majority while some of us are members of the bank of mum and dad when the property bubble bursts we could find ourselves following the bank chiefs apologising for the debt burden we encouraged our children to take on some of us will also have to apologise for losing the family home when we went guarantor on their mortgages for not heeding the warnings we got with the gfc we will be truly sorry some of us have used our windfall wealth from real estate and the stock market to do good works including creating small models of more creative and lower footprint futures that have inspired the minority of the next generations who can also see the writing on the wall but most of us used our houses as atms for new forms of consumption that were unimaginable to our parents from holidays around the world to endless renovations and a constant flow of updated digital gadgets and virtual diversions for this frivolous squandering of our windfall wealth we must be truly sorry while our parents generation experienced the risks of youth through adversity and war we used our privilege to tackle challenges of our own choosing although some of us had to struggle to free ourselves from the cloying cocoon of middle class upbringing we were the generation that flew like the birds and hitchhiked around the country and the world how strange that on becoming parents many of us in middle age we believed the propaganda that the world was too dangerous for our children to do the same around the local neighbourhood instead we coddled them got into the chauffeuring business and in doing so encouraged their disconnection from both nature and community as we see our grandchildren s generation raised in a way that makes them an even more handicapped generation we must be truly sorry for the path we took and the dis ease we created after so many of us experimented with mind expanding plants and chemicals some of us were taken down in chemical addictions but it was dysfunctional and corrupt legal prohibitions more than the substances themselves that were to blame for the worst of the damage so how strange that when in middle age we got our hands on the levers of power most of our generation decided to continue to support the madness of prohibition for this we must be truly sorry to have seen the light but then continued to inflict this burden on our children and grandchildren for having acquiesced in the global war on drugs that spread pain and suffering to some of the poorest peoples of the world we should be ashamed when the war on drugs a war against substances became the model for the war on terror war against a concept some of us reawakened the anti war activism of the vietnam years but in the end we mostly acquiesced to an agenda of trashing international law regime change shock and awe chaos and the death of millions all justified by the 9 11 demolition fireworks that killed a small fraction of the number of citizens that die each year as a result of our ongoing addiction to personal motorised mobility while the shadow cast by climate change darkens our grandchilden s future the shadow of potential nuclear winter that hung over our childhood as not gone away many of us were at the forefront of the international movement to rid the world of nuclear weapons and thought the collapse of the soviet union had saved us from that threat coming into our power after the end of the cold war our greatest crime on this geopolitical front has perhaps been the tacit support of our generation for first the economic rape of russia in the 1990s and then its progressive encirclement by the relentless expansion of nato in australia we have meekly added our resources and youth to more or less endless wars in the middle east and central asia justified by the fake war on terror for this weakness as accessories to global crimes wasting wealth and lives to consolidate the western powers control of the first truly global empire we should hang our collective heads in shame while some of our generation s intellectuals continued to critique the war on terror as fake the vast majority of the public intellectuals of our generation including those on the left have supported the rapid rise of cold war 2 0 to contain russia china and any other country that doesn t accept what we now call the rules based international order code for our empire this is truly astonishing when looked at in the context of our lived history let us hope that sanity can prevail as our empire fades and future generations don t brand us as the most insane war mongering generation of all time for our complicity in this grand failure of resistance we should be truly sorry on another equally titanic front the mistake of giving legal personhood to corporations was not one that our generation made however most of us have contributed our work consumption and capital to assist these self organising profit maximising cost minimising machines of capitalism morphing into emergent new life forms that threaten to consume both nature and humanity in an algorithmic drive for growth at a time of our seniority and numbers we failed to use the global financial crisis as an opportunity to bring these emergent monsters to heel do our children have the capacity to tame the monsters that we nurtured from fragile infants to commanding masters and if they do find the will to withdraw their work consumption and capital enough to contain the corporations will the economy that currently provides for both needs and wants unravel completely this is a burden so great most of us continue to believe we have no responsibility or agency in such a dark reality we trust that history will not place the burden of responsibility on our generation alone but for our part in this failure of agency over human affairs we apologise further we should accept with grace the consequences for our own wellbeing most of us feel impotent when thinking of these failures to control the excesses of our era but on a more modest scale we have mindlessly participated in taking the goods and passing on the debt to future generations no more so than in our habitual acceptance of antibiotics from doctors to fix the most mundane of illnesses for our parents generation antibiotics represented the peak of medical science s ability to control what killed so many of their parents and earlier generations for us they became routine tools to keep us on the job and our children not missing precious days at school through this banal practice we have unwittingly conspired with our doctors to rapidly breed resistance to the most effective and low cost antibiotics we took for granted that future generations would always be able to work out ways to keep ahead of diseases with an endless string of new antibiotics for having squandered this gift we are truly sorry further despite the fact that some of us have became vegetarian or even vegan our generation s demand for cheap chicken and bacon has driven the industrial dosing of animals with antibiotics on a scale that has accelerated the development of antibiotic resistance far faster than would have been the case from us dosing ourselves and our children for supporting this and other such obscene systems of animal husbandry we apologise to our grandchildren and succeeding generations and hope that somehow an accommodation between humanity animals and microbes is still possible we experienced and benefited from the emergent culture of rights and recognition for women minorities and the people of varied abilities and many of us who fought to extend and deepen those rights have pride in what we did however some of us are beginning to fear that in doing so we contributed to creating new demands disabilities and fractious subcultures of fear and angst unimagined in previous generations while we might not be in the driving seat of identity politics and culture wars we raised our children to demand their rights in a world that is unravelling due to its multiple contradictions in this emerging context strident demands for rights are likely to be a waste of valuable energy that younger people might better focus on becoming useful to themselves and others for overemphasising the demand for rights and underplaying the need for responsible self and collective reliance perhaps we should also be sorry and is this escalating demand for rights by younger people itself connected even peripherally to the increasing callous disregard for the rights of others especially in the case of refugees this careless disregard has allowed political elites to use tough treatment of the less fortunate to distract from the gradual loss of shared privilege that once characterised the lucky country to the shame of those in power over the last two decades mostly baby boomers those policies are now being adopted on a larger scale in europe and the us in our lifetimes religious faith has declined for many of our generation this change represents a measure of humanity s progress from a benighted past to a promising future but the collective belief in science and evidence based decision making has now become a new faith scientism which seeks to drive out all other ways of thinking and being from the public space at the same time religious fundamentalism is now resurgent is this too something that our generation unleashed by preaching tolerance while enforcing an ideology we didn t even recognise as such a significant sign of the good intentions of our generation has been our recognition that the ancient war against nature which has plagued human life since the beginnings of agriculture and indeed civilisation must end one powerful expression of our efforts has been the valuing of the biodiversity of life especially local indigenous biodiversity in the new europes of north america and the antipodes seeking to save indigenous biodiversity has grown into an institutionalised form of atonement for the sins of the forefathers while this seems like one of our achievements even this we have bastardised with a new war against naturalised biodiversity perhaps the worst aspect of this renewed war against novel ecologies is that we have accepted the helping hand of monsanto in using roundup as the main weapon in our urban and rural habitats the mounting evidence that roundup may be worse than ddt will be part of our legacy while history may excuse our parent s generation for naïve optimism in relation to ddt our generation s version of the war on nature will not save us from harsh judgement for this we should be truly sorry of course any public apology in this country invites comparisons to the apology by governments to the stolen generation of australian indigenous peoples for the wrongs of the past this unfinished sorry business is beyond the scope of this apology but it is an opportunity to reflect critically on our common self perception of supporting indigenous peoples rights in contrast to the normalised racism of previous generations our generation s invitation to and enabling of australians of indigenous descent to more fully participate in mainstream australian society may have been a necessary step towards reconciliation or could it have been a poison chalice drawing them even deeper into the dysfunctions of industrial modernity that i have already outlined we can only hope that people with such a history of resilience and understanding in the face dispossession will take these additional burdens in their stride in any case this apology is not one that comes from a position of invulnerable privilege giving succour to those who are no threat to that privilege for many baby boomers now caring for parents and dealing with their deaths we are more inwardly focused for some of us especially those estranged from parents through this both painful and tender processes we are finally growing up but a comic tragedy could play out in our declining years if a combination of novel disabilities the culture of rights and amplified fears lead to our children and grandchildren s generations mostly experiencing harder times as far worse than they might really be and deciding we are the cause of their troubles we baby boomers will increasingly find that in our growing dependence on young people we will be subject to their perspectives whims and prejudices hopefully we can take what we are given on the chin and along with our children and our grandchildren s generations we can all grow up and work together to face the future with whatever capacities we have we might hope this apology is itself a wake up call to the younger generations that are still mostly sleepwalking into the oncoming maelstroms in raising the alarm we might hope our humble apology will galvanise the potential in young people who are grasping the nettle of opportunities to turn problems into solutions we hope that this apology might lead to understanding rather than resentment of our frailty in the face of the self organising forces of powerful change that have driven the climaxing of global industrial civilisation finally the task ahead for our generation is to learn how to downsize and disown before we prepare to die with grace at a time of our choosing and in a way that inspires and frees the next generations to chart a prosperous

news national by staff rpeorter government cannot allow itself to be influenced by the black market in determining foreign exchange rates on interbank transactions as the parallel market is run by a few individuals transacting on nominal amounts reserve bank of zimbabwe governor dr john mangudya has said dr mangudya said people running the black market in the streets took a position to influence the country s economy for selfish ends and it would be folly for government to make decisions based on their activities he said this while giving oral evidence before parliament s joint portfolio committee on public accounts chaired by harare east legislator mr tendai biti and that of budget and finance chaired by bikita west mp mr elias musakwa mr biti had asked why the central bank was not using the prevailing street rate in relation to export retention for tobacco farmers i think it will be wrong for the bank to purchase export retention united states dollars from our exporters at the fixed rate at the moment which is 1 2 5 when the market is 3 5 can you give us confidence that you will purchase at the street rate if that is not the case why not just liberalise said mr biti in a heated exchange with dr mangudya if government are managed by street rates i think we need to call some equilibrium i am not sure if you want government to be led by street rates quipped dr mangudya mr biti insisted saying that is reality you should also be aware that those people in the streets took the position that they are trying to influence this economy we should never allow people who have taken position on this economy to run it that will be failure on the part of parliament or government of zimbabwe said dr mangudya these are past effects of parallel exchange rate if we allow that to happen prices will shoot through the roof i think we have had enough in this country i think we need to have discipline in this economy that is what is missing we need to have confidence yes we love the market rate but who determines that market somebody will just say on social media today it s five if you go and check if there has been any trade to match that level you will be surprised why should a 1 000 transaction move the whole market dr mangudya said tobacco farmers will have 50 percent retention of the hard currency to be deposited in their nostro accounts in terms of tobacco it is not 30 percent retention it is 50 percent of the net proceeds we met the tobacco industry gold and merchants we agreed at 50 of the net proceeds to be in their nostro accounts and we want them to open nostro accounts so that we do not consume from cash we want people to use bank accounts the way it will happen is very simple on the day of the auction merchants will bring foreign currency into zimbabwe tobacco will be sold in rtgs dollars and then they will get their us dollar they will get their money from nostro money and rtgs dollar said dr mangudya tobacco selling season is expected to start on march 28 dr mangudya denied that the central bank was involved in quasi fiscal activities despite insistence by mr biti
these days the trade war between the trump administration and china is regularly in the headlines and sometimes so are the bases the chinese are building in the south china sea the ships the u s navy is sending ever more provocatively close to them and the potential clashes that might result but the global nature of the growing conflict between washington and beijing has yet to be fully taken in as it happens at this moment it extends from greenland i m serious to argentina i m serious again in greenland still a self ruling part of denmark a panicked u s military and trump administration recently turned back a chinese plan to help bankroll and build three airports in fact the pentagon itself actually offered to invest in greenland s airport infrastructure otherwise military officials feared china might secure an economic foothold at the far end of what that self proclaimed near arctic state has dubbed its future polar silk road or blue economic passage across the melting north and far worse as the wall street journal put it undoubtedly reflecting the fears of pentagon officials china could have ended up with a military foothold off canada s coast that is the sort of military base that the u s already has in greenland the northernmost of its 800 or so bases across the planet meanwhile at the southern tip of the same planet in argentina s desolate patagonian desert the chinese have built a deep space tracking station with a big dish radar for peaceful research it is however run by that country s military and u s military officials are already in a dither about the dangers it might someday pose to america s array of satellites that the u s has similar radar equipment dotted across much of the earth is undoubtedly just more evidence of what the chinese might in the future want to do think of these chinese forays at the planet s antipodes one aborted one successful and the hypersensitive washington response to each of them as signs of a genuinely rising power and also of the heightening of potential conflicts between it and the still reigning superpower i m talking of course about the previously exceptional and indispensable country that donald trump swears he ll make great again in the process as tomdispatch regular michael klare makes strikingly clear today both countries are plunging into what can only be thought of as a new kind of war that could prove hot indeed before it s over tom war with china it s already under way by michael t klare in his highly acclaimed 2017 book destined for war harvard professor graham allison assessed the likelihood that the united states and china would one day find themselves at war comparing the u s chinese relationship to great power rivalries all the way back to the peloponnesian war of the fifth century bc he concluded that the future risk of a conflagration was substantial like much current analysis of u s chinese relations however he missed a crucial point for all intents and purposes the united states and china are already at war with one another even if their present slow burn conflict may not produce the immediate devastation of a conventional hot war its long term consequences could prove no less dire to suggest this means reassessing our understanding of what constitutes war from allison s perspective and that of so many others in washington and elsewhere peace and war stand as polar opposites one day our soldiers are in their garrisons being trained and cleaning their weapons the next they are called into action and sent onto a battlefield war in this model begins when the first shots are fired well think again in this new era of growing great power struggle and competition today war means so much more than military combat and can take place even as the leaders of the warring powers meet to negotiate and share dry aged steak and whipped potatoes as donald trump and xi jinping did at mar a lago in 2017 that is exactly where we are when it comes to sino american relations consider it war by another name or perhaps to bring back a long retired term a burning new version of a cold war even before donald trump entered the oval office the u s military and other branches of government were already gearing up for a long term quasi war involving both growing economic and diplomatic pressure on china and a buildup of military forces along that country s periphery since his arrival such initiatives have escalated into cold war style combat by another name with his administration committed to defeating china in a struggle for global economic technological and military supremacy this includes the president s much publicized trade war with china aimed at hobbling that country s future growth a techno war designed to prevent it from overtaking the u s in key breakthrough areas of technology a diplomatic war intended to isolate beijing and frustrate its grandiose plans for global outreach a cyber war largely hidden from public scrutiny and a range of military measures as well this may not be war in the traditional sense of the term but for leaders on both sides it has the feel of one why china the media and many politicians continue to focus on u s russian relations in large part because of revelations of moscow s meddling in the 2016 american presidential election and the ongoing mueller investigation behind the scenes however most senior military and foreign policy officials in washington view china not russia as the country s principal adversary in eastern ukraine the balkans syria cyberspace and in the area of nuclear weaponry russia does indeed pose a variety of threats to washington s goals and desires still as an economically hobbled petro state it lacks the kind of might that would allow it to truly challenge this country s status as the world s dominant power china is another story altogether with its vast economy growing technological prowess intercontinental belt and road infrastructure project and rapidly modernizing military an emboldened china could someday match or even exceed u s power on a global scale an outcome american elites are determined to prevent at any cost washington s fears of a rising china were on full display in january with the release of the 2019 worldwide threat assessment of the u s intelligence community a synthesis of the views of the central intelligence agency and other members of that community its conclusion we assess that china s leaders will try to extend the country s global economic political and military reach while using china s military capabilities and overseas infrastructure and energy investments under the belt and road initiative to diminish u s influence to counter such efforts every branch of government is now expected to mobilize its capabilities to bolster american and diminish chinese power in pentagon documents this stance is summed up by the term overmatch which translates asthe eternal preservation of american global superiority vis à vis china and all other potential rivals the united states must retain overmatch the administration s national security strategy insists and preserve a combination of capabilities in sufficient scale to prevent enemy success while continuing to shape the international environment to protect our interests in other words there can never be parity between the two countries the only acceptable status for china is as a distinctly lesser power to ensure such an outcome administration officials insist the u s must take action on a daily basis to contain or impede its rise in previous epochs as allison makes clear in his book this equation a prevailing power seeking to retain its dominant status and a rising power seeking to overcome its subordinate one has almost always resulted in conventional conflict in today s world however where great power armed combat could possibly end in a nuclear exchange and mutual annihilation direct military conflict is a distinctly unappealing option for all parties instead governing elites have developed other means of warfare economic technological and covert to achieve such strategic objectives viewed this way the united states is already in close to full combat mode with respect to china trade war when it comes to the economy the language betrays the reality all too clearly the trump administration s economic struggle with china is regularly described openly and without qualification as a war and there s no doubt that senior white house officials beginning with the president and his chief trade representative robert lighthizer see it just that way as a means of pulverizing the chinese economy and so curtailing that country s ability to compete with the united states in all other measures of power ostensibly the aim of president trump s may 2018 decision to impose 60 billion in tariffs on chinese imports increased in september to 200 billion was to rectify a trade imbalance between the two countries while protecting the american economy against what is described as china s malign behavior its trade practices plainly constitute a grave threat to the long term health and prosperity of the united states economy as the president put it when announcing the second round of tariffs an examination of the demands submitted to chinese negotiators by the u s trade delegation last may suggests however that washington s primary intent hasn t been to rectify that trade imbalance but to impede china s economic growth among the stipulations beijing must acquiesce to before receiving tariff relief according to leaked documents from u s negotiators that were spread on chinese social media halting all government subsidies to advanced manufacturing industries in its made in china 2025 program an endeavor that covers 10 key economic sectors including aircraft manufacturing electric cars robotics computer microchips and artificial intelligence accepting american restrictions on investments in sensitive technologies without retaliating opening up its service and agricultural sectors areas where chinese firms have an inherent advantage to full american competition in fact this should be considered a straightforward declaration of economic war acquiescing to such demands would mean accepting a permanent subordinate status vis à vis the united states in hopes of continuing a profitable trade relationship with this country the list reads like the terms for a surrender rather than a basis for negotiation was the way eswar prasad an economics professor at cornell university accurately described these developments technological warfare as suggested by america s trade demands washington s intent is not only to hobble china s economy today and tomorrow but for decades to come this has led to an intense far ranging campaign to deprive it of access to advanced technologies and to cripple its leading technology firms chinese leaders have long realized that for their country to achieve economic and military parity with the united states they must master the cutting edge technologies that will dominate the twenty first century global economy including artificial intelligence ai fifth generation 5g telecommunications electric vehicles and nanotechnology not surprisingly then the government has invested in a major way in science and technology education subsidized research in pathbreaking fields and helped launch promising startups among other such endeavors all in the very fashion that the internet and other american computer and aerospace innovations were originally financed and encouraged by the department of defense chinese companies have also demanded technology transfers when investing in or forging industrial partnerships with foreign firms a common practice in international development india to cite a recent example of this phenomenon expects that significant technology transfers from american firms will be one outcome of its agreed upon purchases of advanced american weaponry in addition chinese firms have been accused of stealing american technology through cybertheft provoking widespread outrage in this country realistically speaking it s difficult for outside observers to determine to what degree china s recent technological advances are the product of commonplace and legitimate investments in science and technology and to what degree they re due to cyberespionage given beijing s massive investment in science technology engineering and mathematics education at the graduate and post graduate level however it s safe to assume that most of that country s advances are the result of domestic efforts certainly given what s publicly known about chinese cybertheft activities it s reasonable for american officials to apply pressure on beijing to curb the practice however the trump administration s drive to blunt that country s technological progress is also aimed at perfectly legitimate activities for example the white house seeks to ban beijing s government subsidies for progress on artificial intelligence at the same time that the department of defense is pouring billions of dollars into ai research at home the administration is also acting to block the chinese acquisition of u s technology firms and of exports of advanced components and know how in an example of this technology war that s made the headlines lately washington has been actively seeking to sabotage the efforts of huawei one of china s most prominent telecom firms to gain leadership in the global deployment of 5g wireless communications such wireless systems are important in part because they will transmit colossal amounts of electronic data at far faster rates than now conceivable facilitating the introduction of self driving cars widespread roboticization and the universalapplication of ai second only to apple as the world s supplier of smartphones and a major producer of telecommunications equipment huawei has sought to take the lead in the race for 5g adaptation around the world fearing that this might give china an enormous advantage in the coming decades the trump administration has tried to prevent that in what is widely described as a tech cold war it has put enormous pressure on both its asian and european allies to bar the company from conducting business in their countries even as it sought the arrest in canada of huawei s chief financial officer meng wanzhou and her extradition to the u s on charges of tricking american banks into aiding iranian firms in violation of washington s sanctions on that country other attacks on huawei are in the works including a potential banon the sales of its products in this country such moves are regularly described as focused on boosting the security of both the united states and its allies by preventing the chinese government from using huawei s telecom networks to steal military secrets the real reason barely disguised is simply to block china from gaining technological parity with the united states cyberwarfare there would be much to write on this subject if only it weren t still hidden in the shadows of the growing conflict between the two countries not surprisingly however little information is available on u s chinese cyberwarfare all that can be said with confidence is that an intense war is now being waged between the two countries in cyberspace american officials accuse china of engaging in a broad based cyber assault on this country involving both outright cyberespionage to obtain military as well as corporate secrets and widespread political meddling what the russians are doing pales in comparison to what china is doing said vice president mike pence last october in a speech at the hudson institute though typically on the subject he provided not a shred of evidence for his claim not disclosed is what this country is doing to combat china in cyberspace all that can be known from available information is that this is a two sided war in which the u s is conducting its own assaults the united states will impose swift and costly consequences on foreign governments criminals and other actors who undertake significant malicious cyber activities the 2017 national security strategy affirmed what form these consequences have taken has yet to be revealed but there s little doubt that america s cyber warriors have been active in this domain diplomatic and military coercion completing the picture of america s ongoing war with china are the fierce pressures being exerted on the diplomatic and military fronts to frustrate beijing s geopolitical ambitions to advance those aspirations china s leadership is relying heavily on a much touted belt and road initiative a trillion dollar plan to help fund and encourage the construction of a vast new network of road rail port and pipeline infrastructure across eurasia and into the middle east and africa by financing and in many cases actually building such infrastructure beijing hopes to bind the economies of a host of far flung nations ever closer to its own while increasing its political influence across the eurasian mainland and africa as beijing s leadership sees it at least in terms of orienting the planet s future economics its role would be similar to that of the marshall plan that cemented u s influence in europe after world war ii and given exactly that possibility washington has begun to actively seek to undermine the belt and road wherever it can discouraging allies from participating while stirring up unease in countries like malaysia and uganda over the enormous debts to china they may end up with and the heavy handed manner in which that country s firms often carry out such overseas construction projects for example they typically bring in chinese laborers to do most of the work rather than hiring and training locals china uses bribes opaque agreements and the strategic use of debt to hold states in africa captive to beijing s wishes and demands national security advisor john bolton claimed in a december speech on u s policy on that continent its investment ventures are riddled with corruption he added and do not meet the same environmental or ethical standards as u s developmental programs bolton promised that the trump administration would provide a superior alternative for african nations seeking development funds but and this is something of a pattern as well no such assistance has yet materialized in addition to diplomatic pushback the administration has undertaken a series of initiatives intended to isolate china militarily and limit its strategic options in south asia for example washington has abandoned its past position of maintaining rough parity in its relations with india and pakistan in recent years it s swung sharply towards a strategic alliance with new dehli attempting to enlist it fully in america s efforts to contain china and presumably in the process punishing pakistan for its increasingly enthusiastic role in the belt and road initiative in the western pacific the u s has stepped up its naval patrols and forged new basing arrangements with local powers all with the aim of confining the chinese military to areas close to the mainland in response beijing has sought to escape the grip of american power by establishing miniature bases on chinese claimed islands in the south china sea or even constructing artificial islands to house bases there moves widely condemned by the hawks in washington to demonstrate its ire at the effrontery of beijing in the pacific once known as an american lake the white house has ordered an increased pace of so called freedom of navigation operations fronops navy warships regularly sail within shooting range of those very island bases suggesting a u s willingness to employ military force to resist future chinese moves in the region and also creating situations in which a misstep could lead to a military incident that could lead well anywhere in washington the warnings about chinese military encroachment in the region are already reaching a fever pitch for instance admiral philip davidson commander of u s forces in the pacific described the situation there in recent congressional testimony this way in short china is now capable of controlling the south china sea in all scenarios short of war with the united states a long war of attrition as admiral davidson suggests one possible outcome of the ongoing cold war with china could be armed conflict of the traditional sort such an encounter in turn could escalate to the nuclear level resulting in mutual annihilation a war involving only conventional forces would itself undoubtedly be devastating and lead to widespread suffering not to mention the collapse of the global economy even if a shooting war doesn t erupt however a long term geopolitical war of attrition between the u s and china will in the end have debilitating and possibly catastrophic consequences for both sides take the trade war for example if that s not resolved soon in a positive manner continuing high u s tariffs on chinese imports will severely curb chinese economic growth and so weaken the world economy as a whole punishing every nation on earth including this one high tariffs will also increase costs for american consumers and endanger the prosperity and survival of manyfirms that rely on chinese raw materials and components this new brand of war will also ensure that already sky high defense expenditures will continue to rise diverting funds from vital needs like education health infrastructure and the environment meanwhile preparations for a future war with china have already become the number one priority at the pentagon crowding out all other considerations while we re focused on ongoing operations acting secretary of defense patrick shanahan reportedly told his senior staff on his first day in office this january remember china china china perhaps the greatest victim of this ongoing conflict will be planet earth itself and all the creatures humans included who inhabit it as the world s top two emitters of climate altering greenhouse gases the u s and china must work together to halt global warming or all of us are doomed to a hellish future with a war under way even a non shooting one the chance for such collaboration is essentially zero the only way to save civilization is for the u s and china to declare peace and focus together on human salvation

guy boulton milwaukee journal sentinel lost in the ongoing debate over whether wisconsin should expand eligibility for medicaid and accept roughly 184 9 million a year in federal dollars for doing so is one small detail former gov scott walker and the republican controlled legislature already expanded the medicaid program they just didn t take the federal money available to states to offset much of the cost wisconsin is the only state in the country that expanded eligibility for its medicaid program the change made in 2014 covered 147 000 adults without dependent children as of january while not accepting the federal money available to states through the affordable care act that decision will have cost the state an estimated 1 1 billion in federal dollars through the current fiscal year according to the legislative fiscal bureau gov tony evers has proposed expanding eligibility for medicaid up to the threshold that would enable the state to receive the additional federal money republicans in the legislature whose votes evers would need have largely stood firm in their opposition and now legislators are citing a study that contends expanding the program would shift 1 1 billion in costs to private health plans the study released last month by republican lawmakers at a news conference at the state capitol was by the wisconsin institute for law liberty and the center for research on the wisconsin economy or crowe at the university of wisconsin madison economists and policy analysts quickly criticized the study for what they contend is a lengthy list of flaws with one describing it as baloney my real concern is they are trying to affect policy with such garbage work said tim classen a professor of economics at loyola university in chicago the authors of the study will flanders at the wisconsin institute for law liberty and noah williams an economics professor at uw madison stand by the study and its conclusions it s what the analysis shows backed up by a number of years of data flanders said it s what the numbers came out to the study set out to compare health care spending for people who are privately insured largely those who get health insurance through an employer in states that expanded medicaid under the affordable care act and those that didn t the premise of the study is that health systems physician practices and other health care providers will shift costs to private health insurers because medicaid s reimbursement rates don t cover their costs whether the study adequately accounted for wisconsin having already expanded eligibility for badgercare plus the state s largest medicaid program is a question so too is whether health systems and other health care providers can shift costs at will to private health insurers more on both later there s also a question about the study s time frame the study ended with data from 2014 before any purported cost shift to private health plans could have occurred in most states here s why this is a question the expanded eligibility for medicaid programs under the affordable care act didn t begin until jan 1 2014 health systems would begin to see any purported shortfalls from more patients being covered by medicaid during that year insurers typically negotiate three to five year contracts with health systems and other providers even assuming that health systems could raise prices for every heath insurer if there was a shortfall the price increases would not have been set until the following year 2015 insurers and employers who self insure in turn set premiums for their health plans for the following year in september or october this means that any costs shifted to private insurers wouldn t have appeared in the cost of health plans until 2016 at the earliest flanders and williams said some states expanded medicaid before 2014 for example new york delaware and massachusetts expanded coverage before that year and some other states did limited expansions before 2014 that said more than 8 million people a large number by any gauge gained coverage through the expanded eligibility for medicaid in 2014 the study s conclusion that expanding eligibility for medicaid would result in 1 1 billion in costs being shift to private employers also raised questions the legislative fiscal bureau estimates that 76 000 people in wisconsin have incomes between 100 percent and 138 percent of the federal poverty threshold or 12 490 to 17 236 this year the evers administration puts the number at 82 000 people in the state that high end 138 percent is the threshold for the state to be eligible for the federal dollars available under the affordable care act adults with incomes below 100 percent now are eligible for badgercare plus under the state s partial expansion using the legislative fiscal bureau estimate the study s conclusion would result in an average of 15 065 in costs being shifted to private health insurers for each person and that s if all of them sign up for coverage their actual medical bills would have to be higher given that this is just the purported shortfall between what it costs to provide medical care and what the badgercare plus program pays health systems and other providers the program spends 3 252 a year to cover adults in other words each person would have to have roughly 18 000 a year in medical costs based on the study s conclusions to put that in perspective for adults with health benefits through an employer average health care spending ranged from 1 746 a year for men 19 to 34 years old to 8 344 for women 55 to 64 in 2016 according to the peterson kaiser health system tracker it averaged 4 326 for men and 5 775 for women who were 45 54 that year the average costs for people with low incomes could be somewhat higher given the relationship between health and income it really is unfortunate when they do such sloppy work that gives you conclusions like this that are just ridiculous said classen the economics professor at loyola university in chicago flanders said more people could be in that group those with incomes between 100 percent and 138 percent of the federal poverty threshold and that the study was not based on a per enrollee cost this is a somewhat unique approach to be looking at private health care spending he said this is what the results found and williams the economics professor at uw madison and co author of the study said the study s estimate is plausible the study s conclusions didn t evoke any skepticism by the legislators rep joe sanfelippo r new berlin sen duey stroebel r saukville sen chris kapenga r delafield and sen dave craig r big bend who held the news conference to tout them that may be understandable given that it had the imprimatur of williams a respected macro economist who has a doctorate from the university of chicago and flanders research director at the wisconsin institute for law liberty has a doctorate in political science from florida state university and has been published in politico national review and the wall street journal without question republican legislators raise a valid point in noting that private health plans pay higher rates to hospitals doctors and other heath care providers than medicaid but studies show that expanding eligibility for medicaid significantly improved hospital operating profit margins according to an issue brief from the kaiser family foundation which does health policy research further hospital associations have pushed to expand eligibility for medicaid in states that didn t and they presumably wouldn t take that position if they thought it would increase their costs and force them to raise prices critics of the study done by flanders and williams also contend that it did not account for the fact that wisconsin already partially expanded medicaid the issue that really is not addressed for me is wisconsin s expansion has sort of already happened said laura dague an economist and associate professor of health policy at texas a m university the application of these numbers to the wisconsin context is pretty questionable basically the study comes up with a national average of the purported cost shift to private health plans from a broad group adults with incomes up to 138 percent of the poverty threshold it then applies that average to a subset of that group those with incomes between 100 percent and 138 percent of the threshold the study s critics contend that isn t an apples to apples comparison flanders and williams contend that some of the states that expanded medicaid already covered adults including adults without dependent children the assumption we are making here is those equal out for us to arrive at a reasonable estimate for the group in question flanders said the assumption i would dispute is that it is a broader group and williams noted that five states already had broad coverage for adults without dependent children before the affordable care act four states and washington d c did five states had limited coverage six states had programs that were closed and eight states including ohio and illinois had no coverage according to information from the kaiser family foundation the study s model also incorrectly used a per enrollee figure average spending for people in private health plans as a per capita figure meaning everyone in the state this was an honest mistake that came from an incorrect footnote but it distorted the study s conclusion because about a third of the state is covered by medicaid or medicare finally there s the debate over the underlying premise of the study whether health systems can shift costs to private health plans for one thing it implies that health systems have the leverage and market power to set prices higher they are going to raise prices to the extent that they can anyway said andy schneider a research professor at the center for children and families at georgetown university if they have market leverage they are going to raise prices economists and hospital trade groups however fiercely debate this neither flanders nor williams contend the study is perfect there are invariably assumptions that have to be made in every econometric analysis flanders said flanders also said that there are inevitably differing viewpoints on how to best model the question in the study and valid critiques can be offered there were more than a few of those it really is unfortunate because noah williams is an exceptional macro economist classen said he s incredibly talented as an academic economist but this foray into health economics is really disappointing to see it gets out there he added people retweet it people believe it it also is almost certain to be cited by republican lawmakers who oppose expanding eligibility for medicaid and taking the money available through the affordable care act whether to accept the federal money is a key issue in the debate and the position of the republican lawmakers frustrates robert laszewski of health policy strategy associates a health care consultant and wisconsin native who has been a sharp critic of flaws in the affordable care act why are we even having this discussion the data is there the studies are there the practical information is there laszewski said when are these people going to give up and finally admit that forcing wisconsin taxpayers to pay something the federal government has been begging to pay for is not smart policy
karen dandurant news seacoastonline com exeter when elizabeth warren visited town her message was one of unity in the name of making changes to the corruption she sees in politics where she says government works only for the rich and not for the average american family this is our chance to dream big to fight hard and win warren said you in new hampshire are an important part of this it s an investment in democracy and in truth if you believe in that be a part of it you don t get what you don t fight for the abolitionists the suffragettes were told it s too hard give up early union organizers foot soldiers in the civil rights movement and early gay rights activists were told it s too hard they didn t give up they organized a movement and changed the course of this country this is our chance to fight hard and to make changes our country is in a dangerous moment and the direction we take is going to set a course for generations to come the lines waiting to see the massachusetts democratic senator and presidential hopeful stretched down the stairs of the old town hall and snaked around water street warren spoke about her upbringing in oklahoma she talked about hard times and how her family overcame hardship how she persevered until she reached her goals my story is a story about all families and about government said warren my mother s minimum wage job saved our home and family today it will not keep a mom and baby out of poverty it is wrong and i do not want to see it continue minimum wage used to be set based on what it will take for a family of three to survive now it s what will it do for multi million dollar corporations i want a government that is for the family again warren said washington works great for giant drug companies and giant oil companies not for people who need a prescription or who see climate change bearing down not for people trying to live paycheck to paycheck it s corruption pure and simple that touches every family in this country said warren for decades wages have been flat health insurance has doubled college tuition tripled and the cost of child care is up 700 percent we have a problem a government that works for those at the top and now is our time to fight back one of the people who came to see what warren had to say was jeff donald of brentwood he said he has not yet decided on a candidate but that warren was one of his top picks she is one of the few i really like said donald she really gets into policy and she has some good ideas i think she really focuses on equality and battling racism and those are ideals important to me denise spacinski of newburyport mass is volunteering for warren s campaign because she believes in her she is our senator and i have liked her from the beginning said spacinski she looks like she d be a grandmother taking you for a stroll but she has always stood up to tough opponents as far as i can see she is straight as an arrow and considering what we are dealing with that is something we need state sen jon morgan d brentwood said in introducing warren i am here because i had enough of the anger and the bigotry i have had enough of turning a blind eye to the science that is damaging our next generation warren said the country needs big systemic changes to the rules in washington to the rules about the economy and to the rules of politics in washington we need to attack the corruption head on said warren big problems take big solutions we need to end lobbying as we know it to stop the revolving door between wall street and washington we need to make the supreme court follow basic rules of ethics every person who runs for federal office should have to put their tax returns out her last comment garnered loud applause on the economy warren said giant multi national corporations run over their workers their customers and the communities they are in we need power on the other side of the system she said let s make it easier to join unions and give unions more power if elected warren is proposing a two percent tax increase to the country s wealthiest families she said with that student loan debt could be wiped out with 2 trillion dollars left over for other needs of the american people like health care i am calling it a fairness tax said warren they all use roads fire departments and we all pay for it in 2020 if we make the credible case that we understand what s broken and we have a real plan to fix it and we have the grassroots to make it happen we will be able to make the change we need come 2021

the achilles heel of nascent technologies such as 5g artificial intelligence and big data which have the potential to boost productivity and resolve social issues from eldercare to climate change is the lack of a common global standard on data protection a business forum heard yesterday yet another weakness is the poor digital literacy among some quarters of the world which means a segment of the global population could miss out on the benefits of the digital economy business leaders from the group of 20 g 20 bloc of the world s largest developed and developing economies noted that the surge in protectionist sentiment worldwide should serve as a cautionary tale of the need for inclusive growth they were speaking at the business 20 or b 20 summit organised by the influential keidanren business lobby in a list of policy recommendations that keidanren chief hiroaki nakanishi handed to japanese prime minister shinzo abe at the close of the forum world leaders were urged to take up digital transformation as a key agenda topic at the g 20 leaders summit in osaka in june other key issues include climate change gender equality quality infrastructure and protecting free trade and investment systems mr nakanishi and panellists such as world trade organisation deputy director general yi xiaozhun said global headwinds including the looming brexit and ongoing united states china trade frictions have affected business sentiment making it crucial to safeguard multilateral systems nothing is more urgent than restoring global cooperation and liberalisation mr yi said fundamentally progress depends on everyone acknowledging that world trade has never been so interconnected and no country however powerful can resolve its trade challenges on its own singapore while not a g 20 country has regularly had a seat at the table yesterday singapore business federation chief ho meng kit said asean has greatly gained from open trade systems and will benefit from a set of rules that can facilitate the digital economy now that the region is home to unicorn start ups valued at over us 1 billion s 1 35 billion such as grab and gojek mr brooks entwistle chief international business officer at uber and mr eric jing chief executive of ant financial services group that operates china s largest mobile payment platform alipay both lauded the digital transformation for driving financial inclusion at unprecedented speeds given the opportunities for mom and pop businesses japanese telecommunications giant ntt chairman hiromichi shinohara said there could be more effective sharing of data worldwide to drive innovation and to build a multilateral cyber security framework now countries have different rules and regulations in data distribution and the protection of personal privacy he said this is not entirely wrong but to maximise the effective use of data some harmonisation is necessary across borders climate change also emerged as a key issue international chamber of commerce chairman paul polman criticised japan for failing to adequately do its part given its reliance on coal fired plants he called for more political will among countries that still rely on coal to adopt renewable alternatives so as to avoid committing the biggest inter generational crime in the history of mankind mr abe in brief remarks yesterday said the g 20 will work towards a future oriented growth strategy that can leverage disruptive technology to overcome global challenges like climate change and growing income disparities but he was challenged to walk the talk mr perrin beatty president of the canadian chamber of commerce said it is a truism that when leaders get together that when all is said and done more is always said than done the real challenge will be for leaders to go beyond making a statement at the lowest common denominator that everyone can live with to actually make firm genuine commitments key proposals by g 20 business leaders tokyo business leaders from the group of 20 g 20 comprising the world s largest developed and developing economies yesterday submitted to japanese prime minister shinzo abe a list of policy recommendations they want him to raise at the g 20 leaders summit in osaka in june these are some key proposals digital transformation build a common data governance framework to safeguard the free flow of data information ideas and knowledge while also respecting privacy and intellectual property promote a coordinated global response to cyber security threats increase digital literacy by ensuring digital education is made affordable and accessible to all including the poor and the elderly trade and investment reform the world trade organisation to improve its dispute settlement rule making and monitoring functions ensure free trade agreements are comprehensive and of high standard without pre emptive clauses and quantitative restrictions that are not in line with global norms energy and environment keep climate change high on the political agenda to realise a very low emission society tackle marine plastic waste and ban illegal waste disposal quality infrastructure promote projects that are open fiscally sound and environmentally sustainable and ensure job creation and transfer of technology health and well being improve efficiency by digitising health data which when aggregated can support innovation in new medicines and vaccine developments as well as help produce better diagnosis and treatment walter sim
adding inherently unreliable and heavily subsidised wind and solar to your grid is a guarantee of rocketing power prices every place in the world that got serious about wind and solar is being belted with serious increases in electricity costs wind and solar powered germany and wind powered denmark pay europe s highest power prices by a mile and prices in both cases are still climbing at double digit rates germany s power market is in chaos and its grid on the brink of total collapse the annual cost of the subsidies directed to wind and solar is colossal the annual cost to british power consumers and taxpayers in the uk alone is in excess of 6 000 000 000 in those european states which plugged in to wind and solar power prices are more than 50 higher than those g20 members that didn t not that the eu boffins and bureaucrats are all that keen to level with europeans as john constable points out there s a tendency to grossly overstate the purported benefits and vastly understate the true and staggering costs of europe s inevitable transition to an all wind and sun powered future eu commission accused of 5bn miscalculation over renewable energy subsidies bill energy voice david mcphee 22 february 2019 john constable of the global warming policy forum gwpf claims the eu commission climate policy report contains a substantive error miscalculating the cost of annual levies on uk consumers by 4 8 billion he said the initial bill claimed subsidies would be 1 3bn when the correct figure is closer to 6 1bn a spokesman for the eu commission said you are correct that the largest part of the other subsidies was from the renewables obligation and that these were not allocated to financed by end users as they should have been thank you for spotting this error we are correcting the figures and expect a revised report to be online soon mr constable said the miscalculation will have consequences for all sections of the report s overall findings and estimates he said the study is an important and major statement on the economic consequences of the eu s energy and climate policies and it is crucial that such work is as accurate as possible energy voice here s the full analysis from john constable eu commission study reveals international competitive disadvantage of climate policies gwpf john constable 19 february 2019 the third release of the eu commission s periodic study of global electricity and gas prices for the first time compares the eu 28 with the whole of the g20 for the period 2008 to 2016 eu 28 household electricity prices are now more than double those in the g20 while industrial electricity prices are now nearly 50 higher the only g20 states with higher industrial electricity prices are those with heavy commitments to renewables jim ratcliffe the remarkable entrepreneur who has taken neglected elements of britain s chemical s sector once regarded as a sunset industry and produced ineos a vigorous multi billion pound operation that has made him the uk s richest man has just passed authoritative sentence on the european union s general economic policy in an open letter of the 11 february to mr juncker the commission president nobody but nobody in my business seriously invests in europe europe is no longer competitive it has the world s most expensive energy and labour laws that are uninviting for employers some might discount this remark given the article a few days later in the sunday times 17 02 19 rehashing and warming over old news from august 2018 to the effect that mr ratcliffe is apparently locating his own tax affairs just outside the eu in monaco other readers with more experience of the tides in the affairs of newspapers will be inclined to think that if mr ratcliffe a well known supporter of brexit is worth this sort of non coincidental criticism he might actually be on to something indeed it is not necessary to look far for evidence that mr ratcliffe s remarks on energy find an echo even within brussels itself indeed as recently as january this year the directorate general for energy in the european commission published a 750 page attempt to assess the impacts of its energy and climate policies study on energy prices costs and subsidies and their impact on industry and households this analysis has been under reported perhaps because it is the third edition of a work previously released in 2014 and 2016 and so little new was expected in the 2019 update however this version significantly extends the range of the study now comparing the eu 28 to the whole of the g20 adding more detail on matters relating to competitiveness sections on the consequences of price regulation and detailed attempts at a new econometric analysis of the impact of subsidies on energy prices and costs p 15 there is much to quarrel with here and some substantive and indeed significant errors see for example table 6 15 where the uk s subsidies to renewables in 2016 are reported as 1 57 billion whereas the correct figure is closer to 7 billion but disagreements and mistakes aside this is not a minor or superficial study and anyone deeply interested in the subject will wish to turn its pages at least once a selection from its many charts will show what it has to offer as well as illustrating the points that mr ratcliffe made in his letter and explaining why he has supported brexit in principle this pair of charts from the executive summary presents at one glance the study s main findings figure 1 eu28 weighted average electricity and natural gas prices compared to g20 weighted by trade with eu average prices 2017 mwh source trinomics for dg energy study on energy prices costs and subsidies and their impact on industry and households 2019 17 the authors believe that by assembling multiple international eu national and commercial sources they have produced one of the most comprehensive and comparable sets of international price data current available p 16 these are then no mere snapshots but a far reaching attempt to get to grips with a very extensive body of information and the findings are clearly as important they are stark and unambiguous while wholesale prices of gas and electricity in the eu28 and the g20 are broadly comparable both in magnitude and in trend falling in both cases eu28 retail prices are significantly higher and in the case of electricity are not only much higher but have also exhibited until very recently a clear rising trend specifically since 2008 eu28 household electricity prices have been well over and are now more than double those in the g20 this has obvious and very serious consequences for the cost of labour no wonder the eu needs remedial social policies industrial electricity prices in the eu28 are now nearly 50 higher than those in the g20 and bizarrely are actually higher than domestic retail electricity prices in the g20 no factory closure in the eu honda in swindon say no manufacturing migration dyson to singapore for example should surprise anyone the gulf separating the industrial electricity prices within the eu in aggregate from the rest of the world is particularly remarkable in the light of the fact that energy intensive users in the eu are for the most part protected against the full impact of policies by tax relief and other exemptions figure 6 25 p 280 of the study shows that electricity prices to intensive energy users in germany for example would be nearly 40 higher without tax relief and exemptions that shift the burden on to other consumers if those consumers domestic households prominent amongst them were not taking a disproportionately high share of the direct impact of the eu s energy and climate policies the competitive disadvantage of european industry would be still greater domestic electricity may be maddeningly expensive in the eu28 but those burdened bill payers thankfully have jobs at least they do in germany and for the time being the uk one has to note from figure 6 25 has the highest overall prices to energy intensive users and one of the smallest levels of policy exemption some consolation might be found in the fact that industrial prices in the eu28 and the g20 are at present roughly equivalent however while process heat may be competitively priced in the eu it is electrically powered precision production methods that are closely associated with the very high value manufacturing which the eu member states must hope to retain in competition with the rest of the world bluntly important though gas is as a fuel for final consumption in factories and businesses it probably matters less to the emerging future of european industry not to mention transport than electricity the authors correctly attribute the high electricity prices in the eu 28 to the tax regime by which of course is meant energy and climate policies where the eu is out of step with the rest of the world as the authors themselves gloomily comment whilst a convergence in tax rates may occur if other g20 countries implement similar fiscal measures as the eu as part of their climate mitigation policies there is as yet little evidence that this is the case p 16 so much for the leadership exhibited by the eu no one is following that lead or seems likely to do so the main body of the study provides further detail on the climate policy determined divergence in electricity prices consider for example the following three charts the first two charting actual prices and the last providing an indexed comparison figure 2 electricity

impact on industry and households 2019 66 while it is not surprising that retail electricity prices in china are now lower than those in the eu the margin is perhaps not as dramatic as might have been expected a reminder that low cost process heat from coal has been more important to chinese growth than electricity however cheap electricity really does matter in the high tech high wage economies of the united states south korea and canada and in rapidly growing countries such as indonesia turkey and mexico the eu will obviously struggle to compete with such locations for the development of sophisticated industrial processes it is also worth observing which the commission s study does not that the only major g20 states with higher industrial electricity prices than the eu28 are japan which has closed and is only slowly re opening its nuclear fleet while in the meantime generating from expensively imported liquefied natural gas and a vast fleet of extravagantly subsidised solar photovoltaics and brazil which is at least as heavily committed to renewables as the eu itself the grim rising trend in australian electricity prices another state with a heavy investment in renewables is also surely significant gwpf meanwhile in a renewables obsessed land downunder

chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager now i will turn the call to our chief financial officer ms zhu xiaoying to give you more details on our financial highlights after that i will take the questions thank you zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager hello everyone my name is zhu xiaoying now i would like to provide a brief overview of our financial results for the full year 2018 please note that all numbers i will discuss today are in us dollars unless otherwise noted zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager first let me walk you through the full year financial results in 2018 zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager total net revenues in 2018 were 112 4 million a increase of 9 6 million or 9 4 from 102 8 million in 2017 the increase in revenues was mainly due to a increase in sales of off road vehicles during 2018 zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager ev parts sales were approximately 99 1 million in 2018 accounting for 88 1 of our total net revenues a increase of 1 7 million or 1 8 from 97 4 million compared to 2017 zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager revenue from sales of off road vehicles was 13 2 million in 2018 a increase of 7 9 million or 144 8 compared with 5 4 million in 2017 the increase in revenue from off road vehicles was largely due to the additional sales from sc autosports which became our wholly owned subsidiary in the us in july 2018 zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager our cost of goods sold in 2018 was 92 2 million a increase of 3 7 million or 4 2 from 88 5 million in 2017 the change was primarily due to the corresponding increase in sales from 2018 zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager gross profit in 2018 was 20 2 million a increase of 5 9 million or 41 2 from 14 3 million in 2017 gross margin in 2018 increased to 18 from 14 in 2017 the increase of gross margin was due to the higher gross margin from off road vehicles sales of sc autosports as well as increased gross margin from sales of battery packs zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager total operating expenses in 2018 were 21 9 million a decrease of 45 9 from 40 4 million during 2017 the decrease in total operating expenses was due to the largely decreased research and development expenses in 2018 zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager gaap net loss in 2018 was 5 7 million or 0 11 loss per fully diluted share compared with gaap net loss of 28 3 million or 0 59 loss per fully diluted share in 2017 the decreased in net loss was primarily attributable to the increased gross profit the decrease in r d expenses and the increased government grants the company received this year zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager income before income tax in 2018 was 2 1 million compared to loss of before income tax of 31 6 million in 2017 the increased income tax expense is many due to the 6 0 million valuation allowance of hainan facility s deferred tax assets because of three year accumulated loss in its construction period after other income tax adjustments the income tax expense in 2018 was 7 8 million zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager non gaap net loss in 2018 was 8 8 million compared with non gaap net loss of 23 2 million in 2017 non gaap loss per share was approximately 0 17 per fully diluted share for the full year of 2018 compared with non gaap adjusted loss per share of 0 48 per fully diluted share for the full year of 2017 zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager let me touch on the jv s financials now zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager for the full year 2018 the jv company s net sales were 122 5 million gross loss was 17 7 million and net loss was 36 3 million zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager during 2018 the jv company sold a total of 10 259 units of ev products as compared to a total of 11 437 units sold in 2017 zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager kandi s investments in the jv company are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as kandi has a 50 ownership interest in the jv company as a result kandi recorded 50 of the jv company s loss for 18 2 million for the full year 2018 after eliminating intra entity profits and losses kandi s share of the after tax loss of the jv company was 17 9 million for the full year 2018 zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager next i will review the company s cash flow zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager in 2018 cash provided in operating activities was 13 6 million as compared to cash used in operating activities of 3 2 million in 2017 the major operating activities that provided cash for 2018 are increase of accounts payable and increase of other payables and accrued liabilities the major operating activities that used the cash for 2018 was a increase in receivables from the jv company and a increase of accounts receivables zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager cash used in investing activities for 2018 was 0 95 million as compared to cash derived from investing activities of 2 71 million for 2017 during the year of 2018 the major investing activity that used cash was the acquisition of jinhua an kao net of cash received in the amount of 3 56 million zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager cash used in financing activities for 2018 was 5 3 million as compared to cash used in financing activities of 9 81 million in 2017 the major financing activities that provided cash for 2018 were proceeds from notes payable of 54 35 million and proceeds from short term bank loans of 32 50 million the major financing activities that used cash for 2018 were 58 59 million of repayments of note payables and 33 26 million of repayments of short term bank loans zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager operator we are ready to take some questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions we will now take our first question from ted schwartz please go ahead ted schwartz tas associates analyst i notice that you re having an income tax expense of 7 7 million whereas both the joint venture and kandi itself showed a loss i don t understand where that 7 7 million income tax expense came in could you explain that kewa luo investor relations manager i m sorry can you just repeat one more time your phone is a little skipping ted schwartz tas associates analyst pardon me kewa luo investor relations manager hello would you please repeat your question one more time your phone is little skipping ted schwartz tas associates analyst i don t understand how there could be a 7 7 million income tax expense when both the joint venture and kandi showed a loss zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager okay this actually is not the income tax that we paid but however has to be accounted as expense in our financial statements but most of the part is due to the 6 million valuation allowance of hainan facility deferred tax asset because the hainan facility s bringing accumulated loss in its construction period and the rest of 1 7 million is from other subsidiaries who is profitable altogether 7 7 million was accounted for the income tax expenses ted schwartz tas associates analyst what models of cars are there presently are presently in production multiple speakers the 22s the 27 the ex3 and what about the k23 in hainan kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language okay right now there are k23 k22 and ex3 are presently in production and in march we have plans of 300 k23 stacked up ev parts for the production in hainan facility ted schwartz tas associates analyst would you be producing and selling in hainan in march kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager right now since we still rely on geely s manufacturing license so it s going to be sales of the ev part sets hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager so if we plan to have these 300 sets of ev parts produced this month so the sales probably will happen next month ted schwartz tas associates analyst all right thank you very much not sure i understand it but kewa thank you take the next question kewa luo investor relations manager thank you operator we can take next question operator thank you our next question comes from frank vladermann please go ahead frank vladermann analyst yes and good morning can you hear me ok kewa luo investor relations manager yes go ahead frank vladermann analyst okay i have a question involving carbon credits trading i believe that carbon credit trading maybe an important source of revenue for the joint venture going forward can you give us a present status of this program how is this being looked at and implemented in china or has that not yet been fully decided kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager carbon credit trading policy is still in the planning stages we don t know the details of the benefits until the policy is released we have heard a lot of news regarding to it but we haven t seen any final policy that being released frank vladermann analyst okay very good thank you very much i may have another question later please take the next questioner kewa luo investor relations manager thank you operator we will now take our next question from li ghou ph please go ahead li ghou analyst good evening to hu and good morning kewa my question is about the 2019 the production and sales so what was basic inaudible for the 2019 car production and sales is it because of the subsidy delay or it is something else it is something else then what s the steps the company is going to do to resolve this issue if this was the subsidy delay do you have a transfer in when the subsidy might get to be paid foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager due to the changes in the subsidy policy also the delay in the payment sales will definitely be affected as for now the subsidies from 2015 and 2016 already in the process of clearing and we anticipate that we re going to receive this part of the subsidy payment very soon and we re also being told that the subsidy from 2017 and 2018 will be start clearing and start paying very soon as well and so the company is seeking breakthroughs in the government credit online ride haling vehicle market and in the us we have been doing a lot of work and we believe that 2019 we re going to have very promising result li ghou analyst i have another question this is about the cars being produced so mr hu just mentioned that the cars are being produced mostly k22 k27 and ex3 so where are they produced now foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language li ghou analyst actually i heard some news cars are being moved to be produced in rugao is there any particular reason and what is your plan for the plant in shanghai factor or somewhere else foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language li ghou analyst thank you kewa luo investor relations manager let me translate what mr hu just said first of all the first question where are k27 k22 and ex3 being produced the answer is all these cars are being produced at jiangsu rugao so the gentleman is asking why we produce all these cars at one location on the jiangsu rugao instead of spread out them in different locations for example in shanghai and mr hu s answer is because we used to rely on geely s manufacturing license but however right now rugao already has the production license so rugao can produce all these vehicles at one location to save the cost and also to centralize all the production at one place in the past we used to produce k10 at zhejiang factory and k11 at shanghai but since right now we don t have a lot of volume so we centralized everything at the jiangsu rugao and some for some k23 ev parts we do separate in hainan li ghou analyst i have one more question i think the management needs to clarify to the western investors who are often confused by the process actually i am super clear about that this is just for clarification so people are really confused about that process of the manufacturing licence approval currently kandi has the approval from the ndrc the national development and reform commission so and as mr hu just mentioned we are waiting for the speculative approval from miit so when do you expect that to happen foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language li ghou analyst foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language li ghou analyst foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager okay sure so and this question is regarding to the dual production license that we mentioned earlier and mr hu would like to further clarify what this means to us and we believe there has been some confusion regarding the approval of this license issued by the development and reform commission and actually the ndrc approved enterprise to build the factory so that s the first license and the next step is the acceptance of the factory by the ministry of industry and information technology as a result once miit approves the company and the company factory will be able to produce the cars and that s the second license and together it s called dual production license that company is applying and usually there are three steps which is the car has to be included in the include in the directory in order to be registered in china to be able to be driven on the road so basically those are three steps in order for you sell the car and then the car will be finally available in the market and this is the same procedure for all the manufacturers in china and for kandi we have already sent our application for getting the miit approval in the beginning of march and we expect to hear from them in the beginning of april li ghou analyst thank you kewa thank you mr hu kewa luo investor relations manager thank you operator we will now take our next question from john destefano ph please go ahead john destefano analyst good evening my question is in regard to export to the united states of the k22 and ex3 my understanding from what i gathered from your opening and what i read in the press release is that approval is still pending for sale in california so if that is correct are dealerships in place ready to go in california once the approval has been obtained and what ports do you expect to export the automobiles to in california in the us and my understanding multiple speakers excuse me my understanding also is from your opening that you plan to export these automobiles to the us later this year is that correct kewa luo investor relations manager let me translate first foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager these two models can be sold in the us nationwide so it s not just in california so there was no any awaiting application to be not waiting any application in california right now we re in the process of forming a sales force team and the company anticipates that we re going to import 50 evs to 100 evs by the end of may with regards to which ports will be used for importing vehicles into the us i think the us sales team is working on it to choose the most cost efficient one john destefano analyst okay thank you very much kewa luo investor relations manager thank you operator we will now take our next question from mike pfeffer from oppenheimer please go ahead mr pfeffer your line is now open please go ahead it appears he may have stepped away from his headset we will now take our next question from beth mozan ph please go ahead beth mozan analyst i understand that the k23 is going to be designed for the ride hailing business has the hainan factory started meaningful production and if not can you let me know when it might start and the reason and second part have there been discussions with hainan about their emulating the rmb730 million low interest loan program as is in place with jiangsu province kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager we have already planned 300 k23 sets of ev parts for production in march at hainan factory in regarding to the discussions with the government about the supply chain finance support program there haven t been any discussions yet because in hainan we are just producing the parts but in jiangsu rugao we already started producing the evs beth mozan analyst thank you kewa luo investor relations manager thank you we will now take our next question from steve miller please go ahead steve miller analyst thank you two related questions for 2019 this year what are you anticipating to be the revenue for the jv and kandi from the 300 000 ev framework agreement and the 20 000 ev co operation agreement that were announced earlier this year and related to that i understand there is the 20 000 kilometer requirement to be reached by vehicles in the car share program before you can apply for subsidy payment is that going to negatively affect the jv s ability to produce these vehicles that s it kewa luo investor relations manager so first question is about on the revenue for jv right the second question is whether the 20 000 kilometers mileage will be the requirement for the ride hailing program steve miller analyst my first question i guess is what revenues are you anticipating from both agreements and then the second question is whatever cars that are sold in connection with those agreements do they have to comply with that 20 000 kilometer requirement in order to be able for you guys to be able to apply for the subsidy payment kewa luo investor relations manager okay thank you foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager this contract was signed in order to serve the implementation of the 300 000 government credit online ride hailing vehicle alliance program we expect the program to begin in april i don t think there will be any impact on the 20 000 kilometers requirement for the subsidy because each vehicle that is used for online ride hailing service usually runs 8 000 kilometers per month on average so in three months they will be well exceed the 20 000 kilometer requirement operator we will now take our next question from mark kahnau from swiss liquid future please go ahead mark kahnau swiss liquid future analyst yes good morning hello and good evening everybody it seems to me that for the first nine months the jv was effectively breakeven kandi wrote off only 43 000 but by the end of the year there was an after tax loss of 17 8 million that means for me the joint venture must have written off about 35 million in the fourth quarter is that correct and if it s correct for what reason kewa luo investor relations manager i m sorry can you just say slowly one more time so i can translate mark kahnau swiss liquid future analyst through the first nine months of the year the joint venture effectively was breakeven that s what that we could read in the figures kandi wrote off 43 000 by the year end share of loss after tax of the joint venture was 17 8 million but that means to me that the joint venture must have written off 35 million in the fourth quarter is this correct and if it s correct for what reason kewa luo investor relations manager okay foreign language zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager okay okay this is due to in q4 there is rmb160 million research r d expenses for jv in q4 mark kahnau swiss liquid future analyst okay i get that okay very good that s it from me for today kewa luo investor relations manager okay thank you operator we will now take our next question from harris goldman please go ahead harris goldman analyst hello it s been a long time since i talked to mr hu we made the trip i organized the trip in 2014 when we were having quite a few detractors saying that we never existed and of course we proved that wrong anyway my question is i m a little confused and need a little clarification regarding the guidance for this year i see in mr hu s statement we re projecting 20 000 units now my confusion is we have a framework agreement for 300 000 over five years and we have the other 20 000 on accredited units is mr hu taking a very conservative stance regarding jv production this year or would he provide a clarification on why he s only guiding to 20 000 units kewa luo investor relations manager okay foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager well as i mentioned earlier that for 2018 we are glad that we were able to survive and for 2019 we want to look forward to do a revival so in this year even though we have these contracts laid out for 300 000 ev contract we are the primary provider so we don t want to over promise the market and under deliver and for this year we want to take one thing at one step and laid out the groundwork for more growth going forward so and additionally we also want to focus on the quality of our products and be able to deliver better results going forward harris goldman analyst okay so if i understand this is a very conservative guidance this year because from what i ve heard and what i ve read yes this will be a revival year but we can reasonably expect if we receive the subsidies because that s been our problem it appears to me that we ve experienced all along we were we have basically been subsidizing the subsidies and that has curtailed our production and sale so therefore from what i m hearing now from mr hu i m much more optimistic about this revival year than what was said earlier in terms of a 20 000 unit guidance for this year okay that s it thank you kewa luo investor relations manager thank you foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager mr hu says thank you we ll work hard to deliver good business results we can take next question operator we will now take our next question from mike pfeffer from oppenheimer please go ahead mike pfeffer oppenheimer analyst hi thanks for taking my question the press release titled kandi pure electric vehicles project received approval was confusing to many in the us particularly when mentioned along with approval for 50 000 evs in rugao even a bloomberg reporter was confused and said you mr hu said it was approval to build a facility in rugao where kandi jv already had one can you confirm for all that this is the license we have waited several years for allowing kandi to now make and sell its own evs as well as for others and secondly what is the significance of the 50 000 number in the press release thank you kewa luo investor relations manager okay can you ok i ve got your question foreign language zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager thank you for your question i want to once again clarify which i also discussed earlier on the call with regarding to the manufacturing license there are actually three steps in total first is approval from national development and reform commission that they approved the company to build the factory which is what we received earlier and what we announced and the next step is acceptance of the factory by the ministry of industry and information technology and once we get approval from miit then the factory is entitled to produce cars and as a result this is so called dual production license and once this has been obtained the company will be able to not just build a factory and the factory will be able to produce the vehicles and the first step is the miit will have to approve that model to be able to register and we think that by in april we should be able to get all these steps ready and by then we will make announcements the next question is that you asked about 50 000 units that we mentioned in the press release so when you apply to the ndrc for the license to build a factory you have to include your capacity in the factory you re building and you have to at least achieve 80 of capacity in order to build another location factory so for example we applied 50 000 capacity for this factory we can go over that number to produce there 100 000 but if we want to build another factory in a different location we have to at least achieve 80 of 50 000 which is 40 000 so we just it s a number that you give in your application so with that i hope i clarified what you have just asked mike pfeffer oppenheimer analyst thank you operator we will now take our next question from arthur porcari from corporate strategies please go ahead arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst thank you mr hu congratulations and thanks for all shareholders in your year of improvement of 2018 to 2019 and based on public announcements sounds like an incredible start for the 2019 forward long awaited breakout witnessed by amazing string of announcements just since january 4th interesting side note based on just today s numbers so it appears that kandi itself would have had a pre tax profit of almost 20 million for the full year where if not for having to consolidate that 17 8 million share of the jv r d loss in the fourth quarter as a prior caller said the jv was actually at breakeven through the the first three quarters just an observation which you can address in a moment if you want to with this said i d like to address an expanded series of questions mostly limited to two major areas announced more on the five year 300 000 ev for the china resources ride hailing program i mean the five year 300 000 and the three year 20 000 ev cao cao ride hailing program then i want to wrap it up and to see how the jv expects to finance the cost to deliver this potential 5 billion to 6 billion worth of evs over the next five years i pass that on to mr hu and i ll then ask the questions kewa luo investor relations manager hi arthur can you repeat what you asked in the first part about the jv would you just arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst okay what i was ok no i was just saying that this is an add on because of the numbers with which i m saying this but i said this is a side observation i don t think we were expecting the 35 million 36 million fourth quarter writedown in the jv for all that onetime r d expense which caused kandi to actually take an additional 17 8 million loss in the fourth quarter without that it seems like the kandi s pre tax profit which was already at over 2 million if they add that back in we would have almost 20 million for kandi itself i realized that this shows how well kandi itself is performing independently of the jv that s the only point i wanted to make ok and do you need me to repeat the rest of it or do you have the rest of it kewa luo investor relations manager okay i do foreign language go ahead with your question arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst okay first question is after 20 000 cao cao puts an all ev ride hailing program from what i understand so it s good to see that this china unicorn which is a high end ride club uber like chauffeur ev ride hailing program currently has 30 000 high end geely and volvo evs and this was put together by kandi s jv partner li shufu and his geely holdings in the kandi announcement it states that the parties have agreed to collaborate in exploring new and innovative models for an online ride hailing business with their combined resources and market advantage now the question is does this mean kandi will be developing new ev models over and above what we already have to fulfill get into this high end program or will the ex3 get released k23 be used and will the quick battery exchange be used with cao cao as well kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager mr hu is saying now there are a lot of questions so i will just go one by one first the 300 000 cars signed with alliance which is going to be serving for all these online ride hailing platforms not just on the cao cao zhuan che platform going to be for example didi or other platform and this is going to be initiated by our company joint venture hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager because there s requirement for the wheel base that required by the ride hailing services so the ex3 s wheel base is not meeting the requirement therefore we are going to launch the k23 and the other developing car is called k8 b class which is the high end car for the online ride hailing platform arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst and kandi is going to be developing that new k8 or kandi jv kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager yeah together with geely and the joint venture arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst that s breaking news okay let me move on to the 300 000 ev program five year announcement now this was quite a stunning announcement though it had seemed to have no effect on the stock at the time potential to the kandi jv for this over the life of it could exceed 5 billion and as the jv primary parts and battery provider maybe an additional 2 billion directly to kandi i based this on the assumption that the required battery exchange feature addressed in the announcement is the kandi owned and patented qbx which requires four battery packs instead of two as for the consumer plug in versions so i have two questions short questions that have to do with this based on this quote from the announcement the jv company will be the primary vehicle supplier in the accredited vehicle alliance can we assume that all of the 300 000 evs which have the quick battery exchange feature will come will have to have the quick battery exchange feature and if true likely all the evs will then be kandi provided and the second question is how many current service station locations does china resources have across the 25 provinces in china and are they still growing and will the quick battery exchange locations to be exclusive for the alliance members or will they also future be used for any kandi ev which has quick battery exchange feature kewa luo investor relations manager okay foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager okay let me try to cover all the information mr hu just provided first of all kandi will surely be the primary ev provider in the alliance in providing the ev and the battery and the china resources zhejiang they used to they have many locations throughout china and at this point i don t know i don t have a number how many they have but however we think that since these locations always are providing the gasoline to the vehicles and based on the demand of the electric vehicles some of them may also going to be available for the battery exchange and giving a strategic partnering with them and they are going to be in charge of investment and operations of all these credit vehicle alliance vehicle battery exchange business but the specific detail plan of building required services sites will be depending on the demand from the credit vehicle in the alliance program and i think this is going to be gradually delivered within five years and the quick battery exchange feature will surely be used for all these future kandi evs arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst okay good certainly looking at only about 18 000 a car i would think 5 billion is probably a conservative number then anyway let s press on here to get into my next section a little bit here has to do with financing just a short comment first since cao cao is controlled by a kandi jv inaudible 50 partner china resources the alliance with the government enterprise the credibility factor toward the buyer following through on these deals would seem to be quite high but to rapidly address these projects alone i would think that kandi would require the jv to have at least 1 billion in cash to get started so far our partner of the jv has not raised any outside equity since formation so as evidenced on how the hot ev market is in china recently discovered the 7 china ev unicorn start ups each less than three years old and only two to include dl have not sold any evs to date as negatively i m sorry two have sold the other five have not as negatively compared to the kandi jv none of them have any stage of licenses not even first stage and only one has a facility yet together they ve raised over rmb80 billion or 11 6 billion or between 1 billion to 3 4 billion each and to give a total perceived value to all these a 24 billion this is as early as 2016 that kandi jv has publicly announced its intention to go public likely in china this subject has again come up with positive company response in recent conference call go ahead and translate all that for mr hu so far then i will get into the question kewa luo investor relations manager okay foreign language go ahead as i have summarized what you just said arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst okay fine the three year old nio with much less infrastructure and hard assets than the five year old kandi five year old kandi jv recently came public in the us with a 7 billion market cap after raising 2 4 billion private equity in china would it be reasonable to assume that the kandi jv could quickly raise maybe 200 million private equity in china at about a 2 billion cap and then follow up with maybe another 0 5 billion raised at a 3 billion cap inaudible the last part of the press release which you put in today kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager i think i want to answer in two parts first you mentioned a lot of development at nio i want to say that nio s business we really don t need to compare nio with kandi and for now it s not time yet for kandi to discuss jv company s evaluation secondly for jv company what you have plan like i mentioned earlier in my remarks that the jv company s management is working on evaluate for the optimal time to restructure the jv company s equity in order to unlock the shareholder value of the jv company once we have significant progress we will update the market at the proper time arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst okay and then get down to my last question here it would seem to me without before i even hit the question with kandi s 380 million market cap market is saying kandi is worth a zero and the jv is only worth around 700 million i would think that mr hu would argue with that and that s why he s talking about unlocking the value of the jv but when you divide it by two or whatever you can get a real value what kandi should be trading at but with that said the last question has to do with the ipo venue in the past as i assume that ipo is route they might want to go in the past the announced intention was to bring the jv public in china however china asia listings require three consecutive years of positive earnings it s recently been announced with much excitement that the new shanghai tech board similar to nasdaq will start trading later this year without the earnings requirement could the jv consider this new listing for an actual ipo or would the company consider bringing in the jv public even in the united states kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager i think whether it is shanghai tech board or in the us i think these all can be possible and right now still too early to discuss but once we have made a decision we will report to the market arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst excellent i really appreciate mr hu s patience with long series of questions but considering that kandi had less than a 400 million market cap and 50 partner and without a doubt the largest in the ev agreement and in the 300 000 car agreement announced in china by any ev maker needed some expanded discussion and again thank mr hu very much and look forward to once again beating beating his forecast by at least 35 to 40 as he did a few years back when he used to give forecast thank you kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager thank you thank you arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst i m done operator we now have a follow up question from frank vladermann please go ahead frank vladermann analyst well thank you i have three extremely important questions first question does this factory need a separate approval from both the ndrc and miit or only the miit kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager yes we re just waiting for the approval from miit and matter of fact they are already working on approving our application it s already in the process frank vladermann analyst well yes but will that approval cover all the factories or does each each factory require separate miit approval kewa luo investor relations manager are you asking whether the approval going to cover all our factories in different locations frank vladermann analyst yes that is correct kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager this only approve jiangsu rugao factory but when jiangsu rugao factory has it that means that the joint venture has the manufacturing license frank vladermann analyst okay thank you now second question will the k8 be equipped with the quick battery exchange feature kewa luo investor relations manager i m sorry will be the kandi exchange what feature frank vladermann analyst will the k8 be equipped with the quick battery exchange kewa luo investor relations manager okay foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager yes they all do have the quick battery exchange feature frank vladermann analyst okay third very quick question then i m done is the joint venture now an officially recognized company in the eyes of the prc since we have the ndrc license kewa luo investor relations manager whatever jv is frank vladermann analyst is it now an official company in the eyes of the prc kewa luo investor relations manager what do you mean the joint venture frank vladermann analyst yes the joint venture is recognized with a license by the ndrc does this make the joint venture an official company in the viewpoint of the people s republic of china government kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager so since i have to wait for the dual production license to be received that will be considered as the official ev company with the production capability frank vladermann analyst thank you for taking my questions kewa luo investor relations manager thank you operator this concludes today s question and answer session i would now like to hand the call back to our hosts for any additional or closing remarks kewa luo

otherwise noted advertisement advertisement zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager first let me walk you through the full year financial results in 2018 zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager total net revenues in 2018 were 112 4 million a increase of 9 6 million or 9 4 from 102 8 million in 2017 the increase in revenues was mainly due to a increase in sales of off road vehicles during 2018 zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager ev parts sales were approximately 99 1 million in 2018 accounting for 88 1 of our total net revenues a increase of 1 7 million or 1 8 from 97 4 million compared to 2017 advertisement advertisement zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager revenue from sales of off road vehicles was 13 2 million in 2018 a increase of 7 9 million or 144 8 compared with 5 4 million in 2017 the increase in revenue from off road vehicles was largely due to the additional sales from sc autosports which became our wholly owned subsidiary in the us in july 2018 zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager our cost of goods sold in 2018 was 92 2 million a increase of 3 7 million or 4 2 from 88 5 million in 2017 the change was primarily due to the corresponding increase in sales from 2018 advertisement advertisement zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager gross profit in 2018 was 20 2 million a increase of 5 9 million or 41 2 from 14 3 million in 2017 gross margin in 2018 increased to 18 from 14 in 2017 the increase of gross margin was due to the higher gross margin from off road vehicles sales of sc autosports as well as increased gross margin from sales of battery packs zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager total operating expenses in 2018 were 21 9 million a decrease of 45 9 from 40 4 million during 2017 the decrease in total operating expenses was due to the largely decreased research and development expenses in 2018 advertisement advertisement zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager gaap net loss in 2018 was 5 7 million or 0 11 loss per fully diluted share compared with gaap net loss of 28 3 million or 0 59 loss per fully diluted share in 2017 the decreased in net loss was primarily attributable to the increased gross profit the decrease in r d expenses and the increased government grants the company received this year zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager income before income tax in 2018 was 2 1 million compared to loss of before income tax of 31 6 million in 2017 the increased income tax expense is many due to the 6 0 million valuation allowance of hainan facility s deferred tax assets because of three year accumulated loss in its construction period after other income tax adjustments the income tax expense in 2018 was 7 8 million advertisement advertisement zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager non gaap net loss in 2018 was 8 8 million compared with non gaap net loss of 23 2 million in 2017 non gaap loss per share was approximately 0 17 per fully diluted share for the full year of 2018 compared with non gaap adjusted loss per share of 0 48 per fully diluted share for the full year of 2017 zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager let me touch on the jv s

7 million and net loss was 36 3 million zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager during 2018 the jv company sold a total of 10 259 units of ev products as compared to a total of 11 437 units sold in 2017 zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager kandi s investments in the jv company are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as kandi has a 50 ownership interest in the jv company as a result kandi recorded 50 of the jv company s loss for 18 2 million for the full year 2018 after eliminating intra entity profits and losses kandi s share of the after tax loss of the jv company was 17 9 million for the full year 2018 zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager next i will review the company s cash flow zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager in

zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager operator we are ready to take some questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions we will now take our first question from ted schwartz please go ahead ted schwartz tas associates analyst i notice that you re having an income tax expense of 7 7 million whereas both the joint venture and kandi itself showed a loss i don t understand where that 7 7 million income tax expense came in could you explain that kewa luo investor relations manager i m sorry can you just repeat one more time your phone is a little skipping ted schwartz tas associates analyst pardon me kewa luo investor relations manager hello would you please repeat your question one more time your phone is little skipping ted schwartz tas associates analyst i don t understand how there could be a 7 7 million income tax expense when both the joint venture and kandi showed a loss zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager okay this actually is not the income tax that we paid but however has to be accounted as expense in our financial statements but most of the part is due to the 6 million valuation allowance of hainan facility deferred tax asset because the hainan facility s bringing accumulated loss in its construction period and the rest of 1 7 million is from other subsidiaries who is profitable altogether 7 7 million was accounted for the income tax expenses ted schwartz tas associates analyst what models of cars are there presently are presently in production multiple speakers the 22s the 27 the ex3 and what about the k23 in hainan kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language okay right now there are k23 k22 and ex3 are presently in production and in march we have plans of 300 k23 stacked up ev parts for the production in hainan facility ted schwartz tas associates analyst would you be producing and selling in hainan in march kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager right now since we still rely on geely s manufacturing license so it s going to be sales of the ev part sets hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager so if we plan to have these 300 sets of ev parts produced this month so the sales probably will happen next month ted schwartz tas associates analyst all right thank you very much not sure i understand it but kewa thank you take the next question kewa luo investor relations manager thank you operator we can take next question operator thank you our next question comes from frank vladermann please go ahead frank vladermann analyst yes and good morning can you hear me ok kewa luo investor relations manager yes go ahead frank vladermann analyst okay i have a question involving carbon credits trading i believe that carbon credit trading maybe an important source of revenue for the joint venture going forward can you give us a present status of this program how is this being looked at and implemented in china or has that not yet been fully decided kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager carbon credit trading policy is still in the planning stages we don t know the details of the benefits until the policy is released we have heard a lot of news regarding to it but we haven t seen any final policy that being released frank vladermann analyst okay very good thank you very much i may have another question later please take the next questioner kewa luo investor relations manager thank you operator we will now take our next question from li ghou ph please go ahead li ghou analyst good evening to hu and good morning kewa my question is about the 2019 the production and sales so what was basic inaudible for the 2019 car production and sales is it because of the subsidy delay or it is something else it is something else then what s the steps the company is going to do to resolve this issue if this was the subsidy delay do you have a transfer in when the subsidy might get to be paid foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager due to the changes in the subsidy policy also the delay in the payment sales will definitely be affected as for now the subsidies from 2015 and 2016 already in the process of clearing and we anticipate that we re going to receive this part of the subsidy payment very soon and we re also being told that the subsidy from 2017 and 2018 will be start clearing and start paying very soon as well and so the company is seeking breakthroughs in the government credit online ride haling vehicle market and in the us we have been doing a lot of work and we believe that 2019 we re going to have very promising result li ghou analyst i have another question this is about the cars being produced so mr hu just mentioned that the cars are being produced mostly k22 k27 and ex3 so where are they produced now foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language li ghou analyst actually i heard some news cars are being moved to be produced in rugao is there any particular reason and what is your plan for the plant in shanghai factor or somewhere else foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language li ghou analyst thank you kewa luo investor relations manager let me translate what mr hu just said first of all the first question where are k27 k22 and ex3 being produced the answer is all these cars are being produced at jiangsu rugao so the gentleman is asking why we produce all these cars at one location on the jiangsu rugao instead of spread out them in different locations for example in shanghai and mr hu s answer is because we used to rely on geely s manufacturing license but however right now rugao already has the production license so rugao can produce all these vehicles at one location to save the cost and also to centralize all the production at one place in the past we used to produce k10 at zhejiang factory and k11 at shanghai but since right now we don t have a lot of volume so we centralized everything at the jiangsu rugao and some for some k23 ev parts we do separate in hainan li ghou analyst i have one more question i think the management needs to clarify to the western investors who are often confused by the process actually i am super clear about that this is just for clarification so people are really confused about that process of the manufacturing licence approval currently kandi has the approval from the ndrc the national development and reform commission so and as mr hu just mentioned we are waiting for the speculative approval from miit so when do you expect that to happen foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language li ghou analyst foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language li ghou analyst foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager okay sure so and this question is regarding to the dual production license that we mentioned earlier and mr hu would like to further clarify what this means to us and we believe there has been some confusion regarding the approval of this license issued by the development and reform commission and actually the ndrc approved enterprise to build the factory so that s the first license and the next step is the acceptance of the factory by the ministry of industry and information technology as a result once miit approves the company and the company factory will be able to produce the cars and that s the second license and together it s called dual production license that company is applying and usually there are three steps which is the car has to be included in the include in the directory in order to be registered in china to be able to be driven on the road so basically those are three steps in order for you sell the car and then the car will be finally available in the market and this is the same procedure for all the manufacturers in china and for kandi we have already sent our application for getting the miit approval in the beginning of march and we expect to hear from them in the beginning of april li ghou analyst thank you kewa thank you mr hu kewa luo investor relations manager thank you operator we will now take our next question from john destefano ph please go ahead john destefano analyst good evening my question is in regard to export to the united states of the k22 and ex3 my understanding from what i gathered from your opening and what i read in the press release is that approval is still pending for sale in california so if that is correct are dealerships in place ready to go in california once the approval has been obtained and what ports do you expect to export the automobiles to in california in the us and my understanding multiple speakers excuse me my understanding also is from your opening that you plan to export these automobiles to the us later this year is that correct kewa luo investor relations manager let me translate first foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager these two models can be sold in the us nationwide so it s not just in california so there was no any awaiting application to be not waiting any application in california right now we re in the process of forming a sales force team and the company anticipates that we re going to import 50 evs to 100 evs by the end of may with regards to which ports will be used for importing vehicles into the us i think the us sales team is working on it to choose the most cost efficient one john destefano analyst okay thank you very much kewa luo investor relations manager thank you operator we will now take our next question from mike pfeffer from oppenheimer please go ahead mr pfeffer your line is now open please go ahead it appears he may have stepped away from his headset we will now take our next question from beth mozan ph please go ahead beth mozan analyst i understand that the k23 is going to be designed for the ride hailing business has the hainan factory started meaningful production and if not can you let me know when it might start and the reason and second part have there been discussions with hainan about their emulating the rmb730 million low interest loan program as is in place with jiangsu province kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager we have already planned 300 k23 sets of ev parts for production in march at hainan factory in regarding to the discussions with the government about the supply chain finance support program there haven t been any discussions yet because in hainan we are just producing the parts but in jiangsu rugao we already started producing the evs beth mozan analyst thank you kewa luo investor relations manager thank you we will now take our next question from steve miller please go ahead steve miller analyst thank you two related questions for 2019 this year what are you anticipating to be the revenue for the jv and kandi from the 300 000 ev framework agreement and the 20 000 ev co operation agreement that were announced earlier this year and related to that i understand there is the 20 000 kilometer requirement to be reached by vehicles in the car share program before you can apply for subsidy payment is that going to negatively affect the jv s ability to produce these vehicles that s it kewa luo investor relations manager so first question is about on the revenue for jv right the second question is whether the 20 000 kilometers mileage will be the requirement for the ride hailing program steve miller analyst my first question i guess is what revenues are you anticipating from both agreements and then the second question is whatever cars that are sold in connection with those agreements do they have to comply with that 20 000 kilometer requirement in order to be able for you guys to be able to apply for the subsidy payment kewa luo investor relations manager okay thank you foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager this contract was signed in order to serve the implementation of the 300 000 government credit online ride hailing vehicle alliance program we expect the program to begin in april i don t think there will be any impact on the 20 000 kilometers requirement for the subsidy because each vehicle that is used for online ride hailing service usually runs 8 000 kilometers per month on average so in three months they will be well exceed the 20 000 kilometer requirement operator we will now take our next question from mark kahnau from swiss liquid future please go ahead mark kahnau swiss liquid future analyst yes good morning hello and good evening everybody it seems to me that for the first nine months the jv was effectively breakeven kandi wrote off only 43 000 but by the end of the year there was an after tax loss of 17 8 million that means for me the joint venture must have written off about 35 million in the fourth quarter is that correct and if it s correct for what reason kewa luo investor relations manager i m sorry can you just say slowly one more time so i can translate mark kahnau swiss liquid future analyst through the first nine months of the year the joint venture effectively was breakeven that s what that we could read in the figures kandi wrote off 43 000 by the year end share of loss after tax of the joint venture was 17 8 million but that means to me that the joint venture must have written off 35 million in the fourth quarter is this correct and if it s correct for what reason kewa luo investor relations manager okay foreign language zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager okay okay this is due to in q4 there is rmb160 million research r d expenses for jv in q4 mark kahnau swiss liquid future analyst okay i get that okay very good that s it from me for today kewa luo investor relations manager okay thank you operator we will now take our next question from harris goldman please go ahead harris goldman analyst hello it s been a long time since i talked to mr hu we made the trip i organized the trip in 2014 when we were having quite a few detractors saying that we never existed and of course we proved that wrong anyway my question is i m a little confused and need a little clarification regarding the guidance for this year i see in mr hu s statement we re projecting 20 000 units now my confusion is we have a framework agreement for 300 000 over five years and we have the other 20 000 on accredited units is mr hu taking a very conservative stance regarding jv production this year or would he provide a clarification on why he s only guiding to 20 000 units kewa luo investor relations manager okay foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager well as i mentioned earlier that for 2018 we are glad that we were able to survive and for 2019 we want to look forward to do a revival so in this year even though we have these contracts laid out for 300 000 ev contract we are the primary provider so we don t want to over promise the market and under deliver and for this year we want to take one thing at one step and laid out the groundwork for more growth going forward so and additionally we also want to focus on the quality of our products and be able to deliver better results going forward harris goldman analyst okay so if i understand this is a very conservative guidance this year because from what i ve heard and what i ve read yes this will be a revival year but we can reasonably expect if we receive the subsidies because that s been our problem it appears to me that we ve experienced all along we were we have basically been subsidizing the subsidies and that has curtailed our production and sale so therefore from what i m hearing now from mr hu i m much more optimistic about this revival year than what was said earlier in terms of a 20 000 unit guidance for this year okay that s it thank you kewa luo investor relations manager thank you foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager mr hu says thank you we ll work hard to deliver good business results we can take next question operator we will now take our next question from mike pfeffer from oppenheimer please go ahead mike pfeffer oppenheimer analyst hi thanks for taking my question the press release titled kandi pure electric vehicles project received approval was confusing to many in the us particularly when mentioned along with approval for 50 000 evs in rugao even a bloomberg reporter was confused and said you mr hu said it was approval to build a facility in rugao where kandi jv already had one can you confirm for all that this is the license we have waited several years for allowing kandi to now make and sell its own evs as well as for others and secondly what is the significance of the 50 000 number in the press release thank you kewa luo investor relations manager okay can you ok i ve got your question foreign language zhu xiaoying interim chief financial officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager thank you for your question i want to once again clarify which i also discussed earlier on the call with regarding to the manufacturing license there are actually three steps in total first is approval from national development and reform commission that they approved the company to build the factory which is what we received earlier and what we announced and the next step is acceptance of the factory by the ministry of industry and information technology and once we get approval from miit then the factory is entitled to produce cars and as a result this is so called dual production license and once this has been obtained the company will be able to not just build a factory and the factory will be able to produce the vehicles and the first step is the miit will have to approve that model to be able to register and we think that by in april we should be able to get all these steps ready and by then we will make announcements the next question is that you asked about 50 000 units that we mentioned in the press release so when you apply to the ndrc for the license to build a factory you have to include your capacity in the factory you re building and you have to at least achieve 80 of capacity in order to build another location factory so for example we applied 50 000 capacity for this factory we can go over that number to produce there 100 000 but if we want to build another factory in a different location we have to at least achieve 80 of 50 000 which is 40 000 so we just it s a number that you give in your application so with that i hope i clarified what you have just asked mike pfeffer oppenheimer analyst thank you operator we will now take our next question from arthur porcari from corporate strategies please go ahead arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst thank you mr hu congratulations and thanks for all shareholders in your year of improvement of 2018 to 2019 and based on public announcements sounds like an incredible start for the 2019 forward long awaited breakout witnessed by amazing string of announcements just since january 4th interesting side note based on just today s numbers so it appears that kandi itself would have had a pre tax profit of almost 20 million for the full year where if not for having to consolidate that 17 8 million share of the jv r d loss in the fourth quarter as a prior caller said the jv was actually at breakeven through the the first three quarters just an observation which you can address in a moment if you want to with this said i d like to address an expanded series of questions mostly limited to two major areas announced more on the five year 300 000 ev for the china resources ride hailing program i mean the five year 300 000 and the three year 20 000 ev cao cao ride hailing program then i want to wrap it up and to see how the jv expects to finance the cost to deliver this potential 5 billion to 6 billion worth of evs over the next five years i pass that on to mr hu and i ll then ask the questions kewa luo investor relations manager hi arthur can you repeat what you asked in the first part about the jv would you just arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst okay what i was ok no i was just saying that this is an add on because of the numbers with which i m saying this but i said this is a side observation i don t think we were expecting the 35 million 36 million fourth quarter writedown in the jv for all that onetime r d expense which caused kandi to actually take an additional 17 8 million loss in the fourth quarter without that it seems like the kandi s pre tax profit which was already at over 2 million if they add that back in we would have almost 20 million for kandi itself i realized that this shows how well kandi itself is performing independently of the jv that s the only point i wanted to make ok and do you need me to repeat the rest of it or do you have the rest of it kewa luo investor relations manager okay i do foreign language go ahead with your question arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst okay first question is after 20 000 cao cao puts an all ev ride hailing program from what i understand so it s good to see that this china unicorn which is a high end ride club uber like chauffeur ev ride hailing program currently has 30 000 high end geely and volvo evs and this was put together by kandi s jv partner li shufu and his geely holdings in the kandi announcement it states that the parties have agreed to collaborate in exploring new and innovative models for an online ride hailing business with their combined resources and market advantage now the question is does this mean kandi will be developing new ev models over and above what we already have to fulfill get into this high end program or will the ex3 get released k23 be used and will the quick battery exchange be used with cao cao as well kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager mr hu is saying now there are a lot of questions so i will just go one by one first the 300 000 cars signed with alliance which is going to be serving for all these online ride hailing platforms not just on the cao cao zhuan che platform going to be for example didi or other platform and this is going to be initiated by our company joint venture hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager because there s requirement for the wheel base that required by the ride hailing services so the ex3 s wheel base is not meeting the requirement therefore we are going to launch the k23 and the other developing car is called k8 b class which is the high end car for the online ride hailing platform arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst and kandi is going to be developing that new k8 or kandi jv kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager yeah together with geely and the joint venture arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst that s breaking news okay let me move on to the 300 000 ev program five year announcement now this was quite a stunning announcement though it had seemed to have no effect on the stock at the time potential to the kandi jv for this over the life of it could exceed 5 billion and as the jv primary parts and battery provider maybe an additional 2 billion directly to kandi i based this on the assumption that the required battery exchange feature addressed in the announcement is the kandi owned and patented qbx which requires four battery packs instead of two as for the consumer plug in versions so i have two questions short questions that have to do with this based on this quote from the announcement the jv company will be the primary vehicle supplier in the accredited vehicle alliance can we assume that all of the 300 000 evs which have the quick battery exchange feature will come will have to have the quick battery exchange feature and if true likely all the evs will then be kandi provided and the second question is how many current service station locations does china resources have across the 25 provinces in china and are they still growing and will the quick battery exchange locations to be exclusive for the alliance members or will they also future be used for any kandi ev which has quick battery exchange feature kewa luo investor relations manager okay foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager okay let me try to cover all the information mr hu just provided first of all kandi will surely be the primary ev provider in the alliance in providing the ev and the battery and the china resources zhejiang they used to they have many locations throughout china and at this point i don t know i don t have a number how many they have but however we think that since these locations always are providing the gasoline to the vehicles and based on the demand of the electric vehicles some of them may also going to be available for the battery exchange and giving a strategic partnering with them and they are going to be in charge of investment and operations of all these credit vehicle alliance vehicle battery exchange business but the specific detail plan of building required services sites will be depending on the demand from the credit vehicle in the alliance program and i think this is going to be gradually delivered within five years and the quick battery exchange feature will surely be used for all these future kandi evs arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst okay good certainly looking at only about 18 000 a car i would think 5 billion is probably a conservative number then anyway let s press on here to get into my next section a little bit here has to do with financing just a short comment first since cao cao is controlled by a kandi jv inaudible 50 partner china resources the alliance with the government enterprise the credibility factor toward the buyer following through on these deals would seem to be quite high but to rapidly address these projects alone i would think that kandi would require the jv to have at least 1 billion in cash to get started so far our partner of the jv has not raised any outside equity since formation so as evidenced on how the hot ev market is in china recently discovered the 7 china ev unicorn start ups each less than three years old and only two to include dl have not sold any evs to date as negatively i m sorry two have sold the other five have not as negatively compared to the kandi jv none of them have any stage of licenses not even first stage and only one has a facility yet together they ve raised over rmb80 billion or 11 6 billion or between 1 billion to 3 4 billion each and to give a total perceived value to all these a 24 billion this is as early as 2016 that kandi jv has publicly announced its intention to go public likely in china this subject has again come up with positive company response in recent conference call go ahead and translate all that for mr hu so far then i will get into the question kewa luo investor relations manager okay foreign language go ahead as i have summarized what you just said arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst okay fine the three year old nio with much less infrastructure and hard assets than the five year old kandi five year old kandi jv recently came public in the us with a 7 billion market cap after raising 2 4 billion private equity in china would it be reasonable to assume that the kandi jv could quickly raise maybe 200 million private equity in china at about a 2 billion cap and then follow up with maybe another 0 5 billion raised at a 3 billion cap inaudible the last part of the press release which you put in today kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager i think i want to answer in two parts first you mentioned a lot of development at nio i want to say that nio s business we really don t need to compare nio with kandi and for now it s not time yet for kandi to discuss jv company s evaluation secondly for jv company what you have plan like i mentioned earlier in my remarks that the jv company s management is working on evaluate for the optimal time to restructure the jv company s equity in order to unlock the shareholder value of the jv company once we have significant progress we will update the market at the proper time arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst okay and then get down to my last question here it would seem to me without before i even hit the question with kandi s 380 million market cap market is saying kandi is worth a zero and the jv is only worth around 700 million i would think that mr hu would argue with that and that s why he s talking about unlocking the value of the jv but when you divide it by two or whatever you can get a real value what kandi should be trading at but with that said the last question has to do with the ipo venue in the past as i assume that ipo is route they might want to go in the past the announced intention was to bring the jv public in china however china asia listings require three consecutive years of positive earnings it s recently been announced with much excitement that the new shanghai tech board similar to nasdaq will start trading later this year without the earnings requirement could the jv consider this new listing for an actual ipo or would the company consider bringing in the jv public even in the united states kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager i think whether it is shanghai tech board or in the us i think these all can be possible and right now still too early to discuss but once we have made a decision we will report to the market arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst excellent i really appreciate mr hu s patience with long series of questions but considering that kandi had less than a 400 million market cap and 50 partner and without a doubt the largest in the ev agreement and in the 300 000 car agreement announced in china by any ev maker needed some expanded discussion and again thank mr hu very much and look forward to once again beating beating his forecast by at least 35 to 40 as he did a few years back when he used to give forecast thank you kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager thank you thank you arthur porcari corporate strategies analyst i m done operator we now have a follow up question from frank vladermann please go ahead frank vladermann analyst well thank you i have three extremely important questions first question does this factory need a separate approval from both the ndrc and miit or only the miit kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager yes we re just waiting for the approval from miit and matter of fact they are already working on approving our application it s already in the process frank vladermann analyst well yes but will that approval cover all the factories or does each each factory require separate miit approval kewa luo investor relations manager are you asking whether the approval going to cover all our factories in different locations frank vladermann analyst yes that is correct kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager this only approve jiangsu rugao factory but when jiangsu rugao factory has it that means that the joint venture has the manufacturing license frank vladermann analyst okay thank you now second question will the k8 be equipped with the quick battery exchange feature kewa luo investor relations manager i m sorry will be the kandi exchange what feature frank vladermann analyst will the k8 be equipped with the quick battery exchange kewa luo investor relations manager okay foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager yes they all do have the quick battery exchange feature frank vladermann analyst okay third very quick question then i m done is the joint venture now an officially recognized company in the eyes of the prc since we have the ndrc license kewa luo investor relations manager whatever jv is frank vladermann analyst is it now an official company in the eyes of the prc kewa luo investor relations manager what do you mean the joint venture frank vladermann analyst yes the joint venture is recognized with a license by the ndrc does this make the joint venture an official company in the viewpoint of the people s republic of china government kewa luo investor relations manager foreign language hu xiaoming founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language kewa luo investor relations manager so since i have to wait for the dual production license to be received that will be considered as the official ev company with the production capability frank vladermann analyst thank you for taking my questions kewa luo investor relations manager thank you operator this concludes today s question and answer session i would now like to hand the call back to our hosts for any additional or closing remarks kewa luo

a funny thing happened on the way to the u s becoming a nation of renters people started buying homes again new data indicate that in 2016 in defiance of myriad prognostications the decadelong decline in the homeownership rate abruptly reversed once rapid growth in renter households stalled and the long stagnant number of owner led households began rising the most recent housing vacancies and homeownership survey shows homeownership rates rose from a low of 63 percent in the second quarter of 2016 to 64 6 in the fourth quarter of 2018 adjusted for seasonality this move reflects changes in the status of millions of households the homeownership rate has regained all the ground it lost since 2014 while the change in homeownership since 2016 is statistically significant the figures can be volatile and subject to revision the first year of the trend has been confirmed by the census bureau s most recent american community survey the survey takes some time to release but because it s sent to 3 5 million households provides the most accurate such data available outside of the decennial census it s now apparent demographic pressure had been building since the housing crisis millennials were hitting the age at which previous generations has begun buying homes but had put off homebuying due to slow earnings growth a tepid labor market and soaring student loan debt in 2005 11 6 percent of adults ages 25 to 34 were living with their parents urban institute housing expert laurie goodman and her colleagues jung choi and jun zhu found last year by 2017 the share of adults in that age group living with their parents had almost doubled to 22 percent in 2016 millennials finally began to overcome the obstacles that sat between them and homeownership the homeownership rate for those under age 45 had fallen faster than the overall rate since the recession began but since the 2016 turnaround homeownership in the under 35 and 35 to 45 age groups has recovered rapidly the oldest millennials born in 1981 are now 38 advertising millennials have been on a buying spree the last few years zillow research economist aaron terrazas said millennials pack considerable demographic punch they will soon outnumber baby boomers if they don t already and as a rule of thumb aging marriage and procreation tend to drive home purchasing decisions as much as purely economic concerns do the groundwork was laid the year before homebuying decisions take time prices are one likely culprit in the middle of 2015 rents nationally rose more than 6 percent from a year earlier easily their fastest growth since the real estate data experts at zillow began keeping track it s one of the few times on record that rents rose faster than home prices rent appreciation was so high during that period that it essentially put fire under people s feet to get up and buy terrazas said people who may have been sitting on the fence would be incentivized to jump into homeownership in the longer run home prices not rising rents were the real incentive zillow data show home prices have consistently risen at several times the pace of inflation since 2013 some renters were likely driven to homeownership by fears that with homes appreciating so quickly that they would be locked out of buying a home in their desired area terrazas said advertising they may have also feared the end of easy money in december 2015 the federal reserve lifted its interest rate target off zero for the first time in almost a decade the move had been expected for quite some time back then the fed forecast rates would be about 3 4 percent by the end of 2018 they were off by an entire percentage point but we didn t know that at the time maybe people thought interest rates could go up i should lock in now goodman said by the end of 2015 the scars of the recession were beginning to fade the number of new properties in the foreclosure process had peaked seven years earlier in 2008 seven years is also how long it takes for foreclosures to roll off your credit score older buyers who had been burned by the housing bubble would have had their first real opportunity to re enter the housing market many would also have had the means to do so adjusted for inflation labor department figures show average hourly earnings in 2015 rose at their fastest annual rate since 2009 for the first time since the recovery s early days the average american s earnings were growing substantially faster than her costs by late 2015 the unemployment rate hit 5 0 percent exactly half of its post recession peak and just over a percentage point higher than the 3 8 percent rate recorded in february 2019 when there s very low unemployment when there s been slow but steady wage growth that tends to make households confident in their ability to make what will likely be their largest investment of their life said ralph mclaughlin whose blog post inspired this piece mclaughlin is an economist at the real estate data outfit corelogic the reversal seems to be driven by the sales of single family homes that had previously been rented out mclaughlin said the homes could have been rented out by their owners or one of the investment outfits that snapped up properties in the wake of the great recession the number of single family homes occupied by renters peaked in 2016 and fell in 2017 according to the american community survey
the labor movement needs to revive its recent history of demanding full equality for all immigrant workers in february 2000 the afl cio executive council passed a unanimous resolution calling for an immediate amnesty for undocumented workers and an end to employer sanctions that had primarily been used to undermine labor organizing thus denying labor rights for all workers the resolution called for enforcement against employers who violated the labor rights of their undocumented workers and demanded protected status for undocumented worker who reported their employers for labor violations this was a dramatic shift for the u s s main labor federation which for decades had primarily viewed undocumented workers as competitors who unfairly undercut wages and job prospects for u s born workers in 1986 the afl cio had supported the employer based sanctions that were allegedly put in place to punish employers who exploited undocumented workers however for the next decade and a half labor activists saw how these same employers used these new enforcement tools in their favor to intimidate immigrant workers bust up unionizing drives and keep wages low by the late 1990s immigrant workers and rights activists both within and outside the afl cio built mounting pressure to push the federation to recognize this fact the 2000 resolution was a recognition that undocumented workers and their families were part and parcel of the american working class and that attacks on their rights were an attack on all of labor the unions took the call into action with the 2003 immigrant worker freedom ride some 900 undocumented workers their families and fellow activists set out in 18 buses from around country the riders had the support and collaboration of historic figures from the 1960s civil rights movement freedom rides to desegregate the south the 2003 freedom riders paid tribute at sites where the original freedom riders face repression and they faced repression of their own including immigration checkpoints that they successfully resisted the freedom ride culminated in an october 4 rally of 100 000 in queens where then afl cio president john sweeney told the crowd the struggle of immigrant workers is our struggle we believe as dr martin luther king jr believed that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere unfortunately just as the labor movement was turning toward this position of solidarity the narrative in washington around immigration was undergoing a drastic and tragic reframing after the attack on the world trade center on september 11 2001 immigration was rebranded as a national security question the same year as the freedom ride the immigration and naturalization service ins was renamed immigration and customs enforcement and brought into the orwellian named department of homeland security dhs the reframing of immigration as a national security threat was unfortunately a bipartisan effort as democrats rushed to show how strong they were on border security in the 2004 presidential debates john kerry went so far as to paint republican incumbent george bush jr as endangering americans by being soft on border security by 2005 even pro immigrant politicians like barack obama were framing immigration proposals in the context of the dangers of the flood of unmonitored illegals coming into the country in this context much of the immigrants rights and labor movements including my union were convinced that amnesty was impossible and were corralled to support a dead end strategy around the framework of comprehensive immigration reform cir the dreams of legalization for undocumented workers were contorted to fit the priorities of the national security state thus any type of reform had to follow a strategy that emphasized punitive measures for illegals who had broken the law before they could gain any relief along with an increase in enforcement measures and a massive militarization of the u s mexico border cir might better stand for corporate immigration reform given the fact that over time the successive waves of proposed cir legislation included ever increasing levels of guest worker and temporary visa programs that delivered legal workers with ever limited rights to employers while offering billions dollars in contracts to the private prison industry to house the increasing number of detainees in 2006 far right anti immigrant legislation pending in congress sparked mass marches around the country hundreds of thousands in several cities turned out to mega marches that eclipsed even the numbers from the immigrant worker freedom ride the protest wave culminated in one the biggest job action in this country s history with immigrant workers across the country boycotting work in a day without an immigrant on may 1 2006 however while unions participated these marches were not initiated nor primarily lead by the official labor movement which at this point had abandoned its call for amnesty as the framing of the movement shifted away from amnesty toward a highly restrictive punitive and conditional path to citizenship the field was left open for the far right to dominate the narrative on immigration immigrant bashing became a get rich quick scheme for politicians with flagging careers most notably our current president today there is a new opening to revitalize the call for unconditional solidarity with immigrants of all statuses trump s blatant racism and demonization of all immigrants undocumented or not are rejected by a majority of the population the sickening scenes of children being ripped from their parents at the border has awakened awareness about the brutality of ice and the border patrol with recent reports from the aclu and department of health and human services exposing the fact that this horrific abuse long predates the trump administration this has led to heightened calls to abolish ice even among mainstream democratic party politicians the brutal abuse of migrant children in government custody is only the most extreme example however of an immigration system that subjects immigrants of all statuses to exploitation anxiety and even terror on a daily basis history shows that whenever a people are denied basic civil rights human rights violations follow in the u s today we have a growing section of our population that is denied a number of basic rights including the right to vote the right to due process when facing criminal allegations and the right to work organize and unionize freely immigration laws do not just impact the undocumented population today almost one in five u s workers are foreign born including naturalized citizens legal permanent residents visa holders people with temporary status and other undocumented workers people of all statues are integrated into our economy our workplaces our schools our communities and our families many live in mixed status families affected by range of immigration issue millions of undocumented workers hold various types of work permits that allow them to work legally millions of others pay payroll and other taxes they will never reap the benefit of all this while foreign born workers just like their native born counterparts produce profits for their employers the reality is employers want immigrants to be here but only if they are locked into permanent or semi permanent second class citizenship author and activist justin akers chacon argues that employers used the 1986 laws to restructure the workforce throughout the 1990s and lock in permanent pools of cheap labor beyond even what had existed before they pushed wages downward by having the ability to reveal those without papers fired workers who protested and got rid of those who tried to unionize it is precisely the restriction of immigration and persecution of migrant workers that has allowed employers to divide and weaken organized labor as a whole this increase in immigration enforcement has happened in tandem with the dramatic expansion of mass incarceration which has used criminalization to similarly deny basic civil rights to a large section of our population for being poor black and brown we need to fight the racism inherent in both of these systems and for equal rights for all the right to live free of fear to work and organize and participate fully as equals in our society this was a founding principle of the labor movement that needs to be revived today recently we have seen more and more acts of workplace solidarity with immigrants both seiu and national nurses united have organized solidarity trips of health care workers to address the humanitarian crisis unfolding at tijuana san diego border crossing and elsewhere tech workers have protested their companies complicity with ice unionized legal workers in new york have staged walkouts against ice presence in the courts some unions have also gone so far as to put immigrant solidarity into their contract demands striking teachers in los angeles and at charter schools in chicago prioritized and won protections and resources for their immigrant students and their families conversely immigrant activist played an important role in organizing solidarity for the denver teachers strike unfortunately too much of the labor movement is still mired in notions of nationalism that only serve to weaken them but the argument for working class solidarity between immigrants and native born workers is actually quite simple for the past several decades our government has spent increasing billions of our tax dollars terrorizing imprisoning brutalizing and deporting working class people in record numbers they have done so not to protect the rest of us but rather to the benefit of corporations who have driven down wages and living conditions for all in that same time frame the labor movement should join the call to abolish ice and come out against all enforcement tools used by employers to drive down wages we should demand that the billions being spent on repression be redirected to jobs infrastructure schools and health care often we are told the problem with initiatives like medicaid for all or the new green deal are that they are too expensive and yet the money is there if we simply take it away from destructive entities like ice we must also demand that some of that money be spent to provide services and aid to communities that have suffered decades of physical and psychological warfare we should continue to push for sanctuary and abolish ice resolutions in our unions and non unionized workplaces we should begin to talk again about general amnesty and workplace protections for undocumented workers we should seek to incorporate protections for our immigrant co workers and neighbors into our contracts we should support and learn from the heroic struggles of immigrant workers in this country as well as from important strikes across the border trump and his ilk are trying to use immigration to drive a wedge down the middle of the u s working class it s time for us to take to heart the old labor slogan an injury to one is an injury to all and stand shoulder to shoulder with all workers regardless of where they were born or how they got here
