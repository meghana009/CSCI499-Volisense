via creditbubblebulletin it cannot be overstated bubbles are of paramount importance for markets finance more generally economies and social and geopolitical stability two u s bursting episodes over the past twenty years would seem to make this proposition indisputable i would add that bubble dynamics have never been more pertinent than they became over the past year apply monetary stimulus to a historic financial bubble and you re asking for serious trouble the story of a perilous 2019 yet bubble these days has no part in conventional analysis or dialogue for central bankers economists or market pundits to even utter the word on cnbc or bloomberg would suggest one is hopelessly detached from reality from my vantage point bullishness and new paradigm thinking these days rivals that of the early 2000 peak today s faith in central banking is unrivaled the willingness to embrace egregious excess unmatched to summarize the 2019 policy backdrop in one word capitulation it was to be a year of monetary policy normalization the new fed chairman was to finally return policy rates to a more reasonable level after leaving rates near zero for seven years the fed belatedly took a baby step in december 2015 a full year went by before mustering the courage for a second cautious step and a year full later december 2017 rates were still at 1 00 policy rates were only up to 1 25 to 1 50 when powell took the reins having delayed the process much too long normalization was not going to go smoothly rates were taken to 2 25 to 2 5 by the end of 2018 and the wheels almost came off powell s january 4th dovish u turn essentially ended any notion of rate normalization avoiding market instability was the priority and celebratory markets took full advantage in 2019 the odds central bankers would ever actually tighten monetary conditions became exceedingly low to accurately comprehend 2019 demands attention to key bubble dynamics first of all to employ monetary stimulus in the late stage of a bubble ensures instability conventional thinking both in policy circles and the markets was that with limited ammunition central bankers should utilize stimulus early and aggressively late cycle bubbles by their nature connote financial and economic fragilities there are at the same time powerfully entrenched inflationary biases including expansive infrastructures fostering higher asset prices policymaker focus on bolstering system resiliency ensures a precarious extension of terminal phase excess in credit speculation speculative leverage risk intermediation malfunctioning markets resource misallocation and associated financial and economic maladjustment in the late phase of history s greatest global financial bubble there s the thinnest of lines between the onset of crisis and rip roaring bull markets on thursday january 3rd goldman sachs credit default swap 5yr cds prices surged 19 to 131 bps the high since march 2016 and the largest one day move since 2013 in the currency markets a flash crash saw stunning moves including an 8 intraday move in the japanese yen australian dollar dislocation had begun to unfold across global derivatives markets panic buying saw treasury yields sink 15 bps pushing the collapse from november 8th highs 3 24 to 70 bps corporate credit spreads were blowing out especially in junk debt deleveraging dynamics were global for example the spread between 10 year german bunds and the european periphery i e italy and portugal widened markedly a major de risking deleveraging event had gathered momentum equities were under pressure with the djia sinking 660 points during that fateful session the following day chairman powell joined janet yellen and ben bernanke for a panel discussion at a meeting of the american economic association only two weeks since the fed s december 19th rate increase and press conference powell s comments were not expected to be monetary policy focused but the chairman pulled out prepared comments and orchestrated a dramatic dovish u turn policy is very much about risk management we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves always prepared to shift the stance of policy and to shift it significantly if necessary we will be prepared to adjust policy quickly and flexibly and to use all of our tools to support the economy despite economic resilience and a 3 9 unemployment rate the fed was prepared to add monetary stimulus to support the markets the djia rallied 747 points january 4th on powell s comments it was a prescient market move signaling the year of monetary disorder m2

treasuries and safe haven government bonds rallied robustly in the face of bubbling equities prices there was certainly a short squeeze element bolstering the marketplace as hedges against fed normalization were unwound but mainly safe havens could monitor bubble excess in the u s and a faltering chinese bubble and enjoy high confidence that global central bankers would be soon following through on promises to do whatever it takes lower market yields were instrumental in fostering risk market excess and the greater the bubbles inflated the more the safe havens anticipated rate cuts and more qe treasuries bunds swiss bonds and japan s jgbs were transformed into the most enticing financial instruments imaginable central banks were essentially guaranteeing they would perform well and in the event of global instability they would provide spectacular returns a sure moneymaker as well as a trustworthy hedge against risk off the safe haven bond rally morphed into a historic

trillion financial industry or a one time shock that will be quickly forgotten five days after the first government seizure of a chinese bank in 20 years investors are still grasping for answers the takeover of baoshang bank co announced with scant explanation on friday night left china watchers guessing at whether it marks an end to the implicit backstop for banks that has served as a linchpin of the country s financial stability for decades regulators have said they ll guarantee baoshang s smaller depositors and while they ve warned some creditors of potential losses they haven t said what the final payouts could be or given public guidance on whether the takeover will be a blueprint for other lenders china financial and economic fragilities were a growing market concern over the summer instability erupted in china s money market with the vulnerable and now large small banking sector struggling for financing and with u s trade tensions escalating the prospect of beijing officials losing control was palpable china s currency faltered in august with the dollar renminbi breaching the key 7 00 level on august 5th on its way to 7 18 by september 3rd after repeated failed attempts to rein in credit excess tightening measures adopted by a more resolute beijing actually slowed credit growth in 2018 akin to u s rate normalization this was not going to go smoothly and that financial and economic vulnerabilities rapidly manifested with china in the throes of heated trade negotiations with the trump administration ensured beijing would once again let off the brake and

incentivized wild speculative excess that culminated during the summer blow offs however ensure vulnerability to abrupt reversals deleveraging and liquidity issues instability erupted in the u s repo

as the 2010s draw to a close the global economy is in a very different place at the decade s end than at its beginning many of the sociopolitical events that took place around the world were reflective of the financial world analysts say the election of donald trump in 2016 was the catalyst for significant change in the u s economy and the global economy but his rise was as much an effect of broader forces at work as it was a cause of these movements and moments that reshaped the economy over the last 10 years eurozone in crisis in the wake of the recession unsustainably high deficit and debt levels in several european countries led to a crisis requiring the intervention of third party financial institutions such as a 2012 bond buying program implemented by the european central bank to tamp down interest rates on sovereign debt which were rising as investor confidence shrank the crisis was most acutely felt in greece which had its bond rating slashed slashed to junk status after it was revealed that the government had seriously misrepresented its debt burden leaders agreed to sharp austerity measures in return for bailouts from the union and the international monetary fund in the subsequent backlash and public protests against greek austerity measures there was speculation that the country might leave the eurozone entirely some say these events were a precursor to and a catalyst of britain s 2016 vote to leave the eurozone brexit is kind of the natural outcome of when greece was basically held hostage said brad mcmillan chief investment officer at commonwealth

continuation of these challenges in the coming decade nationalism hits trade the 2010s were marked more broadly by a surge of populist and nationalist sentiment both in the u s and elsewhere around

this trend with his on again off again threats to impose tariffs on europe mexico and other trading partners a close second politics is now taking primacy over economics over the past several decades we ve been building an economically optimized world right now that is no longer the case mcmillan said political economy is now being prioritized over economic efficiency and that s something we haven t seen for decades that takes us back to the 50s fed intervenes to prop up the economy in the wake of the financial crisis the federal reserve initiated monetary policy with little precedent in modern times it held interest rates at zero for an extended period of time and undertook enormous quantitative easing programs to pump liquidity into financial markets the decade was really remarkable in the sense that for the first six years of the decade we had zero percent interest rates and for the first five years we had quantitative easing said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america characterizing the central bank s activities as a wild monetary policy experiment some market observers defend the fed s interventionist streak particularly at the start of the decade with the financial crisis still fresh in people s minds the biggest thing in the last 10 years is the continuation of quantitative easing without quantitative easing i think everything would be drastically different way worse than things are now said mitchell goldberg president of clientfirst strategy in hindsight some question whether the fed was too accommodative a stance that could have ramifications for the next recession when the fed cut interest rates to the unprecedented level of zero to 0 25 percent nobody expected it was going to last the seven years that it did mcbride said we ve had way

and jobs act at the end of 2017 had positive results initially but those short term gains could come at the cost of long term pain trump got elected and went on a path of reducing regulation north said i think honestly the reduction in regulation has helped the economy and i think the tax cut helped the economy as well he said but he added that since economic growth fell far short of republicans forecasts the stimulative effects of the tax cut have faded and the national debt has ballooned a risky combination it s putting america on a less stable financial future because of the structure of this unfunded non sustainable tax cut crowley said proponents of the the tax cuts predicted that companies would spend their windfalls expanding and investing in production facilities technology and human capital instead the cuts spurred a wave of corporate stock buybacks which helped propel the market to new record highs but also potentially limited the broader impact the tax cuts were intended to have it s in part a reflection of the fact that there may be in some sectors more than others limited investment or acquisition opportunities or a lack of appealing valuations on those that make a buyback a more palatable way to boost earnings per share said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com every dollar that s going into buybacks is a dollar that s not being used for another form of expansion he said share repurchases have also contributed to stock valuation gains but investing experts warn that this inflation can distort markets more dollars chasing fewer stocks because of all the buybacks isn t something you want long term investors to hang their hat on said john lynch chief investment strategist at lpl financial stock market highs the increase in buybacks is one factor that has contributed to the record long bull market a meteoric rise virtually no one would have predicted 10 years ago when 2010 began the stock market had already begun the long climb out of its recession era hole but the mood was still pessimistic the decade started off very ominously zandi said we began the decade not knowing that the crisis was over we d just suffered the worst economic downturn since the 1930s depression the recession was over officially by june 2009 but it wasn t quite clear that we were out of it since then of course stocks have smashed through one record high after another with valuations boosted by both monetary and fiscal policy mcbride said the fed s trio of rate cuts in 2019 reversed the correction that took place at the end of last year sustaining the bull market for a record setting 10th year that helped cushion the broader economy but it s also helped juiced the equity markets lower interest rates make other investments less appealing he said that enhances the appeal of equities relative to bonds or cash

the us dollar has been falling against numerous currencies photo getty images the us dollar has been falling against numerous currencies photo getty images the nz dollar has staged a major rebound during the last few months with the trade weighted index having rallied five per cent in the final three months of 2019 one explanation is that our prospects look brighter than they did mid year among other things currencies reflect growth prospects stability and the return one can receive on their capital in this regard we simply look better than most read more good news for travellers nz dollar hits 3 month high nz dollar extends gain as commodity currencies rally new zealand dollar climbs as terms of trade near record nz dollar sinks to four year low however much of this nz dollar strength has come against the us dollar which has been falling against most global currencies not just ours the us dollar rallied more than 40 per cent between 2011 and 2017 as the us economy picked itself up off the floor and the federal reserve pared back its quantitative easing programmes since then it s struggled to push through those levels and in recent months it seems to have found itself on the back foot again the us economy is still very buoyant with the american consumer in good spirits and unemployment at a 50 year low those factors point to a strong currency but in contrast you ve got very little inflation worsening deficits election year uncertainty and a fed that has become very reluctant to act for fear of derailing the expansion at the same time there are improving signs in other parts of the world which has seen traders refocus their attention elsewhere europe is becoming more in vogue with investors after a long period of underperformance the british pound is getting some attention with the path to brexit looking clearer and markets elsewhere are feeling more upbeat as trade tensions subside when sentiment is high like this the us dollar often performs poorly as investors prefer cyclical currencies that are more sensitive to growth including the new zealand and australian dollar when nervousness creeps in the opposite happens investors dump these higher risk currencies in favour of the safer us dollar and the likes of the swiss franc and japanese yen this current dynamic is a double edged sword for us a higher exchange rate means our money goes further on the global stage making us a wealthier nation imports more affordable so inflation is kept in check and the reserve bank is inclined to keep interest rates nice and low exporters are never as enthusiastic about a strong nz dollar as they become less competitive then again commodity prices tend to rise when the us dollar is weak so there has traditionally been a natural offset for farmers new zealand companies with large us customer bases could face greater headwinds if only from an earnings translation perspective fisher paykel healthcare pushpay and tourism holdings are a few nzx listed examples that spring to mind in terms of global shares a weaker us dollar would have the opposite effect on american multinationals providing them a healthy tailwind almost 40 per cent of total s p 500 revenues come from outside the us with international exposures even higher for the technology materials and consumer staples sectors longer term our exchange rate probably doesn t deserve be as high as it is and the us dollar should continue to provide a good hedge against any market turbulence that might emerge however if the current optimism surrounding financial markets proves justified the greenback might struggle to regain the momentum it had a year or two ago mark lister is head of private wealth research at craigs investment partners this column is general in nature and should not be regarded as specific investment advice

saudi arabia s oil production facilities iran denied responsibility for that strike oil also occasionally soared last year during times of tension in the strait of hormuz when a number oil ships in that crucial middle east channel were attacked if the attack sets off a prolonged rise in tensions between the united states and iran oil prices could continue to rise and markets could remain unstable for some time read more president donald trump tweeted iran never won a war but never lost a negotiation trump walked away from his predecessor s iran nuclear deal but the tweet suggests he wants to get teheran back to the negotiating table both iran and the us have shown a reluctance in the past to embark on outright conflict but this does not preclude a period of heightened tensions and elevated oil prices wrote caroline bain chief commodities economist at capital economics oil prices were already on an upswing before the escalation bain added and she noted oil supplies might not be affected by the conflict because iranian oil exports are already curtailed thanks to us sanctions yet if tensions rise the conflict could spill over to other regions given the scope for tension to persist in the strait of hormuz a protracted period of higher oil prices has to be a risk said kit juckes of societe generale in a note to investors oil prices could rise to 80 if the conflict spreads noted henry rome iran analyst at eurasia group higher oil prices would eventually reach consumers at the pump hurting the american economy which relies heavily on consumer spending a hit to american

future iranian attack plans iranian president hassan rouhani said in a statement that his country would take revenge for the killing of soleimani the middle east is home to major oil producing countries and key energy supply routes the killing of an iranian general could disrupt business and trade with crucial partners in the region at least for now the attack has undone the positive

street has reached historic proportions last year wasn t just the s p 500 s strongest since 2013 markets wowed investors late in 2019 by showing an uncanny ability to trade higher seemingly every hour of every day if history repeats itself we d see sideways action in january and february and outright declines in march and april paul hickey co founder of bespoke investment group bespoke investment group ran the numbers and confirmed that wall street has rarely experienced a period as decidedly bullish as late 2019 the firm calculated how often during the trading day the s p 500 was up versus the prior days close over a rolling 50 day trading period and bespoke found that in late december the s p 500 was in the green on an intraday basis over 65 of the time a level surpassed only a handful of times since the firm s intraday numbers began in 1984 that extremely bullish pattern continued thursday the dow kicked off 2020 by climbing more than 300 points or around 1 read more it s like we have a tivo on we re just watching the same show day after day said jj kinahan chief market strategist at td ameritrade those stellar gains have padded americans investment portfolios and the market boom could instill further confidence among households and ceos in the sustainability of the economic expansion the fun didn t last yet history shows that such consistently positive market performance doesn t last and it can actually be a negative omen after the past six times when the s p 500 enjoyed such positive returns the index averaged a slight decline of 0 4 a month later according to bespoke sideways trading wouldn t be so bad given how much stocks have spiked the problem is that three months later the s p 500 was down every time averaging a decline of 6 4 bespoke found and even within six months the index was down by an average of 3 6 what 2020 could bring for the stock market the fun didn t last bespoke co founder paul hickey wrote in a note to clients on thursday if history repeats itself we d see sideways action in january and february and outright declines in march and april that s what happened in late 2018 when us stocks tumbled after a similar period of extreme bullishness easing trade war and easy money none of this means the bull market in stocks is about to end there are good reasons for the market rally the united states and china have stopped firing shots in the trade war for now at least the two sides reached a phase one trade deal that prevents new tariffs from getting imposed and rolls back some existing tariffs although the deal does not end the trade war it does ease the biggest risk facing the united states and global economy we don t expect a global or us recession and anticipate a modest growth and profits rebound now that worst case trade outcomes may be avoided michael cembalest chairman of market and investment strategy at jpmorgan asset wealth management wrote in a note to clients the melt up in stocks has also been fueled by easy money from the federal reserve the us central bank cut interest rates three times last year those rate cuts made risky stocks look more attractive relative to ultra safe government bonds moreover the fed has injected vast amounts of cash into the financial system in a bid to ease stress in the overnight lending market although the fed s rescue of the overnight lending market may not have been intended to boost stocks analysts believe it s doing just that extreme greed there is an obvious risk that market sentiment has gotten ahead of fundamentals the cnn fear greed index is sporting a score of 97 essentially signaling maximum greed market valuations also look elevated the s p 500 is now trading at 18 9 projected earnings according to refinitiv that s up from just 16 9 in early october and well above the 10 year average of 15 2 investors think the fed is doing qe again that s giving markets an artificial boost the market valuation of the s p 500 is roughly 199 of the nation s gdp according to jpmorgan that s in the 99th percentile historically similarly jpmorgan said that the s p 500 s enterprise value is 2 5 times sales that s also in the 99th percentile historically however other metrics including free cash flow yield and the s p 500 s earnings yield relative to 10 year treasuries don t look out of whack with recent history valuations are high and we are starting to see cracks in risky and poorly underwritten investments jpmorgan s cembalest wrote he pointed to investors avoiding the energy sector after a decade of weak performance and the recent poor performance of some 2019 tech ipos that s not to mention the implosion of wework s attempted ipo but valuations are notoriously poor timing tools high valuations can go higher and betting against this bull market has been a recipe for disaster horseman capital management one of the most bearish hedge funds in the industry suffered a staggering loss of nearly 35 last year at its flagship fund according to a spokeswoman still td ameritrade s kinahan warned investors not to get lulled into a false sense of security by the string of records on wall street things don t go up forever kinahan said you have to be cautious about saying everything is at all time highs so i m all in the key will be whether corporate america can live up to the hype created by wall street quarterly earnings have to essentially grow into the lofty expectations built up by the market the reality has to meet the anticipation kinahan said share the link of this article with your facebook friends

u s review geopolitical developments ring in the new year it was a light week for economic data in a shortened holiday week but news of president trump ordering an airstrike in iraq and killing a top iranian military general resulted in a riskoff response from markets as oil prices surged and treasury yields fell early friday morning markets were also pressured from the latest ism manufacturing report which signaled further deterioration in the sector with the index falling to its lowest level since 2009 the conference board reported a decrease in consumer confidence for the final month of the year but we continue to see strong consumer fundamentals geopolitical developments ring in the new year there were two notable geopolitical developments that grasped markets attention this week first president trump announced that the phase i trade deal with china will be signed in the white house on january 15 which should provide its detailed terms second and more prominent trump ordered an airstrike in iraq that resulted in the killing of qassem soleimani one of iran s top military generals oil prices jumped and treasury yields fell on the news the largest macro concern beyond yet more geopolitical uncertainty is the lasting impact to oil prices which will depend on if how iran responds turning back to trade while the phase i deal was officially announced on december 13 this week s statement of its forthcoming signing was seen as more than a formality for markets rumblings of a possible phase i deal have been anticipated for months but the actual passage of the deal exemplifies the first true de escalation in the trade war the deal slashed tariffs in half on approximately 120b of imports from china and dismissed the 15 tariff on an additional 156b which was set to go into effect just days after being announced on january 15 we expect to receive more detailed terms of the deal while the deal should certainly provide some lift to confidence with approximately 70 of imports from china still exposed to tariffs a resurgence in business activity remains unlikely indeed consumer and business optimism wobbled last year not just due to additional tariffs being levied but as a result of the unpredictable nature of the trade environment the phase i deal is a step in the right direction but does not provide solace to manufacturers who may still be exposed to tariffs or now recognize tariffs could be used as a geopolitical tool again in the future as such we expect investment spending to remain subdued this year the latest ism manufacturing survey showed the ism manufacturing index declined to 47 2 in december the lowest since 2009 various subcomponents of the index also plumbed lows that haven t been touched in a decade the trade war has certainly weighed on the sector but the downward momentum in the ism has been decidedly worse than other purchasing manager surveys a continued de escalation in trade tensions would be a welcome development for manufacturing but the temporary suspension of boeings 737 max production is an additional headwind for the sector in the near term consumers confidence dipped in december but at 126 5 the conference board index treaded modestly above its average monthly read of the year 126 2 consumers were wary last year amid trade uncertainty and recession fears but there is arguably some upside to confidence in the near term the cutoff date for last month s survey was december 13 the same day the phase i trade deal was announced meaning optimism from the deal was likely not fully captured in december furthermore with the deal set to be signed mid january we may get some upswing in next month s index more broadly low inflation continued gains in the stock market and a healthy labor market should continue to bolster consumer optimism and therefore spending in the new year u s outlook trade balance tuesday monday morning s trade balance report will command more attention than usual due to the surprisingly large drop reported in the advance goods trade report the advance goods trade deficit shrank 3 6 billion in november and came in around 5 billion below expectations apparently attempts by u s businesses and chinese producers to keep a step ahead of tariffs led to a surge in imports in august and the past three months have seen imports tumble at a 13 annual rate while some of that slide in imports has been offset by less inventory building the decline in imports will likely lead to a larger than expected improvement in the trade deficit during the fourth quarter and boost estimates for fourth quarter real gdp growth the advance report has been a fairly good predictor of the goods portion of the international trade report so a substantial improvement is now widely expected previous 47 2 billion wells fargo 43 3 billion consensus 45 0 billion ism non manufacturing index tuesday while the ism non manufacturing survey has held up better than its more widely watched manufacturing counterpart there is likely to be a great deal of focus on the non manufacturing survey this week the overall index has averaged just 53 7 over the past three months and remains near its recent lows the new orders series which is one of the leading components of the survey has risen for the past two months and is back to 57 1 which is slightly above the average for the past six months but still below the trailing 12 month average further improvement here would be a positive sign and suggest the recent lull in economic growth is behind us most of the attention will be on the employment components however which are a key input into many nonfarm employment forecasts the survey s employment series has risen solidly for the past two months closely corresponding with the surprisingly good jobs data previous 53 9 wells fargo 54 3 consensus 54 5 nonfarm employment friday we expect nonfarm payrolls to rise by 160 000 in december following november s blowout 266 000 job gain as noted earlier employment forecasts may change a bit before the data are released depending upon what is reported in the ism surveys and possibly the adp employment report which has not shown anywhere near as much strength as the bls data have the employment report is full of interesting details that provide insight into many areas of the economy the manufacturing data have been more volatile of late due to the earlier strike at gm and return of striking workers in the november data amidst this noise the diffusion index which measures the share of manufacturing industries adding jobs has been gradually improving hinting that the manufacturing slowdown may be coming to an end the household data for 2019 will also be revised to new population estimate and seasonal factors previous 266k wells fargo 160k consensus 163k global review china showing signs of stabilization china s economic activity and pmi data have improved and beat consensus forecasts in november and december while we continue to believe china s economy will decelerate in the coming years a phase i trade deal and reduction to the reserve requirement ratio for chinese banks should provide some support to china s economy chile s economy continues to be disrupted by political protests with the most recent data indicating the economy contracted for the second consecutive month given the updated data it is likely chile s economy contracted in q4 2019 and could fall into technical recession in 2020 china data improving pboc continues to ease for the majority of 2019 chinese economic data were underwhelming highlighting a continued slowdown in china s economy we can point to persistent trade tensions with the united states as a reason for the lackluster economic data however more structural imbalances are also likely a contributor to china s deceleration the past few months of the year proved to be much better for china s prospects heading into 2020 as economic data and sentiment indicators improved to close out 2019 late last year the possibility of a phase i trade deal with the u s likely alleviated some pressure on the economy helping industrial output and retail sales not only improve but beat consensus forecasts in november in addition the december manufacturing pmi was released this week and indicated sentiment in the manufacturing sector held steady at 50 2 despite market participants forecasting a mild softening with a phase i trade deal now agreed upon and likely to be signed in mid january we would expect these activity and sentiment indicators to continue to show modest improvement in early 2020 and ultimately provide some support to china s economy despite the recent data improvement the peoples bank of china pboc acted again to ease monetary policy this week the pboc lowered its reserve requirement ratio rrr for all domestic banks another 50 bps which is set to take effect january 6th the reduction will take the rrr for major banks to 12 50 and for smaller banks the rrr will be reduced to 10 50 by easing reserve requirements for chinese banks the pboc will release close to cny800b of liquidity into the local financial system this additional liquidity should be supportive of household borrowing and ultimately should provide further support to china s economy the pboc has aggressively lowered the rrr for both big and small banks dropping the rate 900 bps respectively since the end of 2011 looking ahead we expect the pboc to continue to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance and expect further reductions to rrr in an effort to support the country s growth prospects protests still hurting chile s economy chile s economy came under pressure in 2019 as anti government protests spread across the country protests forced businesses to close and disrupted transportation resulting in economic activity contracting sharply in october data on economic activity suggested that chile s economy contracted for the second consecutive month declining 3 3 year over year in november the economic activity index is typically a good indicator of gdp growth and with contractions in both october and november it is likely that chile s economy contracted in the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of the downturn in the economy the government has implemented a fiscal stimulus plan to help revive the economy while the central bank moved forward with an fx intervention program to stabilize the currency looking forward we expect the economy to remain under pressure while the probability of chile falling into technical recession is high global outlook eurozone retail sales tuesday eurozone retail sales dropped 0 6 on a sequential basis in october the second straight monthly decline while the year over year trend appears to have flattened out as well based on sentiment data sales may have remained soft over the remainder of q4 as the services pmi averaged just 52 4 during the quarter down from 52 8 in q3 next week s release of november retail sales data will offer more insight into how the hard consumer data fared during the month on the whole we expect private consumption growth to have slowed sharply in q4 after 0 5 sequential growth in q3 fortunately most consumer indicators suggest the slowdown in spending will be fairly short lived indeed disposable income growth remains fairly robust and inflation is contained while the labor market has been resilient despite ongoing weakness in goods producing sectors of the economy accordingly we expect private consumption growth and broader gdp growth to bounce back in q1 2020 previous 1 4 year over year consensus 1 4 canada employment friday canada s november employment report was a miss nearly across the board as employment fell 71 200 with declines in full time and part time positions the jobless rate unexpectedly jumped to 5 9 although wage growth held steady at 4 4 year over year the report followed a fairly strong performance from canada s labor market over most of the earlier part of the year with strong gains in full time jobs and a robust increase in wage growth given that prior outperformance next friday s release of employment data for december will be all the more important in discerning whether november was an anomaly or the beginning of a more sustained slowdown in canadian hiring activity in our view it is a bit hard to square the november report with other canadian indicators and we are of the view that it was not the beginning of a sharp slowdown in economic growth in canada previous 71 2k net change in employment consensus 31 7k mexico cpi thursday mexico s economy has essentially stagnated over the past two years or so struggling under the weight of sky high real interest rates and more recently sharply slower growth across most of the world s major economies restrictive monetary policy and weaker gdp growth conspired to bring down inflation in 2018 but more recently core cpi inflation has risen rather than slowed to be sure the acceleration has not been unruly and core inflation remains close to the central bank s 3 target however the fact that core inflation has not eased more may be one reason why the central bank has been hesitant to cut interest rates more aggressively and provide more policy support to a domestic economy that has stagnated for two years the central bank has cut rates at each of its last four meetings but only by 25 bps each time and thus real interest rates remain close to 4 more aggressive rate cuts seem unlikely until core inflation shows more concrete signs of slowing previous 3 0 year over year point of view interest rate watch fomc slightly more hawkish in 2020 the new year will see some changes on the federal open market committee fomc when fully staffed the fomc contains 19 members 12 of which are voting members in normal times there are seven governors of the federal reserve system however the federal reserve board which sits in washington dc has not been fully staffed since august 2013 presently there are five governors and all of these governors vote at every fomc meeting the president of the federal reserve bank of new york votes at every fomc meeting as well the remaining four voting positions are rotated on a set schedule every year among the other 11 presidents of the federal reserve banks last year s voters from the boston chicago kansas city and st louis federal reserve banks have been replaced this year by the presidents of the cleveland dallas minneapolis and philadelphia feds eric rosengren boston and esther george kansas city are hawks indeed both presidents dissented each time the fomc cut rates at the july september and october fomc meetings on the other hand charles evans chicago and james bullard st louis are doves the two hawks from last year have been replaced by loretta mester cleveland and patrick harker philadelphia who also tend to the hawkish side of the spectrum neel kashkari minneapolis is very dovish but robert kaplan tends to be middle of the road in terms of his policy views therefore the change in voting members tilts the fomc in a slightly more hawkish direction this year that said the committee likely will not be raising rates anytime soon as we noted in a recent report we look for the fomc to keep rates on hold through the end of 2021 although we acknowledge that the committee could conceivably start to tighten policy again in 2020 we believe that gdp growth would need to be materially stronger and or inflation significantly higher than fed policymakers currently expect most market participants also seem to agree that the committee will be on hold for the foreseeable future market pricing indicates that the probability of a rate hike at each of the fomc meetings in 2020 is less than 5 credit market insights swedish debt underperforming in 2019 the global bond market was relatively strong but swedish debt underperformed its euro area peers the bloomberg barclays treasury indexes showed that swedish bonds gained just 2 4 compared to the euro area at 7 2 and significantly lagged italy at 10 6 over the past month sweden s bonds fell leading up to the riksbank s december policy meeting in which the riksbank raised its repo rate 25 bps to 0 00 ending several years of negative interest rates the market had largely priced in a riksbank hike so the krona s moves as well as sweden s fixed income market moves following the announcement were fairly muted the central bank s decision to tighten policy defied the overall trend of easing policy which may have contributed to some of the limitations for swedish debt to gain meanwhile swedish debt has also struggled against its peers such as italy and germany as both countries benefitted from ecb policy easing as well as other easing measures such as the resumption of its asset purchase program however given that sweden is not part of the eurozone it did not reap the same gains from a currency perspective the krona has also lagged its peers and is 2019 s worst performer among g10 currencies as political uncertainty and slower global growth has kept the krona on the defensive with the riksbank rate hike now past it may be difficult for the krona to gain any further traction going into the new year topic of the week budget package delivers the presents early during the week of dec 16 congress passed legislation to fund the federal government through fy 2020 and avoid a repeat of last year s government shutdown since the fiscal year began on oct 1 the government had been operating under a series of continuing resolutions policymakers agreed on top line spending levels back in july but since then had been struggling to pass legislation that appropriates the money to the various government agencies and programs the december budget package appropriates the money and formally authorizes the government to spend the full amount agreed to over the summer as we wrote in july the spending increase in fy 2020 is much smaller than what was seen in fy 2018 2019 and as such the incremental impact on real gdp growth is likely to be smaller we expect federal government consumption and investment to add roughly 0 1 0 2 percentage points to headline gdp growth over the next few quarters top chart the spending package went well beyond just appropriating the top line spending levels perhaps most relevant to the macro outlook was the permanent repeal of three key affordable care act aca taxes an excise tax on medical devices an excise tax on high cost employer sponsored health insurance often referred to as the cadillac tax and an annual fee imposed on health insurance providers all three of these taxes were originally passed as part of the aca but in the ensuing years their implementation was repeatedly delayed this legislation permanently repeals them to the tune of 373 billion in lost revenues over the next decade bottom chart since these taxes are not currently in effect however it is important to remember that this lost revenue is only lost relative to current law and not current policy thus the near term macro impact from this repeal on the federal budget deficit and the 21 trillion u s economy is likely to be negligible longer term federal budget deficit projections however will now likely look even bigger than previously projected

a 20 year chart showing vietnam s cambodia s and the philippines annual gdp growth compared to the u s and united kingdom meanwhile with nearly 100 million people and growing fast vietnam s middle class is rising as quickly as china s did 30 years ago vietnam hasn t had a recession for over two decades either like several other nations below they ve skipped every single one from the early 1990s crash to the recent 2008 financial crisis several reasons make vietnam a great choice to ride out the next recession however while stocks could be a wise bet here you can only own property in vietnam on a leasehold basis your options in vietnam are limited compared to elsewhere the philippines the philippines shares more in common with vietnam than anywhere else on our list both of them are large high growth markets with about 90 million people and a surging middle class each of them are steadily holding gdp growth rates above 5 too and have done so for quite a while yet unlike vietnam the philippine peso is among asia s top performing currencies a one year term deposit often yields over 4 annually thus banks in the philippines are an increasingly popular choice for yield seeking investors to store a bit of spare cash likewise you can own real estate on a freehold basis in the philippines as a foreigner with a caveat you can t directly own land and are restricted to condo units if you re a foreign buyer either way it s a much better deal than in vietnam or india for example where you can only get a leasehold after all why would you purchase a leasehold asset in a country like china or vietnam if you have an option of freehold ownership elsewhere indonesia indonesia is southeast asia s biggest economy by far with 260 million inhabitants and rising quickly you needn t look any further if you want to invest in a strong yet largely undiscovered consumer market although indonesia isn t the fastest growing country on our list that title belongs to cambodia or the philippines their massive size makes up for their slow 5 annual gdp growth this is where you should be if you re in manufacturing or consumer products

a gas flare on an oil production platform in the soroush oil fields is seen alongside an iranian flag in the gulf reuters as oil prices surged after the killing of iranian commander general qassem soleimani in a us drone strike in baghdad senior officials of the finance ministry and the ministry of petroleum and natural gas held a high level meeting friday to assess the impact and review contingency measures officials in the petroleum ministry are learnt to have held an internal meeting following which they were called to the finance ministry for discussions given the possibility of a disruption to oil supplies impacting india s external debt situation and restricting the headroom to counter the slowdown a government official said that both short term and long term diversification measures to reduce dependence on the west asian region especially in the wake of a protracted escalation of the crisis were discussed they included alternative import options including a status update on an agreement entered into with the us and ongoing talks with russia for crude supplies advertisement the concerns stem from the fact that the quartet of iraq saudi arabia iran and the uae are the top crude suppliers to india all of which are in the geographical zone likely to be impacted it is estimated that a 10 per barrel increase in the price of oil would negatively impact india s growth by 0 2 0 3 percentage points and worsen the current account deficit cad by 9 10 billion dollars while indian refineries import crude oil from diverse sources depending on their technical and commercial considerations and keeping in view the domestic requirement imports from the opec bloc has progressively been brought down from 85 4 per cent in fy 17 to 75 4 per cent in the april september period of fy 20 the government official said officials indicated that indian refineries are being progressively encouraged to import crude from sources such as the us canada and mexico apart from the discussions with russia an emphasis on expediting these negotiations has also been done an official said brent crude futures jumped nearly 3 to hit a high of 69 16 a barrel friday the highest since

the late arun jaitley had indicated that india would be comfortable with a price of about 60 a barrel and that if it moved beyond that number it would be a shock that the government will try and absorb despite the inflationary impact a rise in global crude prices leads to an increase in the domestic price of crude products thereby fuelling higher domestic inflation a surge has both a direct and indirect impact on the consumer price index cpi firstly with crude products themselves figuring as constituents in the cpi and seeing a price impact and then indirectly a rise in retail prices of all other commodities manufactured using crude as an input reflecting as a cascading impact which pushes up the cpi again editorial after soleimani on friday in response to the global crude price hike state run fuel retailers increased the price of petrol by 10 paise and that of diesel by 15 paise a litre advertisement crude oil import is denominated in the us dollar and higher import prices raise the country s import bill leading to a worsening of the cad a measurement of a country s trade balance when the value of the imported goods and services exceeds the value of the products it exports cad however is only a part of the country s balance of payments accounting which is dependent on various factors that include supply and demand of rupee versus us dollars interest rate differentials and capital flows early last september drone attacks on saudi aramco s facilities had threatened the biggest ever disruption in oil suppliers but government officials conceded that the worries proved to be over hyped and the crisis was handled well this time though the cascading impact of an iranian backlash has forced the government to ready a contingency plan just weeks before the presentation of the union budget india s current account and fiscal deficits could worsen if oil prices remain at the elevated level the rbi has warned it its last review experts said a sustained level above 70 a barrel could dent the country s import bill and hence fiscal math for the current fiscal advertisement it is a developing situation but if the crude oil level sustains above 70 a barrel for a long time then it will definitely affect the government s fiscal math devendra kumar pant chief economist india ratings research said the rbi in its latest monetary policy committee review had flagged crude oil prices as among six factors that could influence inflation outlook with the rider that crude oil prices are expected to remain range bound barring any supply disruptions due to geo political tensions even as it revised the cpi inflation projection upwards to 5 1 4 7 per cent for the second half of fy 20 a further escalation of the crisis could potentially force the rbi to extended the

in finance r squared measures the correlation between the movements of two things their movements are perfectly correlated if their r squared is 100 percent they are uncorrelated if their r squared approaches zero percent the relationship between the increase in the price of gold and the growth of the central bank balance sheets of the united states the european union and japan had an r squared of approximately 95 percent over the last thirteen years in the real world it s hard to find higher correlation factors than that as the big western central banks have increased their purchases of bonds mortgage backed securities and other assets with newly created fiat money the nominal price of gold has increased in lock step indeed for every trillion dollars of collective central bank balance sheet growth and concomitant fiat money printing gold has increased by 210 per troy ounce but then came mario draghi on the morning of friday april 12 the european central bank president put a financial gun to cyprus s head essentially telling that small bankrupt mediterranean island nation to sell its gold reserves nearly fourteen metric tonnes worth about half a billion u s dollars or the previously promised bailout money just might not be advanced the brief statement by super mario as draghi the ben bernanke of europe is often called sometimes admiringly and sometimes derisively depending on the politics of the writer ratcheted down the previously uncanny correlation between gold and the central banks collective balance sheet within minutes of mr draghi s statement the comex june contract for bullion dropped by 50 per troy ounce by the end of the day after continuous waves of selling june comex gold was down 84 to 1 475 why would the potential sale of fourteen tonnes of gold cause the nominal price of gold to drop by more than 5 percent after all this represented less than one one hundredth of 1 percent of all the world stock of the yellow metal which amounts to 165 000 tonnes the answer is that the market is concerned that what draghi told cyprus he will tell spain italy france and all other debt challenged eu members together those countries hold thousands of tonnes of gold of course draghi cost cyprus a significant amount of money at the very moment it needs every euro it can find fourteen tonnes of gold or 450 000 ounces were worth nearly 38 million more before draghi opened his mouth he could have avoided a public statement and issued his request directly to cyprus allowing cyprus to arrange for a private sale at a higher price china russia and turkey among many other nations have been increasing their gold holdings for several years and likely would have been in the market for cyprus s bullion now cyprus faces a falling market and one that will become weaker when cyprus attempts to sell its gold but draghi is not concerned about cyprus like his fellow central bankers he is concerned about fiat money and sovereign bond rates their fear is that markets will begin to realize that the emperors of fiat funds the federal reserve and the bank of japan along with the european central bank have no clothes meaning that there is no way for them to reel back in the trillions of currency units they continue to print in order to finance unprecedented and ever increasing national budget deficits if it is seen that the emperors really have no clothes then major currencies will be dumped and interest rates will increase rapidly consider the united states the federal reserve is monetizing 85 billion per month more than a trillion dollars per year in u s treasury debt and mortgage backed securities in effect the federal reserve is purchasing 60 percent of all newly issued treasuries and essentially all of the mortgages written to finance the latest housing boomlet as a result of these purchases with dollars derived essentially out of thin air interest rates remain at historic lows in fy 2012 the average interest rate paid on all outstanding treasury debt was 2 1 percent even at that low rate the lowest ever for any extended period the treasury s debt service for fy 2012 was 432 billion if the fed ceased its quantitative easing who would purchase the more than 540 billion in new treasury debt currently being purchased by the central bank at the rate of 45 billion per month no one at least not at an average rate of 2 1 percent as recently as 2002 the average interest rate on treasury debt exceeded 5 percent that is 2 ½ times the current rate if rates simply returned to that level the interest incurred on the national debt would exceed a trillion dollars annually that would necessitate cuts in spending equal to more than twelve times this year s dreaded sequester obviously the fed cannot cease its easing indeed it will have to increase the size of its monetization programs because japan has just leapfrogged the fed the bank of japan boj under its new governor haruhiko kuroda just announced that it will purchase 7 5 trillion yen that s us 75 billion per month in japanese government bonds yes 75 billion is less than the fed s 85 billion but japan s gdp is only a third the size of the u s gdp so the boj s monetization program is much more aggressive than even ben bernanke s in fact the boj s actions will double that nation s monetary base over the next two years how do you spell inflation in japanese perhaps g o l d from the point of view of rational finance meaning market based decision making there is at least one glimmer of sanity emerging as a result of the boj s actions instead of boosting the price of japanese government bonds as would be expected when the boj prints trillions of yen and purchases bonds thereby increasing the demand for such securities the boj s massive bond buying program has caused the bonds prices to plummet it seems that investors realize that all of those yen being printed will reduce the purchasing power of each yen they already own so they are abandoning japanese government bonds and yen to seek safety elsewhere including the u s stock market which just hit a new high in nominal dollars will investors realize that u s treasuries are no better than the japanese bonds that they are fleeing if so we might witness the bursting of the largest financial bubble in world history the collapse of the treasury market followed by the hyperinflation of the dollar to pay off all of the debt that no longer can be serviced jay zawatsky is the ceo of havepower llc a natural gas infrastructure developer and a professor of business

and central america for twenty years as a foreign correspondent he has studied and written books about sacrifice zones the failures of the liberal class and the rise of the right in the united states he shares the wisdom he has gained from his experiences watching governments fail to inform us about what to expect and how to build power you can listen to the full interview plus current news and analysis on clearing the fog interview clearing the fog ctf what were some of the events in 2019 that you thought were of importance chris hedges ch i would say there are two the failure to address the climate emergency which is seeing an acceleration of the deterioration and destruction of the ecosystem that is quite dramatic and pronounced in california and australia would be number one even if we stopped all carbon emissions today which again the ruling elites utterly betrayed and failed us in madrid we re still going to deal with catastrophic climate change the other was the failure on the part of the democratic party to address the rupture of social bonds and deep social inequality that has torn apart the country and resulted in the election of donald trump at the end of the year after the complete failure of the mueller report which was hyped by all sorts of media organizations not only rachel maddow and msnbc but also the new york times we got this kind of mind numbing spectacle of the impeachment with that very cloying and repugnant moral posturing on the part of the democratic party what they did was selective they charged trump not with all of the most egregious impeachable offenses and constitutional violations that he carried out but with the most trivial that s contempt for congress and the attempt to get the ukrainian president zelensky to open an investigation of biden and his son in exchange for about 400 million in us aid and allowing zelenski to visit the white house if the democratic party was committed to actually defending the constitution then they would have to go back and impeach trump for a series of violations that both george w bush and barack obama routinely committed they don t want to do that so when i hear them talking about the restoration of the rule of law and see that they ignored the most serious constitutional violations which have now been normalized by both parties it s an example of at best self delusion and probably very cynical manipulation i can run through a few bush launches two illegal wars that are never declared by congress as demanded by the constitution he places the entire u s public under government surveillance that s violating the fourth amendment he authorizes torture and kidnapping of foreign nationals who are not even u s citizens and holds them where they re tortured in black sites and offshore penal colonies around the world obama expands the illegal wars which are now up to 11 if we count yemen edward snowden reveals that intelligence agencies are monitoring and spying on all of us downloading all of our data and metrics into government computers where they re stored for in perpetuity and nothing is done obama misuses the 2002 authorization for use of military force act to erase due process that s when he argues that the executive branch has the right to assassinate us citizens starting with a radical cleric anwar al awlaki and two weeks later his 16 year old son in essence serving as judge jury and executioner and then of course he signs into law section 1021 of the national defense authorization act which overturns the 1878 posse comitatus act that prohibits the use of the military as a domestic police force i sued him in federal court over that and then there are other again bipartisan constitutional violations including violating treaty clauses that are supposed to be ratified by the senate violating the appointments clause where you need senate confirmation and the routine abuse of executive orders watching the impeachment process was a very depressing spectacle for me because it was about the pretense of the rule of law it again exposed the fact that the democratic party will refuse to be self reflective and refuse to confront its complicity in neoliberalism deindustrialization programs of austerity massive expansion of our prison system and militarizing of our police it tries to personalize all of our problems in the figure of trump ctf you have written that the right wing has picked up revolutionary rhetoric because people in the united states and around the world see the corruption of the elites now with these right wing fascists rising do you see any possibility of the left being able to pick up that need for a revolutionary vision and plan ch well i do see the need but i don t see it happening i think that is driven by fear especially at every presidential election cycle the left the liberal class just crumbles the attraction of trump is that he rightly attacks the deep state which is real but what is the deep state the deep state is the generals the war industry the bankers the lobbyists the corporatists the intelligence agencies the government bureaucrats and the technocrats who actually run both domestic and international policy the fact is we don t control our own economy it s controlled by goldman sachs and citibank and jp morgan chase the washington post when it released the afghanistan papers recently the roughly more than 2 000 pages of internal government documents about the war in afghanistan which they obtained through a three year legal battle exposed exactly the bipartisan lies fraud deceit corruption waste and mismanagement during the 18 year conflict that was carried out by the ruling elites by the deep state the deep state that so many trump supporters have been betrayed by and turned on with a vengeance trump s attraction is that he calls them out often in very vulgar and crude terms the democratic party in pushing biden because he s been anointed by the democratic party donor class is seeking to perpetuate a system that at least half or more of the country wants to get rid of and the left has not embraced or understood that the whole ideology of the ruling elite neoliberalism and imperialism just doesn t resonate anymore they re bound to this ideology because the people funding the party recognize quite correctly that if they don t have that kind of corporate money and corporate backing they will lose power and so they d rather take the whole system down which is what they re doing this is the problem of the left it has misread power i m a strong supporter of extinction rebellion because i think they ve correctly read power we can go back for the last four decades carbon admissions have exponentially risen all of the attempts to work within the system this is 350 org and others have been an utter and complete failure and the left partly because we were so knocked off balance over the last few decades our organizations were either co opted or destroyed is just not willing to face this reality ctf putting aside the democratic party how do you see the potential for the left movement awakening to anti capitalist and anti imperialist thinking ch i don t know that the left is organized i don t know that it has yet offered a strong alternative vision to the mainstream i think it s often divided by identity politics without grasping that the fundamental issue is class this is class warfare and as warren buffett has correctly said his side is winning we also have to make it clear that they have not only marginalized us but cut down the spaces by which we can communicate that s why i m on rt what i do on rt should be on a functioning public broadcasting system but the public broadcasting system in particular pbs is a wholly owned subsidiary of the koch brothers if you go back to the 70s you could see noam chomsky howard zinn angela davis and all sorts of people who were not beholden to institutions or to corporations offering a critique of power the last national show that we had that critiqued power is bill moyers show which is now off the air and in the end was funded through a private foundation all of those sentiments are on the rise but it is yet to be translated into a political movement and if there are uprisings without that kind of vision and focus then the ruling elites can easily decapitate them ctf you worked with us back when we were organizing the occupation in washington d c throughout 2011 and that was a time of a lot of uprisings around the world the occupy movement really took off in the united states now we re seeing a rise again around the world against corruption and neoliberal capitalism do you think that has the potential to come back to the united states in another wave and what do we need to do to be prepared for that if it does ch i covered uprisings for 20 years as a foreign correspondent all around the globe the palestinian uprisings most of the revolutions in eastern europe east germany czechoslovakia romania and the street demonstrations that brought down slobodan milosevic what s fascinating is that what ignites it no one can predict even purported leaders of the opposition don t know what pushes people over the edge which is usually something very relatively in and of itself minor and even banal neoliberalism or global capitalism is a global phenomenon it has affected people in the same way one of the things we don t hear about the protests in hong kong is that especially the young are without work and social inequality is very pronounced i think that economic tyranny lies at the root of the uprisings that we ve seen not only in hong kong but in india chile and france and in iran iraq and lebanon but it also lies at the root of the rise of these right wing demagogues as we just saw in britain with boris johnson narendra modi in india and trump in the united states and so yes i think that we re not immune to this kind of social unrest and this kind of upheaval especially as the forces that created it have no regulation and no restraint student debt personal debt national debt we re about to watch the republican party again take an axe and slash social services and food stamps these corporatists know only one word and that s more and they won t stop until there s blowback the problem is that if that blowback is just kind of a release in the streets of anger and frustration and rage all legitimate without an alternative vision and without alternative structures to begin to challenge power then it can be crushed ctf when we were involved in occupy it was a different phase of the movement s development occupy was an eruption of anger the 99 versus the 1 since occupy there has been a lot of work done by various groups on new economy ideas whether it s participatory budgeting or worker owned businesses cooperatives or public banks california is the first state to do a public bank since north dakota in 1919 20 we re seeing some movement toward the beginning i think of a vision that you re describing and i think that s a potential positive the other thing that s a challenge in the united states is the electoral system because right now so many activists are getting pulled into the 2020 election particularly through the sanders campaign and a little bit through the warren campaign and somewhat in the green efforts but those are so squashed in the united states that they are hardly visible we see the election system as a kind of a mirage democracy it s molded manipulated and in the end never quenches people s needs sanders is interesting because if he loses because of a democratic primary violation that could create an eruption itself if he wins then you have someone in office you can actually push to try to get things done that may cause an eruption can the sanders campaign have that kind of an impact ch i think you could make a strong case that the nomination was stolen from sanders in 2016 people walked out of the democratic national convention but it didn t have that impact the new york times has run more than one story where they are interviewing anonymous democratic party donors who are already organizing to make sure neither sanders nor warren and i don t trust warren too much get the nomination it is the question of whether you can work from within i have long argued that the democratic party is not salvageable it s not reformable it is not in any sense a real political party in that the base has any real say maybe the sanders campaign will prove me wrong i hope they do prove me wrong but i don t think so and if sanders did get the nomination these rich donors who find trump an embarrassment and repugnant and vulgar and inept have made it clear they will support trump if sanders had won in 2016 we would have had complete paralysis because sanders would have never had the base within either the republican or the democratic party to push through the kinds of reforms he says he wants to institute i just don t think at this point our system of what sheldon wolin called inverted totalitarianism is reformable or salvageable nor do i think that electoral politics are going to bring about the kinds of radical reforms especially in terms of our addiction to fossil fuels that are urgently needed ctf what s happening in chile is really interesting because it is stronger than what anyone predicted piñera just announced that in april he will put forward discussions and planning to talk about developing a new constitution which is one of the major demands of the protesters what are your thoughts on what s happening down there ch the examples of chile hong kong and lebanon are important because these people have taken to the streets to put pressure on the ruling elites which is what we have to do that constitution was written as soon as pinochet took power by the so called chicago school the global corporatist and neo liberal milton friedman type economists on behalf of the world s ruling elites and the hands of any chilean government have been effectively tied because of that constitution there s nothing at this point that has proved to be an impediment to the further concentration of wealth in the hands of this global oligarchic elite eight families now hold as much wealth as 50 percent of the world s population we re certainly seeing during the trump administration an acceleration of the demolition of government controls and regulations the further privatizing of public lands and public services the assault on labor unions the ability of global speculators to use trillions of dollars lent to them of government money at virtually zero percent interest to do things like buy back their own stock to swell their own compensation packages the corporations are back to doing exactly what they were doing before 2008 with structured asset destruction through inflation stripping assets through mergers and acquisitions and raising levels of debt incumbency which has created this huge debt peonage on the public jamie dimon has been indicted along with jpmorgan chase more than any other bank in american history for this kind of fraud i mean really sleazy stuff like having veterans sign mortgage loans and then jacking those loans up to amounts that they can t pay we ve created another bubble the ponzi schemes are back in business in addition to creating income inequality and monopoly power that is going to create another financial collapse when it comes i don t know what will trigger it but it s not a sustainable system and what will happen then will they go back and demand more money trillions of dollars from the us treasury how will people react certainly people will react with a kind of outrage and anger but we re headed for an extremely difficult period especially because they have stripped us of all of our rights privacy due process habeas corpus and now under section 1021 of the national defense authorization act they can deploy the military into the streets and they ll use everything within their power they will not shrink from using coercion and force to maintain control and it could get pretty ugly i mean we have a thousand of our citizens right now who are shot dead by police almost all of them unarmed almost all poor people of color in american cities that s one every eight hours ctf one of the challenges on the left is understanding what s happening around the world the united states is getting more aggressive and somewhat more sophisticated in its regime change campaigns there are so many reasons for people in hong kong to protest it s a neoliberal capitalist paradise where there s almost no enforcement of business or finance crimes and people have a very wide wealth divide and inequality expensive housing and low paying jobs with no future it s just a really hard situation for the vast majority of people in hong kong so it s understandable that it s a big uprising then it s interesting to see the national endowment for democracy s role in hong kong they are spending more than a million dollars a year they have been funding anti china movements in hong kong since before the turnover of hong kong to china these hong kong protests are turning into trump save us or anti china stuff singing the star spangled banner or putting up the u k flag in the legislature saying bring us back to colonialism this is really the u s targeting china ch right but it was lord salisbury who said there are no permanent allies there s only permanent power so if you look at the whole human rights drive going back to charter 77 founded by václav havel in czechoslovakia he was a non person within czechoslovakia the only way you could hear václav havel s voice was over voice of america i knew havel and havel was not a supporter of u s imperialism he was a socialist in repressive situations we ll often make alliances all the points you make are true i m not arguing them but the idea that any resistance movement is somehow untainted is wrong in the whole cold war the soviet union which you know had a very deeply repressive anti democratic system backed revolutionary socialist governments such as the cuban government which i would support in terms of foreign affairs there often are contradictions moral contradictions as you correctly pointed out but i don t think that invalidates the uprisings themselves ctf the 2020s are going to be a time when major crises are culminating the climate crisis economic crisis militarism and repression what would be your advice to activists to where they should put their focus or things that they should be preparing for ch well i think extinction rebellion which is this radical climate group that just organized thousands of people to shut down city centers in about 60 cities around the globe has got it it s nonviolent occupation of bridges and roads and roundabouts to paralyze commerce and to begin to force the ruling elites to respond to the climate emergency extinction rebellion is quite clear that they re not interested in reform they re interested in rebellion they are interested in removing the ruling elites from power they will do that by breaking the law and by going to jail over a thousand people were arrested in london that s where we really have to go we have to use our numbers to paralyze the system that s the only hope that we have and i think that s what we have been seeing in countries like lebanon chile and hong kong i think especially if we talk about the climate emergency alone that is the only mechanism left to save us
the decade just ending was the longest period without a slump in the major economies since 1945 but it also involved the weakest recovery in 2019 global growth was at its slowest since the global financial crisis of 2008 what factors led to the slowdown and what enabled the major capitalist economies to avoid a major slump the slow annual gdp growth of 1 2 is due to low investment rates as a recent imf report notes firms turned cautious on long range spending and global purchases of machinery and equipment decelerated trade conflicts were also an important factor in the slowdown in technology spending global trade in durable final goods and components simply slowed to a standstill since 2009 globalization and free trade increasingly has given way to protectionist measures as in the 1930s governments worldwide introduced 2 723 new trade distortions affecting an estimated 40 of world trade by november 2019 emerging economies suffered most in most cases growth has been far lower in the last six years than in the same period before the great recession in the 1930 s in argentina brazil russia south africa and ukraine for example there has been no growth at all in 2018 many central banks placed a hold on their policy interest rates or in the case of the federal reserve actually hiked the rate in 2019 the opposite was the case as monetary authorities reversed their stance that the global economy had been normalized interest rates on government bonds and other safe assets fell back towards zero or even turned negative with borrowing so cheap large corporations and banks sucked up cheap credit not to invest in productive assets but to buy up shares and bonds stock market prices thus rocketed they are up 30 in the united states and global stock markets are now worth 86 trillion just short of an all time high and equal to almost 100 of global gdp the main purchasers of corporate stocks are the corporations themselves these so called buybacks pushed up stock prices making it easier to buy out other companies or get more credit much of the buyback funds were borrowed this expansion of what marx called fictitious capital has replaced investment in productive capital and it has been financed by issuing more debt to fund the cost of servicing existing debt the major capitalist economies are now living in a fantasy world where the stock and bond markets insist world capitalism has never had it so good while the real economy is stagnating in terms of output trade profits and investment the other factor enabling the capitalist economies to avoid a new slump was the rise in employment and the fall in the jobless rate instead of investing heavily in new technology and shedding labor companies took in more cheap labor generated by the recession and immigration according to the international labor organization the global unemployment rate dropped to just 5 its lowest level in almost 40 years in the 2010s it seems that companies rather than reducing their costs in the face of recession and low profitability by sacking workers and introducing labor saving technology opted to take on labor at low wages and with precarious conditions no pensions zero hours guaranteed under temporary contracts etc there was a sharp increase in zombie companies that make enough money to pay a low wage workforce and service their debts but not enough to expand high employment and low real gdp growth means low productivity growth which over time means stagnating economies a vicious circle the predicted ai robot revolution in industry has yet to materialize globally the annual growth in output per worker has been hovering around 2 for the past few years compared with an annual average rate of 2 9 between 2000 and 2007 these factors may have delayed the advent of a new slump the fundamental driver of a capitalist economy is profit however neither the average profitability of capital nor the amassing of profit is rising in the major economies according to the latest data on the net return on capital provided by the eu s ameco database profitability in 2020 will be 4 lower than the peak of 2017 in europe 8 down in japan and flat in the united states the growing profitability crisis threatens to turn the increased credit for corporations from a bonus into a burden the institute of international finance estimates that global debt has now hit 250 trillion nearly 32 500 for every person on earth the world bank joined the bank for international settlements in warning that the largest and fastest rise in global debt in half a century could lead to another financial crisis as the world economy slows world bank chief david malpass warned that a sudden rise in risk premiums could precipitate a financial crisis as has happened many times in the past as we enter the 11th year since the end of the last global slump there are fundamental factors suggesting a new slump is not far away they are stagnant or falling profits and profitability weak or falling investment rising corporate debt and falling trade amid a global trade war the global cost of borrowing has reached an all time low partly due to central bank policies of zero interest rates and quantitative easing but also because there is no demand from the capitalist sector for credit to invest in productive assets or from governments to spend capitalism is a system in which profits rule investment and investment rules employment and income and that rules spending sooner or later the fundamental factors of profits and investment will override the counteracting factors of low interest and unemployment heiko khoo is a columnist with china org cn for more information please visit michael roberts is a london based marxist economist he published the the great

the events in 2019 that you thought were of importance chris hedges ch i would say there are two the failure to address the climate emergency which is seeing an acceleration of the deterioration and destruction of the ecosystem that is quite dramatic and pronounced in california and australia would be number one even if we stopped all carbon emissions today which again the ruling elites utterly betrayed and failed us in madrid we re still going to deal with catastrophic climate change the other was the failure on the part of the democratic party to address the rupture of social bonds and deep social inequality that has torn apart the country and resulted in the election of donald trump at the end of the year after the complete failure of the mueller report which was hyped by all sorts of media organizations not only rachel maddow and msnbc but also the new york times we got this kind of mind numbing spectacle of the impeachment with that very cloying and repugnant moral posturing on the part of the democratic party what they did was selective they charged trump not with all of the most egregious impeachable offenses and constitutional violations that he carried out but with the most trivial that s contempt for congress and the attempt to get the ukrainian president zelensky to open an investigation of biden and his son in exchange for about 400 million in us aid and allowing zelenski to visit the white house if the democratic party was committed to actually defending the constitution then they would have to go back and impeach trump for a series of violations that both george w bush and barack obama routinely committed they don t want to do that so when i hear them talking about the restoration of the rule of law and see that they ignored the most serious constitutional violations which have now been normalized by both parties it s an example of at best self delusion and probably very cynical manipulation i can run through a few bush launches two illegal wars that are never declared by congress as demanded by the constitution he places the entire us public under government surveillance that s violating the fourth amendment he authorizes torture and kidnapping of foreign nationals who are not even us citizens and holds them where they re tortured in black sites and offshore penal colonies around the world obama expands the illegal wars which are now up to 11 if we count yemen edward snowden reveals that intelligence agencies are monitoring and spying on all of us downloading all of our data and metrics into government computers where they re stored for in perpetuity and nothing is done obama misuses the 2002 authorization for use of military force act to erase due process that s when he argues that the executive branch has the right to assassinate us citizens starting with a radical cleric anwar al awlaki and two weeks later his 16 year old son in essence serving as judge jury and executioner and then of course he signs into law section 1021 of the national defense authorization act which overturns the 1878 posse comitatus act that prohibits the use of the military as a domestic police force i sued him in federal court over that and then there are other again bipartisan constitutional violations including violating treaty clauses that are supposed to be ratified by the senate violating the appointments clause where you need senate confirmation and the routine abuse of executive orders watching the impeachment process was a very depressing spectacle for me because it was about the pretense of the rule of law it again exposed the fact that the democratic party will refuse to be self reflective and refuse to confront its complicity in neoliberalism deindustrialization programs of austerity massive expansion of our prison system and militarizing of our police it tries to personalize all of our problems in the figure of trump ctf you have written that the right wing has picked up revolutionary rhetoric because people in the united states and around the world see the corruption of the elites now with these right wing fascists rising do you see any possibility of the left being able to pick up that need for a revolutionary vision and plan ch well i do see the need but i don t see it happening i think that is driven by fear especially at every presidential election cycle the left the liberal class just crumbles the attraction of trump is that he rightly attacks the deep state which is real but what is the deep state the deep state is the generals the war industry the bankers the lobbyists the corporatists the intelligence agencies the government bureaucrats and the technocrats who actually run both domestic and international policy the fact is we don t control our own economy it s controlled by goldman sachs and citibank and jp morgan chase the washington post when it released the afghanistan papers recently the roughly more than 2 000 pages of internal government documents about the war in afghanistan which they obtained through a three year legal battle exposed exactly the bipartisan lies fraud deceit corruption waste and mismanagement during the 18 year conflict that was carried out by the ruling elites by the deep state the deep state that so many trump supporters have been betrayed by and turned on with a vengeance trump s attraction is that he calls them out often in very vulgar and crude terms the democratic party in pushing biden because he s been anointed by the democratic party donor class is seeking to perpetuate a system that at least half or more of the country wants to get rid of and the left has not embraced or understood that the whole ideology of the ruling elite neoliberalism and imperialism just doesn t resonate anymore they re bound to this ideology because the people funding the party recognize quite correctly that if they don t have that kind of corporate money and corporate backing they will lose power and so they d rather take the whole system down which is what they re doing this is the problem of the left it has misread power i m a strong supporter of extinction rebellion because i think they ve correctly read power we can go back for the last four decades carbon admissions have exponentially risen all of the attempts to work within the system this is 350 org and others have been an utter and complete failure and the left partly because we were so knocked off balance over the last few decades our organizations were either co opted or destroyed is just not willing to face this reality ctf putting aside the democratic party how do you see the potential for the left movement awakening to anti capitalist and anti imperialist thinking ch i don t know that the left is organized i don t know that it has yet offered a strong alternative vision to the mainstream i think it s often divided by identity politics without grasping that the fundamental issue is class this is class warfare and as warren buffett has correctly said his side is winning we also have to make it clear that they have not only marginalized us but cut down the spaces by which we can communicate that s why i m on rt what i do on rt should be on a functioning public broadcasting system but the public broadcasting system in particular pbs is a wholly owned subsidiary of the koch brothers if you go back to the 70s you could see noam chomsky howard zinn angela davis and all sorts of people who were not beholden to institutions or to corporations offering a critique of power the last national show that we had that critiqued power is bill moyers show which is now off the air and in the end was funded through a private foundation all of those sentiments are on the rise but it is yet to be translated into a political movement and if there are uprisings without that kind of vision and focus then the ruling elites can easily decapitate them ctf you worked with us back when we were organizing the occupation in washington dc throughout 2011 and that was a time of a lot of uprisings around the world the occupy movement really took off in the united states now we re seeing a rise again around the world against corruption and neoliberal capitalism do you think that has the potential to come back to the united states in another wave and what do we need to do to be prepared for that if it does ch i covered uprisings for 20 years as a foreign correspondent all around the globe the palestinian uprisings most of the revolutions in eastern europe east germany czechoslovakia romania and the street demonstrations that brought down slobodan milosevic what s fascinating is that what ignites it no one can predict even purported leaders of the opposition don t know what pushes people over the edge which is usually something very relatively in and of itself minor and even banal neoliberalism or global capitalism is a global phenomenon it has affected people in the same way one of the things we don t hear about the protests in hong kong is that especially the young are without work and social inequality is very pronounced i think that economic tyranny lies at the root of the uprisings that we ve seen not only in hong kong but in india chile and france and in iran iraq and lebanon but it also lies at the root of the rise of these right wing demagogues as we just saw in britain with boris johnson narendra modi in india and trump in the united states and so yes i think that we re not immune to this kind of social unrest and this kind of upheaval especially as the forces that created it have no regulation and no restraint student debt personal debt national debt we re about to watch the republican party again take an axe and slash social services and food stamps these corporatists know only one word and that s more and they won t stop until there s blowback the problem is that if that blowback is just kind of a release in the streets of anger and frustration and rage all legitimate without an alternative vision and without alternative structures to begin to challenge power then it can be crushed ctf when we were involved in occupy it was a different phase of the movement s development occupy was an eruption of anger the 99 versus the 1 since occupy there has been a lot of work done by various groups on new economy ideas whether it s participatory budgeting or worker owned businesses cooperatives or public banks california is the first state to do a public bank since north dakota in 1919 20 we re seeing some movement toward the beginning i think of a vision that you re describing and i think that s a potential positive the other thing that s a challenge in the united states is the electoral system because right now so many activists are getting pulled into the 2020 election particularly through the sanders campaign and a little bit through the warren campaign and somewhat in the green efforts but those are so squashed in the united states that they are hardly visible we see the election system as a kind of a mirage democracy it s molded manipulated and in the end never quenches people s needs sanders is interesting because if he loses because of a democratic primary violation that could create an eruption itself if he wins then you have someone in office you can actually push to try to get things done that may cause an eruption can the sanders campaign have that kind of an impact ch i think you could make a strong case that the nomination was stolen from sanders in 2016 people walked out of the democratic national convention but it didn t have that impact the new york times has run more than one story where they are interviewing anonymous democratic party donors who are already organizing to make sure neither sanders nor warren and i don t trust warren too much get the nomination it is the question of whether you can work from within i have long argued that the democratic party is not salvageable it s not reformable it is not in any sense a real political party in that the base has any real say maybe the sanders campaign will prove me wrong i hope they do prove me wrong but i don t think so and if sanders did get the nomination these rich donors who find trump an embarrassment and repugnant and vulgar and inept have made it clear they will support trump if sanders had won in 2016 we would have had complete paralysis because sanders would have never had the base within either the republican or the democratic party to push through the kinds of reforms he says he wants to institute i just don t think at this point our system of what sheldon wolin called inverted totalitarianism is reformable or salvageable nor do i think that electoral politics are going to bring about the kinds of radical reforms especially in terms of our addiction to fossil fuels that are urgently needed ctf what s happening in chile is really interesting because it is stronger than what anyone predicted piñera just announced that in april he will put forward discussions and planning to talk about developing a new constitution which is one of the major demands of the protesters what are your thoughts on what s happening down there ch the examples of chile hong kong and lebanon are important because these people have taken to the streets to put pressure on the ruling elites which is what we have to do that constitution was written as soon as pinochet took power by the so called chicago school the global corporatist and neo liberal milton friedman type economists on behalf of the world s ruling elites and the hands of any chilean government have been effectively tied because of that constitution there s nothing at this point that has proved to be an impediment to the further concentration of wealth in the hands of this global oligarchic elite eight families now hold as much wealth as 50 percent of the world s population we re certainly seeing during the trump administration an acceleration of the demolition of government controls and regulations the further privatizing of public lands and public services the assault on labor unions the ability of global speculators to use trillions of dollars lent to them of government money at virtually zero percent interest to do things like buy back their own stock to swell their own compensation packages the corporations are back to doing exactly what they were doing before 2008 with structured asset destruction through inflation stripping assets through mergers and acquisitions and raising levels of debt incumbency which has created this huge debt peonage on the public jamie dimon has been indicted along with jpmorgan chase more than any other bank in american history for this kind of fraud i mean really sleazy stuff like having veterans sign mortgage loans and then jacking those loans up to amounts that they can t pay we ve created another bubble the ponzi schemes are back in business in addition to creating income inequality and monopoly power that is going to create another financial collapse when it comes i don t know what will trigger it but it s not a sustainable system and what will happen then will they go back and demand more money trillions of dollars from the us treasury how will people react certainly people will react with a kind of outrage and anger but we re headed for an extremely difficult period especially because they have stripped us of all of our rights privacy due process habeas corpus and now under section 1021 of the national defense authorization act they can deploy the military into the streets and they ll use everything within their power they will not shrink from using coercion and force to maintain control and it could get pretty ugly i mean we have a thousand of our citizens right now who are shot dead by police almost all of them unarmed almost all poor people of color in american cities that s one every eight hours ctf one of the challenges on the left is understanding what s happening around the world the united states is getting more aggressive and somewhat more sophisticated in its regime change campaigns there are so many reasons for people in hong kong to protest it s a neoliberal capitalist paradise where there s almost no enforcement of business or finance crimes and people have a very wide wealth divide and inequality expensive housing and low paying jobs with no future it s just a really hard situation for the vast majority of people in hong kong so it s understandable that it s a big uprising then it s interesting to see the national endowment for democracy s role in hong kong they are spending more than a million dollars a year they have been funding anti china movements in hong kong since before the turnover of hong kong to china these hong kong protests are turning into trump save us or anti china stuff singing the star spangled banner or putting up the uk flag in the legislature saying bring us back to colonialism this is really the us targeting china ch right but it was lord salisbury who said there are no permanent allies there s only permanent power so if you look at the whole human rights drive going back to charter 77 founded by václav havel in czechoslovakia he was a non person within czechoslovakia the only way you could hear václav havel s voice was over voice of america i knew havel and havel was not a supporter of us imperialism he was a socialist in repressive situations we ll often make alliances all the points you make are true i m not arguing them but the idea that any resistance movement is somehow untainted is wrong in the whole cold war the soviet union which you know had a very deeply repressive anti democratic system backed revolutionary socialist governments such as the cuban government which i would support in terms of foreign affairs there often are contradictions moral contradictions as you correctly pointed out but i don t think that invalidates the uprisings themselves ctf the 2020s are going to be a time when major crises are culminating the climate crisis economic crisis militarism and repression what would be your advice to activists to where they should put their focus or things that they should be preparing for ch well i think extinction rebellion which is this radical climate group that just organized thousands of people to shut down city centers in about 60 cities around the globe has got it it s nonviolent occupation of bridges and roads and roundabouts to paralyze commerce and to begin to force the ruling elites to respond to the climate emergency extinction rebellion is quite clear that they re not interested in reform they re interested in rebellion they are interested in removing the ruling elites from power they will do that by breaking the law and by going to jail over a thousand people were arrested in london that s where we really have to go we have to use our numbers to paralyze the system that s the only hope that we have and i think that s what we have been seeing in countries like lebanon chile and hong kong i think especially if we talk about the climate emergency alone that is the only mechanism left to save us ctf thank you chris you can read chris on truthdig and watch him on rt

much of what passes for left commentary in the us emerged from the post wwii synthesis of radical right economics with a fey liberal notion of democracy in recent years this synthesis has been given the name neoliberalism left largely untouched have been the premises and analytical architecture of neoliberalism which are as much a part of the neoliberal ethos as the nominal ideas as such much of this criticism has had the effect of reinforcing the ideas and actions that are being critiqued presidential candidate elizabeth warren articulated this paradox when she stated that she is capitalist to her bones when tied back to her erstwhile policy prescriptions she restated the neoliberal synthesis capitalist economics tied to a fey conception of democracy as inclusion in capitalist political economy the question then what happens when capitalist outcomes are anti democratic is this not the central political question of the age moreover how and when was capitalism decided upon as the mode of social organization through anything resembling a democratic process the answer is that it wasn t capitalism is an imposed political order that is put forward as both not political and freely chosen what lies behind it is a neoliberal conception of history as before and after the before which occurred before we had a say in the matter and the after which is the world that was decided on before this tyranny of history of being born into already distributed political and economic power calls the theoretical acuity of both capitalism and democracy into question both depend on an absence of coercion power to work if a few people own everything they can make capitalism the least efficient economic system ever conceived and if a few people control political outcomes democracy can hardly be claimed to exist if people are born into a world where a few people own everything and a few people determine political outcomes then neither capitalism nor democracy can be claimed to exist in less abstract terms us president donald trump s rewrite of the nafta trade agreement first passed by democrat bill clinton in 1994 tweaks the original and reframes the role of class struggle regarding trade pacts while the trade pacts that preceded nafta carried with them a sense of being republican the national democrats countered by inserting labor friendly language not through substantive opposition getting nafta passed required a coalition between business friendly republicans and new democrats led by bill clinton it was mr clinton s understanding of the neoliberal ethos that gave him the ability to frame the economic policies of the radical right through the language of democratic inclusion to get a sense mr clinton promoted the idea of a level playing field as he was working with the titans of industry to deliver working class jobs to low wage locales overseas the level playing field was a promise of popular inclusion while his economic policies were being written by corporations and the rich to lower wages and crush the power of labor the idea that trade is always and everywhere beneficial has been the american position left right and center since the reemergence of neoliberalism in the mid 1970s this is why having labor representatives at the table during trade negotiations slowed the evisceration of labor s power not one whit to follow the logic trade is so beneficial that labor benefits from it even though labor s power has been eviscerated through trade agreements as even clintonite supporters of free trade like paul krugman argued early on trade creates winners and losers there is no universal benefit through neoliberal ideology the prior distribution of political and economic power should have had no impact on the distribution of the benefits of trade agreements otherwise the argument over free trade turns into rococo apologetics to benefit the already rich and powerful as it turned out oligarchs and corporations got cheap labor in subsidized factories and freedom from environmental regulations and effective taxation the laboring classes got gradually debased paychecks and benefits followed by exciting new career opportunities as uber entrepreneurs and greeters at walmart what this means is that understanding power is more important to predicting the winners and losers of neoliberal economic policies than knowing the economics this is more likely than not the reason why power is assumed out of capitalist economic theory but what else are establishment politicians referring to when they claim that wildly popular policies in the public interest can t be gotten through congress if the people elect representatives to do the people s bidding but the representatives do the bidding of business interests then where does the power lie it lies with the oligarchs and that isn t democracy the concept of power at work is as part of an iterative social political economic process that neoliberal ideology can t accommodate the theorized point of capitalism is to tie economic distribution to economic production the equal distribution of political power implied by democracy comes from membership in a democratic society not from a system for meritoriously allocating it without perpetual redistribution to place people in equal starting positions neither capitalism nor democracy operate as the theories that support them claim but what trade agreements do accomplish is to reorganize political and economic relations that 1 benefit the already rich and powerful but that 2 disproportionately harm those whose lives have been reorganized when the reorganizing force is threatened amazon uses economic and political power to limit and or eliminate competition for the benefit of jeff bezos and a few other connected executives much of this has nothing to do with market competition witness the self dealing of political competition to attract amazon facilities but shutting amazon down would immediately put thousands of people on the unemployment line in similar fashion left critiques of donald trump s trade war an apparent negotiating tactic for winning trade concessions have centered on the distribution of economic pain not the widely destructive consequences of neoliberal trade agreements or their being structured to cause maximum economic pain to vulnerable citizens when trade relations are threatened complaints that so and so consumer products are made more expensive come from so far down the neoliberal rabbit hole that their very existence affirms the basic economic and political logic of neoliberalism as well as the thatcherite tina there is no alternative if the prior distribution of political and economic power destines the benefits of trade to accrue to the already rich and powerful then why would a democratic society either care about or acquiesce to what benefits the rich and powerful and to the extent that the continued aggregation of wealth by the few buys them more political power how are such policies not antithetical to political democracy posed historically isn t the increasing concentration of wealth and power amongst the few the actual historically demonstrated outcome of neoliberal policies the link between capitalism and democracy in neoliberal theory comes through the idea of choice democracy provides people with a choice of who they want to lead them and capitalism provides them with a choice between consumer products the facile nature of the comparison between how people chose to organize their societies and their preferred brand of toilet tissue didn t occur to those who formulated it because they didn t consider social organization to be a choice to be left to the people neither capitalism nor neoliberalism has ever been put to a vote excerpted from neoliberalism and the end of politics courtesy counterpunch org

purpose i look at the high frequency weekly indicators because while they can be very noisy they provide a good nowcast of the economy and will telegraph the maintenance or change in the economy well before monthly or quarterly data is available they are also an excellent way to mark your beliefs to market in general i go in order of long leading indicators then short leading indicators then coincident indicators a note on methodology data is presented in a just the facts ma am format with a minimum of commentary so that bias is minimized where relevant i include 12 month highs and lows in the data in parentheses to the right all data taken from st louis fred unless otherwise linked a few items e g financial conditions indexes regional fed indexes stock prices the yield curve have their own metrics based on long term studies of their behavior where data is seasonally adjusted generally it is scored positively if it is within the top 1 3 of that range negative in the bottom 1 3 and neutral in between where it is not seasonally adjusted and there are seasonal issues waiting for the yoy change to change sign will lag the turning point thus i make use of a convention data is scored neutral if it is less than 1 2 as positive negative as at its 12 month extreme with long leading indicators which by definition turn at least 12 months before a turning point in the economy as a whole there is an additional rule data is automatically negative if during an expansion it has not made a new peak in the past year with the sole exception that it is scored neutral if it is moving

not a guarantee of future results risks the fund s investments are concentrated in the energy infrastructure industry with an emphasis on securities issued by master limited partnerships mlps which may increase price fluctuation the value of commodity linked investments such as the mlps and energy infrastructure companies including midstream mlps and energy infrastructure companies in which the fund invests are subject to risks specific to the industry they serve such as fluctuations in commodity prices reduced volumes of available natural gas or other energy commodities slowdowns in new construction and acquisitions a sustained reduced demand for crude oil natural gas and refined petroleum products depletion of the natural gas reserves or other commodities changes in the macroeconomic or regulatory environment environmental hazards rising interest rates and threats of attack by terrorists on energy assets each of which could affect the fund s profitability mlps are subject to significant regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in the regulatory environment including the risk that an mlp could lose its tax status as a partnership if an mlp was obligated to pay federal income tax on its income at the corporate tax rate the amount of cash available for distribution would be reduced and such distributions received by the fund would be taxed under federal income tax laws applicable to corporate dividends received as dividend income return of capital or capital gain in addition investing in mlps involves additional risks as compared to the risks of investing in common stock including risks related to cash flow dilution and voting rights such companies may trade less frequently than larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations which may result in erratic price movement or difficulty in buying or selling the fund is a non diversified closed end management investment company as a result the fund s returns may fluctuate to a greater extent than those of a diversified investment company shares of closed end management investment companies such as the fund frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value which may increase investors risk of loss the fund is not a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in the fund because of the fund s concentration in mlp investments the fund is not eligible to be treated as a regulated investment company under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended instead the fund will be treated as a regular corporation or c corporation for u s federal income tax purposes and as a result unlike most investment companies will be subject to corporate income tax to the extent the fund recognizes taxable income an investment in mlp units involves risks that differ from a similar investment in equity securities such as common stock of a corporation holders of mlp units have the rights typically afforded to limited partners in a limited partnership as compared to common shareholders of a corporation holders of mlp units have more limited control and limited rights to vote on matters affecting the partnership there are certain tax risks associated with an investment in mlp units additionally conflicts of interest may exist between common unit holders subordinated unit holders and the general partner of an mlp the fund currently seeks to enhance the level of its current distributions by utilizing financial leverage through borrowing including loans from financial institutions or the issuance of commercial paper or other forms of debt through the issuance of senior securities such as preferred shares through reverse repurchase agreements dollar rolls or similar transactions or through a combination of the foregoing financial leverage is a

china pumps an extra us 115bn stimulus to the economy effective monday 4th saturday january 2020 09 18 utc full article china s latest stimulus effort is a cut to the so called reserve requirement ratio the amount of money that commercial banks are required to stash away china moved to pump more cash into its financial system suggesting that beijing remained concerned about faltering growth despite signs that the world s second largest economy was stabilizing china s central bank the people s bank of china announced that it would inject about us 115 billion into the economy by freeing up banks to lend more money the move comes after a similar action in september the change announced on the new year s day holiday is likely to focus renewed attention on the health of the chinese economy a major driver of global growth the move is relatively modest given the vast size of the chinese economy but the timing suggests that the country s leaders are on high alert for new evidence of a slowdown it follows a recent meeting of the country s top economic planners and comes just weeks before beijing releases closely watched estimates of year end growth china s leaders are contending with the country s slowest pace of growth in nearly three decades the country s slowdown has sent ripples through the global economy germany narrowly avoided a recession last fall and its manufacturing sector has slumped in part because of reduced demand from china other european countries have also seen growth slow and their industrial sectors contract china s struggles have spread to much of the rest of asia where it is the dominant economy and also to africa and latin america which have become increasingly reliant on chinese imports and investment australia which has experienced a prolonged boom driven by chinese demand for its natural resources is now seeing its growth streak threatened other major central banks have also taken steps to shore up their economies a few months ago the european central bank announced its own stimulus package totaling 20 billion euros per month in the united states the federal reserve cut interest rates three times last year to prevent the manufacturing slowdown from spreading to the rest of the economy dozens of other central banks around the world have taken similar steps china s latest stimulus effort comes in the form of a cut to the so called reserve requirement ratio the amount of money that commercial banks are required to stash away for a rainy day the cut reduced the requirement ratio by 0 5 percentage points to 12 5 for large banks and will take effect next monday it will effectively allow banks to lend an additional 800 billion yuan beijing has been trying to pare down the country s dependence on borrowing which helped fuel heady growth in recent years but left big debts on the balance sheets of major corporations and local governments reducing that dependence could help prevent major problems down the road but at the cost of slower growth in the near term some recent signs had suggested that china s slowdown was easing november figures for industrial output and retail sales had indicated the economy was strengthening the property market an essential part of the chinese economy that in recent months had been holding back growth also appeared to be improving in the cut announced economists see beijing as trying to find middle ground between supporting economic growth without resorting to more aggressive steps that could rev the economy further but saddle the country with even more debt the cut is not unusual so early in the year before china s lunar new year holiday which begins this year on jan 25 and when demand for cash intensifies the central bank made a similar cut about a year ago china s most recent cut reduced the requirement ratio by 0 5 percentage points to 12 5 per cent for large banks
jeff prestridge after a truly golden 2019 experts are forecasting more big gains for bullion this year here s how you could strike gold in 2020 gold had a good year in 2019 a very good year as frank sinatra once sang in dollar terms it was up in price 19 per cent priced in pounds it rose by 15 per cent finishing the year at a tad over 1 157 an ounce it s the fourth consecutive year that gold prices in sterling terms have risen yet according to investors and some financial experts gold has further to go much further even they believe 2020 should be another excellent year for an asset that many consider a safe haven in both calm and stormy times gold investors had a strong 2019 with the price of gold rising by 15 per cent an asset that most experts insist should always be considered by investors looking to build a broadly diversified investment portfolio sitting alongside other long term investments such as equities bonds and property this is despite the fact that unlike other assets gold is non income producing it s all about the price with gold it rises and you win it falls and you lose the latest poll conducted by precious metals dealer bullionvault suggests that confidence to deliver strong price gains this year remains sky high nearly four in five of bullionvault s clients believe that gold prices will rise by more than 10 per cent in 2020 the most bullish its investors have been about gold for three years indeed one in six investors are even more exuberant about the prospects for gold predicting gains of 30 per cent in the next 12 months of course you would expect precious metals investors to talk up an asset they have a financial interest in but bullionvault s clients are not exclusively gold investment fans indeed they typically hold no more than 10 per cent of their investments in gold and one in five believes that global stock markets will perform better than gold this year adrian ash director of research at bullionvault says the main drivers of rising gold prices last year were strong investment demand and big purchases by central banks these factors mitigated the impact of reduced gold jewellery purchases in china and india as a result of a slowdown in economic growth and consumer spending there but this year he believes that fear will drive the gold price even higher resulting from potential geo political and global economic risks such as rising tensions between the us and iran he says yes gold and equity prices especially in the united states rose last year but history shows that gold also does well when other assets suffer and financial markets now face a raft of worries from potential conflict in the middle east president trump s impeachment continued trade issues between china and the united states the uk and europe through to the possible fracturing of nato and the growing challenge to the west from both russia and china he adds november s us presidential election could well bring a surge in financial risk indeed money managers are already betting on a wall street sell off and an accompanying jump in gold prices to 2 000 or even 3 000 an ounce to put these figures into perspective in dollar terms gold finished 2019 at 1 523 an ounce investors agree that gold is a useful asset to help diversify a portfolio a more sanguine but supportive view comes from david coombs of investment house rathbones he is head of multi asset portfolios at the london based investment firm responsible for deciding the asset mix of various key funds he admits that as an investment manager gold has rarely held any allure for him because it does not generate an income but since late 2017 he has changed his mind as abnormal times call for abnormal investment decisions as a result some 4 7 per cent of the 600 million fund rathbone multi asset strategic growth portfolio he manages is currently invested in commodities with the biggest holding via a stock market listed exchange traded company ishares physical gold that tracks the price of gold coombs holds gold in the fund not primarily because of potential geo political risks around the corner although like ash he admits they are not in short supply it is more a result of low interest rates in the uk across europe and especially the us he says negative interest rates on some 10 year government bonds in countries such as france germany and switzerland mean the opportunity cost of gold has fallen to its lowest level in decades by selling negative yielding bonds to buy gold you are effectively increasing your income he argues yet more important adds coombs is the direction of interest rate travel in the us he explains over the long term the price of the shiny metal usually moves in the opposite direction to us interest rates so when times are good there s confidence in the economy and interest rates are increasing investors then don t need gold but when uncertainty hangs over the us economy and already low interest rates are cut further investors look to gold for shelter and that s what happening now the federal reserve the us s answer to the bank of england is creating a supportive environment for gold he concludes from a strategic point of view gold is a good hedge against disinflation a valuable benefit these days considering that i think we re facing long term disinflationary headwinds everyone says gold is a hedge against inflation but it is actually a hedge against capital destruction in these abnormal times we see gold as a good store of value coombs thoughts are echoed by bill dinning chief investment officer at waverton investment management he adds one reason why many investors have historically thought gold unattractive is that it costs money to store around 0 2 per cent per annum to store a one kilo bar of gold but for much of the last five years it has been cheaper to store gold than it has been to lend money to many western governments so it makes gold a more attractive component of a diversified portfolio one investor argues that by selling negative yielding bonds to buy gold you are effectively increasing your income wealth readers who wish to hold gold in their portfolios can do so in many ways they can purchase the physical metal through merchants such as baird co bullionvault sharps pixley the gold bullion company the pure gold company the royal mint and spink for example the purchase of 10 000 of gold online through bullionvault will cost 0 5 per cent initially plus 0 36 per cent per annum to store if sold after a year the sales fee would be 0 5 per cent total fees of around 136 a one ounce minted gold bar bullion from royal mint currently costs just over 1 191 it will be delivered free of charge although royal mint offers buyers the choice of having the gold stored securely at its vaults on gold worth 10 000 the annual vault charge would work out at about 120 although it could be higher if gold prices are rising gold bullion can also be bought from the royal mint and then held inside a self invested personal pension gold bullion can also be bought from the royal mint and then held inside a self invested personal pension or a small self administered pension scheme used by some company directors for financial planning pounce if it drops to 760 an ounce although the mood music is in favour of gold two cautionary comments one from brian dennehy investment expert at fundexpert and the other from duncan macinnes at investment manager ruffer don t get sucked in by the gold bugs with megaphones says dennehy wait until gold drops to below 1 000 760 an ounce and then pounce food for thought check the price on sites such as bullionbypost co uk macinnes warns gold is highly unpredictable it is uniquely capable of making forecasters appear silly as in the short term its price drivers are so ephemeral and diffuse so invest with caution maybe monthly and only invest a slice of your wealth in it gold may be indestructible as spandau ballet sang 37 years ago but that doesn t stop its price falling this means that 100 of gold purchased by a basic rate taxpayer for their sipp will only cost 80 because of pension tax relief at 20 per cent while for a higher rate taxpayer it will only cost 60 the gold must be held in royal mint s vaults further details at royalmintbullion com not all providers of sipps or ssass will accept physical gold as a holding so check beforehand rather than buy physical gold investors can buy a stock market listed exchange traded company whose performance tracks the gold price all fund platforms allow investors to buy these shares for example interactive investor includes ishares physical gold among its list of top super 60 investments the fund s annual charge is a competitive 0 25 per cent funds can also be bought that instead of investing in physical gold buy shares in gold mining companies as well as other mining businesses they include investment funds blackrock gold general charteris gold precious metals mfm junior gold merian gold silver ruffer gold and smith williamson global gold resources investment trusts include blackrock energy resources income none of these funds tracks the price of gold but if gold prices move ahead invariably they perform well funds such as rathbone multi asset strategic growth portfolio and investment trusts ruffer and personal assets also have part of their assets in gold gold bullion in the case of personal assets investment trust ruffer currently has some seven per cent of its assets invested in gold shares mainly via a holding in sister fund ruffer gold duncan macinnes a director at ruffer says his company currently prefers gold equities rather than gold bullion because they provide the opportunity to make enhanced returns if the gold price keeps moving ahead he adds after a brutal bear market many mining companies are back on their feet and delivering good cash flow at current gold prices the industry is consolidating around the better management teams exploration spending is subdued so supply should remain reasonably constrained demand for gold from central banks is a positive development in summary macinnes says in a world of expensive assets where the safest assets such as government bonds are the most expensive we think gold is a rare beauty it can be a portfolio hedge and make you money jeff prestridge mailonsunday co uk

the federal reserve has released the minutes of its december interest rate setting meeting showing meeting participants are concerned about low inflation but confident enough in the economy to hold rates steady going forward at a december meeting of the fed s policymaking body the federal open market committee fomc officials voted to keep their benchmark interest rate in a range between 1 5 percent and 1 75 percent at three earlier meetings committee members slashed the target federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point each time the minutes and insight into how central bank officials are weighing policy moves in support of higher or lower interest rates were released friday pdf they show committee members highlighting risks to the economic outlook from global economic softness and below target inflation in america global developments related to both persistent uncertainty regarding international trade and weakness in economic growth abroad continued to pose some risks to the outlook and inflation pressures remained muted the committee said remarks in the document echo those of fed chairman jerome powell who warned reporters that inflation running too cool for too long could sap sentiment and nudge the economy into a downturn while low and stable inflation is certainly a good thing inflation that runs persistently below our objective can lead to an unhealthy dynamic in which longer term inflation expectations drift down pulling actual inflation even lower powell said after december s fomc pdf he complained that inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective federal reserve chairman jerome powell testifies during a house financial services committee hearing on capitol hill on july 10 2019 zach gibson getty images over the 12 months through october a measure of core inflation which does not include food and energy prices due to their volatility was 1 6 percent in the united states still the fomc saw enough signs of economic strength to hold the benchmark rate steady the minutes show that members expected sustained economic expansion a resilient labor market and inflation near the committee s symmetric 2 percent goal as likely outcomes this outlook reflected at least in part the support provided by the current stance of monetary policy the committee noted adding that almost all participants expected that under appropriate monetary policy growth of real gdp in 2020 would run at or slightly above 1 9 percent real gdp in the united states rose 2 1 percent in the third quarter of 2019 according to the bureau of economic analysis the committee said it would continue to monitor the economic outlook including labor market conditions inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments with our decisions through the course of the past year we believe that monetary policy is well positioned to serve the american people by supporting continued economic growth a strong job market and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent goal powell said the central banker signaled the fed s readiness for decisive steps in case of future softening we re strongly committed to achieving our symmetric 2 percent inflation goal he insisted the fed and mortgage rates the fed has a dual mandate to foster price stability and maximum employment which it aims to achieve through three tools of monetary policy open market operations the discount rate and reserve requirements using the three tools the fed influences the federal funds rate which is the interest rate at which banks and other depository institutions lend balances they keep at the fed to other banks and institutions overnight changes in the federal funds rate trigger a chain of events that affect other short term interest rates foreign exchange rates long term interest rates the amount of money and credit and ultimately a range of economic variables including employment output and prices of goods and services the fed explains it is a misconception that the fed sets or directly affects mortgage rates the federal funds rate has only an indirect impact on the cost of home loans which is moderated by markets a comparison of a decade of federal funds rates united states 10 year treasury maturity rates and mortgage rates shows a high correlation between the latter two in contrast the fed driven interest rate curve has a markedly different shape mortgage rates drop united states long term mortgage rates declined slightly this week remaining close to historically low levels united states long term mortgage rates declined slightly this week remaining close to historically low levels mortgage buyer freddie mac said thursday the average rate for a 30 year fixed rate mortgage eased to 3 72 percent from 3 74 percent last week the benchmark rate stood at 4 51 percent a year ago from a 10 year peak of 5 21 percent in april 2010 the average rate on a 15 year mortgage slipped to 3 16 percent from 3 19 percent more positive economic data and improved housing market sentiment have brought stability in mortgage rates freddie mac chief economist sam khater told the associated press volatile interest rates earlier last year caused a slowdown in the housing market khater noted adding that low mortgage rates and a strong job market are setting the stage for a continued rise in home sales and home prices for all of 2019 the 30 year loan averaged 3 9 percent the fourth lowest annual rate since freddie mac began tracking it in 1971 according to the company the associated press contributed to this report

the 22 year long efforts of imran khan culminated in his taking oath as the prime minister of pakistan the 2018 general elections saw the emergence of the pakistan tehreek e insaf pti as the leading political force ahead of the pakistan muslim league nawaz and the pakistan people s party ppp imran khan and his cabinet ministers vowed to bring a change to the political structure of the country they also assured to give importance to the people the citizens and ensured to rectify the mistakes the past governments did however the people now want to ask the prime minister many questions these relate to the promises made during his post election campaigns while imran khan was hopeful to make a difference the results are not as expected imran khan did go on a hunt to bring down nawaz sharif and asif ali zardari he asked the concerned authorities to question the whereabouts from where sharif and zardari received their capital asset and properties although imran khan was successful in disqualifying nawaz sharif as the prime minister and also created barricades for zardari something was missing there was no real accountability in place what transpired following pti s emergence as the ruling party was imran khan indulging in revenge politics with the pml n and the ppp an ideal situation would have been to arrest nawaz sharif and asif zardari ask them to hand over all of their money they amassed through illegal means to the government and leave the country for good however both sharif and zardari went to the hospital to solve their health concerns after years of devouring public money imran khan s entrance strategy into pakistan s political fabric was good he staged a dharna in islamabad to oust the sitting government and presented points to create a naya pakistan once coming to power however his strategy either changed or he deviated from the tasks soon after taking oath the global media began calling him a tout of the army the washington post ran a story titled pakistan s military has its fingerprints all over the elections that pretty much spelled out the global viewpoint on how and why imran khan was brought as the leader several opinions and varying controversies are floating in the media and the general public regarding imran khan s rise as a leader some consider that pakistan needed a leader who could work with the us uk and the world to build a positive image of pakistan others however are presenting a different narrative researchers and analysts suggest that pti s objective is to fulfill the wishes of the international monetary fund imf and to further hamper economic growth in pakistan the sudden and unchecked increase in inflation and the barricades implemented on the industries and businesses is a tactic to achieve this objective imran khan s entrance strategy into pakistan s political fabric was good he staged a dharna in islamabad to oust the sitting government and presented points to create a naya pakistan pti s entrance as the ruling party came at a time when the country was going through a crisis while the governments of pml n and ppp had not been completely honest with the people their era was not economically unstable the general perception of nawaz sharif is that he provided avenues for the business community to flourish imran khan on the other hand is making it difficult for the business community to survive perhaps the pti government must implement a cohesive monetary policy or a fiscal policy with a far reaching positive impact on the economy then there is the case of rising inflation that has badly affected economic progress at the micro and the macro levels analysts have observed a stark difference in the reduction of purchasing parity among the middle and the lower middle class ever since imran khan came to power according to a research report published in pakistan s leading media group the trade deficit was an issue during 2003 and 2004 the period under general musharraf however this trade deficit increased exponentially during the era of pml n interestingly there was an increase in imports and exports during ppp s era the imf however has blamed the policies of pml n and pti for damaging the economy the executive board of the imf while giving a 6 billion bailout package to pakistan in july 2019 said misaligned economic policies including large fiscal deficits loose monetary policy and defence of an overvalued exchange rate fuelled consumption and short term growth in recent years but steadily eroded macroeconomic buffers increased external and public debt and depleted international reserves this goes to show that the pti did not rectify the economic problems it inherited from its predecessor but only worsened it according to the world bank the gross domestic product gdp of pakistan slowed to 3 3 in fiscal year fy 2019 the stabilization measures taken by the government brought a 2 2 point decline as compared to the previous year the current account deficit reduced to us 13 5 billion 4 8 of gdp in fy19 to us 19 9 billion 6 3 of gdp in fy18 this was because of a decline in goods import by 7 4 the services imports also faced a decline by 14 9 imran khan did have a strategy to enter into the government by winning the elections he perhaps had not chalked out the strategy to lead pakistan towards prosperity pti did form the government by amassing 17 out of 104 seats in the senate 156 out of 342 seats in the national assembly but it could not translate its dreams and goals into viable action plans according to south asian voices sav pakistan had to take austerity measures because of imf s bailout program the world bank according to sav estimates that the gdp of pakistan will fall to 2 7 in 2020 the investor sentiment has also tarnished under pti s reign sav reports that direct investment inflows have shown a decline of 59 to us 73 4 million this indicates that investor confidence was high and positive during pml n s tenure

the venezuela crisis also known as the bolivarian diaspora refers to the emigration of around 4 million venezuelans around 13 of the world population out of venezuela over 20 years spanning from 1999 to present what are the causes the main reasons for such a large emigration rate are due to political corruption and issues the underdeveloped economy and the high rates of crime and diseases that are present in venezuela the bolivarian revolution launched by former president hugo chávez in 1999 enacted several policies that focused highly on creating a socialist and populist economy funded by high oil prices however his attempts backfired due to fluctuating oil prices leading to the dissolving of many companies due to low revenue and the flourishing of the black money market due to foreign currency control according to the imf international monetary fund this has damaged the economy greatly causing hyperinflation with the estimated rate of 10 000 000 by the end of 2019 additionally due to the high rates of corruption present the crime rates have increased drastically with a judicial system ranked one of the worst in the world creating change at the political level in venezuela is also becoming increasingly difficult as the political divide deepens between juan guaidó and nikolas maduro maduro was elected as president in 2013 and was re elected in 2018 however this recent election was deemed controversial as reports of vote rigging and bribing were recorded due to this guaidó the head of the national assembly assumed the presidency according to article 233 and 333 of their constitution which gave him the right to do so this has led to a political divide as many countries recognize guaidó as the legitimate president while many recognize maduro the conflict of interests between guaidó and maduro makes it virtually impossible to create change at the political level how does it affect the countries around due to the varying issues present in venezuela a large number of emigrants have left seeking a better life in many latin american countries such as columbia peru chile brazil ecuador and argentina along with mexico and the us many countries especially in latin america are hosting huge numbers of immigrants according to unchr statistics colombia accounts for some 1 3 million followed by peru with 768 000 chile with 288 000 ecuador with 263 000 argentina with 130 000 and brazil with 96 000 immigrants this has led to an overload of immigrants and a huge lack of resources available to them the resources present in latin american countries are spread thin as they welcome large flocks of immigrants each day and attempt to integrate them as part of the country many venezuelans choose to stay in the border states of their host countries in the hope that if the situation seems to reverse in venezuela they might return home however this is unlikely considering the extent to which venezuela is currently suffering how can the situation be alleviated the root of all the economic and social problems apparent in venezuela is partly due to the political divide therefore if the political divide is alleviated and either morado or guaidó is recognized as the legitimate president the amending of other problems will follow once the political problem is solved the economy can begin to improve this can be done by using oil revenues to invest in other industries to battle the fluctuating gas prices and by replacing bolivars with another stable currency to battle inflation due to the low value of bolivars by investing in other industries venezuela can boost the economy greatly and start paying off the national debt additionally by replacing bolivars with a well established currency the economy will be stabilized as the value of the currency in venezuela will go up once the economy is stabilized and hyperinflation is reduced the rate of crime will naturally go down what can we do to help although there is not much we can do to solve the root of the crisis in venezuela we can still contribute in some way a great way to contribute is to donate to any of the large numbers of ngos that are actively helping mitigate the situation some examples would be the red cross pan american health organization giving children hope etc the unhcr the united nations refugee agency website is also a great way to learn more about and donate to the cause lastly spread awareness the more people that are educated about the topic the better

question mr armstrong i just finished reading the repo report i understand why you are reluctant to discuss this publicly when no one else seems to understand what is taking place i was referred to it by a friend who is on the board of another company he informed me that many regard you as the best analyst of all time because you have actually been in the trenches we have no respect for academics in our company they are always wrong and qualify their forecasts as all things remaining equal i respect that you have actually worked at high levels my question is this do you think you will be able to assist central banks in avoiding such a meltdown rh answer i wish i could answer that question in a positive manner unfortunately in this instance the epicenter is outside the domestic jurisdictions of even the federal reserve to avoid this crisis it will require political action not just central banks thus i do not believe anyone can avoid this mess because it is being driven by politics which would require a major shift in thinking to accomplish that history warns we must first experience the crisis before any politicians would ever act if you look closely at the minutes of the last fed meeting there was the unanimous opinion that interest rates would not be lowered in 2020 the free market is pushing rates higher the fed was being bullied to lower rates just before the september repo crisis hit when the repo crisis erupted the fed could no longer entertain lowering interest rates when the free market was raising them the fed had a private meeting with trump to explain he had to stop the talk of negative interest rates even if the fed called me in and gave me dictatorial powers over domestic policy there is nothing i could do the prevent this crisis because it is outside the united states which is spreading and has become a cancer that threatens the global economy the fed has rejected negative interest rates for a very good reason i have warned that europe s negative interest rates has undermined the euro as a reserve currency central banks do not want to hold euros for they are being taxed by the ecb to even hold euros even the head of jp morgan s ceo jamie dimon came out and stated that the jury is still out on the viability of negative interest rates jamie dimon summed up the repo crisis in september saying that banks have a tremendous amount of liquidity but also have a tremendous amount of restraints on how they use that liquidity referring to the rules under basel iii additionally china agreed to a trade deal as did trump because of the repo crisis there are far bigger fish to worry about here than the nonsense of trade the fact that people have not connected the dots between the two is amazing i am glad you understand the crisis i have laid out in this report i am the only analyst who understands it appears because i have worked with institutions for nearly 40 years these people come up with all sorts of conspiracy theories and claim this is helicopter money to just quantitative easing in both circumstances those theories were predicated upon a recession depression which meant classic keynesianism was being applied to increase the quantity of money to stimulate the economy but unemployment is back to 1960s levels and the economy is ok they just spout out the same nonsense they have done since 2007 without ever noticing that qe was buying long term debt because central banks do not control the long end of the curve central banks have dominated the short term interest rates so when the repo rate shot to 10 that exposed the fact that the central banks are losing control of even the short term rates i warned that there had been a destruction of the bond markets and i did a video interview on that when i was in germany last year which was published in april 2019 i warned about the liquidity crisis and basel iii which has also contributed to creating the current repo crisis i also warned that we would enter a liquidity crisis come september beyond that i must be cautious with this crisis because it is the mother of all financial crises and it seems only professionals even grasp the crisis i have contacts at the very core of the marketplace who see this coming but cannot speak due to confidentiality agreements the best i can do is keep it to a private service for the time being i really do not have any choice the implications can be too great and too broad it is not something that will affect just repo that is simply where it begins we are talking about a crisis that will dominate the next 8 6 year business cycle because this involves governments they will search desperately for someone else to blame the way they operate is stark and blunt because governments will never accept responsibility for disrupting the global economy they accused me of manipulating the world economy and the commodity futures trading commission tried to subpoena me for a list of all our clients worldwide i had to defend against them in court and prevailed ironically because there is no law against manipulating the world economy and that is just a joke so please respect with this one i just need to be cautious i can only discus that in a limited service
open this photo in gallery plutocrats the rise of the new global super rich and the fall of everyone else helped propel its author chrystia freeland seen here on dec 10 2019 to the second highest position in canadian government carlos jasso reuters let s start the year with a question have you experienced progress are you better off today than in the first days of 2010 your own answer might be complicated but most people would have to answer yes in canada most families are at least somewhat better off than they were a decade ago more so than in the united states worldwide most are significantly better off this was the third consecutive decade during which poverty shrunk dramatically while living standards health and peace improved significantly more important though is a second question do you believe in progress here i feel confident you ll find fewer people answering in the affirmative compared to previous decades people today especially older people are less likely to believe that things are getting better or that it s worth spending public money to promote upward mobility when people don t believe in it they can make it vanish one of the defining trends of this historical moment is the election of leaders and parties who reject social progress and human betterment as goals some on the nationalist right in the united states brazil russia and other countries want to turn the clock back to some idealized better time using policies that protect existing privilege there s also an anti progressive left seen in the shambolic rise of corbynism in britain which would rather coddle and preserve an imaginary working class than give its members the tools to become secure in the middle class progress is not a feature of nature as with most human accomplishments it is something that only exists and succeeds if we believe in it and devote resources to it the enormous human improvements of the past half century were the result of explicit choices this could be jeopardized by defeatist ideologies in the 2010s many came to believe that progress itself has become an impossibility others including scholars who ignored modern history claimed that it has never existed the old belief that your lot in life is predetermined by genetics or choices or inevitable structures of market economies escaped the dustbin of history and took on an unsavoury new life in the hands of people alarmingly close to the levers of power if one intellectual concept defined the 2010s it was economic inequality the 2010s began with mass demonstrations and occupations aimed at the 1 per cent those protests shifted government priorities beneficially in the united states and europe at least for a couple of years french economist thomas piketty became a literary celebrity deservedly for his ingenious book capital in the twenty first century which proved that income growth for the very wealthy was bound to exceed that of anyone else absent state interventions another impressive book on that phenomenon plutocrats the rise of the new global super rich and the fall of everyone else was influential enough to help propel its author chrystia freeland to the second highest position in canadian government this worthy but limited focus on the social immobility of billionaires the unlikelihood that their grandchildren will wind up less than filthy rich obscured the more important question one that affects hundreds of millions of people what are the prospects for the poor to rise to the middle what stands in their way while vastly less widely read than those bestsellers one of the decade s most impressive large scale studies was published in 2018 by the organization for economic co operation and development under the title a broken social elevator while it partly focused on the sticky ceilings caused by the opportunity hoarding of the already prosperous and suggested that tax policy should be used to unstick those ceilings it saw a lot more promise in cleaning up the sticky floors that make it difficult for the children of low income families to enter a middle class life of financial security and independence if the rags to riches pathway remains an inaccessible eye of the needle the bottom to middle escalator is still a workable device although its state of repair varies from country to country in canada the oecd found it takes an average of four generations for a low income family to become securely middle class that s better than the united states or britain where it takes five but worse than denmark where it takes just two

the warning signs are clear debt is rising on every continent and especially in the business sector which has spent the past decade ramping up its borrowing to previously unheard of levels last october the international monetary fund said that almost 40 of the corporate debt in eight leading countries the us china japan germany britain france italy and spain would become so expensive during a recession that it would be impossible to service in other words tens of thousands of businesses employing millions of people would have gambled with high levels of borrowing and lost making themselves insolvent worse the imf said the risks were elevated in eight out of 10 countries that boasted systemically important financial sectors adding that this situation was a repeat of the years running up to the last financial crisis last month the world bank joined in it said emerging market and developing economies emdes had pushed their borrowing to a record 55 trillion 42tn in 2018 unlike the richer nations already mentioned the 100 emdes across africa asia and south america covered by the report were affected by rising private sector debt coupled with higher government borrowing and this extra state borrowing is not only larger it has also changed in character first it has gone from being largely directed to investment spending to more recently being used simply to cope with the costs of health education and welfare second it is being more commonly borrowed from international investors hungry to lend developing countries cash at relatively speaking sky high rates of interest there is little evidence that anyone is paying any attention to the dire misgivings expressed by either organisation this year the us s p 500 stock market resumed its long term 100 year upward trend following a near 200 increase since 2010 likewise the german dax has soared over the past 10 years from 5 500 to over 13 000 while the paris cac 40 has almost doubled to 6 000 britain s main market in shares has struggled to make any headway over the past three years while brexit uncertainty dominated yet the ftse 100 shows a gain from less than 4 000 in 2009 to 7 600 today some analysts have argued that the imf and world bank are over cooking their analysis after missing the last financial crash seeing danger around every corner others dismiss them as archaic remnants of the postwar consensus that fail to understand how the global economy has entered a new phase one that keeps stock markets humming along and bad recessions at bay without higher interest rates everyone can keep merrily borrowing in the short term at least the optimists could be right and that is largely down to the actions of the us central bank which was on course to repeat the mistake of 2005 07 when it matched rising debt levels especially in sub prime mortgage loans with rising interest rates triggering the kind of financial crash that the imf and world bank now fear is around the corner this time the federal reserve retreated after pushing base rates to almost 2 5 still well short of the pre crash normality of 4 5 but higher than almost everywhere else after three rate cuts last year the us economy starts 2020 with the base rate back in a range between 1 5 and 1 75 without higher interest rates everyone can keep merrily borrowing and when for most businesses borrowing rates remain below their potential income growth rate even when that is lacklustre there is not the usual imperative to boost growth through investment in order to afford higher debt repayments but really this is a back to front way of discussing the issue most of the problems afflicting the global economy relate to a lack of demand for goods and services at least on average compared with the years prior to the 2008 crash and much of the weak demand relates to our ageing populations which in the main focus more on storing up savings for retirement than on spending they are also in the habit of voting for governments that promise to keep taxes low and property prices high allowing them to accumulate even more wealth donald trump and boris johnson fit that bill through their pensions and private investments they treat companies like cash machines demanding a higher dividend every six months much of the borrowing by companies has been to pay these dividends not to invest baby boomers will pretty much all have retired by the end of this new decade so most will have stopped investing and just be withdrawing investment funds and it is this turn of the wheel of fortune that will wreck the global economy if the accumulation of debt and the climate crisis haven t got there first

islamabad pakistan s debt market has so far fetched 1 468 billion and 10 million from abroad through the short term treasury bills t bills and pakistan investment bonds pibs respectively at higher markup rates just on the pattern of egyptian model 1 468 billion foreign funding has been attracted into short term t bills when the policy rates are continuously kept at 13 25 percent it is feared that when the policy rates will be eased down in the country then this money will fly out of pakistan in search of another destination so it can create a peculiar situation at any point of time independent economists have severely criticised this move for luring hot money at expensive rates that is tantamount to harming domesticinvestment and economic activities by keeping discount rate on the higher side the bulk of foreign money into t bills has come from the uk and the usa to the tune of 746 million and 663 million respectively top official sources said while quoting data from the state bank of pakistan sbp on friday when this reporter contacted former finance minister and renowned economist dr hafeez a pasha on friday he said he said there was no justification to attract hot money at the expense of discouraging private sector investment he said higher policy rate was also playing havoc with budgetary estimates and increasing debt servicing requirements he said instead of luring hot money the government should launch eurobond that could be materialized at cheaper rates than the existing rate for attracting money into short term debt market inflationary expectations have been cited as a major cause for keeping the policy rate on the higher side however the inflation stood at 12 63 percent but the core inflation has started receding and now come down from 8 percent to 7 5 percent for december 2019 when core inflation non food non energy stands at 7 5 percent there is no justification to keep overall policy rate at 13 25 percent said the official and added that the higher policy rate was only meant to attract hot money from abroad the government has now brought amendment through presidential ordinance known as tax laws second amendment ordinance 2019 for streamlining investments from nonresidents into debt market on the other hand the sbp officials do not agree to certain assumptions and argued that the foreign portfolio was friction of overall investment so the central bank could not be held responsible for protecting friction part of over 1 billion as sole reasons for keep policy rates on higher side explaining reasons for amendments through ordinance the fbr states that the existing foreign exchange framework of the country allows non residents to invest in debt securities and government securities through special convertible rupee accounts scra s maintained with banks in pakistan there is no restriction on repatriation of funds from scra s which incentivizes investment in the local debt market by non resident investors several amendments for encouraging investment in the local debt market and simplifying the tax regime for non resident companies have been introduced which are summarized hereunder i capital gains emanating from the disposal of debt instruments and government securities including treasury bills and pakistan investment bonds to non resident companies not having a permanent establishment in pakistan who have made investments in such debt instruments securities exclusively through a special convertible rupee account scra maintained with a bank in pakistan shall be subject to withholding

instruments securities through scra maintained with a bank in pakistan iii special convertible rupee accounts scra being maintained by non resident companies having no permanent establishment in pakistan shall be exempt from collection of advance tax on banking transactions otherwise than through cash under section 236 p of the ordinance iv a non resident company having no permanent

in about four years paul jereczek hopes to be harvesting hazelnuts from the 1 000 bushes he planted on his family s farm in the trempealeau county village of dodge mark hoffman milwaukee journal sentinel paul jereczek doesn t want to be the one who loses his family s farm not after four generations before him made it work he and his father ken milk about 200 cows on land in trempealeau county that s been in the family since 1873 the last few years have been challenging and not just because milk prices have been stuck in an economic valley the jereczeks have difficulties finding hired help too which means the barn and the fields take over what could be family time the dairyland in distress series is produced with the support of the pulitzer center the center a nonprofit organization that supports in depth journalism projects played no role in the reporting editing or presentation of the project learn more five or 10 years from now i don t think we will be milking cows anymore realistically the 35 year old farmer said financially we are fine but i have four young children who i don t spend nearly enough time with jereczek is trying to build a bridge to the future even as he crosses it he has planted more than 1 000 hazelnut trees on 3 acres previously used to grow hay a small piece of the farm that someday could pay off well if the perennial crop takes hold worldwide turkey and italy dominate the hazelnut industry domestically oregon has more than 800 growers who produced nearly all of the u s crop valued at 92 million in 2018 more on the future of dairy hybrids have been developed that thrive in a northern climate and are hardy enough to survive wisconsin winters it costs jereczek about 5 a tree to plant them and there s nothing to harvest until at least the third or fourth year which for him is still a couple of years away but because it takes a while the marketplace could be less vulnerable to crashing from everyone jumping in at the same time the university of wisconsin and university of minnesota are collaborating on a million hazelnut campaign to plant 1 million trees across the upper midwest they estimated in 2017 the annual net income from fully mature hazelnut trees at between 3 400 and 4 200 an acre further the roots systems prevent erosion don t need irrigation and are drought resistant is it going to save the farm that s the best case scenario but i m not banking on it yet jereczek said still he remains hopeful his family s future will unfold on the farm where he grew up and returned to after studying english at the university of wisconsin river falls i want my kids to have a chance to do something with the land agriculturally and i don t see dairy being it at this level he said wisconsin has billed itself as america s dairyland for nearly a century but with industrial farms on the rise its next generation of children may never know what it s like to see red barns and brown swiss cattle in pastures on hillsides dairy farmers are pretty exhausted mentally trying to figure out how to survive said angie sullivan agriculture program supervisor with the wisconsin farm center part of the state agriculture department where farmers can get help untangling their finances and managing stress many are also asking themselves whether surviving is enough whether an operation of 50 100 even 200 cows is still the best use of their land and talent this year alone about 800 dairy farmers in wisconsin left the business a rate of more than two per day many had small family farms they joined an exodus from dairy that has sped up in recent years but has gone on for decades some of those farmers are now growing cattle feed for large dairy operations some are raising beef cattle a few have carved out niches that were a surprise even to them one of three of paul jereczek s part time employees pushes feed for dairy cows on the family farm in the trempealeau county village of dodge wis mark hoffman

dairy cows for weddings class reunions maybe a christmas or retirement party his manure storage pit is long gone it s a fishing pond now every day for about 15 years rohland and his family milked cows and tended to their farm in clark county where cattle outnumber people 4 to 1 they grew fruit on land not used for cattle feed there were good times in dairy but they were always followed by low milk prices or poor weather for growing crops it was hard relentless work rohland then in his 40s had metal pins and screws in his hands and ankles the result of farm injuries as time went on it seemed like it was always an uphill battle he said with his children grown up and off the farm and his optimism about the future of small dairy operations drained rohland sold his cows relying on off farm jobs for several years he and his wife sheri turned their wine making hobby into a full time business munson bridge winery some people thought we were nuts rohland said there weren t any wineries in the area but the rohlands had seen wineries in other parts of the state that were so tucked away in the hills they could barely be found and those were packed with customers so they gave it a spin

wheat state and for more than 150 years parts of wisconsin have grown chewing tobacco a small acreage crop that farmers used to say was their mortgage payment because of its profitability in the 1960s there was a large loss of dairy farms after the industry transitioned to refrigerated bulk tanks for collecting milk replacing 10 gallon steel cans farming has been evolving since its very beginning

issues a trade war with china the european union or mexico can upend business for months even years at a time given that volatility one thing seems certain the small dairy farm from 10 years ago won t be around in another 10 years if it doesn t keep evolving said brody stapel a dairy farmer from cedar grove and president of edge dairy farmer cooperative adaptability stapel says is the key wisconsin still produces more cheese than any other state more even than most countries but in the last few years thousands of dairy farmers have lost money practically every day they ve milked their cows year round as an oversupplied market has kept prices depressed many farms milking between 50 and 100 cows are at risk of shutting down because they don t benefit from economies of scale as much as i love small dairy farms we don t have very many automobile manufacturers that build 400 cars a year we did at one time said jack britt a dairy consultant and professor emeritus at north carolina state university so should dairy farmers move to a new enterprise yes but only if they are innovative and willing to learn new methods and systems i don t think there is a single crop or area that could replace dairy but the opportunities are broad if one focuses on the end market or the emerging markets can you co exist with a walmart the question for many wisconsin farmers then is how to get from point a to point b i would never suggest abandoning the family farm said gov tony evers i think it s still a great possibility a great job for folks people who raise their kids on farms will vouch for that evers grew up in plymouth a town once surrounded by scores of dairy farms these were good farm families he said they worked hard and were able to make money we need to get back to that time the problem is farmers have been getting a milk price similar to what it was 30 years ago expenses are very much up to date smaller dairies can still survive but only if their operating costs are low enough or they have a unique product that fetches a higher price said steven deller an agricultural economist at the university of wisconsin madison it s like can you co exist with a walmart yes you can but you have to change one of the best ways make sure there are off farm employment opportunities deller said it keeps the family afloat and therefore it keeps the farm afloat as farmers try new paths not wanting to exit dairy but disillusioned with milking cows some farmers have switched to goats this year according to the most recent u s department of agriculture data wisconsin leads the nation with more than 72 000 dairy goats easily topping california which came in second with 40 000 followed by iowa and minnesota worldwide goat milk is more popular than cow milk and it s gained ground in the u s with a changing consumer marketplace and immigrants accustomed to its taste farmers should be mindful of these kinds of societal adjustments britt said and develop products that respond to them not too many years ago it was generally accepted that small breweries would disappear as large beer makers kept growing taking control of the marketplace then said jack uldrich a futurist from minneapolis there was this explosion of microbreweries diversification key this year with 8 8 million in state funding three uw system schools platteville river falls and madison launched plans for a dairy innovation hub that s expected to create an advanced dairy management academy and improve labs and farms devoted to research the hub is looking out 10 or 20 years on substantial innovations for the industry said scott rankin chairman of the food science department at uw madison the small and medium size producer is on everybody s mind in these discussions uw platteville has a 400 acre research farm with a 200 cow dairy herd it s installing robotic milking machines so that dairy science students can learn by using the latest technologies we are not going to come in and save the farms ourselves but we are going to help them with the intellectual support they need and we re going to be the source of the workforce the people who will manage these farms said shields of uw platteville i think we should be america s dairyland and other things he said the chancellor said there wasn t much that could be done about small dairy farms already lost we can t sort of resurrect them but we can make the future dairy farmers much more adaptable and responsive to the cycles in the industry wisconsin evers says needs a diverse agricultural base that includes farms of all sizes the state ranks first in the nation for snap beans cranberries and ginseng third in potatoes and fifth in cherries in our state one of the few areas making progress monetarily is fruits and vegetables the governor said not everybody can have an orchard that s for sure but i think we need to help all farmers diversify as much as possible at the same time wisconsin leaders have continued to invest heavily in dairy even sending trade missions to china and vietnam to promote products they may be encouraging diversification but they re not walking away from a 45 billion industry dairy cows graze in cochrane scenes like this will become less frequent in the future in wisconsin mark hoffman milwaukee journal sentinel searching for new revenue streams steve kelm a dairy science professor at the university of wisconsin river falls said he s confident dairy farmers will develop new revenue streams inside and outside the industry in california that was almond trees walnut trees and grapes in the central valley wisconsin is going to be similar in that regard whether it s ginseng and things adapted to our environment or berries or raising dairy beef cattle kelm said already some of the state s biggest livestock farms are moving into energy production by converting manure into renewable gas smaller farms are diversifying out of commodities markets and into areas such as dairy cattle genetics raising young animals for bigger farms and producing specialty milk for artisan cheese plants they re looking at raising alternative crops that are on the rise such as hemp looking further into the future wisconsin may be helped by climate change the biggest impact of climate change is going to be the availability of water britt said our forecast is that dairy is going to move north to places that have plenty of it leading dairy states such as california new mexico texas and arizona will have difficulties getting enough water great lakes states including wisconsin minnesota and new york will be magnets for growth that growth however would have to be managed and safe some of the nation s largest dairy farms known as concentrated animal feeding operations or cafos are in the west one of them in oregon is licensed for 70 000 cattle read the stories of dairy farms that shut down in 2019 read more the average size of a wisconsin dairy farm is about 150 cows but that number is rising because the number of cafos in the state has jumped 55 in less than a decade to 279 farms with so many cattle industrial scale farms run the risk of contaminating groundwater and overwhelming lakes rivers and streams with runoff manure and fertilizer pollution rural water well contamination is under growing scrutiny in wisconsin there s going to be a natural push by the public and the government to insist that we don t contaminate our groundwater britt said cows themselves also will change dairy cows of the future will be a milk producing powerhouse the result of crossbreeding and gene editing they will have implantable microscopic sensors to monitor their health and well being the data will be integrated with information gathered across an entire farmstead down to the bacteria in soil where cattle feed grows farmers will be able to use epigenetics in which specific livestock genes are turned on or off to trigger changes in the animal s biology robots and automated systems will do much of the routine work on farms 50 years from now this will benefit cows because they crave consistency britt said dairy farms of the future could even produce specialty milks that are therapeutic for cancer patients or the elderly already some genetically engineered cows are being used to manufacture human antibodies that could someday be used to treat infectious diseases like ebola and influenza give yourself permission to think differently about the future uldrich said the one thing i say as a futurist is if your idea doesn t sound crazy you re not thinking hard enough if it sounds plausible it s already happening in the netherlands the world s first floating dairy farm has been launched in an urban area where rising sea levels have made farmland prone to flooding the three story raft with glass sides is home to 32 cows its electricity is generated from floating solar panels and drinking water comes from a rainwater collection system the cows can move freely from their stalls to an area where they re milked by robots when tides allow it they can cross a bridge to a dock and pasture according to farminguk a british publication three companies behind the project are considering a floating chicken farm and greenhouse aimed at providing fresh food for local markets as well a nuisance becomes a moneymaker the move into energy production is a classic example of a new revenue stream emerging from a chronic problem in this case what to do with the prodigious amount of manure created on livestock farms large scale dairy farms are harnessing methane in manure and selling it as an alternative to traditional natural gas for years some farmers with anaerobic digesters there are currently about 40 operating in wisconsin have tapped the naturally occurring gases in waste to generate electricity selling what they didn t need to utilities the shift to renewable gas also called biogas is being driven by federal and state incentives and in some cases subsidies once the methane is pumped into an interstate pipeline it s considered a renewable fuel burning renewable gas rather than allowing the methane to float into the atmosphere has appeal to companies that need to meet carbon reduction mandates or want to shrink their carbon footprint j j pagel hands in the air of pagel s ponderosa a

event space at his white pine berry farm outside river falls mark hoffman milwaukee journal sentinel zwald was a partner with his brother in a dairy operation that expanded to 600 cows and was doing well but they didn t agree on how family members would enter the business and it caused friction i decided it was better that i leave rather than try to push my way my thoughts zwald said now he and his wife irma own white pine berry farm which sells fruits and vegetables to the general public they also have a corn maze and pumpkin patch in the fall there was some culture shock going from running a large dairy farm to managing a pick your own berries operation you ve got to like people and you have to assume that some of them are going to step on your berries but one of our goals is to get kids families to the farm so they understand this is where their food comes from zwald said starting over wasn t easy financially it s been kind of break even but this year was good and we re adding a

milwaukee journal sentinel challenging times wisconsin s remaining dairy farm families are remarkably resilient they weathered the great depression and the milk strikes of 1933 they ve toughed it out through numerous downturns recessions poor crop years trade disputes i wouldn t bet against anyone who for the last four years has gotten up at 5 a m on christmas day to milk cows and provide for their family the best they can said kelm of uw river falls what s been different about the recent downturn has been its duration five years and its severity the highest number of dairy farm losses in wisconsin on a percentage basis going all the way back to the great depression wisconsin s dairy crisis in 6 charts read more i think a lot of farmers have already made the choice to quit they are going to milk cows until their feed is gone and then they re done said travis tranel a dairy farmer and republican state representative from cuba city it s been a challenge and the next six months could possibly be the biggest challenge it s going to be a long time until may tranel said he s particularly bothered when he hears that young people don t want to farm anymore that could not be further from the truth they want to farm but they just can t afford it said tranel whose family has a 600 cow organic dairy the loss of dairy farms is especially noticeable in southwest wisconsin drive around any of these smaller towns the banks are closing the car dealerships are closing tranel said as i drive by those red barns i always smile and think those were the good old days when a mom and a dad probably raised five or 10 kids in that house on 150 acres and they milked 40 cows as those barns come down my kids aren t even going to know that s what wisconsin used to look like the losses could have far reaching consequences beyond rural communities the success of this nation is because pretty much nobody has to worry about where their food comes from he said if we have gotten to the point where the very people who have made us successful can no longer pay their bills i think we really have to question if that s ok as a society i hope that we don t find it acceptable can you survive the dairy crisis explore the forces affecting a signature wisconsin industry by navigating through common scenarios faced by dairy farmers complete the challenge hopeful for the future some might think that what jereczek has done planting hazelnut trees goes against the grain of wisconsin dairy tradition but the jereczeks understand tradition paul s great great grandfather jacob jereczek moved to trempealeau county in the early 1860s from poland after the civil war he and his sons bought three farms and were among the first immigrant families to settle in the area paul and ken have kept the farm current investing in technology such as automatic calf feeders and health monitoring devices that are attached to the cows ankles they understand that every generation in farming has its challenges but the record amount of rainfall this year which kept farmers out of the fields for spring planting and ruined some of the harvest reminded paul why he planted hazelnut trees a crop that keeps on giving year after year once it gets started i am hopeful he said i think it s a worthwhile investment he s recycling dirty livestock bedding from the dairy to fertilize the trees the worst case scenario if the market for hazelnuts in wisconsin fails to materialize i will have a bunch of nuts to feed to the cattle he said these days a dairy farmer can t afford to waste

pipeline nip with projects worth 102 lakh crore has been a good idea but a lot depends on its implementation if not implemented properly the nip announced recently to ensure timely implementation of infra projects across 18 states and union territories over the next five years can spark off inflation this apart budget 2020 should look at better fiscal and monetary policy integration so that there is a boost in demand the agricultural sector has been severely affected a rate cut basu maintained can boost demand in the short run the political situation over here has become very very divisive and we have to hold it together not by force but yes i m worried about what that division is doing to the economy and once institutions erode that is a long term problem he said on the sidelines of a ficci event organised in the city basu further maintained higher education institutions in india must encourage free thinking there will be different ideas and the country must allow different opinions to be aired hyper nationalism is also not good he however clarified that hyper nationalism in india is not linked to economic policies like the us where the latter is raising tariffs or blocking people from coming in and so on rather here it is a kind of divisiveness that erodes trust and a sense of belonging the economist s comments come at a time when anti citizenship amendment act protests not just by political parties but also by common people have forced the centre on a back foot debt wave to top it all india s growth has slowed down and if it is hit by a global debt wave that the world bank has warned of then it could be a bad shock the world bank data is quite persuasive that the global debt build up is very large when the debt collapses there are two ways in which the country can be hit if the country is very integrated globally which india is now it will get hit but india has another thing it s economy is already doing poorly and the world bank is giving a bit of a warning that if an economy is doing badly and a debt wave hits then it gets sucked in so we india have to be careful basu maintained the world bank has recently put out a statement where it has warned that a wave of debt in emerging and developing economies has grown faster and larger than in any period of the last five decades this could end with another crisis if the wave breaks it could be more damaging since it would engulf private companies in addition to governments at a time when economic growth is sluggish debt in emerging and developing economies climbed to a record 55 trillion in 2018 marking an eight year surge a new world bank group study said the analysis is contained in global waves of debt a comprehensive study of the four major episodes of debt accumulation that have occurred in more than 100 countries since 1970 it found that debt to gdp ratio of developing countries has climbed 54 percentage points to 168 per cent since the debt buildup began in 2010 on average that ratio has risen by about seven percentage points a year that is three times as fast it did during the latin america debt crisis of the 1970s the increase moreover has been exceptionally broad based involving government as well as private debt and observable in virtually all regions across the world slowing economy basu maintained that india is going through a very difficult economic phase and a 4 50 per cent growth is atrocious if you look beyond the 4 50 per cent there are indicators that things can go even worse in the immediate run he added one of the biggest problems is unemployment basu said and there is also a slowdown in the rural sector this could be hurting consumption across the country other indicators like slowing automobile consumption and production and also reduced growth in electricity consumption show the strain two primary reasons for this slowdown demonetisation and a poorly implemented gst basu gives credit to the current political disposition for pushing through gst and the insolvency and bankruptcy code but the haste in implementing gst saw small businesses take a hit on the other hand demonetisation was a bad idea and the government should have declared that it to be a policy mistake ideally the effects of demonetisation should not have lingered on for so long but basu points out that post demonetisation the agricultural sector went through a phase where production has taken place but buying power has collapsed so suddenly the farmers are suffering and they are unable to sell what could have happened is that farmers got into an indebtedness problem they kept borrowing in a cycle and probably that has fed into the agricultural sector he pointed out
by jerry hicks sales and business development manager the perth mint ongoing instability and uncertainty in global markets will likely drive the price of gold upward and support demand which we are already seeing of the market influencers it seems that trade tensions are at the core with prolonged and unresolved negotiations undermining business confidence and market sentiment gaining significant attention beyond that are heightened concerns regarding further interest rate cuts and the plunge in global bond yields what we are also hearing now are increasing reports of a recession underpinned by fears that us equity markets are overvalued in addition due concern also surrounds brexit and its implications for the broader eu the potential impact of political unrest and fiscal volatility in countries across south east asia and europe plus the rise of greater division and instability in the middle east looking specifically at the perth mint in terms of current levels of gold demand this world leading mint sold more gold bullion coins in september than any other month this past year the greatest drivers for this demand were the introduction of the 2020 australian bullion coin program including the third twelve year australian lunar investor series combined with the advanced release of its signature australian kangaroo gold bullion series overall it exports close to usd13 billion each year in precious metal bars and coins in addition as far as its physical gold etf aaau is tracking global gold investment demand is currently biased to the upside so it is a time of acquisition with aaau trading for only a little over a year in a rallying market for gold it is generating an increasing daily average of share buying and investor interest in august for example aaau reached a milestone of 150 million in net assets growing to more than 165 million to the year end 31 october while individual investors buying gold etfs represents a much larger flow into gold than that of central banks it is the buying by central banks that sends an inherent buy now signal to the market at large with astute investors thereby asking if central banks are diversifying their monetary reserves should i be doing the same net buying of gold by central banks has been at the highest level since richard nixon abandoned the gold standard in 1971 led by china russia and poland central banks across the globe bought more than 570 tonnes of gold last year this strong demand continued in the first quarter of this calendar year with total purchases reaching in excess of 180 tonnes up 116 year on year as the year comes to a close we keep a keen eye on the us political landscape president trump s friendly business policies and tax cuts certainly have taken the edge off any strong impetus to push gold significantly higher than where it is at the moment if the impeachment proceedings go forward that will certainly have an effect but there s no doubt the president is going

economists executives and investors are reading the 2020 tea leaves with heightened scrutiny in an effort to divine what this year holds for the u s economy and for ordinary americans here are the events they say are most likely to impact and potentially reshape our economic trajectory the u s presidential election economists say if the 2020 election leads to a divided government like the current one little will change in a meaningful way for businesses and investors if a single party ends up controlling the white house and both chambers of congress though the economic impact could be greater equity markets have traditionally performed better under democrats than republicans when you average it out on a long term basis which defies what most people believe are facts but financial markets are terrified of the far left wing of the democratic party said joseph heider president of cirrus wealth management if elizabeth warren or bernie sanders look like they could be the nominee of the democratic party i think that could have very negative impact on financial markets both of these candidates pledges to rein in big companies and raise taxes on corporations and the wealthy would hit banking finance and tech sectors areas that buoyed indexes in 2019 especially hard you never know what would happen but i don t think that would be a positive outcome for the financial markets said heider if the republicans take back the house and maintain control of the senate and we have a second term for president donald trump i think we get a second round of tax cuts said brad mcmillan chief investment officer for commonwealth financial network he argued though that a democratic president and congress wouldn t be as destabilizing as some market observers fear on one hand taxes go up everyone assumes it s going to kill the economy but remember government spending is also going to go up significantly he said net net it s a much better result than people are thinking trade tensions with and beyond china although the president announced on tuesday that he would sign a phase one trade deal between the u s and china at the white house on jan 15 this by no means takes worries about tariffs and supply chain disruptions off the table experts say especially with the u s withdrawing from large multilateral agreements and ceding its position as de facto leader in global trade the real thing that s going to change the world over the next decade is the u s is no longer the mainstay of the global free trading system mcmillan said as we look forward into 2020 i think the trade wars are either resolved or they accelerate we ll have to see how that unfolds heider said although great britain is not a major trading partner of the u s brexit also could be potentially disruptive particularly if the country leaves the european union without a plan in place those are both unknowns he added a number of market observers express doubt that the current truce between the u s and china is more than a pause and suggest that real or threatened tariffs could continue to cast a chill on business investment in 2020 i wouldn t be surprised if those tariffs came back into play said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america if the white house revisits its recently rescinded plan to levy sanctions on nearly all consumer goods coming from china spending and confidence would drop that s where it will hurt the economy north predicted in the past trump has pulled back from nearly complete trade deals over the perception of being unfairly treated and could very well do so again observers note the vast majority of the phase one is really centered on agriculture but the question remains what s the enforceability mechanism here it s really unclear at this point said lindsey piegza chief economist at stifel fixed income beijing has pledged to operate more fairly but whether or not that promise is kept remains to be seen piegza said they have time and time again promised to crack down on that with no positive outcomes which could derail the prospect of a more significant deal in the future the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies facebook s introduction of its libra cryptocurrency platform is a shot across the bow to gatekeepers of traditional financial and currency systems that will continue to reverberate said lawrence white an economics professor at new york university s stern school of business we ll only know in the next couple of years if it turns out to be a non event but the facebook libra announcement certainly attracted a great deal of attention he said although lawmakers in the u s have broached regulations for cryptocurrency and switzerland s finance minister recently declared that libra had failed white maintained that cryptocurrencies are going to be a big topic of interest and regulatory scrutiny he pointed out that people who dismissed libra s antecedent as a passing fad were proven wrong you wouldn t have seen the facebook libra announcement had there not been the experience of and attention being paid to bitcoin he said governments are thinking how do we regulate this should we be creating our own digital currencies the existence albeit nascent of hundreds of other would be contenders in the space show that cryptocurrencies are going to grow in both visibility and real financial impact white predicted federal reserve rate setting many economists hold the view that ultra low interest rates have helped propel the bull market into unprecedented territory but that could change in 2020 the biggest risk to me is inflation and that s not a risk most people are looking at the cpi figures are starting to creep up a little more said mitchell goldberg president of clientfirst strategy i don t know if the federal reserve will be able to hold off if inflation rises in spite of the president s frequent complaints about his handpicked fed chairman jerome powell goldberg said he expected powell to respond to financial not political signals i think eventually if jerome powell needs to raise rates he will he said this has potentially market shifting implications for highly leveraged companies the corporate debt situation because of where rates are is something we have to be mindful of said john lynch chief investment strategist at lpl financial you have half the bloomberg barclays investment grade index literally a step away from junk because interest rates are so low companies have been able to take on debt loads that would otherwise overwhelm them which could happen if rates rise lynch said this could also create a downward spiral for indebted households piegza said i don t know if we ever got to the point where consumers really cleaned off their household balance sheets enough the way the u s economy has grown out of recession is by the consumer taking on new amounts of debt with corporate appetite for investment at a trough thanks to uncertainty over trade issues consumers are the primary force still keeping the economy in drive right now we re relying on the consumer in terms of discretionary purchases but already we re starting to see some red flags she said this maybe a precarious position ballooning u s debt higher interest rates also have implications for how much the u s treasury in other words taxpayers pays to service the nation s swelling debt load one thing that s remarkably forgotten at the moment is our fiscal situation in terms of deficit and debt nobody wants to talk about that right now north said if you look at the congressional budget projections the debt to gdp ratio keeps creeping up nobody has plans to cut back on the debt for all that money we re borrowing i view it like climate change said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics we know it s a problem if we don t do something about it we don t know precisely when it will be a problem or how it will manifest itself it s a big deal it s just not a big deal today zandi pointed out that the unpredictability of when where and how this will emerge as a headwind is precisely what makes it such an ominous threat at some point down the road it s going to be something that s going to weigh very heavily on the economy it s corrosive it s going to wear down the economy over time
hamish mcrae look out for 2020 s five big political and financial trends the job market is the strongest it s been since 1974 britain avoided a recession but sales and the housing market are still flat the first budget of this new administration is expected in february so what s in store for 2020 it always takes a while for seismic political shifts to feed through into our daily lives and so it is with the scale of the tory victory last month the biggest single influence for britons during the coming year will be what our new self confident government does but there is a lot else going on in the world to try to set the state of the uk in its global context here are my top five themes for the coming year the first three are domestic you have to start with the boris bounce will there be one we surely need it we avoided recession last autumn which is good but retail sales and the housing market are at best pretty flat and that feeds through to business confidence big businesses worry about great issues such as access to european markets small businesses which employ a lot more people worry about whether anyone is buying their stuff they need practical evidence of an uplift that leads to theme number two the british jobs market it has been amazingly strong and for the moment remains so but employers face a big hike in the minimum wage and while in many parts of the country they can shrug that off in other regions the 6 2 per cent rise from april onwards may be the difference between making that extra hire or not people take for granted that there are plenty of jobs and with unemployment the lowest since 1974 you can see why the mood could shift rapidly if job growth eases off so theme three what will the government do in the forthcoming budget probably in february they will spend more allowing the deficit to creep up a bit but it won t be much more and one of the things to look for will be how clever they are being at taking money from spending programmes that voters are not keen on foreign aid and shifting it over to areas which will be popular another thing will be the extent to which they can get infrastructure off the government s books we need that investment but we don t need a higher national debt so someone else should carry the risks the big point here is that the uk has got a populist government so it will try to do things that are popular with ordinary voters rather than the so called liberal elite it will be a big change but we don t know how far it will go the other two concern europe and america the eurozone economy is struggling this is bad news for the uk as europe takes more than 40 per cent of our exports but it is good news for trade negotiations meanwhile the us is close to a deal with china once that is done expect it to challenge europe and it won t just be french wine that is under attack it makes no sense to second guess what donald trump will do but we know what he said in november that europe had terrible trade barriers that were in many ways worse than china if the us cuts up rough the eu may want a friend in britain iran matters it matters because it is itself a large oil producer it matters because more than one third of the world s seaborne oil exports go through the strait of hormuz between iran and oman and it matters because of its ability to disrupt middle east oil production more generally witness its attack on saudi aramco facilities in september the political and military commentators will opine about the geopolitical consequences of aggression of iran and the killing of general soleimani and his colleagues in response to that the financial analysts are already calculating what might happen to the oil price and the dollar and which oil shares benefit most and there are fears of what this might do to the economies of the gulf states particularly if tourists stay away for the rest of us i think we simply need to be aware that serious disruption in the middle east means serious disruption to the world at best this is a drag on the prosperity of all at worst this signals the end of the long expansion that most of the world has experienced since 2010 let s hope it doesn t
03 01 2020 rethinking america must us democrats be moderates jeff faux are democrats really not allowed to have a progressive candidate for president pushing the democrats to timidity an ominous portent for the democrats one new york times columnist wrote another claimed that labour s defeat forecast the coming trump victory in 2020 not surprisingly donald trump himself crowed that boris johnson s election was a harbinger of what s to come in our country whatever the exact cause of johnson s victory in britain was it mostly brexit corbyn labour s program applying it to u s politics has some obvious difficulties for starters there is nothing in the united states equivalent to the brexit crisis or jeremy corbyn or the labour left s socialism but the key error of applying presumed lessons from the uk to u s politics is this the ideological agenda of what constitutes the left in the united states of america for health care education and other critical issues is located in britain s political center moreover most democrats think that defeating the unhinged fascist and his congressional minions in the white house is more important than their own programmatic differences by a margin of 56 to 33 they have told pollsters that they would prefer the strongest candidate against trump even if they disagreed with him or her on the issues radicals realists half republicans the battle for the democratic party nomination is widely described as a contest between the party s heart and its head on the one side are the impatient radicals of the elizabeth warren bernie sanders wing of the party they press for a dramatic reversal in the long term conservative drift in american public policies on the other side are the supposedly more practical realists of the bill clinton barack obama wing they insist that progressive goals can only be reached in small cautious steps the realist view has been repeated so often in the media that it is a widely accepted truism it explains the current strength in the polls of joe biden who was barack obama s vice president a late november 2019 survey found that just 15 of democrats thought biden had the best ideas but by a wide margin 46 to 10 each for sanders and warren they thought he was most likely to beat trump the other leading moderate pete buttigieg is the mayor of a smallish city who if nominated could not even deliver his home state faith in the appeal of centrism also just convinced multi billionaire michael bloomberg to jump into the already overcrowded race for the democratic nomination but how certain should democrats be that the path of a victory of their party s candidate next november goes through the party s center moderates claim that the election of bill clinton and barack obama proves their case yet both clinton and obama actually ran populist campaigns substantially to the left of how they governed and curiously enough two years into both of their first terms voters gave the republicans control of congress should only republicans be radicals moreover in 1980 the moderate democrat jimmy carter lost his re election to the radical republican ronald reagan and once again in 1984 walter mondale s moderate balance the budget centrism lost to reagan s supply side radicalism in 1988 the moderate michael dukakis lost to george bush i in 2000 and 2004 the moderates al gore and john kerry lost to george bush ii and in 2016 the moderate hillary clinton lost to the radical self obsessed smash the china radical donald trump we will never know if more assertive progressive democrats could have won any of these elections but certainly there is evidence that in 2016 bernie sanders bread and butter populism could have beaten trump in the crucial battleground states of the industrial midwest which the relentlessly centrist clinton lost the argument that only a candidate considered moderate within the democratic party can beat trump in 2020 weakens further when you consider this key point every one of the current dozen or so major democratic candidates including warren and sanders is by any measure more centrist than the radical trump trump is known around the globe for his daily urge to express his contempt for the u s constitution the middle class social norms and even rationality itself centrist democrats doctrine self defeating centrist democrats doctrine embraced by the biden camp holds that liberal goals can only be reached in incremental steps and more amazing yet in collaboration with conservatives the reverse obviously does not apply but the evidence gets even more interesting remember how a theatrically compassionate bill clinton told the struggling american workers in 1992 i feel your pain once elected clinton pursued an economic policy defined by financiers traveling through the revolving door between wall street and washington the clinton years were marred by tight budgets for social needs and the de regulation of wall street that ended in the financial bust of 2008 9 as well as trade deals that exported jobs from the industrial states of the midwest and helped get trump elected in 2016 timid mr obama obama followed the same script he regularly lectured his party s left mind you what goes for left in the united states against being too ambitious for example like clinton obama understood intellectually that providing all americans with health care would best be done under a canadian style single payer system where health insurance is provided by the government but like clinton he refused to support it insisting that change happens in steps so he based his obamacare on ideas taken a from a conservative republicans think tank allowed the private insurance and pharmaceutical companies to keep raising prices of premiums and drugs at the end of his term barack obama observed that more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top it should not have been a surprise misreading their own voters nor should it have been a surprise that by 2016 enough voters were so frustrated with the democrat centrists weak policies that they provided the margin of victory to the bizarre donald trump in the hope that he would bring some meaningful change the moderates still don t get it biden regularly denounces warren and sanders for wanting to move too fast on health care and tax reform hillary insists that after four years of trump americans want to return to boring normal times but for many voters those times were a lot better for hillary than they were for them today what is ominous for democrats is not the british election it is the fact that trump although behind in the national polls is running roughly even against potential democrats in key battleground states where the race for state based electoral votes will be decided conclusion none of this means that what goes for a left progressive politician in the united states is automatically the best bet to win this coming november no one who experienced the shock of the 2016 election should be confident of predicting the outcome in 2020 but it does mean that we should be careful of glib analogies between british and american politics and that democrats should take a hard look at their own recent history before automatically buying into the theory that only moderates can win as recent presidential history suggests the middle of the

comment 2019 felt like a rollercoaster ride 2020 is almost certain to be even wilder australia has never started a year with interest rates so low and with so much uncertainty around doubt is enveloping house prices wages and global markets it s hard to see how the rba could possibly get relaxed enough about the future to raise interest rates so what will happen in the new year here are the four big issues you should be thinking about house prices 2019 was a surprising year for house prices the housing market started the year amid unusual gloom then did a big u turn it ended up in a much more familiar place for australians a frenzy of bidding driving house prices up at a record rate house prices are booming again picture supplied we all learned something in 2019 some aussies were shocked to discover house prices can actually fall we also learned house prices will bounce back if the rba cuts interest rates this is good news for homeowners in the short run because it looks likely the rba will cut rates again soon the official cash rate could hit a new record low as early as february 2020 and the bank won t mind if house prices rise it has said it was surprised by the effects of the recent house price fall and implied it won t be making that mistake again soon it likes the way people spend more when their house prices are rising because that spending drives the economy but in the longer run the link from housing prices to interest rates raises big questions with interest rates at record lows surely they must eventually rise again after all the last two decades of rising house prices happened as rates fell from 5 per cent in 2000 to 4 per cent in 2010 then to 0 75 per cent in 2020 if falling rates cause a long positive house price cycle what happens to house prices if the rba one day enters a multi year cycle of rate hikes a recession in 2019 many global recession warning signs started flashing red yield curves briefly inverted in the us which has been a mostly reliable precursor to recession in the last 40 years as the next graph shows are we headed for a recession it certainly seems like it picture supplied when the blue line dips below zero a recession usually follows but was the recent dip big enough google trends data also shows something interesting a big surge in people searching for information about recessions this indicator may be less technical than the yield curve and it has less history to draw on but it certainly peaked before the gfc so its accuracy should not be sneezed at more and more people are searching for the term recession picture supplied at home the biggest indicator of a possible recession may be the reserve bank talking about quantitative easing their forecasts remain mostly positive but quantitative easing is a tool for desperate times and if it s on the table for use in 2020 we have to ask why interest rates are already at record lows and seemingly having little effect if a recession does come in 2020 it s frightening to contemplate how little the rba might be able to do to reverse it jobs and earnings 2019 was not a terrible year for jobs but as the next graph shows it was not impressive underemployment and unemployment both rose taking us nearly back to where we were at the start of 2018 the unemployment and underemployment rates are on the rise again picture supplied rising underemployment is usually a bad sign for wages the backbone of the economy is our paycheques australians mostly spend what they earn and our earnings have not been growing well wages growth is down to around 2 per cent barely above inflation it is fair to ask what will happen in 2020 one useful sign for the future is the anz job ads series it counts up job ads to try to predict the future of the labour market but it has bad news about next year job ads have been falling as the next graph shows the forecast for jobs is not looking bright for 2020 picture supplied this suggests fewer people will be starting new jobs soon this is bad news because to get a raise we need a tighter labour market i e lots of people getting hired and not so many getting fired instead the reverse seems to be happening accordingly the government has downgraded its wages forecasts for 2020 in its mid year economic and fiscal outlook global markets more and more australia s economy depends on global markets we can be lifted up by policies made in beijing but we can also be brought down by mistakes made on wall street and silicon valley and there have been plenty of the latter in history 2019 was the year of the wework saga a hot american real estate start up funded with way too much venture capital money it was going to float on the stock market for billions of dollars instead it suddenly stumbled and fell the float was cancelled the ceo was sacked a whole lot of dodgy dealing was exposed the company is now slashing staff and trying to avoid bankruptcy wework points to a sickness in the american start up bubble in 2019 wework s problems looked isolated but are they in 2007 the pension funds that were having problems with subprime loans looked isolated too it was only by 2008 we realised they were a symptom of a big problem that led the whole word into the global financial crisis a lot of money has chased the start up bubble and if start up firms turn out to have been a bad investment a lot of money is going to be lost how many weworks are out there how many companies pretend to be winners but are actually hollow inside is uber one slack spotify could they be revealed in 2020 and harm the global economy in the process and all this is without mentioning donald trump brexit impeachment the trade war and the us election 2020 is going to be insanely busy finding out what happens to global markets is just one of the many reasons 2020 is going to be a hell of a ride jason murphy is an economist jasemurphy he is the author of the new book incentivology originally published as indicators are flashing red warning signs recession is looming

when he saw the footage of morrison s reception in cobargo english broadcaster piers morgan normally a reliable friend to populist conservatives tweeted he got what he deserved absolutely unconscionable for a prime minister to holiday in hawaii as his nation burns by now nsw emergency services minister david elliott at the time of writing still declining to take calls as he returns from a european jaunt that began after the deaths of nsw volunteer firefighters must feel some relief that he has no international profile illustration john shakespeare credit in truth though the world began to pay attention to the australian conflagrations and its climate change recalcitrance even before the excruciating footage of morrison s visits to firegrounds leaked over the wires on new year s eve new york magazine published a piece about lamenting the global response to the fires that likened morrison to donald trump and jair bolsonaro in embodying climate change denial two days later the economist noted morrison s lethargic approach to climate change on december 23 al jazeera reported australia s government is resisting growing calls for a more ambitious response to climate change even as the country battles devastating bushfires triggered by record temperatures that have sent air pollution to critical levels loading it noted that australia releases 1 3 per cent of the world s greenhouse gases its population accounts for 0 3 per cent of the world s inhabitants in a feature published just after christmas the washington post charted the terrible damage already wrought upon australia s environment by climate change on land australia s rising heat is apocalyptic in the ocean it s worse read the headline it recounted how flying foxes and possums were falling dead out of trees in heat waves how the giant kelp forests of tasmania had already been obliterated this is happening even though average atmospheric temperatures in australia have yet to increase by 2 degrees celsius it reported australia also captured global attention during the most recent united nations climate change talks in madrid in early december known as cop25 which were widely seen as a dismal failure in the face of existential global threat in this international ring australia punched well above its weight identified as one of the nations most responsible for wrecking any chance of securing a meaningful outcome alongside giants like brazil and the united states in a piece entitled the winners were the brakemen die welt explained to german readers how australia had insisted on double counting old emissions cuts to meet new commitments countries such as australia brazil and the usa have blocked and delayed the un climate protection process in madrid the growing will in many countries to stop global warming with decisive action could not prevail here because of the unanimity principle michael schafer head of climate and energy at the environmental organisation wwf germany told german broadcaster welt reimund schwarze environmental economist at the helmholtz centre for environmental research spoke of the talks as a long tragedy prime minister scott morrison s approach to climate change has been called lethargic credit aap australia played its part in this failure with proposals that would have rendered any agreement practically useless wrote james dyke of the university of exeter in the independent newspaper but its continual production of coal is more destabilising it s no surprise that coal mining corporations want to continue coal mining but the fact that certain australian political parties and sections of the media strongly promote coal should be a source of immense shame the greatest gift they could give to australians and the rest of the world would be to radically rethink their ideological attachment to this fossil fuel the diplomatic cost of australia s determination to defend its coal industry in the face global efforts to cut greenhouse emissions is significant broad and so far incalculable says herve lemahieu the director of the lowy institute s asian power and diplomacy program an ongoing project that measures shifting national power dynamics across our region speaking from london he said that as a result of coverage of australia s performance in madrid and of the bushfires australia is now seen in a different darker light across europe where once it existed in the popular imagination as a place of almost pristine natural beauty it is now viewed as the western nation most ravaged by climate change it s reputation as a global citizen has been irrevocably tarnished nsw rfs firefighters work through the night credit kate geraghty the global media has made a link between australia s protection of its coal industry and its climate policy the cat is out of the bag says lemahieu the impact of this new understanding of australia will not only damage our effectiveness in future climate negotiations it will hurt all australian diplomatic efforts he says loading australia is currently negotiating a free trade agreement with the eu he explains that will have to be ratified by the eu parliament and by some eu nations support for is going to face a democratic test among populations that have made that link tim buckley the director of energy finance studies at the institute for energy economics and financial analysis says his frustration at the government s intransigent defence of increasingly technologically obsolete thermal coal coal burnt for energy rather than steel manufacturing at the cost of effective climate change policy and international reputation is compounded by his view that the industry has commenced its drawn out death throes sustained by political muscle rather than economic reality coal power s defenders point to a recent uptick in imports to china and india and the long term potential of customers such as bangladesh pakistan and vietnam buckley concedes china and india will continue to buy australian coal in the short term as they seek to maintain economic growth at up to 6 or 7 per cent annually but both have made clear their intention to first transition to domestic coal as fast as they can build the necessary infrastructure while concurrently decarbonising their economies in line with the rest of the world a bloomberg analysis published on december 23 predicted misery for australian coal exporters as china cut imports loading he says the coal fired power generation of those other nations mentioned as long term customers is wholly dependent on subsidies from nations financing and constructing their coal sectors mainly china south korea and japan both south korea and japan he says are already showing signs that they want to abandon the sector buckley argues that the thermal coal industry s tipping point has already passed missed by its champions in morrison s government but already factored in by global money markets us coal stocks dropped an average 50 per cent in 2019 while exxon remained flat in a us equity market that rose 28 per cent overall meanwhile the share price of the world s largest investor in renewables the us utility nextera energy leapt by 42 per cent banks and insurers around the world among them anz credit suisse and goldman sachs are increasing restrictions on their dealings with thermal coal and coal fired power generation operations divestment from fossil fuel is being turbo charged by the rise of institutional shareholder activism the institutional investors group on climate change now has a combined 24 trillion in assets under management and is developing a practical and useable framework for investors to be able to understand what it would mean for a pension fund to align with the goals of the paris agreement in other words it is developing a practical guide for its members to use in dumping coal loading later this month morrison had planned to india in order to help sell more coal that trip might now not go ahead buckley reckons he would have received a polite welcome not least because india is keen on australian lng he might have even helped sell more coal for a few more years but it would be delusional says buckley to believe that australia will get to choose how and when it transitions from coal the rest of the world will make that decision for us and it could do so suddenly tipping points can be easy to miss in financial markets says buckley in part this is because they are by nature sudden and dramatic in part it is because it is so tempting to keep basing forecasts on historical trends you can get away with that for years he says until it makes you look like a fool

the reality that showing facts to others is not persuasive is ridiculous i mean i find it downright depressing it s true though if you think about it this is not to say that facts are not true and this does not say that facts are not worth noting but facts do not persuade people to change their minds everyone knows this from social media arguments nowhere has anyone ever seen a political or religious belief changed after an exhaustive list of facts were shown give it a try if you want find someone that disagrees with you on capitalism socialism and list out your facts we both know how it will end there are many techniques that are persuasive facts are just not one of them

this is part of the series 31 persuasion tips that i learned from scott adams i personally can not stand people that apologize constantly i mean i do not have anything against offering an apology when you need to but few people do it right most either never apologize and yeah that just makes you look like a megalomaniac others apologize when their shadow appears the trick is to strike a balance refer back to this post for context but as persuasion goes you might apologize for being binarily wrong and not apologize about getting the details wrong the point is that knowing when to apologize can be persuasive
by scott reeves in new york china daily global updated 2020 01 03 23 58 the charging bull or wall street bull is pictured in the manhattan borough of new york city new york jan 16 2019 a worldwide survey of chief executives by the conference board said a recession in 2020 is their greatest fear the second year in a row business leaders listed an economic slowdown as their biggest concern recession fears come amid continued uncertainty about global trade tightening labor markets rising costs and global political instability the survey of some 750 ceos found just two years ago global recession was barely on the minds of ceos in our survey said the new york based conference board recession risk was listed at the top concern in the united states china and europe in japan fear of a recession ranked second behind a tight labor market in latin america recession jitters ranked behind uncertainty about global trade the international monetary fund said there have been four global recessions since the end of world war ii 1975 1982 1991 and 2009 the imf expects the us economy to grow at a 1 9 percent annual rate in 2020 while worldwide growth hits 3 5 percent the ongoing concerns about recession risk among business leaders reflect the slowing economy of the past year and the uncertainties about the outcome of trade disputes bart van ark the conference board s chief economist said in a statement however given a slightly better outlook for the global economy and an easing of trade tensions we anticipate that a drumbeat of negative sentiment which can become a self fulfilling prophecy can be avoided and that we will see more confidence about business prospects in 2020 trade jitters between the us and china appear to have moderated with a tentative agreement on the first stage of what both sides hope will be a comprehensive deal but china also listed uncertainty about global trade as a major concern us ceos listed it as their fourth strongest concern behind recession intense competition and a tight labor market last year the temporary inversion of the bond yield curve in the us stoked fears of a recession when the short term yield on bonds in higher than 10 year notes it often signals a recession because investors question prospects for long term growth but the strong us job market and consumer spending allayed recession fears a strong economy increases the competition to find and retain workers this translates into increased pay and new headaches for ceos regardless of a company s location size or industry sector finding and keeping talent is the top internal stressor for ceos in 2020 said the conference board a non partisan research organization composed of about 1 200 companies in 60 nations demand for highly talented employees now exceeds supply in most mature economies and as a result job openings are more difficult to fill while in some regions labor costs are accelerating the current us economic boom began in june 2009 as the economy emerged from the financial crisis it is now the longest cycle in us history breaking the run of 120 months of economic growth from march 1991 to march 2001 according to the national bureau of economic research in 2019 us gdp growth slipped to 2 3 percent from 3 percent in 2018 amid a continuing trade dispute with china but prospects of a deal are expected to ease recession fears in 2020 and boost domestic growth to 2 5 percent the conference board said despite slower growth the us stock market ended 2019 near record highs the us gross domestic product the total value of goods and services produced in a year grew to an estimated 21 25 trillion in 2019 up from 20 49 trillion in 2018 according to government figures in a research note issued dec 27 to investors investment bank goldman sachs said it pegs the risk of a us recession this year at less than 20 percent we continue to see lower recession risk than most largely because neither of the two classic late cycle risks inflationary overheating and financial imbalances look threatening despite the record age of the expansion the private sector continues to run a healthy financial surplus goldman sachs said fears of a recession in 2020 may simply reflect an instinctive sense that the long economic expansion must surely be almost up if so recession fears are not unreasonable but current economic indicators make a downturn this year unlikely the investment bank said goldman sachs said it expects the us china trade dispute to ease as evidenced by initial steps to reach a comprehensive deal we believe that tariffs have peaked goldman sachs said with phase one of the negotiations apparently complete we do not expect new tariffs on imports from china in 2020 while minor new tariffs are possible the risks that new tariffs would pose to financial markets and the economy will likely discourage the white house from raising tariff rates marginally in the run up to the 2020 election the us federal reserve bank cut interest rates by a quarter point three separate times in 2019 to boost the economy but further cuts this year are unlikely
libra says it will be backed by a basket of assets but is not clear on exactly what assets will be inside of a libra this lack of clarity over what assets it will comprise will likely lead to regulatory jurisdiction vs jurisdiction hell every regulator touched by libra will begin investigating it it is not clear if it is a currency a derivative a security a commodity pool and so on thus it isn t clear which laws apply jurisdictions will likely disagree with each other on this point as they do already in defining digital currencies at home nation states could easily fight over the aspects over digital money as there does not appear to be any enacted international trade agreements that govern this type of financial arrangement
happy friday traders welcome to our first recap of 2020 and what a way to kick things off gold prices are trading near four month highs having gained well over 30 to the ounce this week the yellow metal s rise was spurred initially by an overall increase in demand throughout the commodities complex and then slung higher by the sudden return of geopolitical tension to the economic narrative to end the week gold spot prices look to close just below 1550 oz where the chart seems to have found a strong level of resistance silver is back to 18 oz so what kind of week has it been from the perspective of the global economy gold s moonshot of a week to kick off 2020 has been driven by a real good news bad news situation the us president s assertion that initial components of a trade deal will be signed in january while still unconfirmed by the chinese side boosted the positive outlook that characterized the markets to begin the week while possibly increasing demand for gold in the medium term and of course we re ending the week under the tension of the us and iran once again toeing the edge of conflict the bad news global markets go risk off as iran promises retaliation for us military strike news broke thursday night around the start of the asian trading session that a us air strike in iraq ordered by potus had targeted and killed a high ranking iranian military official the sudden escalation of tensions that had lowered to a hum since this summer between the us and iran sent markets reeling right away while equity markets dropped sharply crude oil futures burst higher and the already elevated trading price for gold was pushed to 1550 oz and a four month high point the environment of animosity has continued through friday s us trading session with stocks lower in earnest along with treasury yields as investors pivot into the safety of government bonds as well as gold iranian leadership is vowing severe retaliation to washington s aggressive action although given how 2019 s economic sanctions have already crippled their economy their options short of a military response that would only worsen the situation exponentially seem pretty limited that combined with the general acceptance if not support of the strike from key us allies leads me to think that chances are good that both sides might pull back from the brink in the coming days that said it will take several paces to cool things down to that point whereas it will only take one bad step to ratchet the potential for open conflict even higher the good ish news optimism for trade peace global growth in 2020 boosts gold etc of course while the fear trade has driven gold prices to these lofty levels just below apparent resistance at 1550 it was the positivity trade that accounted for the first 15 20 of the yellow metal s rise this week while you would struggle to find may reasonable market observers who are predicting a repeat of the stellar 2019 that many major assets had it would be equally difficult to find those who are predicting a market collapse or major recession with that in mind the outlook for large parts of the commodities complex and growth in global economies outside the us saw gold spot prices on the rise driven by expectations for an uptick in demand in the short to medium term as well as some weakness in the us dollar against major trade partners the movement higher was accelerated just after wednesday s market holiday with the claim from donald trump that the us and china would be signing the phase one trade agreement on january 15 while cooling in the lengthy trade war between the world s two largest economies would certainly be a boon to risk appetite and many of the assets that typically have a negative correlation to gold prices it seems likely to also support a rise in the chinese currency as well as china based demand for gold to be sure the bright red asterisk on these headlines is that china as of friday afternoon has yet to confirm the signing date the escalation of military tension around the middle east has pulled focus from this particular story and indeed from the feel good attitude that lead most of this week but we ll be keeping a close on whether the chinese delegation corroborates the white house s schedule or not and i do believe that these currents are persisting below the surface so if we indeed in short order see a pullback from the brink between the us and iran as i believe we might these drivers that have supported gold buying without threatening to destabilize the global economy will keep gold prices elevated friday s data just barely noticed amid all of the geopolitical tension we had a couple points of macroeconomic interest on the calendar today ism manufacturing pmi unexpectedly fell further into the contractionary zone again 2019 ends with the weakest reading for ism manufacturing since the great recession ended expansion began in 2009 47 2 new orders production also weakest since 2009 backs up fed study showing tariffs are hurting not helping us factories michael mckee mckonomy january 3 2020 the discussion minutes of the fed s december meeting were released they solidified the outlook for short term interest rates to remain unchanged through 2020 next up our first full week of 2020 will still be a bit slow on the data front although it will end with some weight as we get the newest jobs report on friday of course it looks like trade and conflict based headlines will dominate gold and dollar markets next week just as they have for the last few days so we will keep our focus there as well for now enjoy your weekend traders i ll see everybody back here for our first full week preview of the gold market s newest decade
1 oil back on the boil geopolitics is back in the driving seat the u s killing of a top iranian commander has doused the nascent new year rally and delivered a 3 boost for oil prices on fears that any violent retaliation from tehran would disrupt energy supplies brent crude futures have actually only risen to their highest since mid september when an attack on saudi arabian crude facilities sparked the biggest price jump in more than 30 years whether oil markets calm down and stocks resume their climb hinges on what happens next september s oil price spike was short lived as riyadh didn t

beijing china has decided to keep its inflation target unchanged this year at around 3 per cent sources say suggesting that policymakers will continue to roll out more economic support measures while avoiding aggressive stimulus some analysts have speculated that beijing will raise the inflation target to 3 5 per cent which would give the authorities more room to support the world s second largest economy as growth tails off to the slowest in nearly 30 years but policy sources told reuters that the government expects surging food prices to start easing in the second half of the year as the government takes steps to address pork shortages the 2020 inflation target to be unveiled at the annual parliamentary session in early march was endorsed by top leaders at the annual closed door central economic work conference last month according to three sources with knowledge of the meeting s outcome the target will still be around 3 per cent one of the policy sources said we cannot rule out the possibility that inflation may break 5 per cent in the coming months but that could be short lived the state council information office and the national development and reform commission the state planner did not immediately respond to reuters requests for comment china s consumer price inflation cpi accelerated to a near eight year high of 4 5 per cent last november as pork prices doubled owing to a massive outbreak of african swine fever but producer prices have remained in deflation for five straight months the diverging price trends have complicated policymakers efforts to revive activity without risking overstimulating the economy while beijing has rolled out a series of support measures in the last two years mainly in the form of higher infrastructure spending and tax cuts leaders have pledged they will not embark on massive stimulus such as that during the 2008 2009 global financial crisis which saddled the economy with a mountain of debt
