from the imf as part of discussions of staff monitored programs or as part of other staff monitoring of economic developments the authorities have consented to the publication of this statement the views expressed in this statement are those of the imf staff and do not necessarily represent the views of the imf s executive board based on the preliminary findings of this mission staff will prepare a report that subject to management approval will be presented to the imf executive board for discussion and decision an international monetary fund team led by alejandro santos visited panama from february 4 through 17 to conduct the discussions for the 2020 article iv consultation the team met with the minister of economy and finance héctor alexander banks superintendent amauri castillo as well as other senior public officials and private sector representatives following a temporary slowdown in 2018 19 the economy is poised for a rebound in 2020 and will remain among the most dynamic in latin america the outlook is positive but the authorities should remain mindful of risks to growth stemming from both domestic and external factors the new government s strategy should aim at preserving panama s competitive advantage as an attractive business destination while focusing on social priorities to ensure sustainable and inclusive growth with this goal in mind panama needs to enhance its productivity and competitiveness while improving social outcomes exiting the fatf grey list by strengthening the aml cft policies while enhancing tax transparency will be key to maintaining panama s position as a regional financial center it is also increasingly important to reinforce fiscal discipline amid growing debt and underperforming revenues in order to ensure both public debt sustainability and fiscal policy credibility given the importance of the financial system in the panamanian economy the authorities should continue to bolster systemic risk assessment risk based supervision and put in place robust frameworks for macroprudential policy and crisis management finally against the backdrop of rising water demand and climate volatility panama needs to prioritize efficient resource management the economy is rebounding from a temporary slowdown weaker activity in 2019 real gdp grew by about 3 percent in the first three quarters of 2019 y y amid easing in the construction and service sectors following a slowdown in 2018 driven by a construction strike however there are indications that the economy began to recover in the last quarter as a new copper mine launched full scale commercial production and 2019 growth is estimated at 3½ percent y y the unemployment rate increased to 7 1 percent in august 2019 from 6 percent a year ago reflecting less economic dynamism subzero inflation cpi inflation remained persistently weak in 2019 staying below zero most of the year closing at 0 1 percent y y and averaging 0 4 percent stable fiscal deficit the overall deficit of the nfps reached 3 1 percent of gdp in 2019 compared to 3 2 percent of gdp in 2018 as an underperformance in tax revenue and accelerated execution of spending by the outgoing administration required an expenditure tightening in the second half of 2019 the fiscal deficit for 2019 was below the 3½ percent limit established in the revised social and fiscal responsibility law sfrl the relatively high deficit pre financing operations along with the payment of accumulated arrears in the amount of over 2 percent of gdp led to an increase in panama s central administration debt burden to about 46 percent of gdp at end 2019 although it is close to 40 percent on a net basis improved external position the current account deficit narrowed to an estimated 6 6 percent of gdp in 2019 from 8 2 percent of gdp in 2018 aided by rising copper exports and remained financed mainly by foreign direct investment the outlook is positive but the balance of risks is skewed to the downside growth will recover and panama will remain among the most dynamic economies in latin america output growth is projected to rebound to 4 8 percent in 2020 supported by full scale copper production and robust private investment over the medium term growth is expected to stabilize at its potential annual rate of 5 percent inflation is expected to pick up to 1 percent y y in 2020 amid accelerating economic activity and stabilize at 2 percent y y in the medium term meanwhile the external position is projected to continually improve reducing the current account deficit to 5 percent of gdp by 2023 the fiscal balance is also expected to gradually improve in line with the amended fiscal rule with the nfps deficit converging to 2 percent of gdp by 2022 the balance of risks is tilted to the downside main domestic risks to growth are related to setbacks in exiting the fatf watchlist and complying with sfrl deficit ceilings both of which could expose panama to reputational damage and thus reduce its competitiveness and erode policy credibility of the new administration continued oversupply in the domestic property market could adversely impact financial stability and the real economy through a price correction and rising npls social tensions could disrupt economic activity and cause policy missteps on the upside copper exports could be more important than anticipated among external risks the most notable ones are a slowdown in canal activity weaker than expected global growth escalating trade tensions the spread of the coronavirus as well as an erosion in competitiveness due to u s dollar appreciation other risks include a sharp tightening of global financial conditions leading to rising domestic interest rates which drive up debt service and refinancing costs cyberattacks can bring significant disruptions to digital infrastructure while climate change related weather events can adversely affect canal activity agriculture and tourism enhancing the fiscal framework is needed to sustain budgetary discipline amid rising debt the envisaged fiscal consolidation is needed to this end the government modified the deficit ceiling under the fiscal responsibility law once again to 3½ percent of gdp in 2019 followed by a gradual adjustment to 2 percent of gdp by 2022 which appears appropriate and the limit has already been observed for 2019 continued consolidation efforts are imperative to ensure debt sustainability especially given the recent rise in public debt levels driven by a relatively high deficit pre financing operations and the borrowing needed to pay accumulated arrears which were unrecorded previously a thorough assessment of the revenue potential and expenditure efficiency is required reform of tax and customs administrations attending social needs and improving the efficiency of public spending are imperative to sustain growth amid revenue shortfalls in addition to improving the capacity of tax and customs administrations action is required to review panama s complex tax exemptions that significantly erode the tax base on the expenditure side realigning current spending with social needs including by investing more in education and improving the effectiveness of social spending will be crucial to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth capital projects including those executed through newly established ppps need to be carefully assessed and prioritized going forward meanwhile the pension system needs to undergo a gradual reform by better aligning incoming contributions with expected payouts amid shifting demographics measures to further reinforce the fiscal framework should be adopted the authorities should recover their track record of fiscal discipline enabled by the fiscal responsibility law by enhancing the fiscal framework and solidifying their commitment to sound fiscal policymaking this would involve appointing the members of the fiscal council to further promote accountability and facilitate informed public debate on fiscal policy in addition over the medium term the new administration should consider adopting a structural rule to build fiscal buffers for economic downturns with the aim of making fiscal policy less pro cyclical and therefore a more effective macroeconomic stabilization tool finally the authorities should strengthen budgetary execution rules to avoid the recurrence of arrears while at the same time strengthen the recording of fiscal accounts by limiting the use of turnkey projects and deferred payment contracts in public investment projects financial integrity and tax transparency frameworks should be enhanced exiting the fatf grey list must remain a priority building on the momentum of recent legislative action the authorities should continue addressing the deficiencies in panama s aml cft regulatory framework identified by the fatf specifically the authorities should update the national risk assessment and the aml cft strategy update the newly created registry of beneficial ownership information for firms and enforce legal action in cases of money laundering and unlicensed remittances upgrading the legal framework and its effectiveness is key to strengthening panama s position as a regional financial center the ongoing efforts to increase public awareness of money laundering and other suspicious financial activity are welcome close cooperation and fluid communication with regional and international authorities on financial integrity will be needed to ensure a prompt exit from the grey list efforts to further enhance tax transparency and information exchange should continue on the back of recent progress in addressing the oecd global forum s legal recommendations which resulted in upgrading panama to partially compliant with its global tax transparency standard the authorities should continue addressing the shortcomings identified in the agency s 2019 review specifically panama should dissolve dormant entities and respond to exchange of information requests in a timely manner financial sector reforms are needed to build resilience and monitor risks upgrades to the financial surveillance toolkit are needed with significant progress in the regulatory framework towards adoption of basel iii the authorities should focus on macroprudential policy and further upgrading the regulatory toolkit it would also be important to put in place an adequate liquidity support facility for banks and robust frameworks for crisis management including by enhancing the range of resolution tools to better monitor macrofinancial risks data gaps with respect to granular information on household and corporate balance sheets and property prices should be addressed the country has potential to develop the fintech sector adopting cybersecurity and fintech regulatory frameworks in line with international standards while capitalizing on panama s digital and mobile connectivity could place the country as a regional fintech hub addressing structural needs and social priorities is urgent implementation of structural reforms will be key to secure high potential growth sustaining high rates of growth will require continued improvements in productivity and competitiveness a strengthening of policies related to labor mobility governance and institutional capacity and enhancing the innovation and technological sophistication in key industries to remain an attractive destination for doing business panama needs to upgrade the skill level of its workforce streamline the insolvency framework and improve the functioning of the judicial system in addition enhancing water management is vital both for the expanded canal operations and a growing population especially given the climate change risks social issues should be prioritized it will be important to continue reforming social policies to maintain broad based and inclusive growth this requires strategic policy action in the areas of education both access and quality gender equality social protection programs and poverty reduction in the comarcas the mission would like to thank the panamanian authorities for their excellent cooperation kind hospitality and candid and open discussions

was 864 6 million reflecting a more sustainable operating margin after an extraordinary year in 2018 with soft steel demand in mexico and a significant decline in steel shipments in argentina operating income in 2019 decreased 1 2 billion year over year mainly due to 66 lower revenue per ton a 30 increase in operating cost per ton and a 440 000 ton decrease in shipments revenue per ton decreased in 2019 principally as a result of declining steel prices in ternium s north american markets in 2019 following a strong pricing environment in 2018 the increase in the steel segment s operating cost per ton6 mainly reflected higher raw material and energy costs and higher depreciation of property plant and equipment partially offset by lower labor costs and maintenance expenses

000 ton decrease in the southern region mainly due to weaker steel demand in argentina partially offset by a 163 000 ton increase in other markets due to higher sales of slabs to third parties story continues the company s net income in 2019 was 630 0 million compared to net income of 1 7 billion in 2018 the 1 0 billion year over year decrease was mainly due to lower operating income partially

2019 was 92 2 million with low operating margin and seasonally weak shipments operating income in the fourth quarter 2019 decreased 136 4 million sequentially mainly due to a 23 decrease in steel revenue per ton and a 139 000 ton decrease in shipments including lower finished steel shipments and lower slab shipments to third parties steel revenue per ton decreased sequentially as it continued to reflect the lagged effect in contract pricing of a weak pricing environment in north america during the second half of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter 2018 the company s operating income in the

operating cost per ton revenue per ton decreased mainly as a result of lower steel prices in the nafta markets which turned from particularly strong during the second half of 2018 to remarkably weak during the same period in 2019 the year over year decrease in shipments was mainly the result of a 46 000 ton decrease in other markets principally on lower slab sales to third parties and a 21 000 ton decrease in the southern region partially offset by a 20 000 ton increase in mexico operating cost per ton decreased year over year in the fourth quarter 2019 mainly reflecting lower purchased

net income in the fourth quarter 2019 decreased 345 5 million due mainly to lower operating income and lower financial results partially offset by a lower effective tax rate the year over year decrease in financial results was principally due to the effect of the argentine peso s and mexican peso s fluctuation against the us dollar in the fourth quarter 2019 versus the fourth quarter 2018 change in the functional currency of ternium s argentine subsidiaries ternium s subsidiary ternium argentina has performed a review of its functional currency and has concluded that the currency that

consumption decreased in most markets in the americas steel demand in 2020 is expected to recover in brazil and colombia and to a lesser degree in the united states and mexico the company anticipates steel price volatility to decrease in 2020 as uncertainty caused by global and regional trade negotiations appears to have moderated after significant turbulence during the past two years and a prolonged steel inventory destocking in north america recently has come to an end ternium expects ebitda to increase in the first quarter 2020 compared to the fourth quarter 2019 with higher shipments and a recovery in steel margin mainly as a result of slightly lower costs with marginally improving steel market sentiment in mexico the company anticipates steel shipments in the country to increase in the first quarter of the year after a seasonally weak fourth quarter 2019 demand in mexico s industrial markets remains stable and public construction activity in the country is beginning to show some signs of improvement in addition the recent ratification by the usa of the united states mexico canada agreement usmca has reduced uncertainty which should help foster economic activity and investment in mexico in the years to come in argentina ternium expects shipments to seasonally decrease in the first quarter 2020 to levels similar to those in the first quarter 2019 the country s macroeconomic environment in 2020 will continue to be highly dependent on the normalization of the country s public debt situation steel market conditions for slab production at ternium s brazilian

million reflecting a more sustainable operating margin after an extraordinary year in 2018 with soft steel demand in mexico and a significant decline in steel shipments in argentina operating income in 2019 decreased 1 2 billion year over year mainly due to 66 lower revenue per ton a 30 increase in operating cost per ton and a 440 000 ton decrease in shipments revenue per ton decreased in 2019 principally as a result of declining steel prices in ternium s north american markets in 2019 following a strong pricing environment in 2018 the increase in the steel segment s operating cost per ton6 mainly reflected higher raw material and energy costs and higher depreciation of property plant and equipment partially offset by lower labor costs and maintenance expenses shipments in 2019 reflected a 240 000 ton decrease in mexico mainly due to a softer commercial market in 2019 and a strong level of shipments in 2018 in anticipation of rising steel prices and a 363 000 ton decrease in the southern region mainly due to weaker steel demand in argentina partially offset by a 163 000 ton increase in other markets due to higher sales of slabs to third parties the company s net income in

revenue per ton and a 139 000 ton decrease in shipments including lower finished steel shipments and lower slab shipments to third parties steel revenue per ton decreased sequentially as it continued to reflect the lagged effect in contract pricing of a weak pricing environment in north america during the second half of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter 2018 the company s operating income in the

operating cost per ton revenue per ton decreased mainly as a result of lower steel prices in the nafta markets which turned from particularly strong during the second half of 2018 to remarkably weak during the same period in 2019 the year over year decrease in shipments was mainly the result of a 46 000 ton decrease in other markets principally on lower slab sales to third parties and a 21 000

change in the functional currency of ternium s argentine subsidiaries ternium s subsidiary ternium argentina has performed a review of its functional currency and has concluded that the currency that most faithfully represents the economics effects of the entity is the us dollar and therefore its functional currency has changed from the argentine peso to the us dollar this change is prospective from january 1 2020 and does not affect the balances at december 31 2019 nor results or cash flows for the year then ended annual dividend proposal ternium s board of directors proposed that an annual

consumption decreased in most markets in the americas steel demand in 2020 is expected to recover in brazil and colombia and to a lesser degree in the united states and mexico the company anticipates steel price volatility to decrease in 2020 as uncertainty caused by global and regional trade negotiations appears to have moderated after significant turbulence during the past two years and a prolonged steel inventory destocking in north america recently has come to an end ternium expects ebitda to increase in the first quarter 2020 compared to the fourth quarter 2019 with higher shipments and a recovery in steel margin mainly as a result of slightly lower costs with marginally improving steel market sentiment in mexico the company anticipates steel shipments in the country to increase in the first quarter of the year after a seasonally weak fourth quarter 2019 demand in mexico s industrial markets remains stable and public construction activity in the country is beginning to show some signs of improvement in addition the recent ratification by the usa of the united states mexico canada agreement usmca has reduced uncertainty which should help foster economic activity and investment in mexico in the years to come in argentina ternium expects shipments to seasonally decrease in the first quarter 2020 to levels similar to those in the first quarter 2019 the country s macroeconomic environment in 2020 will continue to be highly dependent on the normalization of the country s public debt situation steel market conditions for slab production at ternium s brazilian

compensation expenses to the mine sites 4 cost of sales includes mining and processing costs royalties and amortization expense and is calculated based on the mid point of guidance the company s long term strategic objective is to generate increasing returns for its shareholders through low cost production and free cash flow growth from its existing operations and portfolio of development projects the company was successful in achieving these objectives in 2019 with production of 494 500 ounces of gold and a 10 reduction in total cash costs driving record operating cash flow in addition the company made substantial progress on its growth initiatives having completed construction of the low cost cerro pelon mine in mexico and advancing construction of the lower mine expansion at young davidson with several significant near term positive catalysts 2020 is expected to be a transformational year for alamos these include the recently announced substantial increase in high grade mineral reserves and resources at island gold the phase iii expansion study of island gold which is expected to be competed in june and demonstrate a larger very profitable long life operation the completion of the lower mine expansion at young davidson which remains on track for june and the transition to strong company wide free cash flow starting in the second half of 2020 production is expected to temporarily decrease in 2020 to between 425 000 and 465 000 ounces of gold this reflects the previously guided lower production from young davidson during the first half of 2020 while completing the tie in of the upper and lower mines as well as the end of production at el chanate total cash cost guidance of 770 to 810 per ounce and aisc guidance of 1 020 to 1 060 per ounce are temporarily higher reflecting lower gold production at young davidson during the tie in period in the first half of 2020 gold production in the first quarter of 2020 is expected to be within a range of 105 000 to 110 000 ounces consistent with annual guidance costs are expected to be higher in the first half of 2020 and decrease in the second half with the completion of the lower mine tie in at young davidson in 2021 production is expected to increase to approximately 500 000 ounces at lower costs driven by higher mining and production rates at young davidson the construction of the lower mine infrastructure at young davidson is in the final stages the tie in of the lower mine recently commenced and remains on schedule to be completed in june 2020 during this previously guided downtime of the northgate shaft ore will be trucked to surface from the upper mine at a rate of approximately 2 500 tpd given the lower production rate and a full workforce to support ongoing development during this period total cash costs and mine site aisc are expected to increase significantly in the first half of the year following completion of the tie in underground mining rates are anticipated to increase from approximately 6 500 tpd to a rate of 7 500 tpd by the end of 2020 this is expected to drive young davidson production higher and costs significantly lower in the second half of 2020 capital spending at young davidson in 2020 is expected to be between 75 and 85 million down from 2019 levels capital spending is expected to be lower during the second half of 2020 with approximately 60 of the capital budget planned for the first half of the year to complete the lower mine expansion combined with higher production and lower costs young davidson is expected to generate strong free cash flow in the second half of 2020 higher mining rates are expected to drive annual gold production to approximately 200 000 ounces at lower costs in 2021 gold production at island gold in 2020 is expected to be marginally lower than 2019 with higher throughput offset by lower grades mined grades are expected to be higher during the first half of 2020 and lower during the second half of the year reflecting mine sequencing total cash costs and mine site all in sustaining costs are expected to increase slightly from 2019 capital spending at island gold is expected to be between 50 and 60 million in 2020 excluding capitalized exploration the company is undertaking a number of projects to support the growing operation and mine life this includes an expansion of the tailings facility and the construction of a new administration building dry facility and underground workshop the company is currently conducting a phase iii expansion study at island gold beyond 1 200 tpd which is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2020 this study will incorporate the recently released 2019 year end mineral reserve and resource update for island gold which included substantial growth in mineral reserves and resources the company expects this study will demonstrate island gold as a larger more profitable long life operation a total of 21 million has been budgeted in 2020 for surface and underground exploration at island gold to follow up on ongoing exploration success the 2020 program will be focused on continuing to define new near mine mineral resources across the two kilometre long island gold main zone which remains open laterally and down plunge across multiple areas of focus production from the mulatos district in 2020 is expected to be consistent with long term guidance of 150 000 to 160 000 ounces of gold ore will be mined and stacked from multiple sources in 2020 including the mulatos el victor and san carlos open pits as well as the newly constructed cerro pelon mine in addition the crushing and stacking of surface stockpiles will ramp up through the year as mining activities wind down in the san carlos and el victor pits in the first half of 2020 total cash costs are expected to increase slightly from 2019 reflecting the processing of lower recovery stockpiles which carry non cash historical inventory costs resulting in a higher reported cash cost per ounce mine site all in sustaining costs are also expected to increase due to higher sustaining capital mainly related to waste stripping activities at cerro pelon capital spending across the mulatos district is expected to total 20 to 25 million the majority of which is sustaining capital the company expects to make a construction decision on the la yaqui grande project during the second quarter of 2020 la yaqui grande is fully permitted having received the approval of the environmental impact assessment during the second quarter of 2019 and the change in land use permit in july 2019 capital spending on the company s development projects and capitalized exploration at existing operations is expected to total 35 million in 2020 the majority of this spending will be focused on exploration at island gold and exploration permitting and development activities at lynn lake with 183 million of cash and cash equivalents no debt and growing cash flow from its operations the company is well positioned to fund its internal growth initiatives and expects to transition to strong free cash flow generation in the second half of 2020 fourth quarter and year end 2019 results young davidson

reflecting higher realized gold prices for the year ended december 31 2019 revenues of 262 1 million were 25 8 million higher than the prior year attributable to a 2 increase in ounces sold as well as higher realized prices cost of sales which includes mining and processing costs royalties and amortization expense of 59 4 million in the fourth quarter were consistent with the comparative quarter of 2018 as were underground mining costs of cad 51 per tonne cost of sales for the year ended december 31 2019 were 231 1 million slightly lower than the prior year period due to lower mining costs per tonne and lower tonnes processed total cash costs of 766 per ounce in the fourth quarter were consistent with the comparative period and in line with annual guidance total cash costs improved significantly in the fourth quarter compared to the first half of the year as a result of higher grades mined and lower mining and milling costs for the year ended december 31 2019 total cash costs of 800 per ounce were 3 lower than the prior year period and slightly above guidance total cash costs are expected to be higher in the first half of 2020 due to lower production during the lower mine tie in decreasing significantly in the second half of the year mine site aisc of 1 083 per ounce in the fourth quarter were higher than the comparative quarter of 2019 and higher than annual guidance reflecting the timing of sustaining capital expenditures mine site aisc for the year were 1 047 per ounce above guidance as a result of higher sustaining capital expenditures capital expenditures were 27 0 million in the fourth quarter this included 16 4 million of sustaining capital and 10 6 million of growth capital growth capital spending was focused on construction of the new tia1 tailings facility and continued lower mine construction for the full year capital expenditures of 99 9 million were focused on lower mine construction lateral development in the upper and lower mines and construction of the new tia1 tailings facility capital spending was above guidance due to additional grouting requirements and a change in scope of the new tailings facility from an upstream to a centreline design young davidson generated 11 9 million of mine site free cash flow in the fourth quarter significantly higher than the same period of 2018 due to a higher gold price and improved operating costs for the full year mine site free cash flow was 12 8 million generating a return after self financing the lower mine expansion since the acquisition of young davidson in 2015 the mine has generated operating cash flow of 467 4 million and invested 420 0 million in capital expenditures the majority of which has been focused on the lower mine expansion with declining capital spending

of 186 0 million a 14 increase from the prior year period due to an increase in realized gold prices the average realized gold price in the quarter was 1 463 per ounce compared to 1 244 per ounce in the prior year period cost of sales were 136 0 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 a 34 decrease compared to the prior year period primarily due to the prior year including a 64 0 million non cash inventory impairment charge at el chanate mining and processing costs were 87 4 million compared to 96 2 million in the prior year period this decline was attributable to lower operating costs at island gold and young davidson and the completion of mining activities at el chanate in the fourth quarter of 2018 consolidated total cash costs for the quarter were 722 per ounce compared to 770 per ounce in the prior year period a 6 decrease driven by low cost production growth at island gold aisc were 972 per ounce in the quarter 11 per ounce lower than the prior year period driven by lower total cash costs partially offset by higher sustaining capital spending royalty expense was 4 4 million in the quarter lower than the prior year period of 4 8 million as the 5 mulatos royalty commitment ceased in the first quarter of 2019 partially offset by a higher number of ounces sold at island gold and higher realized gold prices amortization of 44 2 million in the quarter was consistent with the prior year period expense of 42 1 million amortization of 348 per ounce was in line with guidance the company recognized earnings from operations of 41 6 million in the quarter higher than the prior year period due to higher realized gold prices combined with lower mining and processing expense driving stronger margins further the prior year period included a 64 0 million non cash inventory impairment charge at el chanate which impacted earnings in 2018 the company reported net earnings of 38 0 million in the quarter compared to net loss of 71 5 million in the same period of 2018 the increase in earnings is due to stronger operating margins the benefit of foreign exchange gains recorded within deferred taxes as well as the prior year period impacted by the non cash inventory impairment charge at el chanate on an adjusted basis earnings of 32 1 million or 0 08 per share increased compared to the prior year driven by higher realized gold prices and improved costs adjusted earnings reflect adjustments for one time gains and losses as well as foreign exchange movements related to the canadian dollar and mexican peso which generated a foreign exchange gain

of gold for record revenue of 683 1 million a 5 increase compared to 2018 this was primarily driven by higher realized gold prices and record production at island gold partially offset by less ounces sold at mulatos and el chanate which transitioned to residual leaching at the end of 2018 revenue benefited from a higher realized gold price of 1 381 per ounce compared to 1 278 per ounce in 2018 a 52 5 million impact cost of sales were 521 4 million in 2019 compared to 639 4 million in 2018 as the prior year included a 64 0 million non cash inventory impairment charge at el chanate cost of sales was also driven lower by lower mining and processing costs royalties and amortization charges mining and processing costs decreased to 339 0 million in 2019 from 387 2 million in the prior year primarily due to lower operating costs at young davidson and mulatos which drove down total cash costs in addition mining and processing costs decreased significantly at el chanate as mining activities ceased in the fourth quarter of 2018 consolidated total cash costs per ounce decreased 10 in 2019 to 720 per ounce compared to 802 per ounce in the prior year the decline in total cash costs was driven by low cost production growth at island gold and lower operating costs and higher grades mined at both young davidson and mulatos aisc decreased to 951 per ounce in 2019 from 989 per ounce in the prior year the decrease was primarily driven by the reduction in total cash costs partially offset by higher sustaining capital spending at young davidson royalty expense was 17 4 million in 2019 a 19 decrease compared to 21 6 million in 2018 primarily due to a lower royalty obligation at mulatos with the completion of the third party royalty commitment in the first quarter of 2019 amortization of 165 0 million in 2019 was lower than the prior year due to fewer ounces sold on a per ounce basis amortization was 334 per ounce in line with guidance and slightly higher than the prior year due to a higher proportion of sales coming from island gold and young davidson which include higher amortization charges the company recognized earnings from operations of 126 0 million in 2019 compared to loss of 22 6 million in 2018 the substantial increase in earnings from operations was driven by higher gold prices and increased production from island gold which generates stronger margins further the prior year included a 64 0 million non cash inventory impairment charge at el chanate the company reported net earnings of 96 1 million in 2019 compared to a net loss of 72 6 million in 2018 driven by improved margins and the 2018 inventory impairment charge at el chanate on an adjusted basis earnings of 83 5 million or 0 21 per share for the year were 326 higher than in

image introduction i am delighted to address this meeting convened by the human rights and environmental development agenda in collaboration with premium times centre for investigative journalism national orientation agency technical unit on governance and anti corruption reforms and african centre for media and information literacy to review the efforts of state and non state actors in the fight against corruption in nigeria in 2019 no doubt state and non state actors have successfully produced reports and launched them held seminars and workshops and staged a walk against corruption in spite of such measures the transparency international has alleged that corruption is on the ascendancy in nigeria as usual both independent and corrupt practices and other offences commission and economic and financial crimes commission dismissed the report of the ti however while the efforts of both anti graft agencies are appreciated in the fight against corruption they are alone as some highly placed officials and agencies are openly promoting corrupt practices and abuse of office having been overwhelmed by the forces of impunity the anti graft agencies have not been able to address the refusal of the federal government to stop the selective investigation and prosecution of corrupt officials annual padding of budgets inflation of contracts daily extortion of money from motorists on all roads by police and military personnel open distribution of money by politicians to purchase votes illegal imposition of candidates on political parties by political parties by god fathers alleged bribe of electoral officers substitution of the decisions of election petition tribunals and courts for the verdict of the electorate monthly payment of salaries to ghost workers diversion of money earmarked for procurement of arms and ammunition to fight insurgency appointment of indicted persons as ministers and heads of public institutions usurpation of political by a cabal of unelected persons and recruitment of public officers in violation of the federal character commission act in his address at the corruption summit of the economic and financial crimes commission held at abuja last year president buhari challenged the nigerian people to join the fight being waged against corruption by the federal government the president pointed out that ant corruption fight should not be seen as an end in itself but as an instrument not only to fight poverty but a means to restore the right order of things in combating the menace of corruption in the next 4 years the president listed the following 8 priorities i strengthen the capacity of the economic and financial crimes commission and other anti corruption agencies by providing additional material organisational and logistical support ii close existing legislative loopholes facilitate collaboration with the judiciary and strengthen the criminal justice system iii enforce effective asset declaration by public office holders and ensure sanctions by professional bodies against lawyers bankers brokers public officials and other individuals facilitating corrupt practices iv ensure comprehensive support and protection to whistleblowers witnesses and victims of corruption v adopt and formulate the policy of naming and shaming all those who engage in corrupt practices while encouraging and honouring those who do not vi educate mobilise and encourage nigerians at the grassroots level to take ownership of the fight against corruption vii press for a crackdown on safe havens for corrupt assets abolishing of bank secrecy jurisdictions and tax havens on the continent and beyond viii insist on the unconditional return of looted assets kept abroad and further strengthening of international cooperation through information and mutual legal assistance in his keynote address delivered at the same conference president paul kagame of rwanda said that corruption must be fought from top to bottom using four key principles culture responsibility accountability and effectiveness he urged africans to discard the myth that corruption is endemic to particular cultures corruption is a universal weakness not an african one and it is not part of our destiny as a continent he said that research has shown that the biggest sources and beneficiaries of corruptions are outside of africa as far as president kagame is concerned this is a fight that can be won tolerating corruption is a choice not an inevitability it is within our power to end it that is the most important starting point otherwise it will be a waste of time to keep talking about it corruption does not take decades to eradicate once we decide to break the habit we have to set our sights high it is not enough to fight corruption just as merely fighting poverty it is too small an ambition for africa we want to create value we want to create wealth not merely fighting corruption with profound respect both african leaders have failed to address the root cause of corruption as no nation can fight corruption outside its political economy the discourse has to take cognizance of the impact of the neo liberal policies being religiously pursued by the majority of african governments to that extent the implementation of the aforementioned policies cannot seriously tackled the problem of corruption it is submitted that corruption cannot be meaningfully fought by governments that pay poor wages to workers owe workers and pensioners arrears of salaries and pension and implement economic programmes that promote poverty and underdevelopment it has to be realised that that the progressive withdrawal of subsidies from social services by the state which is a key component of the imf world bank sponsored structural adjustment programme has led to mass poverty in the land wealth cannot be created by countries whose economy is operated to serve the interests of imperialism for instance two years ago rwanda which was spending 2 billion per annum on the importation of second hand dresses decided to develop her textile industry accordingly the kagame regime banned the importation of all second hand dresses from the united states and other western countries the trump administration kicked against the ban and threatened to impose economic sanctions on rwanda we supported the ban and called on nigeria and other african countries to develop their textile industry but the call has been ignored to the detriment of the economy and the dignity of the nigerian people in a similar vein the trump administration which warehoused part of the abacha loot has set arrogantly set conditions for the repatriation of the sum of 308m negotiated by the governments of nigeria united states and jersey island in the united kingdom upon signing the tripartite agreement for the release of the stolen fund the representative of the united states government threatened that the fund would be recovered if is re looted by officials of the federal government there was no protest from the justice minister mr abubakar malami san who signed the agreement on behalf of the federal government a respected newspaper columnist sonala olumense has criticised the federal government for not rejecting such humiliation but the federal government could not have protested as the bulk of the over 4bn recovered from the abacha loot has been criminally diverted by some unscrupulous public officers in fact the order of the federal high court secured by the serap for the publication of all looted wealth since 1999 has been treated with disdain by the buhari administration apart from inviting nigerians to participate in the fight against corruption the buhari administration has partially fought corruption on the basis of the above listed priorities having realised that the fight against corruption cannot be fought and won by the federal government alone the buhari administration has rightly decided to educate mobilise and encourage nigerians at the grassroots level to take ownership of the fight against corruption but no attempt has been made by the federal government to mobilise the people to fight corruption as a matter of fact the federal government has engaged in budget padding and manipulation for instance the president presented a budget of n10 2trn for the 2020 financial year the national assembly increased the estimates to n10 4trn after the enactment of the appropriation act 2020 the national assembly has been passing the budgets of about 65 agencies of the federal government including nnpc cbn firs ndcc nimasa npa etc the nfiu has challenged the cbn for budgeting the sum of n1 1trn which is 10 per cent of the nation s annual budget in passing the budget of the central bank the house of representatives had to send media men and women packing and secretly increased the budget to n1 3trn having conceded that the anti corruption fight should not be seen as an end in itself the buhari administration has refused to view corruption as a manifestation of impunity in other words the diversion of money that has been earmarked to build hospitals or the refusal to remit funds earned by departments of the government to the accounts of the government constitutes a violation of the appropriation act and the constitution the public officers who engage in such criminal behaviour deserve to be treated like armed robbers because they have robbed the people and sentenced them to eternal agony and want but since the violators of budget laws are top officials of government the system is too weak to punish them hence the menace of corruption has become so rampart due to lack of political will on the part of the government to arrest and prosecute the major culprits the way forward 1 the fight against corruption should be linked to the struggle to free the economy from local saboteurs and foreign vampires president buhari has promised to rescue 100 million poor people from the labyrinth of poverty in the next 10 years the president should be told that it is impossible to achieve the objective with the religious implementation of neo liberal economic policies which have continued to promote poverty among the generality of nigerians 2 the central bank of nigeria has fixed interest rates at 14 per cent per annum realising that the economy cannot develop with 14 per cent interest rate the central bank has authorised the bank of the industries and bank of agriculture to lend at less than 10 per cent per annum since no economy has even developed on the basis of high interest rates we urge the central bank to peg the rate at not more than 5 per cent per annum 3 the economy should be planned by the government and not by the so called market forces instead of substituting chinese imperialism for western imperialism the federal government should empower nigerians to take over and manage the economy the central bank of nigeria should be stopped from further manipulating the foreign exchange market and remittances from nigerians in the diaspora by an illegal policy of the cbn the dollar component of the sum 25bn remitted to nigeria is retained abroad while benefiaries are paid in local currency and at the exchange rate the dubious policy of the cbn is manipulate the exchange the rate in favour of the united states dollar 4 the asset management corporation of nigeria has repeatedly maintained that 350 individuals and corporate bodies are indebted to the tune of the n5 4trn but the amcon has refused to disclose to nigerians that not less than n3trn of the huge debt is owed by the commercial banks since the banks have continued to declare profits of hundreds of billions per annum they should be made to pay their debts 5 according to the nigerian extractive industry transparency initaitive the sums of 22bn and n481 billion have been withheld from the federation account by a few local and foreign oil corporate bodies the huge fund should be recovered forthwith and remitted to the federation account 6 the federal government is reported to have recovered not less that n1trn from treasury looters from the fund the sum of n1bn should be earmarked for the establishment of a factory in each of the 774 local governments while the balance should be allocated to equip schools and public hospitals in the country 7 adequate fund should be provided to empower the agencies set up to enforce welfare laws such as child s rights act compulsory free universal basic education act minimum wage act national health act national health insurance act national immunisation act adult and literacy education act 8 the buhari administration has announced plans to educate mobilise and encourage nigerians at the grassroots level to take ownership of the fight against corruption the national orientation agency and all public media should be funded to embark on mass enlightenment of the people 9 labour unions and other progressive bodies in the country should mobilize the people to own the fight against corruption henceforth there should be popular participation in the preparation and execution of the annual budgets of the federal state and local governments 10 to empower citizens to monitor the disbursement of public funds the office of the accountant general of the federation ought to resume the publication of the monthly statutory allocations paid to the 3 tiers of government 11 section 1 of the freedom of information act 2011 and article 9 of the african charter on human and peoples rights ratification and enforcement act have guaranteed access to information accordingly the buhari administration has resolved to enforce effective asset declaration by public office holders therefore the code of conduct bureau is legally obligated to grant all legitimate requests for copies of asset declaration forms submitted to it by all public officers 12 owing to the illegal award of contracts by the federal executive council some serious corruption cases have been dismissed by the courts to avoid the loss of more corruption cases president buhari is called upon to constitute the national council on public procurement in line with the provisions of the public procurement act 13 section 15 5 of the constitution has imposed a duty on the state to abolish corrupt practices and abuse of power the federal government has set up the ccb efcc and icpc to fight corruption only the governments of kano and oyo states have established anti graft bodies to fight corruption other state governments including those who are calling for restructuring should no longer allow the efcc and icpc to investigate and prosecute corruption cases 14 in order to strengthen the efcc and icpc to perform their duties without interference the national assembly should amend the relevant laws to grant them autonomy the proposed amendment should ensure that the majority of the board members of the agencies are nominees of accredited representatives of credible civil society bodies 15 section 85 2 of the constitution provides that the public accounts of the federation shall be audited and reported on to the auditor general who shall submit his reports to the national assembly and for that purpose the auditor general or any person authorised by him in that behalf shall have access to all the books records returns and other documents relating to those accounts each house of the national assembly shall cause the reports to be considered by the committee of the house of the national assembly responsible for public accounts henceforth the national assembly should stop passing the budget of any department or agency of the government indicted by the auditor general until the money diverted is refunded conclusion permit me to conclude this address by insisting that the fight against corruption cannot succeed without the involvement of the people who are the direct victims of the menace therefore the labour movement and other progressive forces in the country should not hesitate to take advantage of the new official policy to mobilise the masses to demand accountability from all public officers this should start with popular participation in the preparation and execution of annual budgets of all tiers of government president kagame has said that we want to create wealth not merely fighting corruption let the federal government to take up the challenge by creating wealth to fund the rights of the nigerian people to education health and other basic amenities

the international monetary fund will visit lebanon starting tomorrow for consultations with officials as the country grapples with its worst economic crisis in three decades the washington lender said in a statement late tuesday a small imf staff team will visit beirut from february 20 23 to listen to the authorities views on how they plan to face lebanon s economic difficulties to take stock of recent macroeconomic developments and provide broad technical advice on policies to deal with the macroeconomic challenges facing the economy gerry rice the imf s director of communications and spokesman said in a statement lebanon has still not requested financial assistance from the washington lender mr rice said the country reached out to the fund last week seeking technical advice as it faces a looming deadline to repay 1 2 billion dh4 4bn eurobonds that hit maturity on march 9 another 700 million is due in april and 600m in june on tuesday fitch ratings said lebanon s financial position points to a likely restructuring of its debt and financial sector although lebanon technically retains foreign exchange reserves sufficient to service its sovereign debt repayment obligations in 2020 21 the costs of meeting its obligations would be so high that this outcome appears politically unrealistic the rating agency said we believe that some form of government debt restructuring is probable lebanon currently faces a liquidity crunch a shortage of dollars and capital controls by lenders that have eroded confidence in the banking sector the country has one of the highest debt to gross domestic product ratios 166 per cent in the world according to the institute of international finance iif its public debt increased 7 6 per cent to 91 64bn year on year as of the end of december 2019 government debt restructuring will be only part of the challenge fitch said to achieve economic stabilisation the authorities may also have to address the central bank s liabilities and intertwined balance sheets and the commercial banks which could have implications for depositors fundamentally debt sustainability will be contingent on a meaningful fiscal and structural reform process _____________ anti government protesters light candles after protester ahmad tawfik died in martyrs square beirut lebanon lebanese anti government protestor ahmad tawfik succumbs to his wounds on 17 february following three months of surgeries and medical treatment he was shot in the stomach at a protest in october 2019 in tripoli north lebanon epa _____________ last month the iif estimated lebanon will need a bailout package of 8 5bn from the imf to break its economic impasse and help it meet its financing needs and restore growth the country s longtime parliamentary speaker nabih berri said citizens who have been protesting since october would reject an imf bailout programme that would most likely require the country to float its currency forcing a major devaluation in addition to the implementation of higher taxes and austerity measures the lebanese pound has already lost more than a third of its value against the us dollar in the black market

anne o krueger a former world bank chief economist and former first deputy managing director of the international monetary fund is senior research professor of international economics at the school of advanced international studies johns hopkins university and senior fellow at the center for international development stanford university would you believe the following story if you heard it imagine a small rural town with one general store that sells to and buys from the farmers living in the surrounding area owing to their large families the farmers have been running up a tab at the store and they now owe the store a great deal of money so they organise a protest to demand that the store raise its prices on seed fertilizer and the like while reducing the price it will pay for the farmers grains obviously the scenario is absurd paying even higher prices for agricultural supplies and receiving less for what they produce will not help the farmers pay off their tab indeed either change would probably result in higher profits for the store and greater losses for the farmers and their families in this nonsensical parable us president donald trump s administration represents the farmers by accusing china or any other country of currency manipulation the administration is effectively demanding that the chinese appreciate their currency that is make each renminbi cost more in dollars to be sure many politicians over the years have argued that china and other developing and emerging economies manipulate their currency to gain a competitive edge by reducing the purchasing power of their own currencies they can make their exports cost less to foreign buyers while rendering imports more expensive to domestic buyers to account for such concerns the united states has a law mandating that the department of the treasury prepare a biannual report for congress specifying whether any currencies are being manipulated if the treasury does so specify the administration is then expected to carry on talks with the accused country but even then the law mandates no penalties congress has established three criteria to determine whether manipulation has occurred the offending country must have a current account surplus above 3 of gdp it must have intervened in the foreign exchange market to make its currency cheaper and it must have a bilateral surplus with the us in excess of 20 billion in august 2019 china s current account surplus fell below 3 of gdp and the chinese government had previously been intervening not to devalue the renminbi but rather to prevent further depreciation following trump s threats of additional tariffs in the event the us declared china a currency manipulator anyway only to remove the designation as a part of the phase one trade deal agreed in january but in the meantime the trump administration has discovered a new tool with which to bludgeon foreign competitors the department of commerce this month issued a rule that allows for additional levies on imports from countries deemed to be currency manipulators with the percentage increase in the tariff in addition to the statutory tariff and the antidumping or countervailing duty margin being equal to the estimated percentage by which the currency is deemed undervalued worse under the new rule there is no legal process that the department must follow when determining whether manipulation has occurred accordingly a us company that believes it is losing sales to a foreign company may now appeal to the commerce department and the international trade administration for special treatment even if a profitable german exporter charges the same prices for the goods it sells domestically as it does for the goods it sells in the us an american firm can demand additional levies by citing currency manipulation and if no us firm acts the commerce department can simply initiate such appeals on its own the us has long had one of the world s strongest economies owing in no small part to its respect for the rule of law and its efforts to maintain a level playing field for competition both foreign and domestic within the us market given this tradition it is puzzling that so many american politicians and businessmen are now terrified of other countries economic strengths true the us has also long championed extraordinarily loose criteria to justify anti dumping measures and countervailing duties and it has secured rules and procedures for determining such offences within the world trade organisation but a finding of currency manipulation has never been among the relevant criteria most likely the trump administration s unilateral decision to add currency manipulation to the list will be contested in court and at the wto more broadly the trump administration s currency politics will be felt everywhere trump has complained that both argentina and brazil are manipulating their currencies even though those countries exchange rate depreciation is obviously a response to high inflation the international monetary fund and others have recommended that both pursue devaluation in order to restore macroeconomic balance meanwhile trump continues to call on the us federal reserve to lower interest rates and ease its monetary policy so that the dollar will depreciate apparently the us is free to manipulate its currency just so long as no one

netback and net debt these indicators are not recognized measures under gaap ifrs and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by gaap ifrs accordingly the company s use of these terms may not be comparable to similarly defined measures presented by other companies management uses these terms for the reasons set forth below operating netback operating netback is a common non gaap financial measure used in the oil and natural gas industry which is a useful supplemental measure to evaluate the specific operating performance by product at the oil and natural gas lease level the most directly comparable gaap measure to operating netback is funds flow operating netback is calculated as oil and natural gas revenue less royalties operating and transportation expenses it is presented

profitability at the corporate level corporate netback is equal to funds flow which is a directly comparable gaap measure petrus analyzes these measures on an absolute value and per unit basis management believes that funds flow and corporate netback provide information to assist a reader in understanding the company s profitability relative to current commodity prices it is calculated in

industry commonly expresses production volumes and reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent boe basis whereby natural gas volumes are converted at the ratio of six thousand cubic feet to one barrel of oil the intention is to sum oil and natural gas measurement units into one basis for improved measurement of results and comparisons with other industry participants petrus uses the 6 1 boe measure

there is renewed concern about the sustainability of rising debt levels in many african countries much of this debt is being incurred through foreign currency denominated eurobonds issued on international financial markets the total value of eurobonds issued between 2018 and 2019 was more than the value of all bonds sold between 2003 to 2016 african governments are issuing and listing their eurobonds on established international debt markets usually london and irish stock exchanges african governments would venture offshore a lot less if domestic bond markets were active and liquid but besides south africa african bond markets are largely underdeveloped with inactive and illiquid secondary markets this makes it difficult to attract international investor participation locally the international monetary fund imf believes that african countries are on a eurobond issuing spree and half of them are near or at distressed levels it argues that african governments are piling on debt without evaluating the exchange rate risks and the real costs of repaying the debts but in my view the debt alarm being set off by international debt management organisations is exaggerated the problem is not that african countries are borrowing too much but rather they are paying too much interest there are a number of reasons for this including badly informed ratings by rating agencies as well as the behaviour of issuers there are solutions but these require african governments to stand up and take action doing the calculations there are two key elements that are taken into account in assessing a country s debt burden one is the level of debt based on the ratio of debt to gross domestic product gdp the other is the cost of servicing the debt interest payments debt levels on the continent for example are on average way below the 100 debt to gdp ratio mark but the impression created is that they are much higher this exaggerated perception of african debt levels has resulted in countries paying higher interest rates on debt the premiums are much higher than those paid by other countries in my view these are not justified by the risk profile of african countries save for four countries cape verde djibouti congo and mozambique all the other african countries have debt to gdp ratio averaging 60 a debt to gdp ratio of 60 is the imf s and african monetary co operation program s threshold for prudent debt levels the scale of debt issuances in africa amounts to only 1 of the continent s total gdp annually whose average annual growth rate is 4 in simple terms this means the value of income generation is higher than the rate of government debt accumulation these ratios gives a snapshot of the a country s fiscal sustainability on the contrary the amount of interest expenditure has been disproportionate to the debt to gdp ratio studies show that in developed economies an increase of 1 in debt to gdp ratio is associated with an increase of between 0 02 and 0 03 in interest rates african governments are paying interest of 5 to 16 on 10 year government bonds compared to near zero to negative rates in europe and america on average the interest repayment is the highest expenditure portion and remains the fastest growth expenditure in sub saharan africa s fiscal budgets the rising interest rates on africa s debt should be of major concern african countries are shortchanging themselves by accepting high yield curves in their eurobond initial public offerings this unjustifiably cements the perception that they are high risk issuers the drivers the high interest rates are driven by several key factors first the mismatch between the short term duration of the debt that african governments have taken on by issuing eurobonds compared to the long term nature of the infrastructure projects they propose to fund with the money raised through eurobonds the excessive need to attract investors is forcing african governments to borrow short term to finance long term projects second fungibility of eurobonds proceeds flexibility to be utilised for purposes other than the ones they were raise for exposes the funds to the downside vulnerabilities of misappropriation and nonproductive expenditures third poor credit ratings as the majority of countries are in junk status credit ratings are pivotal in determination of both interest rates and the demand for bonds the weaknesses of rating agencies risk assessments have widely been criticised according to sovereign credit methodologies of the big three rating agencies economic growth is a decisive factor in past sovereign credit events there is a strong positive correlation between economic strength and credit worthiness but in africa high economic growth has not translated into better sovereign ratings despite consistent positive economic growth averaging 3 6 among 32 rated african states data show that the number of downgrades and negative outlooks are almost double that of

boomers think socialism is a relic and they re right that the word can be politically toxic to millions of older voters socialism smells of a discredited past which is not good news for self described socialists trying to win in swing districts but the cold war is not the whole story in fact the renewed enthusiasm for socialism is entirely consistent with historical patterns of political responses to major economic dislocation at nearly every moment when huge technological advances have changed the nature of work check or created sky high income inequality check or economic downturns that have resulted in mass hardship check americans have turned to socialist ideas to strengthen the social safety net the american socialist movement began in the early 20th century with labor leaders demanding better worker protections a minimum wage and the abolition of child labor all ideas that would eventually be accepted by both major parties it was a time of vast economic inequality when a railroad tycoon had a toilet seat covered in 23 karat gold while millions of families worked 80 hour weeks in dangerous factories if the people who were making policies were smart said michael carter a shaggy haired dsa member who worked for bernie sanders and later served as deputy campaign manager for alexandria ocasio cortez they might realize that taking us to levels of inequality not seen since the gilded age might take us to similar politics of the gilded age after the stock market crashed in 1929 america was once again at a moment of massive inequality and again responded with efforts to strengthen the social safety net three years into the great depression franklin delano roosevelt embarked on a series of government interventions in the economy designed to protect americans from the ravages of the free market the new deal he reorganized the banks through the emergency banking act put three million men to work planting an astonishing three billion trees in the civilian conservation corps and created millions more temporary government jobs through the works progress administration and other new agencies he regulated wall street for the first time by establishing the securities and exchange commission and legalized collective bargaining the key to union power through the national labor relations act he created universal pensions also known as social security and ensured federal government protections for orphans and the disabled even though the new deal perpetuated racial inequalities people of color were largely excluded from the newly created jobs and the easy access to homeownership that would come after the war it was still the largest expansion of the social safety net in american history fdr called the new deal bold persistent experimentation his critics called it socialist beginning an 85 year tradition of republican attacks one republican member of congress called the new deal undisguised state socialism while another said that roosevelt was a socialist not a democrat these attacks angered the highly pragmatic fdr who when asked his political philosophy answered i m a christian and a democrat that s all former new york governor al smith a democrat gave a speech smearing the new deal as communist and un american get the platform of the democratic party and get the platform of the socialist party and lay them down on your dining room table side by side and get a heavy lead pencil and scratch out the word democratic and scratch out the word socialist he told a crowd at the american liberty league dinner in 1936 there can be only one atmosphere of government the clear pure fresh air of a free america or the foul breath of communistic russia fdr s allegedly socialist tax policies sustained american growth for a generation despite the vast expansion of social protections in the new deal most actual socialists thought it didn t go far enough like occupy activists 80 years later they wanted the president to dismantle the system entirely not just reform it and fdr opposed the creation of public sector unions arguing they would require state governments to essentially negotiate against themselves but fdr also fought for programs that would be considered radically left even by today s standards he wanted cradle to grave social security for all americans essentially a universal basic income but never proposed it because he thought it was politically impossible in 1942 five months after the united states entered world war ii he asked congress to increase the top marginal tax rate to a level that would virtually eliminate great wealth discrepancies between low personal incomes and very high personal incomes should be lessened he said i therefore believe that in time of this grave national danger when all excess income should go to win the war no american citizen ought to have a net income after he has paid his taxes of more than 25 000 a year that s roughly 400 000 in 2019 dollars but part of roosevelt s genius was realizing that ideology was irrelevant for most mainstream american voters he didn t care about the semantics as long as the new deal worked when asked about the political philosophy behind the tennessee valley authority he said it s neither fish nor fowl but whatever it is it will taste awfully good to the people of the tennessee valley almost nine decades later pete buttigieg would have a similar answer when asked about whether the democrats should embrace socialist ideas for years socialism has been used as a kill switch to just stop an idea from being talked about but if you re from my generation the real interest is is an idea good or not he said on morning joe in february 2019 we don t care whether it reads to some conservatives as more socialist or not we care about whether it works the new deal exacerbated the racial wealth gap by enshrining redlining as federal policy which barred people of color from accessing the homes and opportunities to build generational wealth that were newly available to white families but the government programs and the subsequent government funded mobilization for world war ii created a stable middle class of white parents who raised boomers in an era of relative income equality and unprecedented prosperity fdr s allegedly socialist tax policies sustained american growth for a generation the top marginal tax rate topped 90 percent throughout the 1950s then was cut to 70 percent in the 1960s and 1970s while most wealthy americans found loopholes to shrink their effective tax rates the basic structure worked well it paid for social welfare programs and ambitious infrastructure projects such as the interstate highway system while lessening income inequality in what was then the greatest economic expansion in world history the top marginal tax rate didn t fall below 50 percent until the late 1980s when ronald reagan slashed it to 28 percent but thanks to deregulation and privatization in the 1980s and 1990s income inequality today is back where it was before the great depression according to historian jill lepore in 1928 the top 1 percent of american families earned 24 percent of all income but income inequality shrank significantly in the 1940s by 1944 the middle class had grown and the top 1 percent earned only about 11 percent of the total but by 2011 gilded age income gaps had returned the top 1 percent were again earning 24 percent of all income giving the united states the highest inequality of any western democracy moments of great change the industrial or the digital revolution are times when you see an interest in socialism rise at the same time the economy changed faster than the people who worked in it the nature of work was morphing so quickly in the early 21st century that many people felt the benefits and protections of stable employment being ripped out from under them just as workers in the late 19th century had to navigate the new factory exploitations of the industrial economy workers in the early 21st century had to adjust to unpredictable gig work in a digital economy moments of great change the industrial or the digital revolution are times when you see an interest in socialism rise says john nichols author of the s word a short history of an american tradition if you don t get your health benefits from your work because your work has been so redefined that you re a freelancer then you re really going to be saying where does my health care come from that was exactly what many young people were wondering how would they get health insurance when so many of the jobs they could get didn t offer employer sponsored plans how would they afford college when the government no longer subsidized higher education the way it once did those were exactly the questions bernie sanders wanted to answer millennials had been socialist curious for a while but bernie sanders s 2016 presidential campaign was an ideological turning point for many left leaning young people sanders offered universal solutions that seemed to match the scope of the problems young people faced health care is too expensive medicare for all student debt weighing you down free college can t make ends meet raise the minimum wage to fifteen dollars an hour as obama s vision of a unified america was increasingly seeming like fantasy bernie seemed to be speaking truth to power when he drew battle lines and pointed at a real enemy the millionaires and billionaires who benefited from a rigged system that allowed dark money to flow into political coffers never mind that by the time sanders was delivering this message again in his 2020 campaign he had become a millionaire himself thanks to his bestselling book obama had talked about us bernie pointed at them he called bs on the system that young people knew was broken and he told them who to blame for it it was an argument that appealed to well educated downwardly mobile millennials who felt they had done everything right but were still getting left behind there are a lot of people who are deeply invested in telling us that there s nothing we can do that we have no way to change the economy to better reflect human needs that all we can do is tinker around the edges with tax rates and this and that instead of actually imagining a future that is up to the challenges that we face says michael carter the democratic socialist who organized for progressive candidates like sanders and alexandria a lot of the attraction is the imagination we re a generation that was told we can be anything we want to be that we re able to change the world meanwhile all the baby boomers are like we re not gonna change anything and we want all the money still and just chill out bernie sanders lost the primary but his campaign served as a crash course in democratic socialism for an entire generation of young voters just as hillary s loss spurred a defiant horde of liberal women to avenge her defeat bernie s loss and trump s subsequent win drove many young leftists to preach the gospel of socialism after trump won the dsa more than quadrupled its membership to thirty five thousand less than the capacity of fenway park but still a sign of vitality on the progressive left by 2019 democratic socialism had so deeply pervaded millennial attitudes that even young republicans acknowledged its appeal the socialist craze was a cultural movement as well as a political one in hipster brooklyn the moral clarity of socialism seemed fresh and electric while obama style technocratic moderation began to seem dumpy and outdated trump s election had made mainstream democrats seem not only ineffective but deeply uncool when boomers tried to lecture millennials about chairman mao or the dysfunction of eastern european postwar economies it only reinforced how much they were stuck in the politics of the past the more the establishment denigrated socialism the more young progressives embraced it in leftist online circles neoliberal was thrown around with the force of a sick burn usernames flanked by red rose emojis the signifier of socialist sympathies became more and more common on social media and dating apps new york magazine even ran a cover story called when did everyone become a socialist according to john della volpe of harvard s institute of politics by 2018 only 43 percent of 18 to 29 year olds said they supported capitalism while 39 percent said they supported democratic socialism and even if they didn t quite embrace the label many young people were embracing socialist ideas the poll found strong majority support for medicare for all a federal jobs guarantee and tuition free public college gallup found that young people s approval of capitalism had dropped 23 points between 2010 and 2018 by 2019 democratic socialism had so deeply pervaded millennial attitudes that even young republicans acknowledged its appeal in one 2019 poll roughly 30 percent of republicans under 35 and 75 percent of young democrats said they thought the word socialism had a positive connotation and that there was an unfairness in the economic system that favored the wealthy these were young people who were still calling themselves republicans in 2019 establishment liberals were appalled by the youthful lurch to the left while republicans were thrilled experienced democrats worried with good reason that embracing socialism would alienate moderate and conservative boomers in swing districts who bristled at the idea of a socialist revolution that might take away more of their money medicare for all sounded good those democrats noted but 150 000 000 americans got employer based health insurance and many millions of them wanted to keep it those democrats preferred a public option which pete would eventually refer to as medicare for all who want it when an nyu student asked nancy pelosi in 2017 whether there was room for democrats to move left on economic issues she replied curtly we re capitalists two years later she sharpened her criticism i do reject socialism she told 60 minutes that is not the view of the democratic party republicans of course had a field day socialism quickly became the de facto attack line on fox news with sean hannity airing monologues about the radical far left democratic party and the dangers of socialism and tucker carlson devoting whole segments to ridiculing democratic socialists as his 2020 reelection bid approached trump painted the democrats as the party of socialists in his 2019 state of the union he vowed that america will never be a socialist country speaking to the conservative political action conference in 2019 trump said we believe in the american dream not the socialist nightmare but for a generation who hadn t grown up with the soviet threat that attack line had lost its bite the gop had been crying wolf about socialism for so long most recently calling obama a socialist for trying to expand health care access even though his plan was based off one from a conservative think tank that they inadvertently linked the term with policies that were overwhelmingly popular with young people i think the right did us a service calling obama a socialist for eight years saikat chakrabarti one of alexandria s earliest allies told the new yorker it inoculated us but people focus on the labels when they are not sure what they mean what people call socialism these days is eisenhower republicanism __________________________________ from the ones we

the potential impact since the coronavirus situation is still very dynamic magnachip historically has experienced typical seasonal softness and a decline in revenue in its first quarter as compared to the prior fourth quarter but we entered 2020 with a more optimistic view prior to the coronavirus outbreak our preliminary internal forecast had anticipated q1 2020 revenue would be slighter higher than the 200 million in revenue we reported in q4 2019 magnachip s manufacturing supply chain resides largely outside china so there is negligible impact on our results however based on our preliminary assessments public health measures taken in china to protect the population likely will affect customer demand in q1 as a result we ve lowered our internal expectation and widened the typical guidance range we normally would provide for q1 2020 to help account for lingering uncertainty around this public health crisis while actual results may vary based upon events that are still unfolding magnachip currently anticipates based on best available current estimates in q1 2020 revenue to be in the range of 180 million to 195 million down 6 2 at the mid point of the projected range when compared with revenue of 200 0 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 and up 19 1 year over year when compared to revenue of 157 4 million in the first quarter of 2019 to down 6 2 at the mid point of the projected range when compared with revenue of in the fourth quarter of 2019 and up 19 1 year over year when compared to revenue of in the first quarter of 2019 gross profit margin to be in the range of 23 to 25 when compared to 26 6 in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 14 4 in the first quarter of 2019 ceo yj kim comments on business highlights revenue of 200 0 million was the highest level achieved in a fourth quarter since 2012 primarily due to significantly better than expected revenue for our oled display drivers as well as better than expected revenue in our foundry business oled revenue in the fourth quarter increased two fold year over year driven primarily by a sharp increase in demand for our latest generation 28 nanometer display drivers we enter 2020 with an oled driver lineup about twice as large as a year ago and we re positioned for continued long term growth with oled drivers that meet the dual technical requirements for low power and high resolution displays in next generation 5g enabled smartphones and new foldables power revenue declined 18 1 more than had been expected in q4 due to pricing pressure and weakness in the industrial and television markets however power revenue in 2019 showed growth for the third consecutive year and revenue from premium power products increased by more than 20 in 2019 over the prior year our foundry revenue in the fourth quarter increased 4 2 year over year and was at the highest level for 8 foundry revenue since our initial public offering in 2011 strategic evaluation process we continue to make substantial progress in discussions with multiple interested parties toward a possible sale of the business as well as consideration of accretive business conversions and other options we reiterate that our decisions regarding the outcome of the various options of the strategic evaluation process will be guided by what the board and management consider to be the best available path to improve magnachip s profitability and to maximize shareholder value fourth quarter financial review total revenue total revenue in the fourth quarter was 200 0 million up 11 5 as compared to reported revenue of 179 4

margin in the fourth quarter was 26 1 as compared with 23 2 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 28 3 in the third quarter of 2019 the yoy in the foundry services group s gross profit margin was

victim offender reconciliation programs can have a positive impact on both offenders and victims in my experience during my career as a prosecutor however i ve found that most crime victims are more interested in maintaining no contact with the offenders who victimized them i understand that this is a deeply personal decision for crime victims who wish to take part in a victim offender reconciliation program the tennessee department of correction administers one through its victim services office if crime victims are interested in participating in a reconciliation program i wholeheartedly encourage them to explore this option q what is a criminal court judge s role with regard to restoration of rights petitions and expungements a as criminal court judge i am responsible for approving expunctions of eligible records from my court this usually involves a legal determination of whether certain records are eligible for expunction i am very familiar with this area of law due to my involvement as deputy district attorney general in the d a s expungement court this law is designed to allow offenders who have made positive progress in their lives to obtain a fresh start and a second chance similarly tennessee law allows for circuit level judges such as me to consider whether to restore citizenship rights to citizens who had lost those rights due to a previous criminal conviction again this is an area of the law in which i worked during my time as deputy district attorney general i also worked in this area during my service as assistant attorney general at the state attorney general s office in nashville i understand the importance of these issues to both the petitioning citizen as well as the state q can you provide an example of when you expanded access to justice for marginalized citizens a as stated above i was involved in the operation of the d a s expungement court during my time as deputy district attorney general the expungement court was created by d a charme allen and court clerk mike hammond to streamline and cut red tape in what had become an overly confusing and complex process expungement court creates a one stop process where citizens or their attorneys may obtain expunction of eligible records the success of this program and its reliance on student volunteers from my alma mater the university of tennessee college of law is highlighted in the article on the right side of change available at law utk edu citizens should not be deprived of their legal rights simply because the process is too complex or because they cannot afford to hire a lawyer to help them i am proud of the work of everybody involved in the expungement court and the valuable service it provides to our community wesley stone party republican

electstoneforjudge q describe the role that you see victim offender reconciliation playing in your court a the role of victim offender reconciliation in my court will be based upon the law and the individual victim s preferences crime victims do not deserve to be victimized again by our judiciary the law provides many protections for victims of all crimes and i will respect and enforce those protections to the fullest extent possible under the law often offenders have a strong genuine desire to apologize and accept responsibility for their actions while i will encourage victims to reconcile with the people who perpetrate crimes against them victims have a right to not reconcile those differences i will scrupulously honor this preference i will evaluate the need for a program for victim offender reconciliation and the advantages and disadvantages of such program for both the parties involved and the community q what is a criminal court judge s role with regard to restoration of rights petitions and expungements a a criminal court judge s role regarding restoration of rights petitions and expungements is to both encourage offenders to pursue these petitions and strictly and promptly follow the letter of the law when evaluating and either approving or denying these petitions convictions carry significant collateral consequences for offenders in their daily lives including employment opportunities housing and financing needs along with the ability to vote and run for public office since the law provides offenders the opportunity to remove some of the collateral consequences and disabilities associated with convictions ensuring people have their citizenship rights restored consistent with the law is a necessary function of a criminal court judge that i will promptly fulfill likewise i will strictly and promptly apply the law when a person seeks expungement of their public records relating to both specific enumerated convictions and charges that were dismissed q can you provide an example of when you expanded access to justice for marginalized citizens a beginning on the first day i started practicing law as a private attorney over 19 years ago i began expanding access to justice for marginalized citizens by accepting court appointments to represent people of limited means these appointments include representing parents and children in situations where children were removed from the home matters where children were accused of being delinquent by violating the criminal law and cases where adults were charged with violating the criminal law i earned a whole new appreciation for the need to provide high quality representation to people of limited means i discovered the additional need to assist these clients with substance abuse issues mental health issues and often the co occurrence of these two barriers to success i still provide access to justice for marginalized clients in both state and federal court in instances where they are charged with violating the criminal law public defender 6th judicial district sherif guindi party independent campaign address 6407 orchard ave knoxville tn 37919 campaign

public defenders but all states do not a what are the advantages and disadvantages of elected public defenders and b do you support electing public defenders why or why not a the advantages of being an elected public defender is that more funding is available to your office the use of case workers social workers and in house support staff the disadvantage is the stigma that the public has that they are being shuffled through the criminal justice system i do support the public defender as an elected position i think the people of knox county should elect their government to protect the criminal justice system from all appearances that a government can charge you with a crime prosecute you and then defend you does not convey a democracy they should be separate and not appointed q it is common knowledge that public defenders have excessive workloads what would you do if you are elected and find that your staff lawyers have too many cases a we should be able to get more funding for staff lawyers to provide effective representation if the case load is too heavy then the public defender should conflict off the case and allow a private attorney to provide the best effective representation q we understand that the clo has great staff attorneys yet clients sometimes often say that they don t want a public defender they want a real lawyer a what is the greatest source of friction between public defenders and their clients b what would be your plan to overcome that a there are often brand new attorneys straight out of law school with no experience and they appear to be afraid to fight for their clients the public perception is that they don t want to spend the time on their clients because they have too many cases to attend to and do not build a relationship and trust with their client as a private attorney who takes on cases where the public defender has a conflict their is a huge sigh of relief that they are not being shuffled through the system there should be training for new attorney s to build relationships with their clients as a community law office they are often dealing with multiple people and may not get individual one on one attention studies have shown with the department of justice that people who trust their lawyer and feel that their lawyer is looking out for them and will fight for them feel they are treated fairly and had

electericlutton q tennessee elects their district public defenders but all states do not a what are the advantages and disadvantages of elected public defenders and b do you support electing public defenders why or why not a tennessee is one of only two states in the union that has a statewide system of elected public defenders so it is rare in the united states to have an elected public defender however being elected does offer some autonomy because the public defender does not have to answer to a governing body that may have a different agenda than the voters the downside is that public defenders by definition will be representing citizens accused of crimes some of which may be graphic and horrific in nature the public defender needs to be able to represent the client and his or her interests and cannot concern themselves with whether or not the representation is popular with the community i do support electing our public defender because we do serve the citizens of knox county and it seems to me that the citizens should have a voice in who their public officials are q it is common knowledge that public defenders have excessive workloads what would you do if you are elected and find that your staff lawyers have too many cases a i am the current public defender and i can tell you that my staff does have too many cases the department of justice and the american bar association commissioned a study of caseloads and the resulting report was issued by the national advisory commission on criminal justice standards and goals the resulting recommendations are referred to as national advisory commission standards in their study they came to the conclusion that no public defender should handle more than 150 felony cases or 400 misdemeanor cases in a given year ideally attorneys should handle some smaller percentage of those numbers since those caseload standards are considered to be the absolute most anyone can reasonably be expected to handle we have attorneys handling nearly double that number of cases it is always a battle for resources and i have been trying to educate the community and lawmakers about how overworked we are we have a dedicated staff of 28 lawyers who will keep fighting the good fight until we can get additional resources q we understand that the clo has great staff attorneys yet clients sometimes often say that they don t want a public defender they want a real lawyer a what is the greatest source of friction between public defenders and their clients b what would be your plan to overcome that a public defender clients did not get to choose their lawyer which creates mistrust in the beginning of the relationship clients sometimes operate under the misconception that public defenders are only doing this until they can get a job as a d a or judge and have no loyalty to the client some clients literally believe that public defenders aren t actually lawyers when i started as an assistant public defender i was surprised at how many clients thought that i hadn t been to law school some even thought that you could be a pd with just a high school education clients also understand that we are overworked they see us in court sometimes with 25 30 cases on the docket and 6 different court to be in and so they recognize that we do not have as much time for their case as a private attorney we overcome it by doing excellent work for our clients and spending lots of time at the jail with our clients a client can tell when their attorney cares about them and the outcome of their case assessor of property

park city community both my husband and i have been and continue to be concerned about the rising cost of purchasing a home and the high cost of rent and utilities many people face in our community what s needed is a multi pronged strategy that explores federal tax credits public private partnerships and economic investment and access to capital for entrepreneurial opportunities in the 1st

the rest of district 1 is still struggling with disinvestment as it relates to housing and business it will be imperative to use the smart growth principles to help address housing and business growth in district 1 while maintaining the culture of the community the best way to solve this issue is by the listening to the voices of those who live and work in the area and to advocate for those solutions to be executed restoring the burlington station burlington business district is part of my platform because the burlington area has the great potential to becoming a vibrant cultural and economic downtown of east knox county this will promote business growth within the community and the county the increase in housing will follow the business growth q what will you do to increase

how will you address housing and business growth in knox county a the most pressing issue facing knox county is development with minimal regard for its effect on residents our infrastructure has not kept pace with growth there have been too many situations where residents have had to fight the loss of homes or experienced flooding because of insufficient storm water construction due to development traffic saturation in residential areas is also becoming a problem for example the growth of the broadway corridor while great for business has inadvertently caused neighborhood streets to be used as cut throughs and decreased the safety of those neighborhoods as county commissioner i would insist development plans included complete studies that go beyond addressing the obvious effects and that include forethought with bordering neighborhoods roads schools and businesses q what will you do to increase affordable housing for low income families in the county a affordable housing and business growth can be complimentary in fact the national low income housing coalition advocates investing in new housing construction designed to accommodate low income families local governments routinely offer corporations incentives in an effort to bring new businesses housing developers could be offered similar incentives while meeting certain requirements to build new affordable housing units targeting low income families this year is the last year of the five year consolidated plan for community development block grants and home investment partnership funds this plan will need to be re evaluated and extended to ensure affordable housing rehabilitation to county residents i would also investigate extending volunteer financial assistance and educational programs similar to operation backyard homebuyer readiness and neighborhood housing through knoxville leadership foundation as well as increasing support for underperforming schools q will you support increasing the county s property tax rate to pay for infrastructure improvements why or why not a governments provide services services cost money as the cost of services increase the government is faced with the fundamental question to cut services or raise taxes to say that i would never raise taxes would be unrealistic and irresponsible the first step would be to ensure all cost saving measures had been attempted and found to be insufficient the current budget would need to be analyzed to confirm there is no wasteful spending in which funds could be reallocated i will always be cognizant of the impact tax increases have on those who bear the burden you and i our friends families and neighbors if the need arises to raise taxes i will do so with the greatest care infrastructure improvements should be made anytime there is growth i have been informed by residents of my district that roads schools libraries and general infrastructure improvements are a priority to them we need to put our

website grantforcommission com facebook page facebook com grantforcommission q how will you address housing and business growth in knox county a i believe in responsible long term planning as our region continues to grow we must be prepared for that growth that means we need the appropriate infrastructure stormwater transportation schools parks etc to support and leverage quality development i consider myself pro growth because that is the best way to keep our tax rate low however i would not approve a rezoning or project that shifts an undue burden onto taxpayers such as unmitigated traffic issues school overcrowding or stormwater runoff i would like to see land use policies that prioritize redevelopment of underutilized property leverage private investment in our urban neighborhoods and encourage more density along major corridors these areas already have most of the infrastructure and services in place so the growth results in a greater net benefit to the county tax base q what will you do to increase affordable housing for low income families in the county a first off by encouraging more density along our corridors we increase the supply of available housing if we have more supply prices should come down in addition the city county and kcdc need to be aligned in utilizing federal state and local funds to ensure our low income families have access to safe affordable housing poverty in our community doesn t recognize municipal boundaries so we need to approach solutions by working together along the same lines we also need to consider education proximity to employment and transportation and land use policies that consider public health outcomes lower housing prices and rental rates are only one part of the equation we need a holistic approach to assisting low income families throughout our community q will you support increasing the county s property tax rate to pay for infrastructure improvements why or why not a the county is in good financial shape with a strong bond rating and a healthy rainy day fund but our debt burden is pushing its capacity due to strong economic growth knox county has not had a property tax increase since 1999 when it was raised 0 55 the tax rate has actually dropped 1 20 since then generally i don t think government can tax itself into prosperity and i believe the county should continue to responsibly manage expenses and focus on economic growth however if as a community we decide we need to make important investments in public education or infrastructure that have a demonstrated return of strong economic growth i would rather pay for those investments upfront rather than burden future generations with deferred costs or insoluble debt county commissioner district 4 scott broyles

housing and business growth should take place the mayor s pro developer plans tva tower deal change to sidewalk ordinance proposed changes to the growth policy plan have us on the wrong path into the future i am for reasonable and responsible development in knox county i am strongly in favor of anything that improves walkability in the county i e sidewalks and greenways all new development should take account of climate issues such as the flooding we have been experiencing the last couple of years as county commissioner i would be a voice for a process that takes into account all people who are affected by development not just the people who stand to make money from the development q what will you do to increase affordable housing for low income families in the county a county commissioners have two ways to affect the amount of affordable housing for low income families in the county first while the mayor drafts the budget it must be approved by the commission i will use my voice on the commission and my vote on budgetary issues to make sure that appropriate funds are spent on projects to increase affordable housing in last year s budget the mayor cut funding to indigent care in order to help balance his budget i will vote no on any budget with similar cuts to programs designed to help low income families second the commission plays a big part in zoning in the county a big part of making housing more affordable for all residents of knox county is to follow a plan of reasonable and responsible development in order to increase affordable housing for low income families the commission should be more open to general residential or multi family neighborhood zoning rather than just single family housing q will you support increasing the county s property tax rate to pay for infrastructure improvements why or why not a i believe it is irresponsible for any elected official to pledge that they would never raise taxes it does a disservice to the residents of knox county to try to balance a budget on cuts alone as the mayor did last year with his cut to the indigent care program i think if knox county is going to consider increasing taxes it should be done through a property tax increase rather than through sales taxes sales taxes are regressive and hit hardest the poorest among us i would not tie a property tax increase to any specific item in the budget although schools teacher pay and infrastructure are big needs instead i would evaluate the need for a property tax increase based on whether the needs in knox county are appropriately funded if they cannot be paid for by existing revenue streams i would advocate and vote for a property tax increase to balance the budget for all needs i would strongly oppose any attempt by the mayor to make cuts to programs to balance his budget kyle ward party republican campaign address 2042 town center blvd suite 117 knoxville tn 37922 campaign phone 865 214 7376 campaign email votekyleward gmail com

local business with employees i experience first hand the challenges of business growth in our community and the need for affordable housing my goal is to continue to improve on making knox county a desirable location for businesses and families alike we can help do this by prioritizing education improving on our infrastructure needs and keeping taxes low so this remains a desirable location q what will you do to increase affordable housing for low income families in the county a unnecessary and burdensome regulations can harm affordable housing in our community developers need the liberty to innovate and adapt to our communities changing needs and policies need to be put in place that best provide for the residents of knox county and help affordable housing in our community cities which have high regulations and stringent land use regulations like san francisco are a warning for the entire country not to follow their example i want knox county to have the most vibrant housing market in the state q will you support increasing the county s property tax rate to pay for infrastructure improvements why or why not a i will not support an increase in property taxes at current tax rates a budget problem is a spending problem not a revenue problem that means prioritizing spending to focus on infrastructure and education we are going to grow knox county by keeping money in the hands of our community s businesses and consumers mayor jacobs has pledged to not raise property taxes and he is implementing cost savings through responsible budgeting with these cost savings and revenue growth from more economic development we can invest in necessary infrastructure improvements county commissioner district 5 kimberly peterson party democrat campaign address 12907 meadow

will you address housing and business growth in knox county a growth and development is the biggest challenge facing knox county we must develop and implement a strategic plan which anticipates our future needs currently developers are building with little regard to how the people in the area of development will be impacted we are seeing the aftermath of poor planning with flooding problems and increased traffic county growth was last addressed in the growth policy plan executed in 2001 the plan is a good blueprint of smart development placing restrictions and guidelines to prevent urban sprawl and to maintain rural areas our mayor with the approval of both the county commission and city council tried to rescind those protections i was pleased to see farragut stand for the community by saying proposed growth must contain clear provisions for infrastructure roads utilities storm water sewer drainage systems i would revisit and update the growth policy plan with the input of the community and neighborhood associations q what will you do to increase affordable housing for low income families in the county a increasing affordable housing will be addressed through an update of the comprehensive plan for housing due june 2020 we must get creative to our approach to solving the problem we can create housing trust funds and help with down payment assistance by dedicating a percentage of revenue earned from sources like real estate transfer fees and or recording fees for this purpose the county can mandate inclusionary zoning ordinances which require a percentage of affordability in new development we should also explore community land trusts fee programs linkage or impact fees could charge developers a fee for different types of development which would create funds to produce affordable housing more affordable housing can be obtained if we look to successful models from around the country and be willing to embrace innovative strategic ideas q will you support increasing the county s property tax rate to pay for infrastructure improvements why or why not a i do not take the decision to raise property taxes lightly i would conduct a budget review to identify areas that could be trimmed without a detrimental effect however i would not rule out a property tax increase we do not have adequate infrastructure the current budget does not include adequate funds to invest in infrastructure the county has not raised property taxes since 1999 conversely the city has had two property tax increases city property owners had incremental tax increases which generated dollars to reinvest in the community this is a strategy worth exploring for the county many want low taxes to entice people relocating to our area yet if we invest in our infrastructure public schools libraries roads and utilities up front funded by property tax increases the more attractive our county will be ultimately property values will rise a possible property tax increase could be an investment in the future of a healthy and desirable county john schoonmaker party republican campaign address 10044 tan rara drive knoxville tn 37922 campaign email jschoonmaker tds net facebook page facebook com schoonmakerforcommission q how will you address housing and business growth in knox county a as a member of the farragut west knox county chamber i have been extremely supportive of our business community in the 5th district we have a need for more flexible use office space for startups and small businesses to encourage future business growth countywide we should continue to work with our existing business base to find additional opportunities such as supplier chains for current businesses and have them relocate to our area with regard to housing the 5th district comprises one of the largest bedroom communities for the county and is almost at capacity in order to expand our county s housing opportunities we need infrastructure improvements in the east and south county areas i am not against growth or development but i do think we need to consider the impact of growth and development on our infrastructure and develop a plan to take care of the increased wear and tear that will result from additional growth and development q what will you do to increase affordable housing for low income families in the county a in the 26 000 acres of my district the town of farragut controls about 40 of the land and the city of knoxville controls about 4 5 that leaves approximately 55 of the 5th district controlled by the county unfortunately there are not many tracts of land in that 55 that are still available for housing development a successful location for low income housing should be close to retail shopping areas and be adjacent to kat s bus line for transportation needs currently this service only extents westward to seven oaks drive i believe city council and county commission should develop a joint task force to discuss the available locations in the city or county that would be most practical for low income housing then we could partner with the state and federal government for grant opportunities to assist with funding these developments q will you support increasing the county s property tax rate to pay for infrastructure improvements why or why not a i do not support a property tax increase nor do i support a sales tax increase as chairman of the commission s finance committee i have the knowledge and experience to find other ways of increasing funding for issues that are important to the citizens of knox county without the need to raise taxes last year i wrote and filed a bill with the tennessee state legislature that will save over 1 million annually for the town of farragut knox county and the city of knoxville combined additionally a new law was passed that will allow a larger percentage of collected sales tax revenue to flow into knox county from purchases made online this new law does not increase sales tax it just reallocates the funds to the county a portion of these two funding sources could be earmarked for infrastructure these are just two examples of ways the county could stay on budget and still take care of needed improvements clayton wood party republican campaign address 10113 tan rara drive knoxville tn 37922 campaign phone 865 255 7911 campaign email claytonswood gmail com campaign website claytonforcommission com facebook page facebook com claytonwoodforcommissioner q how will you address housing and business growth in knox county a i think that planned growth is vastly preferable to unplanned growth this means that infrastructure is built out in forward thinking ways with arterial connectors that are zoned for higher density nearby some people want to live in an area where they can walk to a bookstore a restaurant an art gallery and live near lots of neighbors with no yards some people want to live on some land without neighbors nearby private property rights should be respected while knox county should move forward with a clear infrastructure plan that stays ahead of traffic and flooding and sprawl many of the people in the 5th district have visited seaside and 30a and have seen dense development done well and development done poorly you do not have to choose between being pro neighborhood or pro development wise public policy enables smart growth that allows for different housing and commercial options q what will you do to increase affordable housing for low income families in the county a i think public private partnerships should continue in this area and it is an area where we are seeing success east tennessee housing development corporation is headed by my friend saundra swink and makes incredible homes that are energy efficient which is critically important in providing low income families with housing they can afford my friend kelle shultz at habitat for humanity continues to make home ownership possible for many low income families my friend ben bentley at knoxville s community development corporation is doing a great job adding low income housing an entire street of new housing for seniors is right around the corner from my favorite local lunch spot vol market on western avenue even with the massive rent increases i have seen in lonsdale in the last 8 years there are still homes available for under 100 000 the homes need a lot of work which is a reason i am excited to see expanded vocational training helping families get a place to live and skills to earn income is a great path forward q will you support increasing the county s property tax rate to pay for infrastructure improvements why or why not a no i do not support it a property tax increase is very hard on seniors with a fixed income and on the working poor renters are passed those increased costs directly we face significant infrastructure costs and we also have significant infrastructure funding opportunities coming at both the state and federal level with planned projects that are presented well knox county can increasingly attract state and federal dollars to improve our infrastructure ron williams the mayor of farragut has demonstrated acumen in this area and i believe soon will be able to secure the needed funding to fix the campbell station exit on 40 the answer to infrastructure needs is not asking for more tax money from those who cannot afford it it is instead to show wisdom in planning and securing funding our state is going to send money from their surplus for infrastructure and i believe we can expect bipartisan support for a federal infrastructure bill that will make funds available as well county commissioner district 6 terry hill party republican campaign address 8609

county a there are a number of things about knox county and its surrounding region that make it an attractive place for people to locate among those are an improving education system low taxes the sheer beauty of east tennessee and a technology corridor from the university of tennessee to oak ridge as our county grows it is vital that we steward that growth with good planning under mayor jacobs leadership the county is about to embark upon a two year comprehensive transportation study that will include analysis of infrastructure needs such as roads utilities and public safety there is a housing shortage in our county especially among homes under 200 000 in value the only way this shortage can be properly addressed is to improve our existing infrastructure i am definitely not anti growth growth is coming and we must take a progressive thoughtful and proactive approach to planning or we will simply end up with bad growth leading to economic and transportation gridlock q what will you do to increase affordable housing for low income families in the county a with respect to the housing shortage the lack of housing for low income and working class families is an issue we must address this is primarily a planning issue i consider growth development and planning to be the number one issue facing our county both now and in the future we must clearly identify and address our infrastructure needs so that we can determine the best locations for affordable housing and work with developers who have a proven history of producing quality affordable housing q will you support increasing the county s property tax rate to pay for infrastructure improvements why or why not a i am fundamentally a proponent of low taxes and limited government i believe as a property and sales tax state tennessee has chosen the most fair and equitable system of taxation i do not believe a property tax increase is needed in knox county as this time however i do recognize that our need for infrastructure improvements may be extensive in the foreseeable future and i am committed to keep an open mind when it comes to other taxation options since there are multiple ways taxes can be

interest in having a board member that will be active and engaged in the schools in district 2 so that the specific needs of each school are understood i believe that relationships are critical to make well informed sound decisions for the people whom you represent i have been and will continue to be active in the schools and seek out opportunities weekly where i can support and listen q if elected how will you ensure knox county schools achieves the disparities task force goals during your first term a we have to continue looking for ways to reach kids other than suspending them from school or sending them to iss kids that are acting out are usually doing so for a reason and teachers that sincerely care are looking for new methods and experimenting with suggestions from the task force i am in the equipment finance business and when we have programs that work we foster them when we have programs that do not work we change them or cut them many of the disciplinary actions that worked in the past are not working now so new ideas and energy are needed and that is what i hope to bring i ve become friends with bryson rosser over the last few years and watching the way he interacts and mentors kids has been so inspiring i ve seen rob and bob black along with jody wright at fulton develop those same type relationships with kids that change lives we should look at leaders like this for examples of people having a tremendous affect on kids who are often from tough situations q what are your two top budget items on the school board budget a i am thrilled to see the plans that governor lee has in place for teacher pay increases i can think of no better investment than great teachers my wife is a teacher my mother in law is a retired knox county teacher and some of my best friends are teachers these folks all have something in common they are doing it for the kids i want to support and reward good teachers so that we can keep them from leaving for better paying jobs in surrounding counties valid testing the reality is that our kids will be awarded scholarships and admittance to the institutions of their choice based on achievement and test scores we need to encourage entrepreneurship and creative thinking but we must also make sure our students master core subjects critical to their success while testing is necessary we must make sure we are

myself available to anyone who wants to discuss school concerns whether in person by phone or by some form of text message as needed my first priority is to always look at the needs of our students that begins with fully funded schools tennessee schools have been very seriously underfunded for years doing more with less is unreasonable tennessee has a responsibility to provide for the education of our public school students with adequate numbers of teachers counselors social workers school nurses bus drivers textbooks supplies and so on in knox county alone the gap between positions funded and those that are not funded is six hundred positions statewide the gap is 9 000 our commissioners are left to find ways to make up that difference we have to help legislators see how important it is to adequately fund our schools q if elected how will you ensure knox county schools achieves the disparities task force goals during your first term a the deo task force agreed to a timeline that allows rolling out several different trainings to our 8 000 staff members it will be important to continue monitoring each of those trainings to ensure we are on track to have all necessary staff fully trained within that expected timeline as these become fully implemented it will be important to have a board member continuing to work with the steering committee to ensure that progress is being reported to the board in a way that is both timely and accurate reports have not been adequate for the board to be able to see all information needed there are also reports that have been previously requested and are still being requested without answer i will ask that the knox county schools office of research evaluation and accountability be involved in reporting progress regarding the deo goals so that clear timelines and formats can be adopted and followed up on with our administration as well as with the full board of education q what are your two top budget items on the school board budget a the largest part of the budget is people increased staffing for all of our schools is necessary for the success of our students student teacher ratios need to be seriously considered and adjusted to give every student the individual attention needed the next most important budget item would be increasing compensation teachers teaching assistants office staff custodians bus drivers and other support staff in the district have to have compensation that is competitive for us to be able to attract and retain the people we need to help our students reach their full

students parents teachers and administrators i commit to take what i am hearing confidently to the superintendent other school board members and our legislative delegates to push for policies that are student centered allow for teachers to focus on student growth raise the bar to the appropriate height for each student and are equitable in leading the restoration house i am convinced that to create

regularly meet with constituents i am committed to taking a full day per month to formally visit constituents and will intentionally seek out other opportunities in between those formal visits increasing as needed q if elected how will you ensure knox county schools achieves the disparities task force goals during your first term a since the task force was created in 2014 there has been significant ground gained but we are not there yet i will do at least two things to help ensure the goals of the task force are met 1 there was a monumental victory in brown vs education with desegregation for students but not teachers before 1964 nearly half of educated african americans in the south were teachers over the next 10 years 38 000 african american teachers lost their jobs i will work to increase diversity and inclusion among teachers and administrators which numerous studies show improves test scores and reduces suspensions among minority students 2 i will work to engage an organization like the international institute for restorative practices to ensure we have a funded plan to fully roll out restorative practices in every school including training every teacher and staff member that engages students school discipline will not change if only a handful of a given school s teachers are trained q what are your two top budget items on the school board budget a we need to work with our legislators to improve bep funding knox county is at a deficit in almost every way when it comes to the bep losing 70 000 000 annually we also need to help county commission understand exactly how funds are spent and where the gaps are in order to make stronger arguments for additional funding on a local level here are two of my budget priorities 1 ensure our students across the system have access to the very best educational environments this includes funding for providing and replacing 1 to 1 devices in at least middle schools and high schools well resourced arts and music classrooms and robust career technical educational opportunities 2 ensure we are hiring and retaining high quality teachers this includes funding salaries at a level that makes us competitive with surrounding districts providing mental health resources for teachers to increase retention reduce burnout and funding ample numbers of social workers counselors and nurses board of

picture depositphotos com rudall30 owing to their large families the farmers have been running up a tab at the store and they now owe the store a great deal of money so they organize a protest to demand that the store raise its prices on seed fertilizer and the like while reducing the price it will pay for the farmers grains obviously the scenario is absurd paying even higher prices for agricultural supplies and receiving less for what they produce will not help the farmers pay off their tab indeed either change would probably result in higher profits for the store and greater losses for the farmers and their families in this nonsensical parable us president donald trump s administration represents the farmers by accusing china or any other country of currency manipulation the administration is effectively demanding that the chinese appreciate their currency that is make each renminbi cost more in dollars to be sure many politicians over the years have argued that china and other developing and emerging economies manipulate their currency to gain a competitive edge by reducing the purchasing power of their own currencies they can make their exports cost less to foreign buyers while rendering imports more expensive to domestic buyers to account for such concerns the united states has a law mandating that the department of the treasury prepare a biannual report for congress specifying whether any currencies are being manipulated if the treasury does so specify the administration is then expected to carry on talks with the accused country but even then the law mandates no penalties congress has established three criteria to determine whether manipulation has occurred the offending country must have a current account surplus above 3 of gdp it must have intervened in the foreign exchange market to make its currency cheaper and it must have a bilateral surplus with the us in excess of 20 billion in august 2019 china s current account surplus fell below 3 of gdp and the chinese government had previously been intervening not to devalue the renminbi but rather to prevent further depreciation following trump s threats of additional tariffs in the event the us declared china a currency manipulator anyway only to remove the designation as a part of the phase one trade deal agreed in january but in the meantime the trump administration has discovered a new tool with which to bludgeon foreign competitors the department of commerce this month issued a rule that allows for additional levies on imports from countries deemed to be currency manipulators with the percentage increase in the tariff in addition to the statutory tariff and the antidumping or countervailing duty margin being equal to the estimated percentage by which the currency is deemed undervalued worse under the new rule there is no legal process that the department must follow when determining whether manipulation has occurred accordingly an american company that believes it is losing sales to a foreign company may now appeal to the commerce department and the international trade administration for special treatment even if a profitable german exporter charges the same prices for the goods it sells domestically as it does for the goods it sells in the us an american firm can demand additional levies by citing currency manipulation and if no us firm acts the commerce department can simply initiate such appeals on its own the us has long had one of the world s strongest economies owing in no small part to its respect for the rule of law and its efforts to maintain a level playing field for competition both foreign and domestic within the us market given this tradition it is puzzling that so many american politicians and businessmen are now terrified of other countries economic strengths true the us has also long championed extraordinarily loose criteria to justify anti dumping measures and countervailing duties and it has secured rules and procedures for determining such offenses within the world trade organization but a finding of currency manipulation has never been among the relevant criteria most likely the trump administration s unilateral decision to add currency manipulation to the list will be contested in court and at the wto more broadly the trump administration s currency politics will be felt everywhere trump has complained that both argentina and brazil are manipulating their currencies even though those countries exchange rate depreciation is obviously a response to high inflation the international monetary fund and others have recommended that both pursue devaluation in order to restore macroeconomic balance meanwhile trump continues to call on the us federal reserve to lower interest rates and ease its monetary policy so that the dollar will depreciate apparently the us is free to manipulate its currency just so long as no one else does project syndicate 1995 2020

in january 2019 olivier blanchard argued at the annual meeting of the american economic association that there were many reasons to doubt the supposed costs of public debt in developed countries including the united states jason furman and larry summers have also stated that it is time to kill off the debt obsession an article in the economist in may 2019 then questioned whether economists are fundamentally rethinking their ideas about fiscal policy this debate has had repercussions in resource rich countries that have suffered from the drop in oil prices since 2017 and are looking for ways to develop their infrastructures and diversify their economies many times this is done through expansive fiscal and monetary policies and non concessional indebtedness in a rather procyclical way but is this the optimal policy mix for a developing resource dependent country we have reasons to believe it is not and offer options to avoid a procyclical bias leaning against the wind is not easy designing an optimal monetary and fiscal policy regime for commodity exporting developing countries is not an easy task jeffrey frankel argues that resource rich countries should let the currency appreciate in the face of positive terms of trade shocks and depreciate during negative shocks in addition to that countries need some sort of nominal anchor and close coordination between monetary and fiscal policies to make sure monetary policy operates around a credible and sustainable fiscal anchor this kind of coordination is much easier said than done though as most often finance ministers and central bank governors tend to act in isolation the main peril resource rich countries face is that fiscal policy becomes procyclical as this could negatively impact welfare and poverty outcomes recent world bank reports for the central african republic and research papers here here and here document the prevalence of procyclical fiscal policies across resource rich countries especially in sub saharan africa ssa based on that research we draw two conclusions and offer an option for countries to avoid the procyclicality trap the procyclicality of fiscal policy is high in sub saharan africa fiscal policy in developing countries has become slightly less procyclical over the last two decades before the 2008 2009 crisis 64 percent of developing countries had a procyclical fiscal stance while the proportion fell to 60 percent after the crisis the procyclicality of fiscal policy is even more pervasive in ssa countries with only 23 percent of countries nine out of 39 running a countercyclical fiscal policy this is relatively low compared to the latin american countries lac where this proportion is 50 percent over time ssa countries did not change the procyclical nature of their fiscal policy while europe and central asia eca and lac reduced their procyclical stance countries in the middle east and north africa mena region switched from a countercyclical to a procyclical stance while south and east asia maintained their countercyclical stance figure 1 figure 1 progress in fiscal policy management 2000 2008 vs 2009 2016 source herrera kouame and mandon 2019 notes in red sub saharan african ssa procyclical fiscal policies are a more common phenomenon in resource rich countries our research shows that natural resource wealth and dependence limit the likelihood of governments to run countercyclical policy mainly because of low economic diversification and vulnerability to commodity price shocks however a countercyclical fiscal policy allows the government to lean against the wind continue providing goods and services when government revenues drop guarantee social protection and insurance to citizens and be more resilient in difficult times relatively high fiscal procyclicality bias in resource rich countries in ssa adds to the number of challenges facing the continent figure 2 for countries such as angola the central african republic nigeria and the republic of congo facing internal security or overhanging debt issues addressing the procyclicality of the fiscal policy is fundamental as discussed in our reports figure 2 procyclicality of fiscal policy in resource rich and resource dependent countries source herrera kouame and mandon 2019 fiscal rules and better transparency can help resource rich countries avoid procyclical fiscal policies our research shows that a combination of top down and bottom up approaches might help countries escape the procyclicality bias top down solutions include the adoption of fiscal rules the use of fiscal rules has increased steadily over time and has been associated with better fiscal debt outcomes in the countries that have adopted them there is also evidence that countries that have adopted fiscal rules might experience a positive effect on the risk premia of their sovereign bonds but of course the devil is in the details as there are good and not so good fiscal rules a consensus in the literature is that a good fiscal rule is a simple clearly stated transparent and with realistic targets for expenditures and debt levels b flexible it allows for course correction with clear escape clauses and for resource rich countries allows for cyclical adjustments to the business cycle or booms and busts and c enforceable there are clear and credible mechanisms to monitor and oversee the implementation of the rule bottom up solutions are complementary and consist of improving transparency in the implementation of the budget and the fiscal rule in order to encourage compliance with the fiscal rules many countries have decided to embed it in the constitution but that may not be enough research by the imf suggests that formal enforcement mechanisms such as those that generate sanctions for noncompliance have also shown limited effectiveness what seems to work well is to encourage greater transparency in the implementation of the budget and the fiscal rule this can be done for example through the adoption of a truly independent fiscal council that reports annually on the performance of the government in abiding by the fiscal rules this could provide lawmakers markets and citizens with the information they need to hold governments accountable this article was first published on brookings

ebitdare adjusted ebitdare and comparable hotel results are forward looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results and performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forecasts although we believe the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that the results will not be materially different risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include the following potential changes in overall economic outlook make it inherently difficult to forecast the level of revpar and margin growth the amount and timing of acquisitions and dispositions of hotel properties is an estimate that can substantially affect financial results including such items as net income depreciation and gains on dispositions the level of capital expenditures may change significantly which will directly affect the level of depreciation expense and net income the amount and timing of debt payments may change significantly based on market conditions which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income the amount and timing of transactions involving shares of our common stock may change based on market conditions and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described herein and in our annual report on form 10 k quarterly reports on form 10 q and current reports on form 8 k filed with the sec comparable hotel operating statistics to facilitate a quarter to quarter comparison of our operations we present certain operating statistics i e total revpar revpar average daily rate and average occupancy and operating results revenues expenses hotel ebitda and associated margins for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance because these statistics and operating results relate only to our hotel properties they exclude results for our non hotel properties and other real estate investments we define our comparable hotels as properties i that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and ii that have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone large scale capital projects as further defined below during the reporting periods being compared the hotel business is capital intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels a large scale capital project that would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set is an extensive renovation of several core aspects of the hotel such as rooms meeting space lobby bars restaurants and other public spaces both quantitative and qualitative factors are taken into consideration in determining if the renovation would cause a hotel to be removed from the comparable hotel set including unusual or exceptional circumstances such as a reduction or increase in room count rebranding a significant alteration of the business operations or the closing of the hotel during the renovation historically we have not included an acquired hotel in our comparable hotel set until the operating results for that hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year for example we acquired the 1 hotel south beach in february 2019 and therefore it is not included in our comparable hotels for 2019 we are however making a change to this policy going forward which is explained below under 2020 comparable hotel definition change hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption or commence a large scale capital project in each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after completion of the repair of the property damage or cessation of the business interruption or the completion of large scale capital projects as applicable 2020 comparable hotel definition change effective january 1 2020 the company will adjust its definition of comparable hotels to include recent acquisitions on a pro forma basis assuming they have comparable operating environments operating results for acquisitions in the current and prior year will be reflected for full calendar years to include results for periods prior to company ownership management believes this will provide investors a better understanding of underlying growth trends for the company s current portfolio as a result the 1 hotel south beach is expected to be included in the comparable hotel set for the year ended december 31 2020 under the prior comparable hotel definition the estimated 2020 range for comparable hotel revpar growth would have been reduced by 10 basis points 2019 comparable hotels of the 80 hotels that we owned on december 31 2019 72 have been classified as comparable hotels the operating results of the following hotels that we owned as of december 31 2019 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods andaz maui at wailea resort acquired in march 2018 grand hyatt san francisco acquired in march 2018 hyatt regency coconut point resort and spa acquired in march 2018 1 hotel south beach acquired in february 2019 the ritz carlton naples removed in the second quarter of 2018 business disruption due to extensive renovations including restoration of the façade that required closure of the hotel for over two months coordinated with renovation and expansion of restaurant areas and renovation to the spa and ballrooms san francisco marriott marquis removed in the third quarter of 2018 business disruption due to renovations of guestrooms ballrooms meeting space and extensive renovations of the main lobby san antonio marriott rivercenter removed in the second quarter of 2019 business disruption due to renovations of guestrooms conversion of public areas into meeting space and an extensive repositioning of the lobby area and minneapolis marriott city center removed in the fourth quarter of 2019 business disruption due to renovations of guestrooms ballroom meeting space and redesign of the lobby the operating results of 18 hotels disposed of in 2019 and 2018 are not included in comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein these operations are also excluded from the hotel operating data for all owned hotels on pages 9 and 10 operating statistics for the non comparable hotels listed above are included in the hotel operating data for all owned hotels by definition the revpar results for these properties are not comparable due to the reasons listed above and therefore are not indicative of the overall trends for our portfolio the operating results for the four hotels acquired in 2018 and 2019 are included in the all owned hotel operating data on a pro forma basis which includes operating results assuming the hotels were owned as of january 1 2018 and based on actual results obtained from the manager for periods prior to our ownership for these hotels since the year over year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results all owned hotel operating statistics are provided for completeness and to show the difference between our comparable hotel information upon which we usually evaluate performance and all of our hotels including non comparable hotels also while they may not be illustrative of trends as compared to comparable hotel operating statistics changes in all owned hotel statistics will have an effect on our overall revenues constant us and nominal us operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period for comparative purposes we also present the revpar results for the prior year assuming the results of our foreign operations were translated using the same exchange rates that were effective for the comparable periods in the current year thereby eliminating the effect of currency fluctuation for the year over year comparisons for the full year forecast results we use the applicable forward currency curve as published by bloomberg l p for each monthly period to estimate forecast foreign operations in u s dollars and have restated the prior year revpar results using the same forecast exchange rates to estimate year over year growth in revpar in constant us we believe this presentation is useful to investors as it provides clarity with respect to growth in revpar in the local currency of the hotel consistent with the way we would evaluate our domestic portfolio however the estimated effect of changes in foreign currency has been reflected in the actual and forecast results of net income ebitda adjusted ebitdare diluted earnings per common share and adjusted ffo per diluted share nominal us results include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation non gaap financial measures included in this press release are certain non gaap financial measures which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with gaap within the meaning of applicable sec rules they are as follows i ffo and ffo per diluted share both nareit and adjusted ii ebitda iii ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare and iv comparable hotel property level operating results the following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance nareit ffo and nareit ffo per diluted share we present nareit ffo and nareit ffo per diluted share as non gaap measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share calculated in accordance with gaap we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share as our nareit ffo defined as set forth below for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with nareit guidelines effective january 1 2019 we adopted nareit s definition of ffo included in nareit s funds from operations white paper 2018 restatement the adoption did not result in a change in the way we calculate nareit ffo nareit defines ffo as net income calculated in accordance with gaap excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets gains and losses from change in control impairment write downs of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the ffo of those entities on the same basis we believe that nareit ffo per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of nareit ffo per diluted share when combined with the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other reits even though nareit ffo per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as noted by nareit in its funds from operations white paper 2018 restatement the primary purpose for including ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a reit is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate related assets mandated by gaap for these reasons nareit adopted the ffo metric in order to promote a uniform industry wide measure of reit operating performance adjusted ffo per diluted share we also present adjusted ffo per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs we believe that the presentation of adjusted ffo per diluted share when combined with both the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share and ffo per diluted share as defined by nareit provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor s understanding of our operating performance we adjust nareit ffo per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as adjusted ffo per diluted share gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt we exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of the write off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period we also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock we believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs acquisition costs under gaap costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company litigation gains and losses we exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under gaap that we consider outside the ordinary course of business we believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance in unusual circumstances we also may adjust nareit ffo for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the company s current operating performance for example in 2017 as a result of the reduction of corporate income tax rates from 35 to 21 caused by the tax cuts and jobs act we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of december 31 2017 and recorded a one time adjustment to reduce the deferred tax assets and increase the provision for income taxes by approximately 11 million we do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our on going operating performance and therefore excluded this item from adjusted ffo ebitda earnings before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries management believes ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the company s capital structure primarily interest expense and its asset base primarily depreciation and amortization management also believes the use of ebitda facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits hotel owners that are not reits and other capital intensive companies management uses ebitda to evaluate property level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare we present ebitdare in accordance with nareit guidelines as defined in its september 2017 white paper earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the company s results with other reits nareit defines ebitdare as net income calculated in accordance with gaap excluding interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property including gains or losses on change of control impairment write downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity s pro rata share of ebitdare of unconsolidated affiliates we make additional adjustments to ebitdare when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitdare when combined with the primary gaap presentation of net income is beneficial to an investor s understanding of our operating performance adjusted ebitdare also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes we adjust ebitdare for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as adjusted ebitdare property insurance gains we exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in adjusted ebitdare is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets in addition property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets acquisition costs under gaap costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company litigation gains and losses we exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under gaap that we consider outside the ordinary course of business we believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance in unusual circumstances we also may adjust ebitdare for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the company s current operating performance the last such adjustment was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim limitations on the use of nareit ffo per diluted share adjusted ffo per diluted share ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share in accordance with standards established by nareit which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the nareit definition of ffo or do not calculate ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit guidance in addition although ffo per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other reits it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non reits we also calculate adjusted ffo per diluted share which is not in accordance with nareit guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other reits ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare as presented may also not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with gaap cash expenditures for various long term assets such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures interest expense for ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare purposes only and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the ebitda ebitdare adjusted ebitdare nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share presentations management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures additionally nareit ffo per diluted share adjusted ffo per diluted share ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions in addition nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as a measure of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders benefit similarly ebitdare adjusted ebitdare nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non controlling partners in consolidated partnerships our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11 to 67 in seven domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 10 properties and a vacation ownership development due to the voting rights of the outside owners we do not control and therefore do not consolidate these entities the non controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1 interest in host lp held by outside partners and a 15 interest held by outside partners in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and therefore consolidate its operations these pro rata results for nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare were calculated as set forth in the definitions above readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships for nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities comparable hotel property level operating results we present certain operating results for our hotels such as hotel revenues expenses food and beverage profit and ebitda and the related margins on a comparable hotel or same store basis as supplemental information for investors our comparable hotel results present operating results for hotels owned during the entirety of the periods being compared without giving effect to any acquisitions or dispositions significant property damage or large scale capital improvements incurred during these periods we present comparable hotel ebitda to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable properties after removing the impact of the company s capital structure primarily interest expense and its asset base primarily depreciation and amortization corporate level costs and expenses are also removed to arrive at property level results we believe these property level results provide investors with supplemental information into the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for the company s comparable properties in the aggregate we eliminate depreciation and amortization because even though depreciation and amortization are property level expenses these non cash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as noted earlier because real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient by themselves because of the elimination of corporate level costs and expenses gains or losses on disposition and depreciation and amortization the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate the performance of our company as a whole management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance we present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period to period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners in particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels which represent the vast majority of our portfolio or from other factors such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions while management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a same store supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of these hotels as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results for these reasons we believe that comparable hotel operating results when combined with the presentation of gaap operating profit revenues and expenses provide useful information to investors and management tejal engman vice president 240 744 5116 a pdf accompanying this announcement is available at

income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 6 5 compared to 8 6 in the same period in 2018 largely due to a change in geographic earnings mix and tax discretes the fourth quarter of 2019 includes a 19 0 million tax benefit for uncertain tax positions primarily related to seeking treaty relief from the competent authority to prevent double taxation on an adjusted basis the effective income tax rates were 18 4 and 19 9 for the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018 respectively the effective income tax rate for the full year 2019 was 15 7 compared to 18 2 in the same period in 2018 largely due to a change in geographic earnings mix and tax discretes the full year 2019 includes a 15 0 million tax benefit for uncertain tax positions primarily related to seeking treaty relief from the competent authority to prevent double taxation on an adjusted basis the effective income tax rates were 18 4 and 21 6 for the full year 2019 and 2018 respectively cash flow and capital deployment cash from operations was 719 4 million for the year ended dec 31 2019 an increase of 173 2 million or 32 versus the same period in 2018 the result was primarily due to a reduction in the build up of inventory in our lithium and catalysts businesses the timing of the collection on certain receivables higher dividends received from unconsolidated investments and increased cash earnings timing on payables and higher cash taxes paid partially offset the increase on oct 31 2019 albemarle acquired a 60 interest in mrl s wodgina spodumene mine and formed the marbl lithium joint venture with mrl approximately 1 6 billion of new note issuances funded the acquisition as well as repaid approximately 350 million of commercial paper notes and the remaining balance of 175 2 million of senior notes issued in 2010 the company also used the funds for general corporate purposes capital expenditures were 851 8 million for full year 2019 as compared to 700 0 million for 2018 with the increase driven largely by expansion in the lithium business as previously announced albemarle reduced its multi year capital expenditure plan to approximately 3 5 billion from 5 0 billion over the next five years this adjustment reflects the company s commitment to generating free cash in 2021 during the year ended dec 31 2019 albemarle deployed dividends to shareholders totaling 152 2 million up 5 from 2018

ebitda more than doubling and free cash flow considerably improving on the oil gas market as expected the lower activity in us onshore was more than offset by ea mea oil gas activity and the first step in the recovery of deep offshore in brazil took place in q4 in the industry and other markets our revenue growth was mainly driven by higher iron ore volume and prices in brazil we continued to

result with 141 million gross cost savings achieved in 2019 we notably outperformed our targets with 586 million gross cost savings since 2016 our top line growth and commercial momentum evidence the

million targeted ebitda and a slightly positive free cash flow beyond 2020 we will continue to accelerate our profitable revenue growth capitalizing on strong positions on the most attractive and fast growing oil gas markets we will also leverage our technological edge and brand recognition in order to develop new products and solutions for our clients our core capabilities also ideally position

ebitda more than doubling and free cash flow considerably improving on the oil gas market as expected the lower activity in us onshore was more than offset by ea mea oil gas activity and the first step in the recovery of deep offshore in brazil took place in q4 in the industry and other markets our revenue growth was mainly driven by higher iron ore volume and prices in brazil we continued to implement our transformation plan leading to a leaner and a more competitive group and i would like to thank all vallourec s teams for their continued involvement which enabled us to achieve such a result with 141 million gross cost savings achieved in 2019 we notably outperformed our targets with 586 million gross cost savings since 2016 our top line growth and commercial momentum evidence the benefits of a reshaped industrial footprint and the successful implementation of new routes in brazil and china we continued downsizing our footprint in europe and enhancing our cost competitiveness and sourcing flexibility with streamlined and more competitive operations vallourec is entering a new phase of its development and i am confident in the group s future success under the leadership of edouard guinotte edouard guinotte newly appointed chairman of the management board as of march 16th 2020 said the strong dynamic resulting from our restored competitiveness should continue in 2020 supported by the ongoing recovery of ea mea markets and by higher o g sales in brazil on which we have strong visibility we expect vallourec s financial performance to continue to improve with a 500 million targeted ebitda and a slightly positive free cash flow beyond 2020 we will continue to accelerate our profitable revenue growth capitalizing on strong positions on the most attractive and fast growing oil gas markets we will also leverage our technological edge and brand recognition in order to develop new products and solutions for our clients our core capabilities also ideally position the group to capture emerging opportunities for energy transition we will also further enhance our competitiveness with additional 200 million in gross savings over 2021 2022 and increased utilization of our new supply routes in this context we intend to strengthen vallourec s balance sheet and extend our liquidity through a 800 million capital increase and new credit facilities of 800 million that will provide us with the financial flexibility to execute our strategy with restored competitiveness and a strengthened balance sheet i am convinced that we will succeed in reinforcing our position as

62 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to lower sales volumes and lower net realized selling prices caused by a temporary reduction in global demand the impact of production downtime and the canadian national railway labor strike 2019 potash adjusted ebitda was similar to 2018 as higher average net realized selling prices were mostly offset by lower sales volumes nitrogen ebitda in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 19 percent lower than the same period last year due primarily to lower ammonia sales volumes and a lower nitrogen net realized selling price nitrogen ebitda in 2019 increased 2 percent compared to 2018 as lower natural gas costs in north america more than offset higher natural gas costs in trinidad and higher earnings from equity accounted investees and the impact of ifrs 16 more than offset lower ammonia sales volumes and lower nitrogen net realized selling prices in the fourth quarter of 2019 nutrien increased the maximum

fertilizer prices have recently improved after reaching historically low levels in 2019 but they continue to be impacted by increased supply from morocco and saudi arabia some global phosphate

resources total attributable proven and probable gold reserves decreased by 6 to 16 7 million ounces from the prior year the decrease was primarily due to mine depletion at essakane rosebel and sadiola and a reduction in estimated probable reserves at the boto gold project total attributable measured and indicated resources decreased by 2 to 27 2 million ounces as a result of mine depletion while total attributable inferred resources increased by 38 to 12 0 million ounces primarily as a result of the declaration of an initial mineral resource estimate for the nelligan gold project in canada comprising inferred resources of 97 0 million tonnes grading 1 02 g t au for 3 2 million ounces on a 100 basis exploration we exercised our option to increase our undivided interest in the nelligan gold project from 51 to 75 by completing a mineral resource estimate and making cash payments totaling 1 8 million c 2 35 million we were awarded the discovery of the year at the mining exploration association of quebec s xplor 2019 awards gala for the nelligan gold project development and operations during 2019 our team achieved a dart rate3 of 0 51 which was the best result achieved by iamgold over the past ten years we announced updated production guidance for westwood based on a preliminary life of mine plan the guidance incorporated modified mining methods operational practices and revised productivity assumptions based on recent operating experience at the mine as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 395 0 million we announced positive results from the carbon in leach cil and heap leach feasibility study completed at essakane the feasibility study supported an investment in a mill optimization project to increase cil plant capacity and the postponement of heap leach operations to the end of life of mine we announced the delivery of the first ore from the saramacca deposit to the mill at rosebel development work on saramacca continued with the haul road construction and bush clearing activities progressing and deliveries of hauling and mining equipment continuing during the quarter mining activities resumed at rosebel in all pits by october 2019 the carbon in column plant at rosebel which became fully operational in the first quarter 2019 produced an additional 2 000 ounces in the fourth quarter 2019 for total year to date recoveries of 7 600 ounces we continued to de risk the côté gold project having commenced site tree clearing activities entering into an impacts and benefits agreement with our first nations partners

attributable gold production inclusive of joint venture operations was 762 000 ounces for 2019 down 120 000 ounces from the prior year the decrease was primarily due to lower throughput and head grades at westwood 38 000 ounces as a result of both reduced mining activity and being limited to lower grade stopes resulting from increased seismic activity in the fourth quarter 2018 lower head grades at essakane 37 000 ounces due to mine sequencing compared to record production in 2018 lower head grades and throughput at rosebel 36 000 ounces resulting from the temporary suspension of

same prior year periods due to increased mining fleet size and availability combined with the higher utilization of contractors ore mined for the fourth quarter and year ended 2019 was higher compared to the same prior year periods as mining continued through lower grade ore zones to support the heap leach operations at the end of cil operations the cil and heap leach feasibility study at essakane was completed in the fourth quarter 2019 and concluded that increasing cil plant capacity and postponing the heap leach operation to the end of life of mine is more economical than operating both a heap leach and the cil plant in parallel see news release dated november 6 2019 detailed engineering and procurement of long lead items continues to progress to increase cil capacity to 11 7 million tonnes per annum at 100 hard rock compared to the original nameplate capacity of 10 8 million tonnes per annum at 100 hard rock cost of sales per ounce sold for the fourth quarter 2019 of 767 and full year of 884 were higher by 1 and 16 respectively compared to the same prior year periods primarily due to higher operating costs lower sales volumes and higher royalties due to higher realized gold prices partially offset by a reversal of previous impairments relating to ore stockpiles operating costs were higher primarily due to lower capitalized stripping and increased use of mining contractors and explosives a stronger u s dollar relative to the euro helped to alleviate these cost pressures total cash costs per ounce produced for the fourth quarter 2019 of 848 and full year of 871 were higher by 17 and 21 respectively compared to the same prior year periods as noted above these cost pressures combined with lower production were partially offset by the stronger u s dollar relative to the euro included in total cash costs for the fourth quarter and year ended 2019 was the impact of realized derivative gains and losses from hedging programs of 2 loss and 2 gain per ounce produced respectively 2018 9 gain and 17 gain all in sustaining costs per ounce sold for the fourth quarter 2019 of 1 006 were lower by 10 compared to the same prior year period primarily due to lower sustaining capital expenditures compared to the fourth quarter 2018 that included down payments for additions to the fleet partially offset by higher cost of sales per ounce all in sustaining costs per ounce sold for the year ended 2019 of 1 028 were 3 higher compared to the prior year primarily due to increased cost of sales per ounce partially offset by lower sustaining capital included in total cash costs and all in sustaining costs for the fourth quarter and year ended 2019 was the impact of realized derivative gains and losses from hedging programs of 2 loss and 1 gain per ounce sold respectively 2018 10 gain and 19 gain outlook we expect attributable production at essakane in 2020 to be in the range of 365 000 to 385 000 ounces essakane expects to continue to optimize production lower unit costs and increase mine and mill efficiencies at higher proportions of hard rock through multiple optimization initiatives mining activity is expected to remain at elevated levels in 2020 supported by the use of a mining contractor to secure strategic pushback objectives providing greater access to higher grade ore zones essakane is targeting higher drill availability and productivity through an expansion in the drill fleet which is intended to contribute to longer drill run times maintenance activities are expected to sustain the improvements that have been realized in overall availability and reliability essakane is targeting completion of the mill upgrade in the second half of 2020 with a series of improvements designed to de bottleneck the crushing circuit which is expected to yield higher grinding capacities in addition to optimizing liner and grate configurations essakane expects to continue to improve recoveries from the addition of a third gravity screen these initiatives are designed to deliver on the 2020 production and cost targets while positioning essakane to pursue additional resources at satellite deposits with the potential to add to the mine life of the essakane operation rosebel mine suriname iamgold interest 95 attributable gold production for the fourth quarter 2019 of 56 000 ounces and full year of 251 000 ounces was lower by 34 and 13 respectively compared to the same prior year periods as ore feed was sourced from lower grade zones due to a security incident in the third quarter which resulted in the temporary suspension of mining activities as mining activities resumed and continued to ramp up in the fourth quarter the mill continued to process primarily low grade stockpiles which resulted in lower head grades than the prior period the carbon in column plant continued to perform favourably with an additional 2 000 ounces recovered from tailings in the fourth quarter 2019 bringing year to date tailings recoveries to 7 600 ounces the plant exceeded the current year target recovery of 5 000 ounces in the third quarter at a marginal operating cost of approximately 35 per ounce to cover additional power and elution costs mining activities continued at saramacca in the fourth quarter 2019 following the delivery of first ore see news release dated october 31 2019 with the development of additional ore storage capacity on site and commencement of grade control drilling material mined from saramacca continued to be delivered to the rosebel mill through the use of an alternate road construction of the haul road progressed in the fourth quarter with bush clearing activities substantially complete construction of the haul road along with site infrastructure is expected to be completed in the first half of 2020 deliveries of hauling and mining equipment continued in the fourth quarter with an additional eight haul trucks and four loaders received to support the ramp up of mining activities in 2020 cost of sales per ounce sold for the fourth quarter 2019 of 1 108 and full year of 1 007 were higher by 29 and 17 respectively compared to the same prior year periods this was primarily due to the reduction in sales volumes partially offset by a reversal of previous impairments relating to ore stockpiles and lower mining costs as mining activity continued to ramp up in accordance with international financial reporting standards rosebel reduced the cash costs and depreciation attributed to inventory for the year ended 2019 by 9 6 million and 3 6 million respectively 2018 nil and nil

costs for the fourth quarter and year ended 2019 was the impact of realized derivative gains from hedging programs of nil and 1 per ounce sold respectively 2018 4 gain and 8 gain outlook we expect attributable production at rosebel in 2020 to be in the range of 245 000 to 265 000 ounces 2020 production guidance reflects pushbacks and mine development focused on optimizing cash flows over the next 5 years as well as the ramp up of saramacca guidance also incorporates factors to account for risk related to negative grade reconciliation rosebel will continue to undertake strategic pit pushbacks on the rosebel concession unlocking higher grade ore zones while advancing the exploitation of the saramacca deposit which is expected to contribute to increased production volumes each successive quarter of 2020 the mill feed in the first half of the year is expected to be supplemented by the processing of stockpiled ore while mill throughput in 2020 is expected to be at levels consistent with 2019 lower head grades in the first half of the year are expected to reflect the processing of lower grade stockpile feed as the mine operations return to normal levels of mining activity with further improvements in the second half of the year expected from inclusion of higher grade saramacca ore in the mill feed improved recoveries are further expected through the optimization of the elution circuit and acid wash circuit construction continues on the haul road linking the saramacca deposit to the rosebel mill with completion of the final surface expected in the first half of 2020 rosebel is also continuing to evaluate the underground mining potential of the saramacca deposit which could result in significantly lower waste volumes reducing the mining area footprint and potentially improving profitability westwood mine canada iamgold interest 100 gold production for the fourth quarter 2019 of 29 000 ounces was 4 higher than the same prior year period primarily due to higher throughput partially offset by lower head grades gold production for 2019 of 91 000 ounces was 29 lower than the prior year primarily due to lower throughput and head grades mining activities in 2019 were affected by increased seismic activity in the fourth quarter 2018 and were limited to lower grade stopes resulting in lower head grades than prior year periods included in ore mined for the quarter and year ended 2019 was 33 tonnes of ore mined from a satellite deposit head grade excluding marginal ore and ore mined from the satellite pit for the fourth quarter and

the annual pace of inflation jumped last month to 2 4 per cent its fastest rate in almost two years fuelled by higher costs at the gas pump pricey tomatoes and a rare surge in clothing costs the move compared with a year over year increase of 2 2 per cent in december and topped the 2 3 per cent economists predicted for january in a poll by financial markets data firm refinitiv much of the bump came as concerns about events in the middle east helped pushed gas prices up 11 2 per cent compared with january 2019 when a global supply glut lowered oil prices statistics canada said wednesday excluding gasoline the year over year inflation rate would have been 2 per cent in january but by the end of january prices dropped over concerns of the novel coronavirus outbreak and economists said that the effect of gas prices should dissipate experts also said the data released wednesday by the national statistics office only slightly dent the odds of the bank of canada cutting its key interest rate this year the central bank has left the door open to a rate cut to stimulate growth and consumer spending if it sees an economic slowdown that is more persistent than expected i think they re a bit concerned that with slower growth more recently inflation won t stay on target said josh nye a senior economist with rbc economics despite a bit of upside surprise in terms of the headline rate in january and core inflation still at 2 per cent i think the door is still open to the bank of canada lowering interest rates this year the average of canada s three measures for core inflation which are considered better gauges of underlying price pressures and closely tracked by the bank of canada was 2 033 per cent compared with 2 067 per cent for december despite the acceleration in headline inflation underlying price pressures appear to be losing some momentum royce mendes a senior economist at cibc wrote in a note the overall increase in prices of 2 4 per cent compared with a year ago was also driven by increased mortgage interest costs purchases of passenger vehicles auto insurance premiums and a bump in rents statscan said increases were partly offset by lower prices for telephone services internet access tuition fees and traveller accommodation the agency said costs grew for fresh vegetables by 5 per cent which the agency says is largely attributable to a 10 8 per cent bump in the price of tomatoes stemming from inclement weather in growing regions of the united states and mexico and clothing and footwear normally not an inflationary driver shot up 3 9 per cent from a year earlier which economists noted was its fastest annual growth recorded since 1991 bmo chief economist douglas porter noted housing costs seemed strangely mild rent costs slowed to 2 4 per cent in january from the 3 4 per cent in december even as home prices across the country flared higher the headline inflation figure may be understating jumps in home costs over the last year he said over all the inflation rate slightly reduce the odds of a bank of canada rate cut mr porter said but make no mistake the market is still largely expecting a rate cut at some point this year regionally prices on a year over year basis rose more in january than december in every province except ontario and quebec your time is valuable have the top business headlines newsletter conveniently delivered to your inbox in the morning or evening sign up today

agriculture market we executed on our strategic plan growing our retail business with several strategic acquisitions and made great strides with the roll out and adoption of our leading retail digital platform and financial tools agriculture fundamentals are strengthening and grower sentiment is positive we expect higher planting and favorable farm economics to support strong north american crop input demand in 2020 commented chuck magro nutrien s president and ceo article content our business is designed to provide stability in times of market weakness with significant leverage through a recovery in fertilizer markets we remain focused on optimizing our network allocating capital to grow our retail business and leading our industry in returning capital to shareholders added mr magro highlights nutrien generated 2 2 billion in free cash flow in 2019 up 9 percent over last year and 2 6 billion in free cash flow including changes in non cash working capital in 2019 which is over three times higher than in 2018 nutrien recorded a number of charges totaling 128 million this quarter related to mergers acquisitions and impairments the largest associated with the rebranding of the australian retail business after the ruralco acquisition retail performed well as ebitda increased 8 percent in the fourth quarter and 2 percent in the full year 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 nutrien s sales service and supply chain strength helped to grow market share and we expect strong ebitda growth in 2020 due to contributions from acquisitions improved market conditions and organic growth potash ebitda was down 62 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to lower sales volumes and lower net realized selling prices caused by a temporary reduction in global demand the impact of production downtime and the canadian national railway labor strike 2019 potash adjusted ebitda was similar to 2018 as higher average net realized selling prices were mostly offset by lower sales volumes nitrogen ebitda in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 19 percent lower than the same period last year due primarily to lower ammonia sales volumes and a lower nitrogen net realized selling price nitrogen ebitda in 2019 increased 2 percent compared to 2018 as lower natural gas costs in north america more than offset higher natural gas costs in trinidad and higher earnings from equity accounted investees and the impact of ifrs 16 more than offset lower ammonia sales volumes and lower nitrogen net realized selling prices in the fourth quarter of 2019 nutrien increased the maximum number of common shares that may be acquired under its current normal course issuer bid ncib to approximately 7 percent of the outstanding common shares nutrien repurchased an aggregate of 36 million common shares in 2019 and 72 million common shares over the past 24 months nutrien full year 2020 adjusted net earnings per share and adjusted ebitda guidance is 1 90 to 2 60 per share and 3 8 to 4 3 billion respectively advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content market outlook agriculture and retail recent us china trade progress has underpinned positive sentiment among us growers as agricultural exports to china are expected to improve significantly both in the short and medium term the us department of agriculture usda projects 2019 2020 global grain inventories outside of china to be at six year lows us crop input demand in 2020 is expected to be supported by an additional 14 million acres or about a 6 percent increase in planted acreage we expect demand for potash in southeast asia will be supported by the significant improvement in palm oil prices since mid 2019 despite improved agricultural fundamentals in most key markets we continue to monitor the possible impacts of the coronavirus drought conditions in australia and the african swine fever crop nutrient markets global potash prices declined in 2019 as customers in key offshore markets drew from inventories built by strong first half 2019 shipments while demand declined in north america due to adverse weather and in southeast asia due to weak palm oil prices global potash producers announced the equivalent of over 3 million tonnes of estimated production curtailments to rebalance supply we estimate global potash deliveries were approximately 64 5 million tonnes in 2019 down significantly from the 66 7 million tonnes in 2018 we believe potash production curtailments lowered inventory at the producer level while continued grower consumption lowered distributor inventory in key markets outside of china we expect global potash demand to rebound in 2020 driven by increased planting acreage in north america a rebound in applications in indonesia and malaysia lower beginning inventories and strong affordability we estimate global potash deliveries in 2020 will be between 66 to 68 million tonnes in 2020 similar to the record global delivery levels of 2018 global nitrogen prices declined in 2019 due to reduced demand in north america driven by challenging weather conditions and lower feedstock prices in some key producing regions we expect nitrogen fundamentals to improve in 2020 supported by higher north american planting stable demand in other key regions and limited new global capacity dry phosphate fertilizer prices have recently improved after reaching historically low levels in 2019 but they continue to be impacted by increased supply from morocco and saudi arabia some global phosphate producers have announced curtailments to rebalance supply and the coronavirus could reduce chinese export availability in the first quarter of 2020 however we expect low raw

nitrogen and phosphate segments are differentiated by the chemical nutrient contained in the products that each produces in the first quarter of 2019 our chief operating decision maker reassessed product groupings and decided to evaluate the performance of ammonium sulfate as part of the nitrogen segment rather than the phosphate and sulfate segment as previously reported in our 2018 annual

finance costs income taxes and depreciation and amortization for the three months ended december 31 2018 nitrogen reflected increases of 30 8 and 12 in sales gross margin and ebitda respectively and

content article content moreover the concurrent oil price collapse has added to the positive environment for gold as lower energy costs decrease the cost of production while increasing profitability unfortunately lost in the dust are canada s mineral exploration companies which for the most part continue to find financing and maintaining a share aftermarket a struggle article content given this reality graduating from exploration to gold production however small can be hugely transformational for both a company and its shareholders this is why one junior miner s plan to become a gold producer makes for an exceptionally exciting opportunity unique approach lowers risk maximizes upside article content this junior miner is sonoro metals corp tsxv sm otcqb smof fra 23sp and their focus is on developing gold and silver deposits in sonora state mexico a unique component of the company s strategy is that it is in advanced discussions with chinese engineering procurement and contracting epc companies for the development and financing of its flagship cerro caliche project the project s financing is to consist of debt paid back from production and the deal is expected to be turnkey with the epc company providing all aspects of the final engineering equipment and eventual construction together with the financing additionally because it is a debt financing sonoro would become a gold producer with little or no share dilution as sonoro s chairman john darch explains this strategy makes perfect sense from the perspective of both the epc company and sonoro he notes these epc companies are experts in developing mines this reality puts them in an ideal position to identify opportunities and de risk project finance the reason is their direct involvement in the feasibility study and later other critical components such as definitive engineering equipment procurement and construction this expertise and their control of the mine development process increases their confidence that the gold will be mined at a profit and that they will get paid back he adds at the same time the added profits they earn on their epc contracts reduce their financial exposure and adds to their motivation to finance sonoro has been informed that a technical review of the project was successful and now discussions are advancing to cover details regarding engineering work and

to fast track development to produce gold at its cerro caliche site over the next 24 months isn t new the company is modelling this initial strategy on the playbook of glamis gold glamis turned out to be a multi decade growth story which culminated in its sale to goldcorp for 8 6 billion in 2006 but the foundation of its success was a tiny heap leach mine called the picacho whose annual production ranged from 18 000 to 24 000 oz granted comparing sonoro with glamis may seem like a stretch but sonoro s management team has a track record that indicates they are moving in the right direction collectively management has either discovered or developed more than a dozen gold and copper deposits into operating mines one of these la cieneguita was developed and operated on behalf of glamis by a mining engineer named jorge diaz diaz is sonoro s vice president of operations in mexico and has been with the company since its founding ken macleod president ceo and director at sonoro metals notes our technical team s key management has been with us since sonoro was founded prior to joining sonoro they spent more than three decades discovering and developing gold deposits or operating gold mines in the region he adds they know the area intimately because they ve spent most of their lives there they are critical to our current cerro caliche project s success and also to sonoro s future growth i say future growth because not only are they expert mine builders but over their many decades they have identified and have access to numerous promising gold deposits in northern mexico that have never been developed photo by supplied sonoro s flagship cerro caliche project covers some 1 400 hectares and is in the midst of a gold rich intensely mined region in northern sonora state nearby mining operations include alio gold s san francisco mine premier gold s mercedes mine goldgroup s cerro prieto mine and agnico eagle s recently acquired santa gertrudis mine the company s second project san marcial is at an earlier phase of development and is also located in northern sonora state where old mine workings harken back over a century it s 20 km east of alio gold s san francisco mine and has extensive surface gold mineralization sonoro is targeting this project as a potential future oxide gold deposit similar to others already being mined in the area but for now the focus is to develop cerro caliche and if successful use the cash flow for both projects advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content management a storied past with an exciting future old but often true advice the best place to find a gold deposit is near already existing gold deposits similarly the best management is often built up of individuals that have discovered built and managed gold mines many times in the past with this in mind sonoro s management has a successful track record that spans discovery through resource development and production making them a powerful force for the company for instance sonoro s chairman john darch founded a company called crew development which through its subsidiaries operated and developed a handful of major projects including greenland s first gold mine seven mines in south africa and chibuluma south the first mine to be developed since the 1970s in zambia s copper belt after making a fortune discovering and developing mineral deposits darch retired from mining and co founded a coffee company in thailand called doi chaang for some people success follows them wherever they go and for darch that appears to be true under his guidance doi chaang went from an impoverished farming village to becoming an internationally recognized coffee brand and major success story which then went on to become the subject of a documentary and book in 2018 darch returned to the mining industry convinced that a major gold bull market was underway and that the depressed junior exploration companies were likely to provide an opportunity to acquire developable gold assets with which to build a gold producer in darch s estimation sonoro has the cornerstone asset at its cerro caliche project which can provide a springboard for future growth just as glamis gold s picacho mine did the real question is how far will sonoro get as its resources grow several gold producers in the area have mines which will run out of ore and be forced to close in the next few years developing gold deposits in their midst will make sonoro an ideal takeover candidate they

states and six canadian provinces at the end of 2019 we estimate that we had approximately 12 share of the wholesale landscaping products distribution market we are four times larger than our nearest competitor and larger than two through 10 combined we have a very balanced mix of business with 59 focused on maintenance repair and upgrade 26 focused on new residential construction and 15 on new commercial construction we are also the only national full product line wholesale distributor in the market our balanced end market mix broad product portfolio and geographic spread give us multiple avenues to grow and provide important resiliency in softer markets turning to slide 5 our large and local strategy combines the scale resources and capabilities of a large world class company with the passion deep knowledge and entrepreneurialism of our local teams in order to deliver superior value to our customers and suppliers it is important to note however that we are still in the early to middle innings of building our company and still have a long way to go in order to fully execute our strategy and reach our full potential accordingly we remain highly focused on our commercial and operational initiatives to build our capabilities and improve the value that we deliver to our customers and suppliers these initiatives are complemented by our acquisition strategy which fills in our product portfolio moves us into new geographic markets and adds terrific new talent to siteone taken all together our strategy creates superior value for our shareholders through organic growth ebitda margin expansion and acquisition growth slide 6 shows siteone s history and the results from our strategy over the past six years over this period we have been able to deliver consistent organic growth strong acquisition growth and solid ebitda margin expansion while investing heavily in sg a to build our it category management marketing supply chain finance operational excellence and acquisition teams as well as our underlying systems infrastructure including e commerce while we have not finished building our systems infrastructure our field support teams are firmly established and we will continue to leverage these teams to accelerate our performance going forward you will also note that we completed almost 50 acquisitions across the irrigation agronomics nursery and hardscapes product lines during the last six years with 10 of these added in 2019 through these acquisitions we have added significant capability and developed many lessons learned which now can be applied to future acquisitions our acquisition pipeline remains very robust and with only 12 market share we have significant potential to continue growing through acquisition in the years to come finally you will note that we regained our ebitda margin expansion momentum in 2019 with fully staffed field support teams several new systems in place and significant muscle added through acquisition we are more confident than ever in our ability to achieve 10 plus adjusted ebitda margin in the medium term i will now discuss some performance highlights for our full year 2019 as shown on slide 8 we delivered 12 sales growth in 2019 with a very healthy balance of 5 organic daily sales growth and 7 contribution from acquisitions given the very unfavorable weather in the first half of 2019 yielding only 2 organic growth through june i was particularly proud of our team s performance in catching up during the second half and achieving the 5 organic daily sales growth this is also a good example of how the weather can move demand from quarter to quarter but in most cases will even out during the full year organic growth during the year benefited from strength across our product portfolio led by our hardscape and landscape supplies product segments adjusted ebitda grew 14 in 2019 to 201 1 million and adjusted ebitda margin increased 20 basis points to 8 5 compared to the prior year our gross margin improved by 70 basis points with 50 basis points of this improvement coming from acquisitions our acquisitions which were comprised largely of hardscape and landscape supply businesses also increased our sg a as a percent of sales overall we were pleased to move our ebitda margin forward in 2019 although we would expect a higher pace of improvement in the coming years toward our 10 milestone from a balance sheet perspective we began to reap the benefits of our distribution centers and jda replenishment system as we reduced slow moving inventory and improved our inventory turns from 3 5 times to 3 7 times based on the year end inventory we also did a great job managing our trade receivables during the year accordingly our cash provided by operating activities improved 67 to a record 131 million allowing us to reduce our net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio from 3 2 times at the end of 2018 to 2 6 times at the end of 2019 we expect to make continued progress increasing our inventory turns over the next two to three years on the operations front we made a lot of progress with siteone com in 2019 based on our customers feedback we have improved our product data and our search capability while also adding the ability for customers to pay their accounts online finally we have created a spanish version of siteone com with these improvements and others in process we expect to accelerate our customer adoption of siteone com in 2020 we made significant investments in 2019 to improve our customer experience and get our customers in and out of our branches faster we now have bar coding and counter scanners in over 500 branches additionally we have rolled out our associate mobility platform mobilepro to over 100 branches allowing our associates to input orders and check out our customers anywhere in the branch or in the material yard this is particularly helpful in our larger nursery and hardscapes branches we plan to have mobilepro in 250 branches by the spring selling season this year we expect mobilepro will help us increase our associate productivity while also allowing us to gain market share with a superior customer experience we continue to make good progress with our new transportation management system or tms during the second half of 2019 we have already begun to achieve savings on our inbound freight to the branches and we expect tms to contribute to our gross margin expansion in 2020 additionally we are under way with the pilot of our new local customer delivery system which will allow us to more effectively coordinate and manage customer deliveries across branches we are very excited about the potential cost savings and customer service benefits from tms which will give us yet another advantage over our competitors altogether 2019 was a great year of progress in building the foundation for siteone on the acquisition front we continue to add terrific companies to siteone with 10 companies comprising approximately 100 million in trailing 12 month sales added in 2019 and three more so far this year our acquisitions are performing well and we continue to have a strong pipeline of potential deals as we move into 2020 finally in 2019 we were able to further strengthen our leadership team we brought on scott salmon to lead our acquisition team and then consolidated our pricing and category teams under greg weller who also runs our supply chain as we announced on friday we are thrilled to welcome shannon versaggi who is our new chief marketing officer shannon comes to us with a terrific track record in all aspects of marketing from lowe s and adds critical expertise and experience as we more fully leverage our digital capability and seek to further build out our brand and enhance our customer experience i m personally very excited about the strength of our leadership as we move into 2020 in summary 2019 was a year in which we continued to execute our strategy and demonstrated the momentum of our long term growth story we improved our results strengthened our team and balance sheet and made meaningful progress on our systems infrastructure accordingly we are in great position to continue our momentum and increase the value that we deliver for all of our stakeholders in 2020 now john will walk you through the quarter and the full year in more detail john john guthrie executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks doug i ll begin on slide 9 with the income statement for our fourth quarter results we reported a net sales increase of 13 to 535 million in the fourth quarter for the full year net sales increased 12 to 2 36 billion during the quarter we had 61 selling days which was unchanged compared to the prior year period for the full year we had 252 selling days which was also unchanged from the prior year in 2020 we will pick up a 53rd week in fiscal december and our selling days will increase to 256 organic daily sales increased 8 in the quarter and 5 for the full year geographically 10 out of 11 regions had positive sales growth in the quarter with our strongest sales growth occurring in the south organic daily sales for landscaping products which includes irrigation hardscapes nursery and landscape accessories finished strong growing 10 during the quarter and 5 for the year landscaping product sales in the quarter benefited in part from pent up demand that resulted from the challenging weather we had in the first half of the year organic daily sales for agronomic products which includes fertilizer control products seed ice melt and equipment remained steady growing 5 for the quarter and 4 for the year prices increased 1 in the quarter and 3 for the year compared to the same period in 2018 as cost increases from suppliers were passed through by the market a number of price increases were put in place in the fourth quarter of 2018 and as a result price inflation for the quarter was less than the full year for 2020 we are forecasting moderate price inflation of 1 to 2 acquisition sales growth which reflects the sales growth attributable to the acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2019 was 25 million or 5 of the overall fourth quarter growth rate for the full year acquisition sales growth was 152 million or 7 of the overall growth rate gross profit increased 14 to 170 million in the fourth quarter and gross margin increased 50 basis points to 31 8 the improvement in gross margin for the quarter is primarily attributable to higher supplier incentives and product mix which positively impacted margin by 20 basis points both these areas benefited from our strong growth in landscaping products compared to the prior year period for the year gross profit increased 14 and gross margin increased 70 basis points to 32 8 the improvement in gross margin for the year reflects the contribution from acquisitions and strategic inventory purchases ahead of price increases selling general and administrative expense or sg a increased 11 to 167 million in the fourth quarter sg a as a percentage of sales decreased 40 basis points to 31 2 the reduction in sg a as a percentage of sales reflects operating leverage and a reduced impact of acquisitions for the full year sg a increased 13 to 654 million and sg a as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points to 27 8 the increase primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions with higher sg a as a percentage of sales for the fourth quarter of 2019 we recorded an income tax benefit of 5 6 million which was the same as the prior year period for the full year income tax expense was 13 8 million compared to 1 3 million for the 2018 fiscal year and our effective tax rate was 15 1 compared to 1 7 for the prior year the increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in the amount of excess tax benefit from asu 2016 09 excess tax benefits of 9 6 million were recognized for the 2019 fiscal year as compared to 16 3 million for the 2018 fiscal year net income for the fourth quarter was 2 5 million compared to a net loss of 2 1 million during the prior year period our net income improvement this quarter was primarily attributable to our strong sales growth our weighted average diluted share count was 42 8 million for the fiscal 2019 compared to 42 6 million for fiscal year 2018 adjusted ebitda increased by 23 to 22 2 million for the fourth quarter compared to 18 1 million for the same period in the prior year for the full year adjusted ebitda increased 14 to 201 1 million compared to 176 million for the prior year the improvement reflects solid top line growth and improved margin now i d like to provide an update on our balance sheet and cash flow statement as shown on slide 10 as a reminder we adopted the new lease accounting standard during the first quarter of 2019 total operating lease liabilities at the end of the year were approximately 235 million with corresponding right of use assets of the total operating lease liabilities 49 million are reported as current liabilities and are reflected in net working capital net working capital at the end of the year was 455 million compared to 483 million at the end of 2018 excluding the current lease liabilities working capital for the quarter would have been 504 million a 4 increase over 2018 the increase is attributable to the working capital added with our 2019 acquisition cash flow from operations increased 82 to 66 million for the quarter and 67 to 131 million for the full year 2019 an improvement of 53 million over 2018 the increase was primarily attributable to improved turns of inventory and receivables we were especially pleased with our team s accomplishments in reducing working capital tied up in our supply chain and in improving the asset efficiency of the company we made cash investments of 28 million for the quarter compared to 24 million for the same quarter last year and 92 million for the 2019 fiscal year compared to 164 million in 2018 the decrease for the full fiscal year reflects less acquisition investment in 2019 compared to 2018 due in part to a reduction in the size of the completed deals net debt at the end of the year was 529 million which is down from 556 million at the end of last year net debt decreased to 2 6 times our trailing 12 month adjusted ebitda compared to 3 2 times at the end of 2018 the lower leverage reflects our increased profitability combined with a reduced year over year debt levels driven by our strong cash flows and reduced investment in acquisitions we are pleased to be comfortably within our long term year end leverage target of two to three times net debt to adjusted ebitda in summary our capital structure continues to provide us with the flexibility to execute our growth strategy including the funding of our acquisitions i will now turn the call over to scott for an update on siteone s acquisition strategy scott salmon executive vice president strategy and development thank you john as shown on slide 11 48 companies have joined the siteone family since the beginning of 2014 they added 230 branches to siteone and represent approximately 915 million in sales on a ttm basis in 2019 we acquired 10 outstanding companies bringing approximately 100 million in ttm sales as we continue to be the first choice for entrepreneurs seeking a fair valuation excellent opportunities for their associates and a long term partnership with the industry leader now as we turn to slide 12 through 17 you will be able to find information on our six most recent acquisitions on september 30 we acquired design outdoor incorporated which serves the greater reno lake tahoe market from the single location focused on the distribution of hardscapes products to landscape professionals the reno lake tahoe market is a new market for us and we are very excited to add the design outdoor team as part of the siteone family on december 20 we acquired dirt doctors a leading new england distributor of hardscapes and landscaping products with three locations this acquisition expands upon our 2018 and 2019 acquisition of landscape express and landscape depot on december 27 we acquired daniel stone inc which serves the greater austin texas market from a single location daniel stone represents the third hardscape and landscape supplies acquisition we ve made in texas since july 2018 we ve continued our momentum into 2020 by adding three more excellent companies wittkopf landscape supplies empire supplies and the garden department these acquisitions have allowed us to extend our hardscapes product offerings into both the greater spokane valley area in washington as well as the newark union metro area of new jersey in addition we significantly expanded our already leading nursery and landscape supplies presence in long island as we turn to slide 18 we continue to see a significant opportunity to grow profitably through acquisitions which allow us to move into new markets expand our presence in existing ones broaden our product offering and add outstanding talent to our team our pipeline remains very deep thanks to the strong efforts of our development professionals field leaders and the leaders of previously acquired companies together they have earned an outstanding reputation for helping newly acquired teams to successfully join the siteone family of company 95 of our deal activity in 2019 involved exclusive negotiations with sellers with nearly 50 companies added since 2014 we have a growing number of successful entrepreneurs who have joined the siteone family many of these leaders have stayed on to help drive our success and act as terrific ambassadors for siteone we would like to thank all of our siteone associates for helping us to attract the best companies to join us in the future while the timing of our acquisitions cannot be fully predicted we are pleased with our current pipeline of deals and confident that we will continue to add strong companies to siteone in 2020 and beyond doug black chairman and chief executive officer thanks scott i ll wrap up on slide 19 we are optimistic about 2020 as we see steady markets providing another year for siteone to continue to execute our strategy and achieve good performance and growth with a stronger team new system capabilities and good momentum on our initiatives we expect to accelerate our market share gains and adjusted ebitda margin expansion while continuing to produce excellent cash flow in 2020 we will also continue to add companies to siteone through acquisition before we get into our 2020 guidance i would like to provide an update on the trends we are seeing across our end markets and how those trends impact our organic sales growth prospects for 2020 the maintenance end market represents 42 of our business and we are seeing good growth in this segment due to a strong economy steady price inflation and our improved ability to gain market share as mentioned our agronomics business which is primarily maintenance grew 4 last year and we would expect similar growth in 2020 similarly the repair and upgrade end market which comprises approximately 17 of our business is still benefiting from a strong economy low unemployment and good consumer spending additionally we benefit from two trends in repair and upgrade first there is the ongoing focus on outdoor living which involves making the backyard a living space particularly with hardscapes and mining second there is the increased scrutiny on stormwater management which is driving double digit growth in our drainage and stormwater categories we expect these two trends to continue for many years accordingly we expect growth in repair and upgrade to remain healthy in the mid single digits in 2020 the new commercial construction market which is approximately 15 of our business has been very strong now for several years while our current customer backlogs are solid we would expect growth in this market to moderate to low single digits during the full year 2020 the new residential construction end market accounts for 26 of our business right now builders are very bullish about 2020 and we have seen a tick up in new residential backlogs with our customers overall we expect this market to be solid with mid single digit growth in 2020 lastly we would expect overall price inflation to be in the 1 to 2 range down from 3 in 2019 taken all together we would expect to achieve mid single digit growth again in 2020 with slightly lower price inflation and slightly higher volume growth in terms of acquisitions scott and his team along with our field leaders have done an excellent job in building and converting our pipeline of high quality companies as he mentions we currently have a strong backlog of deals and feel good about our ability to add more companies during the remainder of 2020 turning to our guidance for 2020 we expect adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 213 million to 228 million which represents year over year growth of 6 to 13 this range does not factor any contribution from unannounced acquisitions furthermore this range incorporates an extra week that we will have in 2020 versus 2019 unfortunately this extra week occurs in fiscal december during a very slow sales period and as a result will reduce our daily organic sales growth rate by approximately 100 basis points and will reduce our adjusted ebitda by 2 million to 3 million with the extra week of sg a overall we feel very good about our momentum going into 2020 as we continue to realize the benefits from our initiatives and leverage our stronger company to deliver performance and growth in closing i would like to acknowledge all of the siteone associates who continue to create significant value for our customers and suppliers we have a tremendous team and it is an honor to be joined with them as we build a company of excellence for all of our stakeholders operator please open the line for questions questions answers operator thank you our first question is from david manthey with baird please proceed david manthey robert w baird analyst hi good morning thank you doug you said you expect a higher pace of adjusted ebitda margin improvement in coming years but when we look at the midpoint of the range for 2020 it s looking like maybe 10 basis points of improvement which is in line or less than what we ve seen since the ipo could you talk about the major cost factors or mix factors that are preventing you from getting more ebitda margin expansion in 2020 specifically doug black chairman and chief executive officer yes thanks david so we craft the range around a myriad of scenarios in terms of sales and performance but overall our expectation would be that we would see more improvement in 2020 than we saw in 2019 and we ve got a bit of a headwind on the gross margin side we had the early buys in 18 helping us in 19 but we ve got plenty of initiatives to overcome that and still achieve some margin improvement we ve got the blocking and tackling in category privately we ve got some excellent private label initiatives that are well advanced we talked about the tms and we would expect freight and logistics savings and then we re still growing faster with the small and medium customer than we are overall so those all give us good avenues to improve gross margin and then on the sg a side our team is more fully built and with good organic growth and some of our initiatives associate mobility and some of our efficiency initiatives and lack of some onetime hits that hit us in 2019 we think we ll have good sg a leverage as well so put those together we think we re in a stronger position this year to achieve ebitda margin expansion in 2020 than we were in 19 and acquisitions will affect that but they seem to be coming in at the same ebitda percent level as we are and of course we re getting some synergies there so all told range aside we expect to get some more ebitda margin improvement in 20 than in 19 david manthey robert w baird analyst ok thank you for that that s helpful could you characterize 2019 just to baseline us on weather quickly i know second quarter was really tough for you but third quarter seemed nearly perfect and i know it s always a combination of factors that lead you to the mid single digit growth but how would you characterize 2019 as a year i mean with those two quarters would you say it was roughly normal and then as you mentioned you got non res maybe coming off a bit price coming off a little bit and maybe weather a little bit better to get you back to the mid single digit is that how you re thinking about the comparison with last year doug black chairman and chief executive officer yes you got it the second quarter was tough and so we were at 2 organic growth at the half year last year the fall was a good season right weather was good we didn t have any major hurricanes interrupt us in the south and so weather does tend to balance and in 2019 we saw some of that balance come through we ve got less price inflation than we had going into last year but we feel better quite frankly if you remember last year the residential market was a bit stalled and there were some question marks there residential is two thirds of our business and the residential market feels stronger as the builders are more bullish this year and even our customers we ve seen a tick up in projects that they ve had there so we think all together it balances and we ll get a similar market in 2020 altogether than we had in 2019 and we re more advanced on our organic growth initiatives than we were last year so that all brings us back to about the same place which is that mid single digit growth and that assumes kind of a balancing year in 2020 we don t know which season will be effective we know probably one of them will if we have very very terrible weather could be lower than that if we have great weather through the year it could be higher than that david manthey robert w baird analyst that s perfect thanks doug doug black chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question is from ryan merkel with william blair please proceed ryan merkel william blair and company analyst hey good morning and nice quarter john guthrie executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning scott salmon executive vice president strategy and development good morning ryan merkel william blair and company analyst i just want to follow up on weather if i could we had pretty mild weather in the fourth quarter and even in january and i just want to get a better understanding of how much this helps you or is the impact more muted because we re in the off season just some context there john guthrie executive vice president and chief financial officer the impact is somewhat muted i would say in q3 weather had a bigger impact on the business than in q4 but it was a positive it was a tailwind i would say in q1 the weather has less of an impact until you really get to march when spring breaks so i would say it was a nice tailwind this year and obviously relative to the beginning of the year we had a backlog of work that was out there that the weather allowed us to move forward with ryan merkel william blair and company analyst ok it s kind of what i thought and then secondly you mentioned an increased ability to take market share in 2020 i know you listed a bunch of the initiatives but can you just tell us how much do you aim to outgrow the market or put some numbers or context to that comment please doug black chairman and chief executive officer yes we would hope to outperform the market kind of 1 to 2 if you will and we ve probably been on the lower end of that range and in 2020 we feel like we should have a stronger chance to be on the higher end of that range but that would be roughly what we expect to get at this point in our development ryan merkel william blair and company analyst ok and then just lastly if i can sneak this in the outlook for moderating commercial construction i don t know if you hit on it but what metrics are you looking at and what conversations are you having that shapes that view doug black chairman and chief executive officer well yes our primary metrics we have two sources of let s say data on that one is our customers themselves and what kind of backlogs they have our customers do have solid backlogs but they re not as long as they used to be i mean this time last year they had all of 2019 locked up this year they just have a little less right so chances are they ll pick more backlog up but it just feels a little less strong than we did going into last year the other lens we have is our project services group we have a group that bids commercial jobs ourselves and assist our customers in doing takeoffs and that group is looking out forward and it s the same they re still seeing a steady flow of projects but it seems to just be a tick lower than what they had seen in the past so those are the reasons we d be a bit cautious there we re not raising red flags but we re cautious especially given the strength of commercial over the last several years that has some likelihood of slowing down particularly in the back half of 2020 ryan merkel william blair and company analyst makes sense doug thanks doug black chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question is from stephen volkmann with jefferies please proceed stephen volkmann jefferies analyst doug black chairman and chief executive officer i m sorry stephen you re breaking up stephen volkmann jefferies analyst doug black chairman and chief executive officer yes we couldn t catch that could you try to get a better connection operator ok our next question will be from mike dahl with rbc capital markets please proceed chris kalata rbc capital markets analyst hi it s actually chris on for mike thanks for taking my questions so first it looks like pricing in this quarter came in at the low end of your guidance it s just up 1 and your outlook hasn t moderating through 2020 so i was wondering if you could just touch on has anything changed in the market as far as your pricing power or your customers willingness to take on additional price increases and then i have a follow up doug black chairman and chief executive officer i think it s more a reflection of what s going on with our suppliers in the markets in general going into this year and really in the back half of 2018 we had some impact from tariffs in addition there is strong pricing coming from our suppliers and year over year a lot of those price increases went into place in q4 of 2018 so we were comping against the price increases what we re seeing with regards to 2020 we re seeing some price increases coming from suppliers better than much more modest compared to what we saw going into 2019 so i don t think necessarily it s a backlash relative to kind of where the market is at but just kind of issues like tariffs etc are not on the board this year compared to last year chris kalata rbc capital markets analyst got it thanks for that and then just my second question could you just give an update on your m a backlog currently i know deal sizes were a little bit smaller last year versus the average so how do current average deal sizes look to you guys john guthrie executive vice president and chief financial officer yes you re right our 2019 deal size at 10 million was below our average over the last four years which would be more around 17 million but if i look at the backlog we definitely have a significant number of medium and larger size companies as well so we would anticipate kind of reverting back to the norm somewhere probably between 15 million to 20 million average chris kalata rbc capital markets analyst got it appreciate the color operator our next question is from matthew bouley with barclays please proceed christina chiu barclays analyst this is christina chiu on for matt i m just wondering in addition to what was already said in the prepared comments how did organic growth break out between your two products group in agronomics and landscaping john guthrie executive vice president and chief financial officer landscaping products grew 10 for the quarter and agronomics grew 5 for the quarter christina chiu barclays analyst got you and then also can you help quantify some of the benefits that you ve seen thus far from some of these operational investments in delivery and transportation it and marketing and how customers have kind of been receiving some of these upgrades doug black chairman and chief executive officer yes well going back we made a lot of progress just in the overall customer experience in terms of being consistent with our customers having the right product assortment having the right pricing and having the associates kind of trained and able to serve them we ve augmented that with siteone com so we have customers that are adopting our new online portal in order to not only do quotes and bids but also order their product in advance so that when they come in it s all ready for them and then recently we ve rolled out the barcoding and associate mobility mobilepro which allows our associates in our larger facilities in nursery and hardscape centers to check customers out in the yard to be able to scan and get pricing out in the yard and around the branch and this dramatically improves the speed at which the customers can get in and out of our facilities and therefore improve their customer experience on the transportation side we re still early on in that most of our transportation work to date has been on inbound freight coming into our branches we re now running a pilot in the coastal carolina s to coordinate our outbound deliveries to customers in that way we can coordinate across branches we can have a centralized dispatching and we can get shipments there quicker and faster and at a lower cost so that s having a significant impact for those customers in those markets and that s something that we plan to roll out across the country during 2020 so all of these are aimed at the touch points of our customers making things easier making things faster and when you do that time is money for our landscapers their most precious resource is their labor and their second most precious resource is their own time because they re all entrepreneurs and they re busy and so if you can save them time give them a good competitive price and have it be an easy experience they ll come to us right and we ve seen that in the early stages and that s what gives us confidence we can outperform the market as we just provide a faster more efficient superior customer experience than our competitors so still in the middle innings there we ve seen good progress and we re seeing the growth start to pick up but lots more room there to improve as we roll all these out across the country and lock them in as a way we do business for the long term does that answer your question christina chiu barclays analyst yes i think that covers it thank you doug black chairman and chief executive officer ok perfect operator our next question is from keith hughes with suntrust please proceed judy merrick suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thanks this is judy merrick in for keith hughes just a follow up on the let us talk about the acquisitions kind of picking up maybe return in medium or large is there anything else you see that s different just the type of products or adjacencies or anything else that you re looking at for the acquisitions doug black chairman and chief executive officer i would say nothing significantly changing we re still seeing an overwhelming number of the deals are exclusively negotiated i think you ll still see us leaning more toward hardscapes and nursery type acquisitions simply because of our filling out our map and our strategy to get our full product line offering across all of our target msas so by and large i think there s been very little change the pipeline is strong and again still vast majority exclusively negotiated right we ve talked about adjacencies like equipment and other facets of landscaping products that we can go into but we have a robust pipeline in our traditional verticals and really until we get further down the road on that we don t think it s the time to start adding adjacencies and making our business more complex so right now we d like to keep we are working across nursery hardscapes agronomics and irrigation and that business has its own complexities we d like to stick to that in the near term and keep those other adjacencies for down the road in our evolution to go after judy merrick suntrust robinson humphrey analyst ok great thank you doug black chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question is from seldon clarke with deutsche bank please proceed seldon clarke deutsche bank analyst hey guys thanks for the question could you just give a little bit more color around the cadence of your organic growth target for this year and whether it implies any acceleration in any market in particular in the back half john guthrie executive vice president and chief financial officer so i think in general from an organic growth if we were to think next year is going to be a normal year i think you would see probably we felt we had because weather impacted the second quarter we would expect to have probably the strongest quarter throughout the year and potentially the third quarter kind of moderate the opposite way where second quarter is our most important quarter of the year so it will be nice to hit there in general i think the growth geographically probably we re all across the country so for instance in the first half of this year probably southern california was somewhat negatively impacted a lot of rain you might see a recovery there the south had a very good year so i mean we re somewhat one of the great things about being so geographically diverse is there is always one market where it s probably down a down year and in another it s offset but generally i would say in general the south was pretty strong this year obviously there s good economic trends there although the west at least the first half of last year faced some wet weather seldon clarke deutsche bank analyst ok that s helpful and then are you hearing anything from your suppliers in terms of disruption related to the coronavirus that we need to be thinking about john guthrie executive vice president and chief financial officer we ve heard some we get about 10 15 of our cost of goods from china either as input components or whole components and it mostly affects our chemical business some of our landscape accessories and lighting and so we ve obviously been in communication with those the disruptions to date have not been major there are potential disruptions down the road and so we ve been doing some buying into our dcs and other things to mitigate that we have secondary suppliers in the united states that we can use for these products and we can also buy forward into our dcs as a shock absorber against any kind of disruption so we feel good about our ability to kind of manage through any developments and we re watching like everybody else but today no major disruptions and we feel like our plans can allow us to navigate any disruptions that we develop in the future seldon clarke deutsche bank analyst great i appreciate the questions thanks doug black chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question is from alex maroccia with berenberg capital markets please proceed alex maroccia berenberg capital markets analyst hey good morning guys thanks for taking the questions so it s been a strong start to the year in the acquisition pipeline i guess why did people wait until the start of the year to sell and what are you guys thinking you ll add this year as a percentage of revenues john guthrie executive vice president and chief financial officer i ll take the second one first i guess we would still target our 7 to 13 ttm sales in terms of what we re looking for to add in terms of m a and then on the timing i don t think anyone is specifically waiting i mean there s a small psychological edge so i guess for some people or benefit to finishing at the end of the year but more or less it just comes down to when people are ready to sell and the due diligence process and how long that takes so i don t think there s any particular force that s pushing people toward the end of the year which is sort of a timing for us in this year doug black chairman and chief executive officer and if you look at it we did three deals in q4 so they re kind of they re falling they just all fell toward the end of the year some through the q4 some flipped over to the beginning of the year and there s a little bit of an effect to a seller s mind share that they have to be able to invest in an acquisition process if they re in season from march to june they have a little bit harder time to focus on it so it naturally pushes it sometimes to h2 alex maroccia berenberg capital markets analyst got it that s helpful and then second one is just seeing shannon come in as cmo she s got the big company background can you give us an understanding of how you re trying to change your marketing strategy and if we can expect a significant uptick in marketing spend doug black chairman and chief executive officer great question so we re thrilled to have shannon joining marketing has been one of our strategic initiatives for some time now yet we re really still in the early stages of using marketing as a major lever to drive organic growth we ve made some solid progress over the last couple of years what we love about shannon is she s got experience in all aspects of marketing she was the vp with lowe s and she s got kind of proven track record especially as we move into the digital age and we started using all of our weapons digital and otherwise in an integrated fashion to communicate with our customers to improve the customer experience and to grow organically we think shannon is uniquely prepared to take us to world class and that s what we re very excited in terms of marketing spend we re not a big company and she understands that and so we ll be steady as you go going forward we ll obviously make investments in market we ve been making investments in marketing so that won t end i don t see that being a huge tick up but if we see levers to pull we ll certainly make those investments and we ll expect high returns from those investments so we ll have to see i think invariably as we get bigger our spend will increase but we re not looking for any kind of massive strategic pivot here we re just really looking for shannon to take the investments that we made already perhaps smarter and better ones going forward to continue to drive organic growth we re very excited about her joining the team alex maroccia berenberg capital markets analyst got it all right thanks a lot guys doug black chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator we have reached the end of our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to doug for closing remarks doug black chairman and chief executive officer ok thank you and thank all of you for joining us today we very much appreciate your interest in siteone we re very excited about our long term growth potential and profitability potential and i d like to once again just thank all of the terrific siteone associates for helping us get to where we are today and for all their hard work and commitment in building a world class company thank you very much and we look forward to

sales volumes held up well margins were affected by a 3 drop in average selling prices and higher professional fees mainly related to the closing of ipsco acquisition 10 million net income for shareholders however increased 42 sequentially as we recorded a low income tax charge for the quarter while in the previous quarter the tax charge was adversely affected by the impact of currency

ebitda margin of net sales 18 8 20 1 in 2019 our sales declined 5 compared to 2018 reflecting lower drilling activity in canada and the usa and lower sales in the middle east and africa despite the integration of saudi steel pipe and a strong level of premium sales for indian offshore gas projects sales in the middle east and africa region were affected by aramco destocking in saudi arabia and did not include the extraordinary level of sales to east mediterranean gas pipelines recorded in 2018 operating income declined 5 in line with the decline in sales although gross margins were affected by lower volumes and high maintenance and start up delays associated with the major overhauls and investments we carried out at many of our industrial facilities including tamsa in mexico these were compensated by lower amortization charges shareholders net income declined 15 for the year reflecting the decline in operating income and lower returns on our investment in ternium cash flow provided by operating activities amounted to 1 528 million during 2019 which included a reduction in working capital of 523 million this amounted to a free cash flow margin of 16 following capital expenditures of 350 million during the year we made 484 million in dividend payments an investment of 133 million in saudi steel pipe and our net cash position increased by 495 million to 980 million at december 31 2019 annual dividend proposal upon approval of the company s annual accounts in march 2020 the board of directors intends to propose for approval of the annual general shareholders meeting to be held on april 30 2020 the payment of dividends in an aggregate amount of approximately 484 million which would include the interim dividend of approximately 153 million paid in november 2019 if the annual dividend is approved by the shareholders a dividend of 0 28 per share 0 56 per ads or approximately 331 million will be paid on may 20 2020 with an ex dividend date on may 18 2020 and record date on may 19 2020 market background and outlook drilling activity in the us shales after declining throughout 2019 as oil and gas companies adjusted to lower cash flows and a less accommodating financial environment is expected to stabilize at current levels provided that oil and gas prices and global demand expectations are not further affected by the coronavirus outbreak offshore drilling activity in the gulf of mexico however is expected to show some recovery during 2020 drilling activity in canada which declined 30 in 2019 is expected to remain close to last year s level in latin america offshore drilling activity which rose in mexico and guyana in 2019 is expected to grow further particularly in brazil while in argentina shale drilling activity which declined sharply towards the end of 2019 is unlikely to recover quickly as continuing uncertainty about the investment climate has led oil and gas companies to postpone new investments in vaca muerta in the eastern hemisphere drilling activity is likely to remain broadly stable with higher activity in some regions like the middle east and the north sea while in other regions like the caspian and in some lng developments activity may be delayed with the current level of oil and gas prices global octg demand which we estimate remained stable in 2019 is expected to decline slightly in 2020 affected primarily by lower demand in the usa and further destocking in the middle east despite lower market demand in usa and argentina and lower prices in the americas we expect to increase sales in 2020 with the expansion of our position in the us market through the integration of ipsco and higher sales of premium products for offshore drilling projects we expect margins in the first quarter to be in line with those of the fourth quarter as they will be affected by the current losses that ipsco is incurring but should recover during the year as we realize synergies from the integration and work on reducing costs and

sequentially and 18 year on year the sequential decline is mainly attributable to south america and the middle east africa partially offset by higher sales in the other regions in north america sales increased sequentially 1 thanks to seasonally higher sales in canada that compensated a decline in product prices throughout the region in south america sales decreased 14 sequentially due to lower sales in argentina where oil and gas activity has been strongly impacted from last august in europe sales increased 13 sequentially after seasonally higher sales in the north sea in the middle east and africa sales were relatively stable in the region with a slight decrease in india following a high level of shipments in the previous quarter in asia pacific we had higher sales in vietnam and australia operating income from tubular products and services amounted to 138 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 163 million in the previous quarter and 154 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 operating income during the quarter was negatively affected by a 3 decline in average selling prices and higher consultancy and legal fees and selling expenses in sg a costs of goods

sales compared to 333 million 18 9 in the previous quarter and 487 million 23 1 in the fourth quarter of 2018 affected by a one off amortization charge of 109 million sequentially sg a increased 5 due

amounted to a loss of 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to a gain of 8 million in the previous quarter and a loss of 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 the loss during the quarter corresponds mainly to a 6 million loss on fx derivatives covering primarily net payables in argentine and mexican peso equity in earnings of non consolidated companies generated a gain of 13 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 13 million in the previous quarter and 51 million in the same period of 2018 these results are mainly derived from our equity investment in ternium nyse tx income tax charge amounted to 10 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 108 million in the previous quarter and a gain of 2 million in the same period of 2018 the charge of the quarter

drilling activity in south america sales declined slightly reflecting a reduction in drilling activity in argentina towards the end of the year in europe sales increased due to higher demand for offshore line pipe and octg with lower sales of mechanical pipes and line pipe for hydrocarbon process projects in the middle east africa the acquisition of saudi steel pipe and an increase in sales in the middle east outside of saudi arabia where destocking took place did not compensate for the drop in sales of offshore line pipe following the completion of deliveries for east mediterranean gas

morning everyone thanks for joining us today i ll share some thoughts on the fourth quarter and overall 2019 performance we will discuss the rail transportation market as well as provide an outlook for 2020 then pat will cover the quarter in greater detail turning to slide 3 you can see that we delivered a strong financial result for 2019 in particular we had a solid cash generation of more than 1 billion which exceeded our guidance driven by strong working capital performance this allowed us to strengthen the balance sheet by reducing debt by over 500 million since the end of the first quarter which creates the flexibility needed to fund future strategic organic and inorganic growth in line with our goal to drive continued margin expansion adjusted operating margins for the full year were roughly at 14 as we continue to deliver on cost management actions and synergies stemming from the wabtec and ge transportation merger total adjusted income from operations for the quarter was 313 million driven in part by year over year growth in both freight and transit i d like to emphasize that total backlog increased in the fourth quarter driven by international freight services and a significant digital electronic order that will drive enhanced network optimization for a class i railroad each provided a strong foundation for visibility and growth in the future finally we ended the year with adjusted eps within our prior guidance range of about 4 17 we hit roughly 30 million in net synergies for the year which exceeded our net 20 million target and puts us on a path to deliver a total of 250 million in synergies before 2022 looking to 2020 we will continue to take actions on improved project execution particularly in transit and we remain focused on the prioritization of resources and prudent capital allocation we expect market conditions to continue to be challenging primarily in the north american freight market but our diversified global portfolio significant installed base and backlog will help us navigate these headwinds with these factors in mind we forecast that 2020 revenues will be about 8 7 billion margins will grow about 100 basis points driven by synergies and further improvement in the transit segment eps will grow and we ll have another strong cash generating year allowing us to further strengthen the balance sheet finally this morning the company announced a 500 million share repurchase authorization the program reinforces our confidence in the company our ability to generate strong cash flows through the cycle and deliver shareholder value as we turn to slide 4 i d like to cover market conditions we re seeing across the freight and transit segments let me start with freight our business performed well despite continued challenging conditions in north america north american carloads were down about 7 in the fourth quarter and were down about 4 for the full year versus 2018 this was driven largely by trade uncertainty weak global macro conditions that have led to drop in intermodal traffic declines in commodities like coal and agriculture we expect carload volumes in 2020 to be flat to slightly down versus last year and we forecast that the railcar build to be about 40 000 railcars versus about 58 000 in 2019 and we anticipate the locomotive deliveries to be down double digits versus 2019 driven by north america these assumptions are included in our 2020 guidance as we ve shared on previous calls lower carload volumes along with precision scheduled railroading are having an impact on new local orders however the impacts continue to be partially offset by international orders growth in services including our modernization program and aftermarket sales we remain very aligned with our customers in driving efficiency and productivity across their operations through advanced technology digital solutions and unique service offerings our digital electronics business saw solid momentum with backlog up double digits in 2019 this gives us further confidence that the business can grow in average faster than the overall freight segment across our international installed base we continue to see strong opportunities for growth especially across asia in regions like russia cis australia and india where we ve delivered over 100 locomotives in 2019 as part of our 1 000 locomotive contract in the transit segment we continue to see steady growth in ridership and urbanization investments in transit rail systems across europe the u k and even in certain u s markets are presenting unique opportunities for growth this includes growth in infrastructure spending in established economies like germany where rail spending is steadily increasing due to the shift to green and emerging economies like india where we are uniquely positioned to win in the fourth quarter we re able to take advantage of these growth trends with notable orders in brakes and doors across india europe u s and asia and across our segment portfolio we have firm multiyear backlog that will contribute to growth with that i m going to turn it over to pat who will provide a deeper dive into the financials pat dugan chief financial officer thanks rafael as we turn to slide 5 you can see that we closed 2019 on a solid note and built good momentum to more than offset the challenges in the north america freight market sales for the fourth quarter were 2 4 billion that increased year over year sales were mainly due to the merger of ge transportation by oe mix and increased revenue in transit offset somewhat by foreign exchange as well as lower sales for railcar components to provide improved transparency starting this quarter we have recast our segment sales into new product line disclosures you can find additional details describing the new product lines in the appendix f to our press release issued this morning you can also see all gaap and adjusted numbers for the year and the reconciliations that we also have provided for the quarter operating income was 226 million and adjusted operating income was 313 million mainly driven by continued strong improved performance in services along with locomotive deliveries adjusted operating income included 16 million for noncash policy harmonization that number is consistent with estimates in our original guidance at close of the ge transportation merger however this excluded pre tax expense of about 71 million for transaction restructuring and litigation costs please see appendix d in our press release for the reconciliation of these details now looking at some of the detailed line items our sg a was 324 million including 61 million of the 71 million in expenses i just discussed we expect the adjusted run rate number to be about 270 million per quarter going forward engineering expenses increased to 60 million due mainly to the addition of ge transportation and the amortization expenses were 65 million for the quarter net interest expense of 58 million was due to the higher debt balance and the adjusted net interest expense was 55 million i always want to emphasize that we are focused on generating cash to reduce our debt balance and reduce our interest expense going forward we expect interest expense to be about 50 million per quarter income tax expense was 38 million excluding the net tax benefit from transaction costs for the ge transportation merger adjusted income tax expense was 63 million for an adjusted effective tax rate of about 24 in the fourth quarter we had gaap earnings per diluted share of 0 71 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of 1 04 the details bridging gaap eps to the adjusted eps of 1 04 can be found attached to our press release ebitda which wabtec defines as income from operations plus depreciation and amortization was 337 million and adjusted ebitda was 424 million adjusted ebitda included the 16 million of policy harmonization but excluded the pre tax expense of 71 million which i had previously discussed depreciation was 45 million versus 15 million in the year ago quarter the increase obviously due to the ge transportation merger for 2020 we expect depreciation expense to be about 180 million amortization expense was 66 million for the quarter compared to 10 million in last year s quarter this increase was also due to the merger for 2020 we expect amortization expense to be about 280 million which in 2020 will be excluded from our adjusted results as part of our cash eps as of december 31 i want to emphasize our multiyear backlog was roughly 22 billion and our rolling 12 month backlog which is a subset of that multiyear backlog was 5 6 billion our backlog remains a solid foundation and will allow us to continue to navigate the market headwinds that we re facing now turning to the segments it is important to note that the recast of our segment and product lines has resulted in some businesses reclassified to different segments this has caused the prior year segment results to be revised and those results can be found in two areas appendices g and h attached to our press release looking at the freight segment sales increased to 1 7 billion in the fourth quarter this increase was due to the ge transportation merger again adding 1 3 billion organic sales decreased 22 million primarily due to lower sales of freight car components and industrial products segment operating income was 239 million and adjusted operating income was 270 million for an adjusted margin of 16 1 for 2020 we have good visibility into our oe deliveries through the multiyear backlog finally segment backlog grew slightly from last quarter to 19 billion on new international orders now looking at our transit segment sales increased slightly to 701 million primarily driven by growth in aftermarket sales this increase was due to organic growth which was up 19 million and acquisitions adding about 2 million which more than offset a negative fx of 16 million the fourth quarter marked the ninth quarter in a row that we have delivered organic sales growth which shows that our near record backlog continues to drive multiyear top line visibility segment operating income was 39 million for an operating margin of 5 6 excluding about 11 million in restructuring expenses and including additional charges related to the u k refurbishment projects the adjusted operating margin for the segment was 7 1 as it relates to the u k projects we have made several changes in recent months this includes changes in key management and taking prudent action on driving better project governance we are no longer taking on these type of projects as for the existing backlog we have completed about 75 of those refurbishment projects in the u k and have a strategy in place to accelerate the rest going forward for the transit segment we will continue to enhance our efforts to drive a lean culture with cost out improvements have better delivery and better quality and are confident that we can drive about 100 basis points of margin expansion across the transit segment in 2020 now let s turn to the balance sheet and cash flow as described on slide 6 we exceeded prior guidance for the year and generated about 1 billion in cash from operations this was the result of better financial results improved working capital performance and the timing of cash payments received now to touch on the components of our working capital as of december 31 receivables were 1 7 billion which is consistent with the third quarter inventories were about 1 8 billion compared to 2 billion at the end of the last quarter and payables were 1 2 billion or about flat with the prior quarter receivables include unbilled receivables of 514 million which were more than offset by customer deposits that we received of about 604 million as of december 31 we had 604 million in cash mostly held outside the u s total debt of about 4 4 billion and net debt to an adjusted ebitda of about 2 6 times which was on track with our year end leverage target longer term we are still targeting a net debt to ebitda to be about 2 to 2 5 times capex for the year was 185 million versus 93 million last year the increase due mainly to the merger and going forward we expect to spend about 200 million in 2020 which is about 2 of sales overall our balance sheet continues to provide the financial capacity and flexibility to invest in our growth opportunities and our goal is to be at and remain an investment grade credit rating before i hand it over to rafael to discuss the 2020 guidance in more detail i do want to take a moment to bridge our 2019 adjusted results on slide 7 to a pro forma view that would help you model our 2020 guidance on a like for like basis the pro forma view includes four important notable changes the first is that the pro forma is inclusive of the two additional months of ge transportation results interest charges second as we have discussed we will no longer have the adjustment for policy harmonization so the revenue recognition policy harmonization and other areas of policy harmonization will not be discussed third we are now adding back the nonrecurring ppa and finally we have modeled the year with a fully dilutive share count of 192 million shares i would note that on a full year pro forma there is a 0 34 impact which you can see on the page and it takes you from the 4 60 to 4 26 one last point to emphasize is that the two months of ge transportation results were impacted by the timing of locomotive deliveries cash payments and receipts during the quarter when you look at it in total with the get contribution in the one month period of the first quarter the results and margins are very consistent with the segment the overall freight segment for wabtec now let s shift to the 2020 guidance as illustrated on slide 8 and i ll turn it back over to rafael rafael santana president and chief executive officer thanks pat so based on the operating momentum we ve built in 19 our current backlog and an assessment of key market conditions our 2020 guidance for sales is about 8 7 billion adjusted ebitda of about 1 6 billion and adjusted income from operations of about 1 4 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share to be between 4 50 and 4 80 we expect gaap cash from operations to be about 900 million this includes roughly 100 million in prior year restructuring transaction and litigation cash outflows in the first quarter of 2020 we expect sales adjusted net income adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings per diluted share to be lower when compared to the remainder of 2020 this is due to the seasonality and project scheduling that said we expect product mix to improve throughout the year in line with those dynamics building on a solid 2019 we expect to deliver over 150 million in net synergies in 2020 and we re on track to deliver 250 million in synergies before 2022 finally our adjusted guidance for 2020 now includes all add backs related to noncash recurring purchase price accounting charges or deal related amortization and excludes estimated expenses related to restructuring and transactional expenses excluding these expenses our adjusted operating margin targets for the full year is about 16 and our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be about 25 5 so as you heard through the call this morning and you see on slide 9 wabtec had a solid performance in the fourth quarter and a strong year overall we continue to see growth in our aftermarket and services revenues further demonstrating the importance of our installed base across both for the freight and transit segments as well as the resilience of our portfolio we ve strengthened our international footprint with significant orders in critical markets around asia like russia and cis and india and we exceeded expectations on cost reductions and synergies stemming from the wabtec and ge transportation merger looking forward we fully expect to deliver a total of 250 million in synergies before 2022 in 2019 we delivered strong cash generation placing the company in a position of strength and we re poised to execute a focused capital deployment strategy to further grow shareholder value heading in 2020 we expect to see continued headwinds especially in north america but we re confident that our significant installed base our strong aftermarket reach and our globally diverse business model will help us manage through another challenging cycle we will take action on improved project execution and margin expansion and as always we remain laser focused on the prioritization of resources and prudent capital allocation we look forward to sharing more on our outlook for 2020 on our technology strategy and our focus on long term growth during our upcoming investor conference which will be held on march 10 in new york with that i want to thank the entire wabtec team for a strong 2019 and with that i ll open up to any questions you may have questions answers operator our first question comes from justin long from stephens go ahead justin long stephens inc analyst thanks and good morning pat dugan chief financial officer good morning rafael santana president and chief executive officer good morning justin justin long stephens inc analyst so maybe to start with the 2020 operating cash flow guidance pat could you talk about the assumption for working capital that s getting baked into that and also how you re going to be accounting for the tax benefit that s paid out to ge within that cash flow statement and then also would love to get your thoughts on the magnitude of debt pay down that you anticipate this year pat dugan chief financial officer right so starting with how we are treating the tax tax item obviously comes through as a benefit to us it is as part of cash from operations but we then offset it with a payment almost like it s an investing activity so you got the negative of that coming through in the different line item on the cash flow statement ok we feel very good about the overall benefit to us but the year what we pay for 2019 is still being evaluated along with the ge team when i look at the guidance i mean i think an easy way to look at it is an ebitda which is about 1 6 and then you have interest other and taxes that are reducing it to about 1 1 this is a gaap number we re mentioning the fact that we have restructuring overhang or headwind that s going to hurt us into 2020 things that we ve added back in 19 that we ll have to pay in 2020 of about 100 million and i think we re trying to look at our working capital with a strong second half of the year there could be a little bit of working capital pressure which would put us to the 900 million gaap cash from operations guidance that we gave everybody so its terms of debt repayment was your last question i think justin long stephens inc analyst correct pat dugan chief financial officer part of the question is that we re targeting a debt pay down that will get us into that 2 to 2 5 times leverage ratio but we re also looking at our overall capital allocation plan where we continue to invest in the company make sure that we re opportunistic in the right m a situation and then look at how we can return cash to shareholders also justin long stephens inc analyst ok and just to clarify on the working capital point is the assumption that you will have a headwind this year and are there any numbers you can put around the magnitude of that headwind pat dugan chief financial officer well i think i kind of did the math it s probably maybe about 100 million of working capital pressure with a strong second half of the year that we re considering in the guidance we re obviously working on plans to do better mitigate look at other tools look at customer deposits and things that could be a positive in managing our receivables managing our payables but that s what we ve kind of considered in our guidance right now justin long stephens inc analyst ok great and then just to help from a modeling perspective there are a lot of adjustments in the model right now so i was wondering when you talk about 100 basis points of margin improvement and it sounds like you ll see a similar magnitude in both segments can you give us the comparable adjusted operating margins for both the freight and the transit segment in 2019 pat dugan chief financial officer yeah we haven t done that i think that we haven t disclosed that what we re kind of looking at is overall that 100 basis points to be more weighted to the transit side a little bit less on the freight side but about the same on average between both segments justin long stephens inc analyst ok and then lastly and maybe this is a two part question and then i ll hop back in the queue but you mentioned the first quarter will be the low point of the year is there any color you can give us on the quarterly cadence of earnings you anticipate or at least what s baked into the 2020 guidance so maybe that one s for you pat and then rafael just taking a big step back and looking at the business right now what s your confidence that this year s the trough given what we re seeing in the freight market i mean do you have confidence that 2020 is the trough for earnings for this business pat dugan chief financial officer well just to talk about the quarter guidance and then i ll hand it over we don t give quarter guidance but we are trying to kind of give a nod to the seasonality of the business so if you just look at q3 to q4 in other periods the services element of our product lines is meaningful it has margins that can make things shift and so with the first quarter which tends to be a slow start because of transit freight and aftermarket and the timing of some of the underlying oe projects we just wanted to make sure everybody understood that the first quarter was going to be slightly different so that was important but as for the kind of quarter by quarter guidance we re not going to be doing that rafael santana president and chief executive officer justin with regards to the year i mean we certainly have many elements of trough here in this year but i ll stay away from that we ll continue to monitor the markets we operate in and we re really very much focused on things we control we re taking the necessary actions to adjust our business to the realities we face and the guidance we re putting out forward it certainly contemplates i ll call new locomotives down double digits for the year in terms of deliveries and freight cars down to about 40 000 cars versus in the 50 000s for the previous year so at this point we re very much confident on being able to drive margins up about 100 basis points despite of those headwinds justin long stephens inc analyst ok great i will leave it there thanks for the time rafael santana president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question is from allison poliniak from wells fargo go ahead allison poliniak wells fargo securities analyst good morning rafael santana president and chief executive officer good morning allison poliniak wells fargo securities analyst rafael with services a sizable component of freight here could you help us better understand it seems like it s holding up better cyclicality wise i think you touched on some seasonality issues with it any color there that you can help us with that particular component of freight rafael santana president and chief executive officer allison a couple of things i ll start internationally i mean our installed base continues to grow we have a number of locomotives well either entering into service or getting out of the warranty period so we continue to see a robust growth there i think our mods business we continue to see opportunities to grow that business into this year we ve talked recently about an international order we got and i think that also provides us similar dynamics and i would not forget about our opportunity to ultimately help customers on driving more efficiency we have a number of solutions that can help them in that regard as they look at ways of improving their operating ratio so we remain confident so we work with our customers very closely on fleet strategies and making sure that ultimately our fleets are the ones delivering most value out there allison poliniak wells fargo securities analyst great and then on the digital side i think you touched on a nice order that you got there any specific product area that s driving some of that growth is it broad based how are you viewing that particular piece of the business in light of psr and what s going on there rafael santana president and chief executive officer i think there s a couple of areas there that i d highlight to you number one as railroads look into increasing efficiency i think we have a number of solutions there that allow them to manage through larger trains but also there s an element of fuel savings and i think we re well positioned on that regard so that s one of the specific sub product lines within that business the other one is on really managing the overall operations so we talk about network optimization and some of these are longer term orders but it certainly reflects the confidence in the business and ultimately the opportunity we have to help customers improve their efficiency in their businesses allison poliniak wells fargo securities analyst great and then just last it might be too early for this but any thoughts on the alstom bombardier announcement in terms of any impact potential to wabtec rafael santana president and chief executive officer we think it s early days still i mean we re still really going through the details we have good and strong relationships with both customers and so we see an opportunity here to grow our business with them allison poliniak wells fargo securities analyst great thank you rafael santana president and chief executive officer thanks operator our next question is from matt elkott from cowen go ahead matt elkott cowen and company analyst good morning thank you can you guys give some more specificity on the double digit decline in locomotive deliveries in 2020 rafael santana president and chief executive officer matt first i mean this is fundamentally driven by north america and it s just a reflection of really carloads being down by 4 last year and especially in the fourth quarter by more than 7 we continue to see i mean some of those challenging dynamics for the first half of this year and we do expect that as per our customers for some improvement as you go into the second half of the year but it s a north america driven freight phenomenon matt elkott cowen and company analyst ok that s helpful but double digit i guess is a big range are we talking closer to like teens double digits rafael santana president and chief executive officer we re going to stay away from specific i m going to call counts on the locomotives but down double digits matt elkott cowen and company analyst ok and staying on locomotive deliveries and maybe operational metric disclosures are there going to be changes to the way you guys report any of your segment metrics or operating statistics associated with the investor day in march or any color on what we should expect at the investor day long term growth plan anything like that would be helpful pat dugan chief financial officer well matt this is pat i think the first thing we ve done is we ve kind of recast our revenue so kind of a little more visibility on the revenue aligned with our equipment business which includes logos the freight car component business which also includes a little bit of an industrial and services and all those things are kind of available both historically and then in restated going forward into next year in the guidance at the investor day i think we ve been pretty consistent on disclosures of like local deliveries and we re going to stay away from that but i do think we ve taken some pretty good steps to provide some transparency on the top line and where it s coming from matt elkott cowen and company analyst ok that s helpful pat now you talked a bit about the capital deployment priorities i think historically before the ge transaction you guys did three to four tuck in acquisitions per year should we expect you guys to ease back into that pace at some point in the future or do you not think of it that way rafael santana president and chief executive officer well i think 19 was very important in terms of making sure that we strengthened the balance sheet we certainly feel confident about having the optionality to still do those bolt on acquisitions and it s certainly something we will consider as part of the capital allocation process along the lines with returning value to shareholders but also looking at organic growth internally matt elkott cowen and company analyst and rafael is there like a priority area when you re looking at bolt on acquisitions is it digital acquisitions that relate to rail automation is it to support your service aftermarket locomotive business is there an area of focus that you prefer to do acquisitions in the longer term rafael santana president and chief executive officer i think you touched the two one of them being the digital electronics area we certainly see an opportunity there it s an area that grows faster than the overall freight market the other one is just an element of recurring services making sure that we re utilizing a lot of the infrastructure we ve got around customers and continue to grow that business faster than the segment growth matt elkott cowen and company analyst ok and just one final question any impact from the coronavirus specifically as it relates to your transit business and as you think of ridership going forward if this coronavirus thing does not subside soon is there a risk to your aftermarket transit business potentially rafael santana president and chief executive officer yeah so a couple of comments there number one very important to us is really the safety of our employees and i think in china we ve got close to 1 500 employees none of them with coronavirus at this point so it s a critical part for us we continue to monitor our supply chains and have taken a number of actions in order to make sure we ultimately act on alternative sources we do about 3 of our business in china at this point i mean we re continuing to monitor the situation and continue to take action if there s any relevant facts we ll make sure to disclose them matt elkott cowen and company analyst great thank you very much rafael santana president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question is from chris wetherbee from citi go ahead james monigan citi analyst it s james on for chris wanted to touch on synergies in the 150 million number you gave out how much of that is flow through from 2019 and how much is new to 2020 also kind of wanted to get a sense of where you thought you d be exiting 2020 in terms of run rate for synergies pat dugan chief financial officer so the 150 million is incremental it s an improvement you have an element of it is say about 60 million of it is coming from the well the 30 million was a net number we do have about 60 million worth of spend that was applied against that 30 million and then you have additional spend though in this year so i don t want anybody to don t think we still have some costs in order to achieve some of these synergies but the 150 million net is the incremental over the 2019 results it s coming from the same areas it s the full benefit of the rooftop consolidations the sourcing the supply chain improvements and the restructuring efforts that we went through in 2019 we haven t quantified what the run rate is at the end of the year but we still think that it puts us in a really good path when you look at it to achieve the 250 million worth of run rate synergies before the original guidance when we closed the transaction rafael santana president and chief executive officer the one thing i would add is consistent with what you saw last year expect us to continue to look for ways to accelerate the synergies and that s very much aligned with making sure that we ultimately adjust the business to the realities we face james monigan citi analyst got it and then also kind of wanted to get a sense of what your outlook for mix in 2020 in freight is it seems you re calling out some headwinds to oe so i just kind of wanted to understand what you thought the oe aftermarket mix would be and sort of give an idea of like how much of that do you think is sustainable from sort of getting better penetration in some of the aftermarket products you ve been talking about rafael santana president and chief executive officer well we continue to see a strong opportunity to grow our services business i think it s tied to some of the offerings which are of course a little bit different when i compare it to last year but that ties up to modernization that ties up to some of the elements of really some fleets that are entering operations globally out there some of the headwinds are presented in our freight components business with freight cars down on the 40s there s also a number of markets that are adjacent to that business segment they re also down including oil and gas the transit business we continue to see opportunities out there some significant orders in the underground u k north america as well and india continues to be a bright spot where we re very well positioned so mixed overall conditions we re guiding to 8 7 billion of orders which when you look at a 12 month basis it seems basically flattish james monigan citi analyst ok got it just one quick follow up what level of growth in your mod business are you expecting in 2020 and then i ll just hand it off rafael santana president and chief executive officer could you say your question again please pat dugan chief financial officer growth in mods james monigan citi analyst how much growth are you expecting in mod deliveries in 2020 and then i ll just hand it off rafael santana president and chief executive officer ok in 2020 we have the opportunity to still slightly grow the business and we re continuing to invest on ultimately i ll call driving more value for our customers those will include enhancements to fuel as you look at overhauling or modernizing the engines and so this modernization i think it continues to be a growth story for us as we look into ways of driving further value for our customers operator our next question is from jerry revich from goldman sachs go ahead jerry revich goldman sachs analyst yeah hi good morning everyone rafael santana president and chief executive officer good morning pat dugan chief financial officer good morning jerry revich goldman sachs analyst i m wondering if you could talk about your order outlook for the freight business i know it can be lumpy in terms of timing of major contract awards can you just flesh out for us how your prospect looks both on the service side as well as on the locomotive side as we kick off 2020 here rafael santana president and chief executive officer i think internationally we continue to have a bright spots and i think i mentioned asia we re seeing demand in putting in this quarter for demand for new locomotives we re also seeing an aspect of fleet renewal that continues to take place in places like australia for instance russia and cis continues to be a bright spot for us and growing as i look across west coast of africa we have the opportunity to follow up of existing projects the next phase of them latin america brazil continues to be a market where we re well positioned and as you look at concessions being renewed that s also an area of opportunity for us transits the dynamics are positive in ridership out there it s a business that if you look at the area we work in it provides at least 3 to 5 growth for us it s more about being selective in terms of the order intake we have headwinds in north america a lot of it really driven by the freight market and dynamics i mentioned with regards to new locomotives and freight cars jerry revich goldman sachs analyst and rafael net of all that do you think you could grow backlog in 2020 based on the prospect list that you have in front of you today rafael santana president and chief executive officer we re certainly focused on doing that i think we have a good pipeline of opportunities that we re working on but we re certainly dealing with i ll call challenging dynamics in the north american markets it s good to see the fourth quarter on where we ve landed we have backlog growing about 2 3 and we certainly got our teams out there working very hard to make sure that we grow the business over time jerry revich goldman sachs analyst ok and lastly on the margin bridge 20 versus 19 so the 100 basis points or 100 million ebitda growth i appreciate that it s early in the year but taking some of the discrete items it looks like you have the pieces to get you above the 100 million increase so we spoke about 150 million of synergies the improvement in transit margins as prior projects roll off that should be 50 million to 100 million 100 million from pro forma ge transportation addition based on the february 19 presentation and obviously we have the policy harmonization headwind and i know it s early in the year but i m wondering if you could just talk about if there are any other pieces that we should be thinking about that might be headwinds or is it a function of look it s early in the year and the environment is choppy so we need to give ourselves room to execute pat dugan chief financial officer well i think you ve kind of outlined all the aspects the synergies are obviously a positive contributing to the margin growth but we definitely have headwinds in the market you re seeing some shift in mix of sales year over year where you are placing sales like our freight component area which tends to be a strong profitable business with other business that doesn t have the same kind of margin profile so when you kind of look at those things on a net basis that s what gives us the confidence in the 100 basis points overall improvement in margin for the year jerry revich goldman sachs analyst ok thank you rafael santana president and chief executive officer yeah thank you operator our next question is from scott group from wolfe research go ahead rafael santana president and chief executive officer scott are you there yeah why don t we go to the next question maybe we ll add scott back later operator ok the next question is from courtney yakavonis from morgan stanley go ahead courtney yakavonis morgan stanley analyst hi good morning guys rafael santana president and chief executive officer good morning courtney yakavonis morgan stanley analyst just on the services part of freight i really appreciate the disclosure that you guys gave us but can you help us just think about how that business is growing on a pro forma basis year over year exiting 2019 and any thoughts on whether that s kind of the right run rate to think about that business in 2020 given your guidance for railcar and loco deliveries rafael santana president and chief executive officer so a couple of points we continue to see the opportunity to grow that business i think there s a number of dynamics there i think our mods program continues to be an area of opportunity i can t emphasize enough internationally what some of those opportunities are the other element for us it s the fleet that it s expanding globally we have grown the number of what i ll call installed diesel engines out there and that provides that business an opportunity to sign on what i ll call long term service agreements to support those fleets out there so that continues to be an opportunity for us i did mention that we re continuing to invest on enhancing the value our customers can get from modernizing existing fleets that includes fuel solutions and we re going to be coming up with i ll call incremental opportunities there so we re certainly continuing to look at services as an area of opportunity and even in north america as you look at a very significant number of locomotives parts the locomotives are running they re running harder and so we ll continue to support customers in terms while making sure they re getting the right reliability and availability of these fleets courtney yakavonis morgan stanley analyst ok gotcha and just on 2019 any insight into what that growth rate was on an organic basis just since it s a little confusing with the get not in the 2018 numbers pat dugan chief financial officer yeah it s kind of hard because you got two aspects you ve got different basis of gaap and policies and so it s a bit confusing i would just say overall for 19 the service revenue because of the impact of the opportunities created for itself under psr and additional mods that the revenues for services were up in 19 and then when you look into 2020 which i think was kind of your first question all the things rafael just talked about but you have a little bit of a headwind from parkings offset by our continued focus on new products and opportunities under psr to serve our customers long term in growth rates we really wouldn t talk about that on this call but it s really for us an area of growth courtney yakavonis morgan stanley analyst ok gotcha and then just switching on to the transit side of the business i think you did some resegmenting and now it looks like on the core business as it s restated margins were down for the past two quarters and then down pretty significantly this quarter can you talk just a little bit about what was driving those margin declines this quarter and then kind of when we think about the 100 bps of expansion next year how should we think about the pace of that and kind of the continuation of the u k projects flowing in rafael santana president and chief executive officer ok let me start here well i think a couple of things to separate here number one the quarterly performance was certainly impacted by well the lower margin of the refurbishment projects in the u k i think we ve reached some really critical milestones in these projects during the quarter and we believe to have a really strong cost visibility as we ve delivered more than 75 of these projects up to this point so i think that s one element of that i think the other thing to keep in mind is we re very encouraged to see the steps taken by the transit team in terms of the performance in the overall business and we re starting to see that really showing up into some what i ll call underlying key metrics that includes improvement on on time delivery that includes improvement with really lower cost associated with cost of quality we continue to see accountability up across the business there s a more robust bidding process out there margins on the orders taken over last year are up versus the backlog we ve got costs and actions taken to drive margin improvement and we have really pushed the supply chain to better cost locations we do not take these results lightly lilian and the team have really taken action including leadership changes at the project level so we ultimately drive the right discipline and accountability across the business pat dugan chief financial officer so just to help a little bit in the fourth quarter of 19 we took charges associated with certain inefficiencies especially in terms of higher labor costs we did reach some critical milestones in these projects in the quarter and we think we have a really good cost visibility and we have delivered more than 75 of these projects with most of them running off in 2020 our estimation is over 90 completed by the end of the year so we feel we re coming to the end of these projects with a good view on the profitability and i would just add that this has been well received and with hitting these milestones created cash opportunities that were realized in the fourth quarter courtney yakavonis morgan stanley analyst ok thank you operator our next question is from steve barger from keybanc capital markets go ahead steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst hi good morning guys rafael santana president and chief executive officer good morning pat dugan chief financial officer good morning steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst so you re looking for around 700 million in free cash flow which i think is about 80 of midpoint net income plus or minus can you remind us how you re thinking longer term for free cash flow conversion from net income and how long it will take to get there pat dugan chief financial officer yeah you re going off of free cash flow we ve done cash conversion off of sort of just cash from ops which would be in excess of our goal is to get over 100 and i think that we have a little bit of impact from the restructuring items i talked about and the working capital pressure in the year but overall we think we ll have cash if you look at the cash from operations as a percentage of net income that you would be in excess of 100 steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst all right and just going back to an earlier question you talked through the buckets of capital allocation but no numbers you ve got 600 million in cash just to use that free cash flow number i think you ll have around 700 million or 900 million in operating cash flow can you give us any dollar targets for debt reduction this year or can you frame up how you re thinking about debt reduction versus share buyback in terms of size and timing pat dugan chief financial officer i think our debt reduction would be it goes hand in hand with that leverage ratio so i think in putting numbers to it it s a similar performance to what we did in 19 maybe a little bit less but i really hadn t thought about it in terms of total dollars i keep focusing on the leverage ratio and of course the capital allocation story is one about having the cash available for funding our growth initiatives for the opportunistic m a and other areas that would allow us to return cash to shareholders rafael santana president and chief executive officer it goes back to creating the optionality we spoke and i think the announcement that we have with regards to the 500 million program that gives us also here an opportunity when shares are selling below the intrinsic value for us to act on steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst well i guess that s kind of the point i was making is that you feel good enough about the balance sheet now to start executing against that buyback because it certainly seems from a liquidity standpoint you re in good shape rafael santana president and chief executive officer we certainly feel we have done i ll call good progress through last year and we re at a stage here that we should fully exercise optionality and that should include share buyback steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst perfect one more just thinking about the seasonal pattern you talked about for 1q as i recall the first quarter of 19 was unusually strong due to locomotive mix so just to clarify would you expect eps will be down versus the 1 06 in 2019 pat dugan chief financial officer you remember you re looking on an adjusted basis versus a different adjusted basis but a couple of things i want to point out is if you go to 1q a year ago you had a partial quarter and it was an especially strong quarter month stub period that got included in the wabtec results when you look at it in total and for the freight segment i think you re going to end up with a result that s kind of similar in profile to what you see here in q4 that s the seasonality reality to 2020 in the first quarter but as for like a specific eps guide for the quarter we re going to do what we always did and we re not going to give any kind of quarterly guidance specific to the quarter steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst all right maybe i ll squeeze one more in for the full year do you expect negative organic growth in freight offset by relco and anything else or do you think that organic growth can be positive for freight rafael santana president and chief executive officer well when you look at what we re guiding to i mean we certainly have pressures coming from the overall freight business with transit being up pat dugan chief financial officer i mean relco in terms of size is a steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst i know it s small pat dugan chief financial officer is a small tuck in acquisition it s strategic it s good but not one of the bigger ones but that s the truth so i think to your question overall our revenue guidance on a pro forma basis is relatively flat i think we said it earlier that you have a little bit of mix of freight and some of the stronger freight businesses will be a little bit down offset by some of the growth in our transit business steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst thanks pat dugan chief financial officer yeah operator our next question is from ken hoexter from bank of america merrill lynch go ahead ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning just to follow up on the prior questions on the transit margins which you know now at 7 maybe just your thoughts on getting back to double digit long term i know you talked 100 basis points near term and removing some charges is that a product shift or is it increasing competition pushing those margins down maybe just talk a little bit about that on your bigger picture rafael santana president and chief executive officer well let me start here first of all i think we have the opportunity to improve margins in our overall business i think i ve talked before about the quality of the order intake which the team has taken some specific actions around that and we see improvements happening i think we talked about the quality of execution and that s why i made some comments earlier on some key improvements on some key metrics which include on time delivery and really lower costs associated with the cost of quality the team continues along the lines of having a very robust bidding process they ve taken further cost actions to drive margin improvements and we re continuing to push the supply chain to better cost locations you re going to hear from lilian and the team a lot more details on that progress and how they re committed even already this year to drive more than 100 basis points improvement during the investor day pat any pat dugan chief financial officer no i ll just reiterate the same thing that rafael just said we feel good about the overall for long term ability to drive margin expansion it s core to both businesses as well as achieving of having year over year lean efforts other opportunities that we find to offset and offset inflation and other costs and improve the overall margin but the synergies also contribute long term to us improving and while we also feel good about our 250 million we constantly are looking for opportunities above and beyond ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst great i appreciate that and then just a follow up on the you mentioned some passenger opportunities stepping up in the u s is that something you re looking to offset freight is that strictly on the transit side or are you talking kind of locomotives you mentioned just in the prepared comments the step up in passenger opportunity in the u s so just looking for some follow up on that rafael santana president and chief executive officer ok so yeah specifically with regards to our transit business we continue to have opportunities in the u s market again we re being very selective on the opportunities we go after but it s certainly also a bright spot in terms of both orders and brakes specific opportunities for the transit business ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst great that helps thanks operator our next question is from ivan yi from wolfe research go ahead ivan yi wolfe research analyst good morning guys this is ivan on for scott group first there s a pretty meaningful drop in the locomotive and railcar deliveries in your guidance can you talk about the biggest offsets this year that keeps overall sales flat and with that thanks for the new sales breakdown this year that s very helpful maybe you can say how much of the freight equipment sales are in north america and how much of the components is ultimately tied to the equipment market rafael santana president and chief executive officer ok so i think when you look at the dynamics in the freight business you ll certainly see an element of freight cars and locomotives down our freight components business is also well with pressure associated with some of the adjacent markets that we serve we continue to see opportunity to grow our services business i think an element of it is international growth tied off with not just modernization opportunities but also an element of fleets entering into service our digital electronics business we talked about double digit orders growth last year which provides i think a solid and strong backlog for us to be executing and that s certainly an area of opportunity for us here as we continue to progress and move forward well our overall transit business will also be growing this year ivan yi wolfe research analyst great and the rails are working toward one man crews right now what is the opportunity for wabtec and when do you expect to start seeing it and also can you also talk directly about ptc and the direction of that business this year up down flat thank you rafael santana president and chief executive officer yeah so a couple of points i mean when you talk about rail automation overall we ve been working with our customers over the years and we do have an element of adoption which might vary from customer to customer in terms of some of these tools but we really believe we have some of the critical elements to allow that we re continuing to invest on really the next generation of some of these products the ability to go from zero to zero on basically autopilot and there s a number of i ll call specific products that could further help our customers automating their operations so it s really up to our customers and working through it on how they would like to get there we re really ultimately providing the tools and the optionality on how to do that on ptc i think we re very much focused this year on both elements of making sure that we ve got interoperability working and that we continue to work with our customers and making sure that you have a system that s reliable and available to them as they go to full implementation ivan yi wolfe research analyst great and last one isn t the transit backlog down year over year so why does transit grow in 2020 what s the offset thank you pat dugan chief financial officer transit is affected by fx and some of the recast items so it s a little bit complicated but ultimately you have a big pool of transit backlog and then in terms of sales the phasing the timing the delivery the project schedules that are expected by the customer will have been considered in the guidance and will drive the top line rafael santana president and chief executive officer so backlog ex fx basis is slightly up quarter over quarter i think there s of course an element here of what pat just said one of it s seasonality of timing of orders however when we look at our backlog it remains at what i ll call historical high levels and we re confident in terms of all the opportunities we have ahead operator our next question is from saree boroditsky from jefferies go ahead saree boroditsky jefferies analyst thanks for squeezing me in could you provide an update on what you saw in your industrials mining business in the quarter and then how you re thinking about the 2020 outlook rafael santana president and chief executive officer ok when we think about mining i think overall there s certainly what i ll call pressure for overall mining as we talk to our customers i think it s a little bit different and we feel better about in specific the truck size class that we serve but it s a market that we re really monitoring closely especially due with the situation in china but at this point no specifics to be detailed i d say very much reflected within our guidance the elements i just described saree boroditsky jefferies analyst ok and then it looks like sg a guidance is embedded in pickup as a percentage of sales can you just talk us through if there s any headwinds in sg a that we should think about in 2020 pat dugan chief financial officer no i don t think so i mean thinking about our sg a we are combining the two companies and we got a 10 month get versus 12 months and that might be factoring how you re looking at it but i think all in all there s no specific item in there that s causing a problem in comparability i think year over year saree boroditsky jefferies analyst ok and then just a final question just given the 500 million in share repurchase authorization i guess any color on the cadence of how we should think about 2020 and then would this all be upside to your current eps guidance it doesn t look like you re embedding any buybacks in your share count pat dugan chief financial officer that s right we have not considered any buyback in the share count for guidance purposes so rafael santana president and chief executive officer and the authorization was really as a way to make sure that ultimately if shares are selling below the intrinsic value that we have an opportunity here to act and that s basically how we re looking at it saree boroditsky jefferies analyst appreciate the color thank you so much pat dugan chief financial officer thank you rafael santana president and chief executive

guidance this is due to the acceleration of underground development and exploration spend the underground development improves the operational flexibility across the mines and the additional exploration expenditure at wassa focused on infill drilling and some expansionary step out drilling of the southern extension of the wassa orebody cash position of 53 4m at december 31 2019 and total debt of 106 8m for net debt of 53 4m at and total debt of for net debt of following a review of the operation the value of prestea is being impaired by 56 8m based on a conservative valuation approach given recent performance and the execution risk in delivering the revised mine plan the residual asset value is balanced by liabilities and working capital resulting in a zero net asset value andrew wray chief executive officer of golden star commented the fourth quarter operational performance was in line with our expectations with wassa continuing to deliver strong mining rates and an increase in underground grades while ongoing improvements in the prestea underground performance were offset by the planned reduction in open pit contribution as a result we delivered on the upper end of the revised production range and the mid point of the aisc guidance for 2019 the effort of our management and mine site teams in 2019 alongside the significant capital investment has started to deliver improved operational performance and enhanced geological understanding at both of our mines in 2020 we plan to continue to invest in our asset base with the completion of the paste plant project at wassa which is expected to provide more flexibility in the mine plan a new mining method and mining area at prestea and acceleration of the development and maintenance spend across both sites these initiatives are expected to deliver improved production rates and margins as we progress through the year they will also help us to further define the long term growth at wassa we remain excited by the potential to continue to increase the mining rates at wassa with the aim of improving the scale and margins at the operation at prestea the investment is aimed at improving the sustainability and flexibility of the operation with the introduction of a second mining level in order to enable it to return to positive cash generation once fully ramped up through 2020 this is expected to also improve the options available for us to realize value from the asset having carried out the operational review redesigned the mine plan and invested in the equipment for long hole open stoping lhos following the update of the life of mine plans at each operation we have undertaken a carrying value review of the assets as a result the decision was made to reduce the carrying value of prestea to reflect anticipated changes to future cash flow resulting from shifts in the unit costs working capital and capex assumptions we have taken a conservative approach given recent performance as well as the inherent execution risk in the new plan resulting in an impairment charge of 56 8m q4 2019 fy 2019 performance summary q4 2019 q4 2018 yoy change fy 2019 fy 2018 yoy change production and cost

team was put in place following the appointment mid year of andrew wray as ceo this is being accompanied by a transition of our corporate head office from toronto to london to be more accessible to our operations in west africa and enhance the executive team s support of the operations through a greater on the ground presence the severance costs relating to the closure of the toronto office and duplication of head office costs had an impact on the corporate costs other expenses in 2019 and this will continue into h1 2020 after which time the cost base is expected to normalize wassa mining rates wassa delivered improved mining rates in 2019 while maintaining low per tonne unit costs mining rates exceeded 4 000tpd tonnes per day through h2 2019 wassa is expected to continue to deliver at this level throughout 2020 prestea optimization the independent review of the underground operation and improvement project which commenced in 2019 positions the mine for a transformational year in 2020 the current alimak mining areas on 24 level are being optimized to improve orebody definition reduce stope cycle time and reduce dilution development has commenced on 17 level for the introduction of lhos in the 17 21 level area these changes are expected to be ongoing through 2020 and are aimed at improving the flexibility in the operation and are planned to result in an improved mining rate in excess of 500tpd on a consistent basis sustainability philipa varris was promoted to the executive committee in q4 2019 to prioritize golden star s sustainability and safety initiatives implementation of our safety and health strategy throughout 2019 saw increased alignment to our values and enhanced achievement of our principle that all incidents are reported which led to an expected increase in our near miss and all injury frequency rates continued optimization of our malaria prevention program in support of sustainable development goal 3 sdg achieved the lowest per capita malaria case rate in the history of the business these successes were recognized in the year by the global compact network canada in their sdgs emerging practice guide case studies to strengthen our relationship with our host communities the wassa mine signed a milestone memorandum of understanding with its local communities financing on october 17 2019 the company closed the 60

the 2020 guidance is a range of operational initiatives aimed at improving the consistency of the operations and visibility of the longer term potential of the operations 2020 capex the fy 2020 capex guidance totals 55 60m while the 2020 budget shows a lower level of investment than seen in 2019 the capex budget remains at elevated levels to fund the introduction of a new mining level and method at prestea the wassa paste plant construction and accelerated maintenance and development at both mines 2020 exploration the 2020 exploration budget is lower than in 2019 as the surface drilling of the deeper zones of the southern extensions to the wassa orebody is now complete although the orebody remains open to the south the future drilling is now expected to be carried out from underground drill positions in order to lower the cost of the infill drilling programs and to allow tighter infill drill spacing to be achieved more efficiently in 2020 the greenfield and brownfield exploration programs will focus on near mine targets in and around wassa and prestea as well as on regional exploration targets within 60km of the wassa operation a total of 6 2m 3 5 m capitalized and 2 7m expensed has been allocated for exploration activities during 2020 wassa operating expectations the mid point of the 155 165koz production guidance for the year is 2 ahead of the 2019 performance in 2020 the mining rate is expected to continue at the higher rates in excess of 4 000tpd as achieved in h2 2019 the paste plant project is due to be completed in late q3 2020 enabling the operation to better sequence and mine primary and secondary stopes as well as recovering pillars and secondary stopes in some previously mined areas this is expected to make a small contribution in 2020 with a greater impact expected in 2021 as the paste fill system becomes fully operational this timeline may be subject to change as we have been notified by the project engineering consultant that there is potential for a delay to the delivery of materials and components being sourced from china the situation is being closely monitored and we will provide further updates as soon as we are informed of any change prestea operating expectations the 40 45koz production guidance for 2020 is broadly in line with 2019 performance with significant changes at the operation underway production from the underground is expected to improve in 2020 with reduced open pit contribution at prestea underground the investment in a new mining area and the introduction of lhos is expected to improve overall mining rates and reduce the operational risk with improved flexibility in the schedule the improvements being implemented are expected to reduce the aisc by around 200 oz as per the 2020 guidance when

from the 149 7koz produced in 2018 this increase in production was due to the increase in tonnes mined and processed at the wassa underground mine compared to 2018 in february 2018 wassa became an

q4 2019 33 higher than achieved in q3 2019 and in line with the 3 80g t achieved in q4 2018 the improvement in grades in the quarter is attributable to mining progressing in the 595 and 620 levels

expected to be completed in q3 2020 with commissioning in q4 2020 this timeline may be subject to change as we have been notified by the project engineering consultant that there is potential for a delay to the delivery of materials and components being sourced from china the situation is being closely monitored and we will provide further updates as soon as we are informed of any change the paste fill process is expected to add approximately 6 t to the mining unit costs but results in a higher recovery of the resource with less ore left in remnant pillars which is expected to support

q4 2019 in line with the same period in 2018 but 24 lower than in q3 2019 due to a lower contribution from the open pits as mining at the opon area was impacted by heavy rains due to the constrained nature of the open pit as it is nearing the end of its design life some relatively small scale oxide resources close to the bogoso processing plant have been evaluated for open pit mining and we expect it to form a lower proportion of the plan in h1 2020 the decrease in fy 2019 production relative to 2018 was due to a 38 decrease in the open pit production and a 35 decrease in underground production the lower open pit production results from a planned decrease in the volume of open pit ore processed offset in part by a 30 increase in open pit grades the reduced underground production resulted from a 45 decrease in head grades caused by a combination of higher dilution and ore loss this effect was partially offset by a 24 increase in underground ore tonnes processed grades in q4 the work to address dilution in the underground mine delivered improvements particularly in stope s12 which was the first stope with a reduced raise height this helped to better control mining execution and manage dilution the initiative to separate ore from waste to further reduce dilution of the mill feed is also starting to yield benefits with 9kt of waste material successfully removed from processing in the quarter stope availability underground production was slightly higher in q4 2019 than the prior quarter albeit lower than anticipated due to ore locked up in stope s13 as a result of oversize material blocking the stope as mining activity progresses through the adjacent stope s14 during q1 2020 we expect some of this ore to be released open pit mine life exceeding expectations the open pits produced 4 8koz in q4 2019 in line with the 4 6koz in the same period in 2018 the prestea open pits were expected to complete gold production earlier in 2019 however open pit mining continued into q4 2019 with additional ore being sourced from the pits close to bogoso costs cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization was 20 4m for q4 2019 compared to 32 1m for the same period in 2018 the decrease was due primarily to 9 9m of severance payments from the prestea improvement plan in q4 2018 not being repeated in 2019 a 2 4m decrease in mine operating expenses related to less ore processed from prestea open pits and a 0 4m decrease inventory net realizable value adjustment and write off offset by a 0 1m increase in operating costs from metals

rose 35 from the 1 630 oz aisc achieved in q3 2019 again primarily due to the lower ounces produced and a largely fixed cost base with production volumes anticipated to rise through 2020 the unit costs are expected to reduce to an aisc guidance range of 1 650 1 850 oz prestea operational review following the completion of csa s independent review and phase 2 design the implementation of a revised mining plan is progressing at the prestea underground mine with several of the independent review recommendations underway within project okode extraction of the 17l 21l has been redesigned for lhos and development has commenced with the new design using conventional equipment orders have been placed to mechanize the lhos zones including a development jumbo long hole drill an additional loader scoop and a small truck to haul material back to 17l the jumbo is expected to be delivered during h1 2020 and is expected to significantly improve development productivity an operational readiness plan for the implementation of the lhos mining method is currently underway in the alimak stoping area from 21l 24l stopes have been redesigned to reduce the overall hanging wall span as recommended by csa this is achieved by reducing the height where possible to improve travel times and stope turnover rates where the height cannot be reduced due to lack of access the strike length of the stopes has been reduced to improve stability a slightly narrower alimak platform is being trialled to reduce overall dilution levels ventilation connections have been completed on 24l enabling the development focus to move to the set up of stopes to the north and south of the current block several other initiatives recommended by csa and prioritized by the site team are being managed under project okode supported by a project manager and operations specialist as well as project teams on site some of these initiatives include the increase in drilling for resource definition overbreak controls maintenance improvements and various productivity improvements such as rail upgrades shaft schedule improvements and an upgraded rock breaker exploration in 2019 the company invested 20 5m in exploration of which 3 2m was expensed and 17 3m was capitalized the 2019 exploration spend therefore exceeded the 15 8m budget for the year the increased investment in exploration was made during h2 2019 with additional budget allocated for infill and step out drill holes into the southern extensions of the wassa orebody and on 8 000 metres of infill definition drilling budget into panel 4 the 12 additional holes drilled in southern extension zone increased the geological and structural understanding of the zone which allows for more detailed planning of the mining of this area finally additional budget was also allocated to drilling 5 000 metres in the deeper areas of the father brown resource area in 2020 the greenfield and brownfield exploration programs will focus on near mine targets in and around wassa and prestea as well as on regional exploration targets a total of 6 2m 3 5m budget for capitalized exploration and 2 7m for expensed exploration has been allocated for exploration programs across the project portfolio wassa in 2019 the wassa exploration drilling infill and step out extension drilling from surface was completed with a total of 45 047 metres drilled with assay results released in q4 for more information please see the company s news release issued on november 13 2019 an update of the resource model has commenced the results of which we expect to announce in q1 2020 in q4 2019 the exploration team also completed a detailed review of the exploration portfolio in ghana generating a pipeline of early stage target delineation and drill testing targets with the 2019 surface program at wassa now complete the company has commenced a complete review of the geological interpretation involving external structural geology and geochemistry specialists updated geological interpretations and resource estimations for the year end 2019 is expected to be reported during q1 2020 however we expect further refinements to the interpretations and subsequent resource estimation updates in h2 2020 based on additional detailed analysis of the geological model the drilling to date at wassa has been targeted at the conversion of inferred resources to indicated as well as the definition and expansion of current inferred resources results have been successful in converting portions of the inferred resources to indicated as well as better defining mineralization on the southern extension of the orebody and within the hanging wall and footwall zones of the main b shoot mineralization deeper infill drilling into the wide zones of mineralization intersected in the southern extension drilling in late 2018 and early 2019 has shown that the previously interpreted single high grade mineralized zone can now be interpreted as several sub parallel mineralized zones and this new understanding will be incorporated into the resource update expected to be released in q1 2020 although the previously interpreted single broad zone of mineralization is now interpreted as several narrower 20 70 metre wide zones of mineralization we do not expect to see a significant variation in the overall resource volume at wassa drilling in 2020 is planned to be focused on testing the footwall to the main mining area b shoot investigating for underground plunge extensions of gold mineralization between the mined out wassa south east pit and the recently identified footwall zones in the southern extension drilling this programme is expected to commence in q1 2020 and consists of an initial 4 6 holes for 3 000 metres of diamond core on 200 metre spaced sections drilled from underground platforms if successful this drilling program may identify a new underground mining area at wassa outside the current decline system potentially adding incremental tonnes to the currently under utilized processing plant father brown as stated in the q3 2019 results the review of the asset showed that the project as it currently stands does not deliver sufficient returns to move into a feasibility study as a result the 2020 exploration budget will not see any significant investment in father brown resource estimation and evaluation work is being progressed in conjunction with desktop mine design work this work will be used to assess whether future drill programs are justified prestea underground in 2019 drilling at prestea focused on improving the understanding of the orebody and waste zones that had been impacting the productivity of the alimak mining process earlier in 2019 during 2019 63 holes were drilled totaling 12 424 metres most of this drilling was infill drilling to the north and south of the existing stopes on 24 level the updated resources and reserves will be disclosed in the year end mineral resource and reserve statements due

each month s values to prior periods values to detect trends that may indicate increases or decreases in operating efficiencies we provide this measure to investors to allow them to also monitor operational efficiencies of the company s mines we calculate this measure for both individual operating units and on a consolidated basis since cash operating costs do not incorporate revenues changes in working capital or non operating cash costs they are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under ifrs changes in numerous factors including but not limited to mining rates milling rates ore grade gold recovery costs of labor consumables and mine site general and administrative activities can cause these measures to increase or decrease we

share based compensation expenses and severance charges are allocated based on gold sold by each operation all in sustaining costs per ounce is that amount divided by the number of ounces of gold sold excluding pre commercial production ounces sold during the period this measure seeks to represent the total costs of producing gold from current operations and therefore it does not include capital expenditures attributable to projects or mine expansions exploration and evaluation costs attributable to growth projects income tax payments interest costs or dividend payments consequently this measure is not representative of all of the company s cash expenditures in addition the calculation of all in sustaining costs does not include depreciation expense as it does not reflect the impact of expenditures incurred in prior periods therefore it is not indicative of the company s overall profitability share based compensation expenses are also excluded from the calculation of all in sustaining costs as the company believes that such expenses may not be representative of the actual payout on equity and liability based awards the company believes that all in sustaining costs will better meet the needs of analysts investors and other stakeholders of the company in understanding the costs associated with producing gold understanding the economics of gold mining assessing the operating performance and the company s ability to generate free cash flow from current operations and to generate free cash flow on an overall company basis due to the capital intensive nature of the industry and the long useful lives over which these items are depreciated there can be a disconnect between net earnings calculated in accordance with ifrs and the amount of free cash flow that is being generated by a mine in the current market environment for gold mining equities many investors and analysts are more focused on the ability of gold mining companies to generate free cash flow

independent auditor the independent auditors reports on the annual report and financial statements for 2018 and 2019 were unqualified did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis and did not contain a statement under 498 2 or 498 3 of the companies act 2006 the company s statutory accounts for the year ended 31 december 2018 have been filed with the registrar of companies the company s statutory accounts for the year ended 31 december 2019 will be delivered to the registrar in due course the financial information in this annual financial report has been prepared using frs 102 the financial reporting standard applicable in the uk and republic of ireland frs102 which forms part of generally accepted accounting practice uk gaap issued by the financial reporting council the financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with the companies act 2006 and with the statement of recommended practice financial statements of investment trust companies and venture capital trusts issued by the association of investment companies aic in october 2019 chairman s statement and review of 2019 portfolio performance at the mid year we reported that the net asset value per share nav had grown 17 2 by the year end the company s nav per share growth had reached 27 5 the growth in nav for the year which compares favourably with wider indices reflected strong equity markets globally and good stock selection of note was an unusually sharp divergence in performance between larger and smaller companies within our overall smaller companies remit larger companies performed materially better than smaller ones to illustrate this the company s investments with a market capitalisation in excess of 1bn at the year end had delivered a total return of 56 5 with the investments with a market capitalisation below 1bn returning the lower but still good figure of 19 1 there is degree to which this divergence reflects success because the good performers have grown but the more significant factor this year is a much greater re rating in the valuation basis a crude measure of some relevance is the bloomberg forecast of enterprise value to sales it is 5 0x on average for the holdings above 1bn whereas the average for companies below 1bn is 2 8x the most significant effect on performance is provided by the uk which accounts for 52 2 of the company s total assets and has a much lower average market capitalisation the total return from our uk portfolio was 30 2 which compares favourably with the numis smaller companies index plus aim ex investment companies which returned 22 2 nevertheless this market has not felt like a bull market at all because liquidity has been so poor indeed volumes in aim technology stocks across the market have fallen 70 over the last year in a normal market cycle we would expect the performance to filter down to much smaller companies in 2020 and 2019 should have been a good year for new issues however it was not the uk market had a double headwind firstly political uncertainty which was significantly alleviated by the election because the uk portfolio appreciated 7 8 in december secondly a withdrawal from illiquid assets or at least avoidance of smaller companies partly due to the regulatory shock of mifid ii and other issues the latter may have an ongoing effect which we have to monitor closely however the performance figures should reassure investors that shrinking markets can still be rewarding the north american region has delivered the strongest overall return reflecting a greater skew to the larger end of the remit the total return from the north american portfolio was 39 5 versus the russell 2000 small cap technology index in sterling terms returning 29 7 it is interesting to observe that the large capitalisation russell 1000 technology index returned 41 5 so again smaller companies have materially underperformed their bigger brethren but it is pleasing to have performed nearly as well as that latter index which is dominated by apple and microsoft when they have performed so well it is also pleasing that the uk performance in spite of the microcap challenges has exceeded that of the us russell 2000 technology index remarkably there were 62m in takeovers in the company s north america portfolio some of which have not completed which is extraordinary versus a market value of 218m at the start of the year the company s total return in europe was 38 9 with three quarters of the region s return by value coming from the three biggest holdings be semiconductor data respons and nordic semiconductor the asian total return was 29 3 with a particularly strong performance from taiwan of 51 5 cash has been a drag on the overall return cash levels were higher than planned at the start of 2019 reflecting a spate of takeovers and a further 106m of takeovers have been announced during 2019 in both the uk and north america portfolios sales exceeded purchases and modest net cash was invested in emea and asia there were no completed takeovers in those regions though by the year end one significant holding data respons agreed a takeover which has not yet completed reinvestment has been measured and the manager has taken profits in a number of holdings reflecting full valuations during the year share buyback transactions amounted to 20 3m or 2 3 of the equity outstanding at an average price including costs of 12 79 per share board composition and governance as anticipated at this time last year julian cazalet retired from the board of the company at the conclusion of the annual general meeting in april 2019 having chaired the board for ten years we are very grateful for his leadership and his very substantial contribution to the company s success henrietta marsh joined the board in september bringing investment management background with a particular focus on smaller companies to further strengthen the board s expertise the company undertook an audit tender process in 2019 and is pleased to report that pricewaterhousecoopers llp were appointed as auditor to the company and have undertaken the 2019 audit outlook valuations are not as attractive as they have been but the sector is still dynamic and we believe continues to offer better opportunities than the wider market the microcap end of the market offers conspicuously more interesting valuations the closed end nature of an investment trust makes it an ideal vehicle to access the company s target market ian russell chairman 18 february 2020 investment manager s report after a year of consolidation in 2018 i was confident that 2019 would be better but candidly i am surprised by quite how strong the market has been i was particularly apprehensive in the middle of the year when i was aware how dire liquidity was particularly in the uk and europe as woodford s troubles emerged there was a spate of selling as investors tried to reduce holdings in illiquid stocks and the market was scarcely functioning i feared distressed sellers would deliver a downward dislocation fortunately the woodford situation occurred against a very strong market background otherwise more damage could have been done why i wonder has the market been so strong i believe the main reason is that while there is a shortage of capital in smaller quoted companies there is a surplus in the hands of private equity they are using cheap debt to leverage returns and exploit the anomaly that interest is tax deductible when dividends are not they continue to pay significant premiums when acquiring quoted companies and gradually the quoted market is moving to their valuation levels they have gathered assets by performing with leverage which has worked in an era of declining and very low real interest rates from first principles the ideal environment is for companies to have permanent capital and for investors to have perfect liquidity that worked in the stock market and for the wider economy as well over extended periods on the other hand private equity is temporary capital with short term horizons which while possibly driving markets higher in the short term will over time tend to undermine economies as more ownership goes into its hands the move to private equity ownership has been helped by the huge increase in costs and distraction from spiralling regulation in public markets which is particularly onerous for developing businesses for example i estimate that of the 131 uk listed investments in the portfolio each has spent an additional 50 000 on investor relations by appointing a joint broker commissioning independent research or in extremis employing an individual to do investor relations on average herald owns 4 2 of the outstanding capital of its uk holdings so the share of those costs borne by our investors is c 275 000 this is a hidden cost not disclosed to investors at the same time we now have 17 holdings with no broker coverage a further 64 with access to only one broker including our largest us holding pegasystems and a further 62 holdings with access to research from only two brokers this anecdote perhaps explains why mifid ii research payments are so confusing and challenging for us and why some investors and brokers are disappearing from the smaller companies scene similarly audit fees are leaping and it seems too much time is spent counting the blades of grass without intelligently viewing the lawn we are jealous of the minimal scrutiny of the private equity world but maybe in time investors will realise that minimal regulation is not ideal either wealth managers are facing ever increasing costs which now have to be paid out of after tax income when previously more of the cost was ascribed to capital none but the richest investors can now afford tailor made advice when costs were pro rata to dealing more of the cost was born by big investors and less by small investors in recent years the stock markets in the uk and the us have not provided the stable quality ownership that they did in the past and have not supported the uk technology sector the quality long term owners of defined benefit pension schemes and insurance companies have disappeared and the ebbs and flows of open ended funds make them unstable shareholders for small companies as allocations to quoted uk equities have fallen investors have too easily accepted takeovers and failed to provide capital for companies to grow in this challenging environment for smaller public companies herald has been a steadfast supporter of technology businesses we have been made insiders for secondary fund raisings over 100 times in 2019 and we have participated in 62 placings with an aggregate value of 40m there were other occasions when we would have participated or invested more had there been more co investors as we are disciplined in ensuring that we generally do not exceed 10 ownership of the outstanding share capital i am sure flows into passive investments are driving up some valuations for liquidity reasons they should not and generally do not invest in smaller companies but it is another slug of capital no longer available for small quoted companies clearly they do not participate in new issues nor in pricing shares efficiently on a more positive note there is relative value in the smallest companies capital is still hard to find where it is needed most which is for emerging companies who have not yet reached profitability where venture capital has significantly lower cash to deploy compared to leveraged private equity furthermore us investors appreciating the value in the uk are beginning to appear on the share registers of the smaller uk quoted companies which may be the lifeline needed i am reassured that the sec has extended the exemption which allows us brokers to sell research to european firms by three years there are therefore the building blocks in place of attractive valuations and increasing capital availability for a positive investment environment i remember when i started in the city during thatcher s reign the atmosphere was we need small companies to create wealth added value jobs taxes and future big companies and there was an enthusiasm to allocate capital accordingly it is within the government s powers to direct uk savings to alleviate the disastrous decisions made over the last twenty years after all they provide a subsidy to pensions isas and private equity now that we have left the eu there is an opportunity for government to create a really positive environment for innovation and growth uk the uk portfolio has returned 30 2 outperforming the numis smaller companies index plus aim ex investment companies the numis index by 8 the return from stocks with a market capitalisation exceeding 1bn was 77 3 which has driven the outperformance and was over 60 better than the smaller uk companies in the company s portfolio i note that fully listed uk stocks returned 54 5 and aim stocks delivered 21 6 so the bigger stocks in aim contributed very strongly and i conclude that neither aim nor politics is the issue but rather the flight of capital from illiquid smaller companies of the top 73 holdings in the company with a market capitalisation of over 1bn only 17 are in the uk with a market value of 185 4m but a book cost of only 41 7m therefore on average they have risen 4 5x many having started as microcaps in the portfolio the number of takeovers in the uk was eight with an aggregate value of 38 1m which is a lower rate than recent years being only 8 1 of the uk portfolio at the start of 2019 the most significant takeover was statpro in which the company had an 11 stake we went above our customary 10 threshold when they could not draw on their overdraft facility when kaupthing went bankrupt we along with statpro s directors provided emergency funding we first invested in may 2000 in an early stage ipo when it was a struggle to find value in the technology bubble i am sorry to see the company go but pleased to say the return over the life of the holding is 1 018 5 of the cumulative 13 8m total return over the history of the holding 9 2m was in 2019 with the takeover premium people detached from investing may ask why did you not buy them at the beginning of 2019 two reasons firstly an 11 stake would not have been available and secondly the company would not have floated and survived if we had not provided it with necessary capital unfortunately there are not enough other long term investors around i suspect there were few technology investments made in may 2000 that delivered that sort of return albeit over nearly 20 years scisys was another company where herald was the largest outside shareholder with an 8 2 stake it is under offer as is sophos the star performers have been gb group and future which both returned more than 20m during the year and have been strong long term performers dwarfing the disappointments from m c saatchi and loopup there are currently a few unlisted holdings with an aggregate value of 15 1m some are unlisted securities which are convertible into quoted ones 35 7 of 15 1m and others are previously quoted companies that have delisted 11 2 fusionex and celoxica there are two further private companies which are also held within herald ventures natilik and antenova accounting for 19 8 both are profitable and paying dividends the board has approved a limited scope to invest in private companies and we have a natural flow of opportunities if we believe better returns can be achieved here we would consider asking directors and shareholders for greater flexibility but have no current plans to do so the remaining private investment is the holding in the management company since inception the uk has been the core driver of the company s performance but over the last five years the uk has lagged the returns from north america and europe even so the total return in the uk has been 105 5 over that period while the numis index has returned 52 4 and the aim technology index a similar amount north america the north american portfolio s return in sterling terms was 39 5 some 10 ahead of the russell 2000 technology index smaller companies in the us materially underperformed the company s overall return for many years post the technology bubble of 2000 but have outperformed from 2014 the company s north american portfolio has returned 171 4 in sterling terms over the last five years with the russell 2000 technology index returning 135 4 over the same period 36 0 ahead the total return of the large company russell 1000 technology index has returned 181 4 i should be thrilled if we can sustain that degree of outperformance but a legitimate question is why we have not had a higher us weighting there were two factors takeovers and valuations at the beginning of 2015 the value of the north american portfolio was 144m and by coincidence the aggregate value of us takeovers in the last five years has also been 144m of that 62m is the value of takeovers in 2019 alone including mellanox and fitbit which have not yet completed some 20 4 of the north american portfolio at the start of 2019 has been acquired in the last year the significant takeovers were attunity 17 3m mellanox 16 8m amber road 9 4m hydrogenics 6 7m and quantenna 5 4m we took an initial position in attunity in 2014 and the company cornerstoned a secondary offering in december 2017 investing 4 75m which i had the confidence to do having known the management with a modest holding for three years the take out price of 23 5 per share by private equity house thoma bravo seems a good return in just over a year but one of my colleagues saw them at a gartner conference recently and exclaimed on his return that we were robbed because revenues had grown 100 we are sad to be losing mellanox as well the total return has been 9x the initial book cost and the exit valuation is somewhat disappointing it takes time and patience to find similar opportunities as well as losing some holdings to takeovers in north america we took profits in some where we believed that the stocks had run too far in aggregate we sold 67m of north american stocks offset by 30m of purchases the cash from sales and takeovers has come in with the market at elevated levels and we believe that there will be better buying opportunities in the us private equity is sweeping up value but some of the momentum stocks in the saas software as a service area were on uncomfortably high valuations with ev sales values as high as 30x there is a resourcing bubble in california and stock based compensation meaning free shares are being liberally doled out but normally stripped out of adjusted eps numbers there were signs in the second half that the market is beginning to worry about this too and valuations have corrected a little analysts almost never take account of share based payments in earnings forecasts which means there is a material overstatement of earnings and therefore understatement of the p e ratio this is a particular problem in the software sector but not in semiconductors i am therefore unsurprised that semiconductors have performed relatively well there are 22 stocks in the portfolio with an aggregate value of 170m which exceed 3bn market capitalisation which is the level above which we do not make new or further investments of these 13 are in north america with an aggregate value of 95 5m which is an anomalously large proportion 37 of the north american portfolio the aggregate cost base for these holdings is only 19 3m so the average return is nearly 5x in addition 14m profit has been realised already the star performers have been pegasystems mellanox descartes and five9 liveperson and hydrogenics are smaller companies which have contributed strongly this year the high levels of takeovers in the company s north american market investment universe has been reflected in a sharp decline in the number of listed technology companies because takeovers have exceeded ipos at the beginning of 2019 the number of stocks in the bloomberg communications and technology sectors in the united states with a market capitalisation 20m and 1bn valuation it is interesting that some of these have crawled to market in a dull way or failed to ipo those private valuations were too high furthermore spotify and slack pioneered an introduction to the market without a fund raising slack s share price for example reached 38 6 when it first listed and traded at 22 at the year end it still has a market value way above our smaller companies remit at 12 4bn which is eye watering compared to forecast sales of 622m for the year to march 2020 and a huge loss making margin of over 20 of ebit presumably some of the stock has been acquired by passive investors these late stage venture investors must be careful to leave something on the table to attract public investors or exits will be difficult examples like this may make the pre ipo fashion fade while leveraged private equity will stumble when interest rates rise emea the european portfolio had a tricky year in 2018 led by the semiconductor downturn including the largest holding be semiconductor industries but 2019 has seen a good recovery the total return for 2019 was 38 9 and over 5 years it has been 181 in sterling terms which makes it the best performing region data respons is a norwegian holding acquired in 2014 and a french company akka has agreed to acquire it it is a pity to lose a holding with a known and respected management team but it has helped short term performance asia the asian portfolio has returned 29 3 in sterling terms this year and 78 3 over 5 years within the year the kosdaq it index in korea rose 6 3 the larger company twse electronics index in taiwan increased 40 8 and the mothers general small companies index in japan was up 8 9 performance across the asian indices was disparate between countries and between the first and second half of the year in general china and hong kong equity markets had a volatile and challenging year due to the negative impact on gdp of trump s tariff war with china and the civil disturbance in hong kong the australian market had a stellar start to the year rising around 50 in sterling terms by mid july 2019 before giving up a decent proportion of these gains by the year end by contrast the twse electronic index the twsee index had modest gains in the first half but rose strongly in the second half to return 40 8 for the full year one of the highest returns from any index worldwide the taiwanese portfolio holdings surpassed the twsee index with a 51 5 return in the year the stock market excitement in taiwan is focused around two concepts firstly the adoption of 5g wireless technology increasing the demand for taiwanese hardware and semiconductors and secondly demand for components from chinese companies desperate to switch away from american suppliers as a result of the us china trade war as with all concepts the reality can disappoint and with a number of the taiwanese holdings near record valuations there is a temptation to realise some gains the biggest contribution in the year came from realtek a taiwanese semiconductor company that benefitted from strong demand for its rf semiconductors particularly for use in wireless audio earbuds the approach within the asian portfolio is to continue to diversify away from the hardware business models common in korea and taiwan by unearthing opportunities and allocating capital to interesting small companies in countries such as australia and japan both of which have a good flow of ipos coming to market sector background we remain enthusiastic about the outlook for investing in the technology sector cloud computing and ubiquitous connectivity will continue to drive disruption across different sectors creating opportunities for technology companies although we expect trade tensions and regulatory concerns to continue to cause short term volatility ultimately the sector is among the few which is investing heavily in innovation creating high value employment and bringing benefits to consumers enterprises and governments around the world and generating attractive returns in the process the concept of it as a utility has been talked about since the mid 1990s however it was with the wide acceptance of opensource software post 2000 the availability of mobile data networks in the mid 2000s the launch of amazon s aws in 2006 and the launch of the apple app store in 2008 that the pieces of the puzzle were in place for the concept to go mainstream today we call that utility model cloud computing we are 10 years into the adoption of cloud computing the size of the market is very large but growth rates remain robust gartner group estimate public cloud revenues to grow from 227bn in 2019 to over 350bn in 2022 source gartner moreover we see the adoption of cloud computing disrupting about 1tr of the current annual spending on legacy systems the move to cloud computing is disproportionately beneficial for smaller companies it gives them access to a global resilient it infrastructure at arguably less than 1 of cost of having to build it themselves and the added benefit that they can flexibly scale their businesses up and down efficiently and with low risk additionally this allows small companies to target niche markets around the world efficiently in the same way that the internet democratised information flow and we are still grappling with its second and third order effects cloud computing and ubiquitous connectivity continue to democratise software development across different end markets with changing second and third order effects investing in technology gives us a front seat to see the ripples and aftershocks of seemingly unconnected small innovations which often combine to create tectonic shifts across different industries regardless of the source of the innovations smaller companies and the entrepreneurs behind them tend to be the first ones to exploit the nascent opportunities throughout global supply chains with time and relentlessly excellent execution leaders emerge to dominate fragmented newly created markets this has been the story of most of the tech titans of today e g microsoft apple tsmc google facebook amazon asml and sap we have seen this pattern repeated again and again over the last three decades we do not see any sign of it changing in the foreseeable future environmental impact in a world of limited resources and growing environmental and social concerns it is worth highlighting that a number of the technology companies have taken it upon themselves to be standard bearers raising the environmental and social bars for all for example apple is using 100 renewable energy for all of the electricity used by its facilities around the world and is striving to make products using 100 recycled and renewable materials apple imposes its own exacting standards on all of its suppliers and the suppliers of their suppliers apple s lead in this area has spurred others such as google microsoft amazon to also up their efforts so although the us government driven by corporate lobbies drags its feet on environmental commitments this has not stopped the leading us technology companies from rapidly raising standards across their supply chains around the world this leads small companies which are customers and or suppliers of the large companies to also become progressively more environmentally efficient we re sourcing 100 renewable energy for all the electricity used at our facilities in 43 countries around the world two thirds of this renewable energy comes from apple created projects we take responsibility for our entire carbon footprint that includes the emissions beyond our direct control like those from sourcing materials making our products and our customers using their devices partners across our supply chain are installing or investing in sizable solar projects and purchasing clean energy directly from renewable projects or from their utility as of april 2019 44 manufacturing partners in 16 countries have committed to 100 renewable energy for apple production apple environmental responsibility report 2019 coronavirus the technology sector will be significantly affected if coronavirus continues to disrupt manufacturing in china although the direct exposure to chinese companies is minimal the indirect effect could be significant in particular a handful of holdings in each region manufacture products there either with chinese operations or through subcontractors and suppliers and many more companies use pcs and servers which are at least in part manufactured there however the knock on effects will be felt in many sectors if the cessation of production is prolonged and at this stage that is uncertain prospects we remain confident that there is growth in the sector above that of the wider economy and that much of the sector now has non cyclical spending in particular the recurring revenues associated with it infrastructure and applications used by corporations the consumer and governments alike have the defensive characteristics of utilities without the regulatory issues which benefit so many companies within our universe however the geopolitical uncertainties the illiquidity associated with smaller companies and valuation levels which will be vulnerable when interest rates rise means that we prefer to keep higher than normal cash levels to ensure we can exploit buying opportunities which will inevitably occur for reassurance valuations are in general not in bubble territory and the difficulty which central banks have in raising interest rates means there is a good chance that valuations could rise further katie potts fund manager 18 february 2020

derive therefrom for the reasons set forth above undue reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements notes 1 non ifrs disclosure the company believes that investors use certain non ifrs measures as indicators to assess gold mining companies specifically total cash costs per ounce and all in sustaining cash costs per ounce in the gold mining industry these are common performance measures but do not have any standardized meaning the company believes that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with ifrs certain investors use this information to evaluate the company s performance and ability to generate cash flow accordingly it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs total cash costs per ounce of gold total cash costs total cash costs include mine site operating costs such as mining processing and local administrative costs including stock based compensation related to mine operations royalties production taxes mine standby costs and current inventory write downs if any production costs are exclusive of depreciation and depletion reclamation capital and exploration costs total cash costs are net of by product silver sales and are divided by gold ounces sold to arrive at a per ounce figure for the period ended december 31 2019 total cash costs includes an adjustment for the purchase price allocation that represents the impact on production costs of the valuation of metal inventory acquired with the business combination on the purchase of the el limon and la libertad mines all in sustaining costs per ounce of gold aisc aisc is a performance measure that reflects the expenditures that are required to produce an ounce of gold from current operations while there is no standardized meaning of the measure across the industry the company s definition is derived from the definition as set out by the world gold council in its guidance dated june 27 2013 and november 16 2018 respectively the world gold council is a non regulatory non profit organization established in 1987 whose members include global senior mining companies the company believes that this measure is useful to external users in assessing operating performance and the ability to generate free cash flow from operations calibre defines aisc as the sum of total cash costs sustaining capital capital required to maintain current operations at existing production levels corporate general and administrative expenses in mine exploration expenses amortization of asset retirement costs and rehabilitation accretion related to current operations aisc excludes capital expenditures for significant improvements at existing operations deemed to be expansionary in nature exploration and evaluation related to growth projects rehabilitation accretion not related to current operations financing costs debt repayments and taxes total aisc is divided by gold ounces sold to arrive at a per ounce figure for the period ended december 31 2019 aisc includes an adjustment for the purchase price allocation that represents the impact on production costs of the valuation of metal inventory acquired with the business combination on the purchase of the el limon and la libertad mines adjusted net income loss per share adjusted net income loss and adjusted net income loss per share are non ifrs measures that do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers the company defines adjusted net income loss as net income loss adjusted for non recurring and significant recurring items the company defines adjusted income loss per share as adjusted net income divided by the basic weighted number of common shares outstanding management believes that the presentation of adjusted net income loss and adjusted income loss per share is appropriate to provide additional information to investors regarding items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future or that management does not believe to be a reflection of the company s ongoing operating performance management further believes that its presentation of these non ifrs financial measures provide information that is useful to investors as they are important indicators of the strength of our operations and the performance of our core business accordingly it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs other companies may calculate this measure differently

although overall sales volumes held up well margins were affected by a 3 drop in average selling prices and higher professional fees mainly related to the closing of ipsco acquisition 10 million net income for shareholders however increased 42 sequentially as we recorded a low income tax charge for the quarter while in the previous quarter the tax charge was adversely affected by the impact of currency devaluations mainly in argentina and mexico during the quarter cash flow from operations amounted to 264 million which included a reduction in inventories of 117 million after capital

despite the integration of saudi steel pipe and a strong level of premium sales for indian offshore gas projects sales in the middle east and africa region were affected by aramco destocking in saudi arabia and did not include the extraordinary level of sales to east mediterranean gas pipelines recorded in 2018 operating income declined 5 in line with the decline in sales although gross margins were affected by lower volumes and high maintenance and start up delays associated with the major overhauls and investments we carried out at many of our industrial facilities including tamsa in mexico these were compensated by lower amortization charges shareholders net income declined 15 for the year reflecting the decline in operating income and lower returns on our investment in ternium cash flow provided by operating activities amounted to 1 528 million during 2019 which included a reduction in working capital of 523 million this amounted to a free cash flow margin of 16 following capital expenditures of 350 million during the year we made 484 million in dividend payments an investment of 133 million in saudi steel pipe and our net cash position increased by 495 million to 980 million at december 31 2019 annual dividend proposal upon approval of the company s annual accounts in march 2020 the board of directors intends to propose for approval of the annual general shareholders meeting to be held on april 30 2020 the payment of dividends in an aggregate amount of approximately 484 million which would include the interim dividend of approximately 153 million paid in november 2019 if the annual dividend is approved by the shareholders a dividend of 0 28 per share 0 56 per ads or approximately 331 million will be paid on may 20 2020 with an ex dividend date on may 18 2020 and record date on may 19 2020 market background and outlook drilling activity in the us shales after declining throughout 2019 as oil and gas companies adjusted to lower cash flows and a less accommodating financial environment is expected to stabilize at current levels provided that oil and gas prices and global demand expectations are not further affected by the coronavirus outbreak offshore drilling activity in the gulf of mexico however is expected to show some recovery during 2020 drilling activity in canada which declined 30 in 2019 is expected to remain close to last year s level in latin america offshore drilling activity which rose in mexico and guyana in 2019 is expected to grow further particularly in brazil while in argentina shale drilling activity which declined sharply towards the end of 2019 is unlikely to recover quickly as continuing uncertainty about the investment climate has led oil and gas companies to postpone new investments in vaca muerta in the eastern hemisphere drilling activity is likely to remain broadly stable with higher activity in some regions like the middle east and the north sea while in other regions like the caspian and in some lng developments activity may be delayed with the current level of oil and gas prices global octg demand which we estimate remained stable in 2019 is expected to decline slightly in 2020 affected primarily by lower demand in the usa and further destocking in the middle east despite lower market demand in usa and argentina and lower prices in the americas we expect to increase sales in 2020 with the expansion of our position in the us market through the integration of ipsco and higher sales of premium products for offshore drilling projects we expect margins in the first quarter to be in line with those of the fourth quarter as they will be affected by the current losses that ipsco is incurring but should recover during the year as we realize synergies from the integration and work on

services decreased 2 sequentially and 18 year on year the sequential decline is mainly attributable to south america and the middle east africa partially offset by higher sales in the other regions in north america sales increased sequentially 1 thanks to seasonally higher sales in canada that compensated a decline in product prices throughout the region in south america sales decreased 14 sequentially due to lower sales in argentina where oil and gas activity has been strongly impacted from last august in europe sales increased 13 sequentially after seasonally higher sales in the north sea in the middle east and africa sales were relatively stable in the region with a slight decrease in india following a high level of shipments in the previous quarter in asia pacific we had higher sales in vietnam and australia operating income from tubular products and services amounted to 138 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 163 million in the previous quarter and 154 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 operating income during the quarter was negatively affected by a 3 decline in average selling prices and higher consultancy and legal fees and selling expenses in sg a

products and services increased 7 sequentially and declined 9 year on year the sequential increase in sales is mainly due to higher sales of coiled tubing while the year on year reduction is mainly due to lower sales of excess energy following the closure of our san nicolás power plant in argentina which occurred in january 2019 selling general and administrative expenses or sg a amounted to 349

sg a increased 5 due to 10 million higher consultancy and legal fees mainly related to the closing of ipsco s acquisition and higher logistic costs due to a different mix of shipping destinations financial results amounted to a loss of 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to a gain of 8 million in the previous quarter and a loss of 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 the loss during the quarter corresponds mainly to a 6 million loss on fx derivatives covering primarily net payables in argentine and mexican peso equity in earnings of non consolidated companies generated a gain of 13 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 13 million in the previous quarter and 51 million in the same period of 2018 these results are mainly derived from our equity investment in ternium nyse tx income tax charge amounted to 10 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 108 million in the previous quarter and a gain of 2 million in the same period of 2018 the charge of

reflecting lower drilling activity in south america sales declined slightly reflecting a reduction in drilling activity in argentina towards the end of the year in europe sales increased due to higher demand for offshore line pipe and octg with lower sales of mechanical pipes and line pipe for hydrocarbon process projects in the middle east africa the acquisition of saudi steel pipe and an increase in sales in the middle east outside of saudi arabia where destocking took place did not compensate for the drop in sales of offshore line pipe following the completion of deliveries for east

debt of 106 8m for net debt of 53 4m at and total debt of for net debt of following a review of the operation the value of prestea is being impaired by 56 8m based on a conservative valuation approach given recent performance and the execution risk in delivering the revised mine plan the residual asset value is balanced by liabilities and working capital resulting in a zero net asset value andrew wray chief executive officer of golden star commented the fourth quarter operational performance was in line with our expectations with wassa continuing to deliver strong mining rates and an increase in underground grades while ongoing improvements in the prestea underground performance were offset by the planned reduction in open pit contribution as a result we delivered on the upper end of the revised production range and the mid point of the aisc guidance for 2019 the effort of our management and mine site teams in 2019 alongside the significant capital investment has started to deliver improved operational performance and enhanced geological understanding at both of our mines in 2020 we plan to continue to invest in our asset base with the completion of the paste plant project at wassa which is expected to provide more flexibility in the mine plan a new mining method and mining area at prestea and acceleration of the development and maintenance spend across both sites these initiatives are expected to deliver improved production rates and margins as we progress through the year they will also help us to further define the long term growth at wassa we remain excited by the potential to continue to increase the mining rates at wassa with the aim of improving the scale and margins at the operation at prestea the investment is aimed at improving the sustainability and flexibility of the operation with the introduction of a second mining level in order to enable it to return to positive cash generation once fully ramped up through 2020 this is expected to also improve the options available for us to realize value from the asset having carried out the operational review redesigned the mine plan and invested in the equipment for long hole open stoping lhos following the update of the life of mine plans at each operation we have undertaken a carrying value review of the assets as a result the decision was made to reduce the carrying value of prestea to reflect anticipated changes to future cash flow resulting from shifts in the unit costs working capital and capex assumptions we have taken a conservative approach given recent performance as well as the inherent execution risk in the new plan resulting in an impairment charge of 56 8m q4 2019 fy 2019 performance summary q4 2019 q4 2018 yoy change fy 2019 fy 2018 yoy change production and cost

team was put in place following the appointment mid year of andrew wray as ceo this is being accompanied by a transition of our corporate head office from toronto to london to be more accessible to our operations in west africa and enhance the executive team s support of the operations through a greater on the ground presence the severance costs relating to the closure of the toronto office and duplication of head office costs had an impact on the corporate costs other expenses in 2019 and this will continue into h1 2020 after which time the cost base is expected to normalize wassa mining rates wassa delivered improved mining rates in 2019 while maintaining low per tonne unit costs mining rates exceeded 4 000tpd tonnes per day through h2 2019 wassa is expected to continue to deliver at this level throughout 2020 prestea optimization the independent review of the underground operation and improvement project which commenced in 2019 positions the mine for a transformational year in 2020 the current alimak mining areas on 24 level are being optimized to improve orebody definition reduce stope cycle time and reduce dilution development has commenced on 17 level for the introduction of lhos in the 17 21 level area these changes are expected to be ongoing through 2020 and are aimed at improving the flexibility in the operation and are planned to result in an improved mining rate in excess of 500tpd on a consistent basis sustainability philipa varris was promoted to the executive committee in q4 2019 to prioritize golden star s sustainability and safety initiatives implementation of our safety and health strategy throughout 2019 saw increased alignment to our values and enhanced achievement of our principle that all incidents are reported which led to an expected increase in our near miss and all injury frequency rates continued optimization of our malaria prevention program in support of sustainable development goal 3 sdg achieved the lowest per capita malaria case rate in the history of the business these successes were recognized in the year by the global compact network canada in their sdgs emerging practice guide case studies to

guidance totals 55 60m while the 2020 budget shows a lower level of investment than seen in 2019 the capex budget remains at elevated levels to fund the introduction of a new mining level and method at prestea the wassa paste plant construction and accelerated maintenance and development at both mines 2020 exploration the 2020 exploration budget is lower than in 2019 as the surface drilling of the deeper zones of the southern extensions to the wassa orebody is now complete although the orebody remains open to the south the future drilling is now expected to be carried out from underground drill positions in order to lower the cost of the infill drilling programs and to allow tighter infill drill spacing to be achieved more efficiently in 2020 the greenfield and brownfield exploration programs will focus on near mine targets in and around wassa and prestea as well as on regional exploration targets within 60km of the wassa operation a total of 6 2m 3 5 m capitalized and 2 7m expensed has been allocated for exploration activities during 2020 wassa operating expectations the mid point of the 155 165koz production guidance for the year is 2 ahead of the 2019 performance in 2020 the mining rate is expected to continue at the higher rates in excess of 4 000tpd as achieved in h2 2019 the paste plant project is due to be completed in late q3 2020 enabling the operation to better sequence and mine primary and secondary stopes as well as recovering pillars and secondary stopes in some previously mined areas this is expected to make a small contribution in 2020 with a greater impact expected in 2021 as the paste fill system becomes fully operational this timeline may be subject to change as we have been notified by the project engineering consultant that there is potential for a delay to the delivery of materials and components being sourced from china the situation is being closely monitored and we will provide further updates as soon as we are informed of any change prestea operating expectations the 40 45koz production guidance for 2020 is broadly in line with 2019 performance with significant changes at the operation underway production from the underground is expected to improve in 2020 with reduced open pit contribution at prestea underground the investment in a new mining area and the introduction of lhos is expected to improve overall

from the 149 7koz produced in 2018 this increase in production was due to the increase in tonnes mined and processed at the wassa underground mine compared to 2018 in february 2018 wassa became an underground only mining operation however open pit stockpiled ore continued to be processed for much of 2018 and to a lesser extent in 2019 grades the underground mining delivered grades of 3 78g t in q4 2019 33 higher than achieved in q3 2019 and in line with the 3 80g t achieved in q4 2018 the improvement in grades in the quarter is attributable to mining progressing in the 595 and 620 levels

higher than in 2018 capital expenditures capital expenditures for q4 2019 totaled 21 7m compared with 13 9m incurred during the same period in 2018 the increase in capital expenditures was due primarily to a 5 4m investment in the paste fill plant a 4 2m increase in spend on mobile equipment a 2 3m increase in electrical upgrades and a 1 1m investment in the pumping station project offset by a 4 1m decrease in exploration drilling compared to the same period in 2018 projects update infrastructure investment in order to equip the mine for its future as a long life low cost operation a number of projects were implemented in 2019 in order to upgrade some of the infrastructure these projects included the following initiatives ventilation upgrade the upgrade to the ventilation infrastructure was completed in q4 2019 the completion of this project supports the current production areas and provides the ventilation capacity for the next few years of mining activities with further investment expected in 2021 to extend the ventilation system the upgrade to the ventilation infrastructure was completed in q4 2019 the completion of this project supports the current production areas and provides the ventilation capacity for the next few years of mining activities with further investment expected in 2021 to extend the ventilation system electrical upgrade this is a more significant infrastructure project which is intended to support the mine plan for the next five years the civils work for the installation of the electrical substation is currently ongoing and is expected to be completed in conjunction with the completion of the paste fill project work to upgrade the underground electrical infrastructure is progressing alongside the substation project this

and is expected to be completed in conjunction with the completion of the paste fill project work to upgrade the underground electrical infrastructure is progressing alongside the substation project upgraded pumping capacity in order to prepare the mine for the future transition to operations at greater depth and in order to improve the reliability of the pumping systems the cascading pump system is being replaced by a modernized pumping station on 620 level the pumping station is nearing completion with the primary pump already installed and the secondary back up pump now being installed the consolidation of the multi pump system into a larger higher capacity system should simplify the maintenance program for the mine s pumping infrastructure and reduce operational risk in order to

plant project at wassa continued to progress in q4 2019 the project is currently at 55 completion with long lead items ordered and early works contracts now awarded construction of the project is expected to be completed in q3 2020 with commissioning in q4 2020 this timeline may be subject to change as we have been notified by the project engineering consultant that there is potential for a delay to the delivery of materials and components being sourced from china the situation is being closely monitored and we will provide further updates as soon as we are informed of any change the paste fill process is expected to add approximately 6 t to the mining unit costs but results in a higher recovery of the resource with less ore left in remnant pillars which is expected to support

q4 2019 in line with the same period in 2018 but 24 lower than in q3 2019 due to a lower contribution from the open pits as mining at the opon area was impacted by heavy rains due to the constrained nature of the open pit as it is nearing the end of its design life some relatively small scale oxide resources close to the bogoso processing plant have been evaluated for open pit mining and we expect it to form a lower proportion of the plan in h1 2020 the decrease in fy 2019 production relative to 2018 was due to a 38 decrease in the open pit production and a 35 decrease in underground production the lower open pit production results from a planned decrease in the volume of open pit ore processed offset in part by a 30 increase in open pit grades the reduced underground production resulted from a 45 decrease in head grades caused by a combination of higher dilution and ore loss this effect was partially offset by a 24 increase in underground ore tonnes processed grades in q4 the work to address dilution in the underground mine delivered improvements particularly in stope s12 which was the first stope with a reduced raise height this helped to better control mining execution and manage dilution the initiative to separate ore from waste to further reduce dilution of the mill feed is also starting to yield benefits with 9kt of waste material successfully removed from processing in the quarter stope availability underground production was slightly higher in q4 2019 than the prior quarter albeit lower than anticipated due to ore locked up in stope s13 as a result of oversize material blocking the stope as mining activity progresses through the adjacent stope s14 during q1 2020 we expect some of this ore to be released open pit mine life exceeding expectations the open pits produced 4 8koz in q4 2019 in line with the 4 6koz in the same period in 2018 the prestea open pits were expected to complete gold production earlier in 2019 however open pit mining continued into q4 2019 with additional ore being sourced from the pits close to bogoso costs cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization was 20 4m for q4 2019 compared to 32 1m for the same period in 2018 the decrease was due primarily to 9 9m of severance payments from the prestea improvement plan in q4 2018 not being repeated in 2019 a 2 4m decrease in mine operating expenses related to less ore processed from prestea open pits and a 0 4m decrease inventory net realizable value adjustment and write off offset by a 0 1m increase in operating costs from metals inventory for q4 2019 compared to for the same period in 2018 the decrease was due primarily to of severance payments from the prestea improvement plan in q4 2018 not being repeated in 2019 a decrease in mine operating expenses related to less ore processed from prestea open pits and a decrease inventory net realizable value adjustment and write off offset by a increase in operating costs from metals inventory cash operating cost per ounce of 1 616 decreased 13 from 1 867 for the same period in 2018 and increased by 30 from 1 249 in the previous quarter due to lower production decreased 13 from for the same period in 2018 and increased by 30 from in the previous quarter due to lower production aisc per ounce increased 2 to 2 202 from 2 164 for the same period in 2018 in q4 2019 the aisc rose 35 from the 1 630 oz aisc achieved in q3 2019 again primarily due to the lower ounces produced and a largely fixed cost base with production volumes anticipated to rise through 2020 the unit costs are expected to reduce to an aisc guidance range of 1 650 1 850 oz prestea operational review following the completion of csa s independent review and phase 2 design the implementation of a revised mining plan is progressing at the prestea underground mine with several of the independent review recommendations underway within project okode extraction of the 17l 21l has been redesigned for lhos and development has commenced with the new design using conventional equipment orders have been placed to mechanize the lhos zones including a development jumbo long hole drill an additional loader scoop and a small truck to haul material back to 17l the jumbo is expected to be delivered during h1 2020 and is expected to significantly improve development productivity an operational readiness plan for the implementation of the lhos mining method is currently underway in the alimak stoping area from 21l 24l stopes have been redesigned to reduce the overall hanging wall span as recommended by csa this is achieved by reducing the height where possible to improve travel times and stope turnover rates where the height cannot be reduced due to lack of access the strike length of the stopes has been reduced to improve stability a slightly narrower alimak platform is being trialled to reduce overall dilution levels ventilation connections have been completed on 24l enabling the development focus to move to the set up of stopes to the north and south of the current block several other initiatives recommended by csa and prioritized by the site team are being managed under project okode supported by a project manager and operations specialist as well as project teams on site some of these initiatives include the increase in drilling for resource definition overbreak controls maintenance improvements and various productivity improvements such as rail upgrades shaft schedule improvements and an upgraded rock breaker exploration in 2019 the company invested 20 5m in exploration of which 3 2m was expensed and 17 3m was capitalized the 2019 exploration spend therefore exceeded the 15 8m budget for the year the increased investment in exploration was made during h2 2019 with additional budget allocated for infill and step out drill holes into the southern extensions of the wassa orebody and on 8 000 metres of infill definition drilling budget into panel 4 the 12 additional holes drilled in southern extension zone increased the geological and structural understanding of the zone which allows for more detailed planning of the mining of this area finally additional budget was also allocated to drilling 5 000 metres in the deeper areas of the father brown resource area in 2020 the greenfield and brownfield exploration programs will focus on near mine targets in and around wassa and prestea as well as on regional exploration targets a total of 6 2m 3 5m budget for capitalized exploration and 2 7m for expensed exploration has been allocated for exploration programs across the project portfolio wassa in 2019 the wassa exploration drilling infill and step out extension drilling from surface was completed with a total of 45 047 metres drilled with assay results released in q4 for more information please see the company s news release issued on november 13 2019 an update of the resource model has commenced the results of which we expect to announce in q1 2020 in q4 2019 the exploration team also completed a detailed review of the exploration portfolio in ghana generating a pipeline of early stage target delineation and drill testing targets with the 2019 surface program at wassa now complete the company has commenced a complete review of the geological interpretation involving external structural geology and geochemistry specialists updated geological interpretations and resource estimations for the year end 2019 is expected to be reported during q1 2020 however we expect further refinements to the interpretations and subsequent resource estimation updates in h2 2020 based on additional detailed analysis of the geological model the drilling to date at wassa has been targeted at the conversion of inferred resources to indicated as well as the definition and expansion of current inferred resources results have been successful in converting portions of the inferred resources to indicated as well as better defining mineralization on the southern extension of the orebody and within the hanging wall and footwall zones of the main b shoot mineralization deeper infill drilling into the wide zones of mineralization intersected in the southern extension drilling in late 2018 and early 2019 has shown that the previously interpreted single high grade mineralized zone can now be interpreted as several sub parallel mineralized zones and this new understanding will be incorporated into the resource update expected to be released in q1 2020 although the previously interpreted single broad zone of mineralization is now interpreted as several narrower 20 70 metre wide zones of mineralization we do not expect to see a significant variation in the overall resource volume at wassa drilling in 2020 is planned to be focused on testing the footwall to the main mining area b shoot investigating for underground plunge extensions of gold mineralization between the mined out wassa south east pit and the recently identified footwall zones in the southern extension drilling this programme is expected to commence in q1 2020 and consists of an initial 4 6 holes for 3 000 metres of diamond core on 200 metre spaced sections drilled from underground platforms if successful this drilling program may identify a new underground mining area at wassa outside the current decline system potentially adding incremental tonnes to the currently under utilized processing plant father brown as stated in the q3 2019 results the review of the asset showed that the project as it currently stands does not deliver sufficient returns to move into a feasibility study as a result the 2020 exploration budget will not see any significant investment in father brown resource estimation and evaluation work is being progressed in conjunction with desktop mine design work this work will be used to assess whether future drill programs are justified prestea underground in 2019 drilling at prestea focused on improving the understanding of the orebody and waste zones that had been impacting the productivity of the alimak mining process earlier in 2019 during 2019 63 holes were drilled totaling 12 424 metres most of this drilling was infill drilling to the north and south of the existing stopes on 24 level the updated resources and reserves will be disclosed in the year end mineral resource and reserve statements due

given recent performance and the execution risk in delivering the revised mine plan the residual asset value is balanced by liabilities and working capital resulting in a zero net asset value andrew wray chief executive officer of golden star commented the fourth quarter operational performance was in line with our expectations with wassa continuing to deliver strong mining rates and an increase in underground grades while ongoing improvements in the prestea underground performance were offset by the planned reduction in open pit contribution as a result we delivered on the upper end of the revised production range and the mid point of the aisc guidance for 2019 the effort of our management and mine site teams in 2019 alongside the significant capital investment has started to deliver improved operational performance and enhanced geological understanding at both of our mines in 2020 we plan to continue to invest in our asset base with the completion of the paste plant project at wassa which is expected to provide more flexibility in the mine plan a new mining method and mining area at prestea and acceleration of the development and maintenance spend across both sites these initiatives are expected to deliver improved production rates and margins as we progress through the year they will also help us to further define the long term growth at wassa we remain excited by the potential to continue to increase the mining rates at wassa with the aim of improving the scale and margins at the operation at prestea the investment is aimed at improving the sustainability and flexibility of the operation with the introduction of a second mining level in order to enable it to return to positive cash generation once fully ramped up through 2020 this is expected to also

team was put in place following the appointment mid year of andrew wray as ceo this is being accompanied by a transition of our corporate head office from toronto to london to be more accessible to our operations in west africa and enhance the executive team s support of the operations through a greater on the ground presence the severance costs relating to the closure of the toronto office and duplication of head office costs had an impact on the corporate costs other expenses in 2019 and this will continue into h1 2020 after which time the cost base is expected to normalize wassa mining rates wassa delivered improved mining rates in 2019 while maintaining low per tonne unit costs mining rates exceeded 4 000tpd tonnes per day through h2 2019 wassa is expected to continue to deliver at this level throughout 2020 prestea optimization the independent review of the underground operation and improvement project which commenced in 2019 positions the mine for a transformational year in 2020 the current alimak mining areas on 24 level are being optimized to improve orebody definition reduce stope cycle time and reduce dilution development has commenced on 17 level for the introduction of lhos in the 17 21 level area these changes are expected to be ongoing through 2020 and are aimed at improving the flexibility in the operation and are planned to result in an improved mining rate in excess of 500tpd on a consistent basis sustainability philipa varris was promoted to the executive committee in q4 2019 to prioritize golden star s sustainability and safety initiatives implementation of our safety and health strategy throughout 2019 saw increased alignment to our values and enhanced achievement of our principle that all incidents are reported which led to an expected increase in our near miss and all injury frequency rates continued optimization of our malaria prevention program in support of sustainable development goal 3 sdg achieved the lowest per capita malaria case rate in the history of the business these successes were recognized in the year by the global compact network canada in their sdgs emerging practice guide case studies to strengthen our relationship with our host communities the wassa mine signed a milestone memorandum of understanding with its local communities financing on october 17 2019 the company closed the 60

aisc performance within the respective guidance ranges the company achieved a consolidated cost performance broadly in line with the midpoint of the cash operating cost and aisc guidance ranges in 2019 the capital spend exceeded guidance by 19 this is attributable to the acceleration of underground development and exploration spend during h2 2019 the decision was made to allocate an additional

the 2020 guidance is a range of operational initiatives aimed at improving the consistency of the operations and visibility of the longer term potential of the operations 2020 capex the fy 2020 capex guidance totals 55 60m while the 2020 budget shows a lower level of investment than seen in 2019 the capex budget remains at elevated levels to fund the introduction of a new mining level and method at prestea the wassa paste plant construction and accelerated maintenance and development at both mines 2020 exploration the 2020 exploration budget is lower than in 2019 as the surface drilling of the deeper zones of the southern extensions to the wassa orebody is now complete although the orebody remains open to the south the future drilling is now expected to be carried out from underground drill positions in order to lower the cost of the infill drilling programs and to allow tighter infill drill spacing to be achieved more efficiently in 2020 the greenfield and brownfield exploration programs will focus on near mine targets in and around wassa and prestea as well as on regional exploration targets within 60km of the wassa operation a total of 6 2m 3 5 m capitalized and 2 7m expensed has been allocated for exploration activities during 2020 wassa operating expectations the mid point of the 155 165koz production guidance for the year is 2 ahead of the 2019 performance in 2020 the mining rate is expected to continue at the higher rates in excess of 4 000tpd as achieved in h2 2019 the paste plant project is due to be completed in late q3 2020 enabling the operation to better sequence and mine primary and secondary stopes as well as recovering pillars and secondary stopes in some previously mined areas this is expected to make a small contribution in 2020 with a greater impact expected in 2021 as the paste fill system becomes fully operational this timeline may be subject to change as we have been notified by the project engineering consultant that there is potential for a delay to the delivery of materials and components being sourced from china the situation is being closely monitored and we will provide further updates as soon as we are informed of any change prestea operating expectations the 40 45koz production guidance for 2020 is broadly in line with 2019 performance with significant changes at the operation underway production from the underground is expected to improve in 2020 with reduced open pit contribution at prestea underground the investment in a new mining area and the introduction of lhos is expected to improve overall mining rates and reduce the operational risk with improved flexibility in the schedule the improvements being implemented are expected to reduce the aisc by around 200 oz as per the 2020 guidance when

the same period in 2018 and a 17 increase on q3 2019 production this increase in production was primarily due to an increase in underground tonnes mined compared to the same period in 2018 mining rates at the wassa underground increased to approximately 4 090tpd on average in q4 2019 compared to approximately 3 360tpd in the same period in 2018 fy 2019 gold production was 156 2koz a 4 increase from the 149 7koz produced in 2018 this increase in production was due to the increase in tonnes mined and processed at the wassa underground mine compared to 2018 in february 2018 wassa became an underground only mining operation however open pit stockpiled ore continued to be processed for much of 2018 and to a lesser extent in 2019 grades the underground mining delivered grades of 3 78g t in q4 2019 33 higher than achieved in q3 2019 and in line with the 3 80g t achieved in q4 2018 the improvement in grades in the quarter is attributable to mining progressing in the 595 and 620 levels

q4 2019 in line with the same period in 2018 but 24 lower than in q3 2019 due to a lower contribution from the open pits as mining at the opon area was impacted by heavy rains due to the constrained nature of the open pit as it is nearing the end of its design life some relatively small scale oxide resources close to the bogoso processing plant have been evaluated for open pit mining and we expect it to form a lower proportion of the plan in h1 2020 the decrease in fy 2019 production relative to 2018 was due to a 38 decrease in the open pit production and a 35 decrease in underground production the lower open pit production results from a planned decrease in the volume of open pit ore processed offset in part by a 30 increase in open pit grades the reduced underground production resulted from a 45 decrease in head grades caused by a combination of higher dilution and ore loss this effect was partially offset by a 24 increase in underground ore tonnes processed grades in q4 the work to address dilution in the underground mine delivered improvements particularly in stope s12 which was the first stope with a reduced raise height this helped to better control mining execution and manage dilution the initiative to separate ore from waste to further reduce dilution of the mill feed is also starting to yield benefits with 9kt of waste material successfully removed from processing in the quarter stope availability underground production was slightly higher in q4 2019 than the prior quarter albeit lower than anticipated due to ore locked up in stope s13 as a result of oversize material blocking the stope as mining activity progresses through the adjacent stope s14 during q1 2020 we expect some of this ore to be released open pit mine life exceeding expectations the open pits produced 4 8koz in q4 2019 in line with the 4 6koz in the same period in 2018 the prestea open pits were expected to complete gold production earlier in 2019 however open pit mining continued into q4 2019 with additional ore being sourced from the pits close to bogoso costs cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization was 20 4m for q4 2019 compared to 32 1m for the same period in 2018 the decrease was due primarily to 9 9m of severance payments from the prestea improvement plan in q4 2018 not being repeated in 2019 a 2 4m decrease in mine operating expenses related to less ore processed from prestea open pits and a 0 4m decrease inventory net realizable value adjustment and write off offset by a 0 1m increase in operating costs from metals inventory for q4 2019 compared to for the same period in 2018 the decrease was due primarily to of severance payments from the prestea improvement plan in q4 2018 not being repeated in 2019 a decrease in mine operating expenses related to less ore processed from prestea open pits and a decrease inventory net realizable value adjustment and write off offset by a increase in operating costs from metals inventory cash operating cost per ounce of 1 616 decreased 13 from 1 867 for the same period in 2018 and increased by 30 from 1 249 in the previous quarter due to lower production decreased 13 from for the same period in 2018 and increased by 30 from in the previous quarter due to lower production aisc per ounce increased 2 to 2 202 from 2 164 for the same period in 2018 in q4 2019 the aisc rose 35 from the 1 630 oz aisc achieved in q3 2019 again primarily due to the lower ounces produced and a largely fixed cost base with production volumes anticipated to rise through 2020 the unit costs are expected to reduce to an aisc guidance range of 1 650 1 850 oz prestea operational review following the completion of csa s independent review and phase 2 design the implementation of a revised mining plan is progressing at the prestea underground mine with several of the independent review recommendations underway within project okode extraction of the 17l 21l has been redesigned for lhos and development has commenced with the new design using conventional equipment orders have been placed to mechanize the lhos zones including a development jumbo long hole drill an additional loader scoop and a small truck to haul material back to 17l the jumbo is expected to be delivered during h1 2020 and is expected to significantly improve development productivity an operational readiness plan for the implementation of the lhos mining method is currently underway in the alimak stoping area from 21l 24l stopes have been redesigned to reduce the overall hanging wall span as recommended by csa this is achieved by reducing the height where possible to improve travel times and stope turnover rates where the height cannot be reduced due to lack of access the strike length of the stopes has been reduced to improve stability a slightly narrower alimak platform is being trialled to reduce overall dilution levels ventilation connections have been completed on 24l enabling the development focus to move to the set up of stopes to the north and south of the current block several other initiatives recommended by csa and prioritized by the site team are being managed under project okode supported by a project manager and operations specialist as well as project teams on site some of these initiatives include the increase in drilling for resource definition overbreak controls maintenance improvements and various productivity improvements such as rail upgrades shaft schedule improvements and an upgraded rock breaker exploration in 2019 the company invested 20 5m in exploration of which 3 2m was expensed and 17 3m was capitalized the 2019 exploration spend therefore exceeded the 15 8m budget for the year the increased investment in exploration was made during h2 2019 with additional budget allocated for infill and step out drill holes into the southern extensions of the wassa orebody and on 8 000 metres of infill definition drilling budget into panel 4 the 12 additional holes drilled in southern extension zone increased the geological and structural understanding of the zone which allows for more detailed planning of the mining of this area finally additional budget was also allocated to drilling 5 000 metres in the deeper areas of the father brown resource area in 2020 the greenfield and brownfield exploration programs will focus on near mine targets in and around wassa and prestea as well as on regional exploration targets a total of 6 2m 3 5m budget for capitalized exploration and 2 7m for expensed exploration has been allocated for exploration programs across the project portfolio wassa in 2019 the wassa exploration drilling infill and step out extension drilling from surface was completed with a total of 45 047 metres drilled with assay results released in q4 for more information please see the company s news release issued on november 13 2019 an update of the resource model has commenced the results of which we expect to announce in q1 2020 in q4 2019 the exploration team also completed a detailed review of the exploration portfolio in ghana generating a pipeline of early stage target delineation and drill testing targets with the 2019 surface program at wassa now complete the company has commenced a complete review of the geological interpretation involving external structural geology and geochemistry specialists updated geological interpretations and resource estimations for the year end 2019 is expected to be reported during q1 2020 however we expect further refinements to the interpretations and subsequent resource estimation updates in h2 2020 based on additional detailed analysis of the geological model the drilling to date at wassa has been targeted at the conversion of inferred resources to indicated as well as the definition and expansion of current inferred resources results have been successful in converting portions of the inferred resources to indicated as well as better defining mineralization on the southern extension of the orebody and within the hanging wall and footwall zones of the main b shoot mineralization deeper infill drilling into the wide zones of mineralization intersected in the southern extension drilling in late 2018 and early 2019 has shown that the previously interpreted single high grade mineralized zone can now be interpreted as several sub parallel mineralized zones and this new understanding will be incorporated into the resource update expected to be released in q1 2020 although the previously interpreted single broad zone of mineralization is now interpreted as several narrower 20 70 metre wide zones of mineralization we do not expect to see a significant variation in the overall resource volume at wassa drilling in 2020 is planned to be focused on testing the footwall to the main mining area b shoot investigating for underground plunge extensions of gold mineralization between the mined out wassa south east pit and the recently identified footwall zones in the southern extension drilling this programme is expected to commence in q1 2020 and consists of an initial 4 6 holes for 3 000 metres of diamond core on 200 metre spaced sections drilled from underground platforms if successful this drilling program may identify a new underground mining area at wassa outside the current decline system potentially adding incremental tonnes to the currently under utilized processing plant father brown as stated in the q3 2019 results the review of the asset showed that the project as it currently stands does not deliver sufficient returns to move into a feasibility study as a result the 2020 exploration budget will not see any significant investment in father brown resource estimation and evaluation work is being progressed in conjunction with desktop mine design work this work will be used to assess whether future drill programs are justified prestea underground in 2019 drilling at prestea focused on improving the understanding of the orebody and waste zones that had been impacting the productivity of the alimak mining process earlier in 2019 during 2019 63 holes were drilled totaling 12 424 metres most of this drilling was infill drilling to the north and south of the existing stopes on 24 level the updated resources and reserves will be disclosed in the year end mineral resource and reserve statements due

the year ended december 31 2018 and in our annual information form for the year ended december 31 2018 as filed on sedar at www sedar com the forecasts contained in this press release constitute management s current estimates as of the date of this press release with respect to the matters covered thereby we expect that these estimates will change as new information is received while we may elect to update these estimates at any time we do not undertake any estimate at any particular time or in response to any particular event non gaap financial measures in this press release we use the terms cash operating cost cash operating cost per ounce all in sustaining costs all in sustaining costs per ounce adjusted net loss income attributable to golden star shareholders adjusted loss income per share attributable to golden star shareholders cash provided by operations before working capital changes and cash provided by operations before working capital changes per share basic cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization as found in the statements of operations includes all mine site operating costs including the costs of mining ore processing maintenance work in process inventory changes mine site overhead as well as production taxes royalties severance charges and by product credits but excludes exploration costs property holding costs corporate office general and administrative expenses foreign currency gains and losses gains and losses on asset sales interest expense gains and losses on derivatives gains and losses on investments and income tax expense benefit cost of sales per ounce is equal to cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization for the period plus depreciation and amortization for the period divided by the number of ounces of gold sold excluding pre commercial production ounces sold during the period cash operating cost for a period is equal to cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization for the period less royalties the cash component of metals inventory net realizable value adjustments materials and supplies write off and severance charges and cash operating cost per ounce is that amount divided by the number of ounces of gold sold excluding pre commercial production ounces sold during the period we use cash operating cost per ounce as a key operating metric we monitor this measure monthly comparing each month s values to prior periods values to detect trends that may indicate increases or decreases in operating efficiencies we provide this measure to investors to allow them to also monitor operational efficiencies of the company s mines we calculate this measure for both individual operating units and on a consolidated basis since cash operating costs do not incorporate revenues changes in working capital or non operating cash costs they are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under ifrs changes in numerous factors including but not limited to mining rates milling rates ore grade gold recovery costs of labor consumables and mine site general and administrative activities can cause these measures to increase or decrease we believe that these measures are similar to the measures of other gold mining companies but may not be comparable to similarly titled measures in every instance all in sustaining costs commences with cash operating costs and then adds the cash component of metals inventory net realizable value adjustments royalties sustaining capital expenditures corporate general and administrative costs excluding share based compensation expenses and severance charges and accretion of rehabilitation provision for mine site all in sustaining costs corporate general and administrative costs excluding share based compensation expenses and severance charges are allocated based on gold sold by each operation all in sustaining costs per ounce is that amount divided by the number of ounces of gold sold excluding pre commercial production ounces sold during the period this measure seeks to represent the total costs of producing gold from current operations and therefore it does not include capital expenditures attributable to projects or mine expansions exploration and evaluation costs attributable to growth projects income tax payments interest costs or dividend payments consequently this measure is not representative of all of the company s cash expenditures in addition the calculation of all in sustaining costs does not include depreciation expense as it does not reflect the impact of expenditures incurred in prior periods therefore it is not indicative of the company s overall profitability share based compensation expenses are also excluded from the calculation of all in sustaining costs as the company believes that such expenses may not be representative of the actual payout on equity and liability based awards the company believes that all in sustaining costs will better meet the needs of analysts investors and other stakeholders of the company in understanding the costs associated with producing gold understanding the economics of gold mining assessing the operating performance and the company s ability to generate free cash flow from current operations and to generate free cash flow on an overall company basis due to the capital intensive nature of the industry and the long useful lives over which these items are depreciated there can be a disconnect between net earnings calculated in accordance with ifrs and the amount of free cash flow that is being generated by a mine in the current market environment for gold mining equities many investors and analysts are more focused on the ability of gold mining companies to generate free cash flow from current operations and consequently the company believes these measures are useful non ifrs operating metrics non gaap measures and supplement the ifrs disclosures made by the company these measures are not representative of all of golden star s cash expenditures as they do not include income tax payments or interest costs non gaap measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have standardized definitions under ifrs and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs these measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under ifrs adjusted net loss income attributable to golden star shareholders is calculated by adjusting net loss income attributable to golden star shareholders for gain loss on fair value of financial instruments share based compensation expenses severance charges loss gain on change in asset retirement obligations deferred income tax expense non cash cumulative adjustment to revenue and finance costs related to the streaming agreement and impairment the company has excluded the non cash cumulative adjustment to revenue from adjusted net income loss as the amount is non recurring the amount is non cash in nature and management does not include the amount when reviewing and assessing the performance of the operations adjusted loss income per share attributable to golden star shareholders for the period is adjusted net loss income attributable to golden star shareholders divided by the

although overall sales volumes held up well margins were affected by a 3 drop in average selling prices and higher professional fees mainly related to the closing of ipsco acquisition 10 million net income for shareholders however increased 42 sequentially as we recorded a low income tax charge for the quarter while in the previous quarter the tax charge was adversely affected by the impact of

despite the integration of saudi steel pipe and a strong level of premium sales for indian offshore gas projects sales in the middle east and africa region were affected by aramco destocking in saudi arabia and did not include the extraordinary level of sales to east mediterranean gas pipelines recorded in 2018 operating income declined 5 in line with the decline in sales although gross margins were affected by lower volumes and high maintenance and start up delays associated with the major overhauls and investments we carried out at many of our industrial facilities including tamsa in mexico these were compensated by lower amortization charges shareholders net income declined 15 for the year reflecting the decline in operating income and lower returns on our investment in ternium cash flow provided by operating activities amounted to 1 528 million during 2019 which included a reduction in working capital of 523 million this amounted to a free cash flow margin of 16 following capital expenditures of 350 million during the year we made 484 million in dividend payments an investment of 133 million in saudi steel pipe and our net cash position increased by 495 million to 980 million at december 31 2019 annual dividend proposal upon approval of the company s annual accounts in march 2020 the board of directors intends to propose for approval of the annual general shareholders meeting to be held on april 30 2020 the payment of dividends in an aggregate amount of approximately 484 million which would include the interim dividend of approximately 153 million paid in november 2019 if the annual dividend is approved by the shareholders a dividend of 0 28 per share 0 56 per ads or approximately 331 million will be paid on may 20 2020 with an ex dividend date on may 18 2020 and record date on may 19 2020 market background and outlook drilling activity in the us shales after declining throughout 2019 as oil and gas companies adjusted to lower cash flows and a less accommodating financial environment is expected to stabilize at current levels provided that oil and gas prices and global demand expectations are not further affected by the coronavirus outbreak offshore drilling activity in the gulf of mexico however is expected to show some recovery during 2020 drilling activity in canada which declined 30 in 2019 is expected to remain close to last year s level in latin america offshore drilling activity which rose in mexico and guyana in 2019 is expected to grow further particularly in brazil while in argentina shale drilling activity which declined sharply towards the end of 2019 is unlikely to recover quickly as continuing uncertainty about the investment climate has led oil and gas companies to postpone new investments in vaca muerta in the eastern hemisphere drilling activity is likely to remain broadly stable with higher activity in some regions like the middle east and the north sea while in other regions like the caspian and in some lng developments activity may be delayed with the current level of oil and gas prices global octg demand which we estimate remained stable in 2019 is expected to decline slightly in 2020 affected primarily by lower demand in the usa and further destocking in the middle east despite lower market demand in usa and argentina and lower prices in the americas we expect to increase sales in 2020 with the expansion of our position in the us market through the integration of ipsco and higher sales of premium products for offshore drilling projects we expect margins in the first quarter to be in line with those of the fourth quarter as they will be affected by the current losses that ipsco is incurring but should recover during the year as we realize synergies from the integration and work on

services decreased 2 sequentially and 18 year on year the sequential decline is mainly attributable to south america and the middle east africa partially offset by higher sales in the other regions in north america sales increased sequentially 1 thanks to seasonally higher sales in canada that compensated a decline in product prices throughout the region in south america sales decreased 14 sequentially due to lower sales in argentina where oil and gas activity has been strongly impacted from last august in europe sales increased 13 sequentially after seasonally higher sales in the north sea in the middle east and africa sales were relatively stable in the region with a slight decrease in india following a high level of shipments in the previous quarter in asia pacific we had higher sales in vietnam and australia operating income from tubular products and services amounted to 138 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 163 million in the previous quarter and 154 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 operating income during the quarter was negatively affected by a 3 decline in average selling prices and higher consultancy and legal fees and selling expenses in sg a

products and services increased 7 sequentially and declined 9 year on year the sequential increase in sales is mainly due to higher sales of coiled tubing while the year on year reduction is mainly due to lower sales of excess energy following the closure of our san nicolás power plant in argentina which occurred in january 2019 selling general and administrative expenses or sg a amounted to 349

sg a increased 5 due to 10 million higher consultancy and legal fees mainly related to the closing of ipsco s acquisition and higher logistic costs due to a different mix of shipping destinations financial results amounted to a loss of 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to a gain of 8 million in the previous quarter and a loss of 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 the loss during the quarter corresponds mainly to a 6 million loss on fx derivatives covering primarily net payables in argentine and mexican peso equity in earnings of non consolidated companies generated a

reflecting lower drilling activity in south america sales declined slightly reflecting a reduction in drilling activity in argentina towards the end of the year in europe sales increased due to higher demand for offshore line pipe and octg with lower sales of mechanical pipes and line pipe for hydrocarbon process projects in the middle east africa the acquisition of saudi steel pipe and an increase in sales in the middle east outside of saudi arabia where destocking took place did not compensate for the drop in sales of offshore line pipe following the completion of deliveries for east

we are facing a multidimensional crisis of the global capitalist system economic crisis stagnation or recession in europe recession in japan slowdown in the us economy slowdown in india and in china deep crisis in the car industry at a global level huge increase of private debts in particular for the big corporations including big international banks and corporations like apple public debt has also raised a lot creation of bubbles stock exchange bubble corporate bonds corporate bonds securities issued by corporations in order to raise funds on the money markets these bonds resemble government bonds but are considered to be more risky than government bonds and other guaranteed securities such as mortgage backed securities and therefore pay higher interest rates bubble in consequence of the policies implemented by the central banks of the most industrialized countries ecological crisis the dramatic character of the consequences of climate change are very clear and the decrease of the economic growth is not producing a reduction of the toxic emission of gases in the atmosphere trade crisis there is a commercial war between china and the us but also at a lower level between europe and the us crisis of several international institutions which are part the system of capitalist domination of the planet political crisis in important countries crisis in the us between the two capitalist parties the republicans and the democrats impeachment crisis within the european union crisis between different factions of the big capital in the uk around the question of the brexit political crisis in algeria and sudan and in india and sri lanka first conclusion the capitalist system is really in crisis in the mind of a large number of people in a lot of countries the rejection of the capitalist system is higher than it has ever been over the last 4 decades from the beginning of the neoliberal offensive under pinochet thatcher and reagan the offensive of the big capital against working people is still going on but in different regions of the planet this offensive is challenged by massive mobilizations of the population peoples are protesting against the increase of inequalities in a lot of countries people are also protesting against the authoritarian and repressive tendencies of capitalist governments usually there is a spark that provokes mobilization a price increase e g for public transport as in chile or the imposition of an unpopular tax such as the whatssapp tax in lebanon or a combination of both such as a fuel price increase announced in france in november 2018 in ecuador in september 2019 in iran at the end of 2019 or an authoritarian measure the list of countries where there have been massive mobilizations in 2018 2019 is impressive sudan algeria for one year lebanon since october iraq since november iran in the last months nicaragua between april and july 2018 chile from october 2019 ecuador in september october 2019 colombia in november 2019 haiti in 2018 and in 2019 puerto rico in july 2019 france bulgaria romania russia against pension counter reforms in 2018 and for democratic elections and against repression in 2019 india pakistan student mobilizations from november 2019 hong kong we have to add the big mobilizations of the youth against the ecological crisis in the most industrialized countries european countries canada australia but also some latin american countries also the big mobilizations of women s movements and feminist movements in different countries like the usa in 2017 in argentina since 2017 2018 in spain in 2018 2019 with a massive feminist strike of 6 million women in poland against the penalization of abortion and other european countries leftist ideas received an important echo in the population of several highly industrialized countries see the support to the corbyn labour program in 2017 and to the campaign of bernie sanders in the usa in 2016 and now in 2020 second conclusion peoples want radical solutions against the profound multidimensional crisis of the capitalist system radical right wing extremism can gain the political battle with the left if the radical left is incapable of proposing radical leftist solutions the radical left should be clearly anticapitalist antiracist internationalist feminist and ecologist socialist there is a crisis of the radical left program and the militants and activists should be part of rebuilding a program towards democratic ecologist feminist socialism third conclusion the question of opposing the debt system is vital we must oppose the debts whenever they are illegitimate more and more people are suffering around the planet because of the increase of public illegitimate debts and because of the increase of the private debt provoked by microcredit agencies resulting from abusive mortgage mortgage a loan made against property collateral there are two sorts of mortgages 1 the most common form where the property that the loan is used to purchase is used as the collateral 2 a broader use of property to guarantee any loan it is sufficient that the borrower possesses and engages the property as collateral loans because of abusive lending to peasants because of abusive lending to students the cadtm is calling for the abolition of illegitimate public debts and urges citizens to mobilize in order to audit the debt the cadtm is also calling for the abolition of private illegitimate debts the main reason why cadtm is organizing this 8th cadtm south asian workshop here in colombo is because sri lanka is affected by a huge amount of illegitimate public debt and because the exploited people of sri lanka is suffering a high level of household private debt in particular the women this south asian workshop is the fourth one organized since 2008 in sri lanka by the cadtm international network public indebtedness is not in itself a bad thing public authorities can use loans to finance the complete closure of thermal and nuclear power plants replace fossil energies with renewable sources of energy that respect the environment finance a conversion from current farming methods which contribute to climate change and use a lot of chemical inputs which are responsible for the decrease in biodiversity favouring local production of organic food to make farming compatible with our fight against climate change radically reduce air and road transport and develop collective transport and the use of railways finance an ambitious programme of low energy social housing public debt could be used to finance ambitious programmes of ecological transition instead of to enforce anti social extractivist productivist policies that foster competition between nations public borrowing is quite legitimate if it serves legitimate projects and if those who contribute to the loan do so legitimately a popular government will not hesitate to force corporations whether national foreign or multinational as well as richer households to contribute to the loan without drawing any profit profit the positive gain yielded from a company s activity net profit is profit after tax distributable profit is the part of the net profit which can be distributed to the shareholders from it i e with zero interest and without compensation in the case of inflation inflation the cumulated rise of prices as a whole e g a rise in the price of petroleum eventually leading to a rise in salaries then to the rise of other prices etc inflation implies a fall in the value of money since as time goes by larger sums are required to purchase particular items this is the reason why corporate driven policies seek to keep inflation down at the same time a large portion of households in the popular classes will easily be persuaded to entrust their savings to the public authorities to fund the legitimate projects mentioned above this voluntary funding by the popular classes would be remunerated at a positive actual rate for instance 4 this means that if annual inflation reached 3 the public authorities would pay a nominal interest rate of 7 to guarantee an actual rate of 4 such a mechanism would be perfectly legitimate since it would finance projects that are really useful to society and because it would help reduce the wealth of the rich while increasing the income of the popular classes abolishing illegitimate debts must be part of a much broader programme of further measures which would trigger the adoption of a transition to a new post capitalist and post productivist model such a programme would include abandoning austerity policies socialising the banking and insurance sector implementation of an overall tax reform with heavy taxation of capital an overall reduction in working hours with compensatory hiring and maintaining wage levels socialisation of the energy water and health sectors measures for ensuring gender parity development of public services and social benefits and the implementation of a strongly determined ecological transition policy eco socialism must be put at the heart of the debate not left aside immediate and concrete proposals must emerge we must wage the struggle against austerity and embark on the path of an eco socialist transition it is of absolute and immediate necessity

bloomberg opinion the most severe of lebanon s intersecting crises is the country s seemingly inexorable spiral toward economic catastrophe in only the latest of many harbingers of doom the likelihood of a default on a government bond due next month has sent stocks crashing to a 15 year low it s not just investors who re spooked the national carrier middle east airlines was panicked into announcing that it would no longer accept lebanese currency for payments the decision was quickly rescinded but it was a stunning vote of no confidence in the pound and by extension the economy and the government lebanese authorities have asked the international monetary fund for guidance on stabilizing the economy but international bailout conditions are likely to be painful a team of imf experts is scheduled to begin consultations next week but it is possible if only just to see a silver lining in all this the desperate need for a bailout combined with the ongoing people power movement in the streets could finally prompt significant economic and political reforms the intersection between the economic and political crises isn t lost on anyone at home or abroad the world bank s middle east representative ferid belhaj has called for reforms issuing a stark warning for lebanese leaders you cannot continue doing what you ve been doing for years when you see what the reaction on the street is and when you see what the state of the economy is the massive street protests that began last october were initially centered on socio economic grievances but quickly evolved into a rejection of the entire political elite the protests continue but not with the breadth and intensity they had before it remains to be seen whether the movement is fading or whether it will regroup and make another major push for political reforms the newly installed prime minister hassan diab an ally of hezbollah has little breathing room however he is being snubbed by gulf arab countries that have long been crucial to the lebanese economy through aid and remittances from expatriate lebanese workers only qatar has agreed to receive him the other arab countries have clearly indicated they aren t interested in propping up a government installed they believe to do the bidding of the iran backed group capital investment has dried up despite another interest rate cut the all important remittances largely from the gulf are in freefall in the last six months of 2019 lebanese banks lost 10 billion of deposits and the country is experiencing a rapidly intensifying liquidity crisis with dollars in short supply the most immediate threat is a 1 2 billion eurobond that matures in march and does not appear payable the imf has suggested debt holders may have to write off up to 70 of such investments prompting another slide in the already beleaguered pound diab knows an international bailout is the only way out of this mess but the west and the gulf countries and even multilateral institutions such as the imf and the world bank have made it clear they will not rescue lebanon unless there are substantial and painful economic reforms including currency devaluation reduced subsidies and public sector employment and a crack down on corruption and this would almost certainly involve significant political change as well greater transparency and accountability are crucial to any long term lebanese economic recovery but the current political order has proven incapable of such tough measures and many of the leading national political figures are as the protesters insist deeply implicated in endemic corruption nor will the changes be limited to domestic politics to get long term international support diab will be under pressure to finally enact the dissociation policy his predecessors have talked up for years but never implemented this rather vague policy commits the lebanese government in all its components to refrain from involvement in any regional conflicts or the affairs of other arab states to have any meaning this would require hezbollah to give up its cherished role as cat s paw for iran in places like syria iraq and yemen but who will bell that cat hezbollah has just erected a statue of the slain iranian commander qassem soleimani as a symbol of its and iran power over lebanon diab s best hope is that the hezbollah leadership recognizes that they are inextricably bound to the rest of the lebanese system and that if the economy completely collapses so will their finances if diab is serious about mobilizing an international rescue he needs to move quickly on the reforms that will be required by donors especially the reduction of of the national debt and an end to the looting of national wealth by the elites i wouldn t hold my breath though diab is as the protesters have been saying part of the elite still even if the lebanese ruling class is determined to keep changes to the minimum necessary to ensure international support as long as the donors stay firm on their demands for reform they can begin to push the ossified power structure toward change and if the protesters keep up the pressure on the streets they may be able to force the implementation of constitutional provisions to create a more democratic and non sectarian lower house in parliament if a combination of domestic and international pressure in the context of the emerging economic implosion is not enough to impose serious change on lebanon it s hard to imagine what could to contact the author of this story hussein ibish at hussein ibish gmail com to contact

valencia calif melbourne australia business wire avita medical limited asx avh nasdaq rcel a regenerative medicine company with a technology platform positioned to address unmet medical needs in therapeutic skin restoration announced that it filed today with the australian securities exchange asx its appendix 4d half year report for the six month period ended 31 december 2019 revenues of recell system for first six month period ended 31 december 2019 six months ended in thousands of australian dollars 31 december 2019 2018 u s product sales a 9 274 a 1 102 international product sales 410 711 total product sales 9 684 1 813 other income including barda 3 846 5 113 total revenue a 13 530 a 6 926 we continue to be pleased with early recell system utilization as we progress our go deep strategy within the in patient burn setting we are focused on driving incremental growth within existing accounts together with broadening our commercial footprint via the addition of 25 burns centers throughout calendar 2020 early 2020 sales performance has highlighted the commitment of burn specialists to the recell system particularly among our group of super users said dr mike perry avita medical s chief executive officer with our strong balance sheet buoyed by our successful financing in november we are also exploring opportunities to advance our existing clinical programs as well as potentially commencing additional late stage studies where we believe we have achieved a significant level of de risking via our substantive body of clinical evidence and peer reviewed publications as an example we will be working with the fda to explore the possibility of using an adaptive pivotal study design for vitiligo in place of or adjunctive to the currently approved ide in this indication we plan to provide updates on these opportunities over the next few months u s recell system update 2020 is off to a pleasing start with consistent demand for the recell system especially among our super users and notwithstanding the 43rd annual boswick burn wound symposium being held in late january and our national sales meeting nsm being held in early february at our nsm we spent a significant amount of time consulting with our burns surgeons including our most experienced users with a view to improving on best practices for use of the recell system these activities included a specific focus around optimal usage and teaching methodology for the recell system with a particular focus on the use of the recell system with smaller burns and as a standalone therapy these efforts and our broader efforts to promote awareness of the recell system will extend into the forthcoming annual meeting of the american burn association which will be held in orlando florida 17 20 march at this meeting there will be 8 presentations highlighting recell focused on decreased length of stay cost savings use on small burns and other potential uses looking ahead we will also be attending financial conferences to further educate investor and analyst audiences about recell and the potential of the platform to this end we will be attending the cowen annual healthcare conference in boston massachusetts 4 march our presentation will be webcast and a link to the audio track and the presentation will be available on our website at market acceleration expansion update our goal of expanding utilization of the recell system to 25 new burns centers during the 2020 calendar year cy 2020 is well underway with two new centers ordering as of the end of january while the rate of in patient burn admissions is inherently variable we are confident that site expansion and our broader recell system usage will result in incremental revenue growth across the entirety of cy 2020 consistent with this goal we are keenly focused on our go deep strategy of 1 broadening our burn utilization from large full thickness wounds or big burns to the much higher incidence of smaller or partial thickness burns which is consistent with usage patterns demonstrated by our most experienced burn specialists and 2 educating and training other burn surgeons within our customer base the nearest term opportunity we are advancing is in trauma and soft tissue injuries where similar to the burn market surgeons graft skin to repair defects from accidents e g degloving lacerations gun shots etc in 2019 september we secured an investigational device exemption ide to pursue fda approval for soft tissue reconstruction i e trauma and we presently have three sites screening patients with our first patient expected shortly this study will assess the safety and effectiveness of the recell system in a minimum of 65 trauma patients in addition we are pursuing incremental reimbursement avenues within the out patient setting as we believe this will be important to support adoption of the recell system within the broader burn market we are also seeking fda approval for a pediatric scald indication we have fda investigational device exemptions for our two pediatric scalds studies and plan to commence these studies soon with enrollment slated to start in mid 2020 as previously disclosed in late december 2019 we received fda ide approval for a feasibility study with 10 vitiligo patients to primarily determine the optimal concentration of the cell suspension prepared using the recell system while we remain committed to the 10 patient single site pilot study we are presently considering adaptive trial designs that could lead to an acceleration of the commencement of a full pivotal study for the recell system in vitiligo our depth of clinical experience with patients internationally makes us confident that such a strategy would address this unmet need have a high likelihood of success and could allow us to get our technology to patients more quickly and efficiently we are also continuing to explore large opportunities for the recell system as a delivery platform to help address cellular and genetic disorders as previously disclosed we entered into a sponsored research agreement with the gates center for regenerative medicine at the university of colorado in november 2019 this relationship is focused on proof of concept and development of a spray on treatment of genetically modified cells for patients with the genetic skin disease epidermolysis bullosa eb with potential applicability to other genetic skin disorders it is early days in this program but we are hopeful of first in human studies commencing in the middle or second half of 2021 in parallel we are well advanced with discussions to secure a rejuvenation application for the recell system and hope to have further details available in the middle of this year lastly with our successful capital raising in november 2019 we have additional resources that may allow us to advance into a potential fda registration study in an area where we have existing strong and deep clinical evidence these opportunities are all presently under re assessment and we hope to provide more clarity including details regarding the potential commencement of an additional

form part of the financial statements notes to the half year financial statements for the half year ended 31 december 2019 1 basis of preparation and accounting policies a basis of preparation this general purpose condensed financial report for the half year ended 31 december 2019 has been prepared in accordance with ias 34 interim financial reporting and the corporations act 2001 the group is a for profit entity for financial reporting purposes under australian accounting standards the parent company s functional and presentation currency is australian dollars a this half year financial report does not include all notes of the type normally included within the annual financial report and therefore cannot be expected to provide as full an understanding of the financial performance financial position and financing and investing activities of the consolidated entity as the full financial report it is recommended that this half year financial report be read in conjunction with the annual report for the year ended 30 june 2019 and considered together with all public announcements made by avita medical limited in accordance with the continuous disclosure obligations of the asx listing rules this half year financial report has been prepared on the going concern basis the accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the group for the purposes of preparation of these interim financial statements certain items on the consolidated financial statements and notes for the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation b new standards adopted as at 1 july 2019 the group has adopted the new accounting pronouncements which have become effective this year and are as follows ifrs 16 leases ifrs 16 leases replaces ias 17 leases along with three interpretations ifric 4 determining whether an arrangement contains a lease sic 15 operating leases incentives and sic 27 evaluating the substance of transactions involving the legal form of a lease ifrs 16 has been applied using the modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of adopting ifrs 16 being recognised in equity as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for the current period prior periods have not been restated for contracts in place at the date of initial application of ifrs 16 the group has elected to apply the definition of a lease from ias 17 and ifric 4 and has not applied ifrs 16 to arrangements that were previously not identified as lease under ias 17 and ifric 4 the group has elected not to include initial direct costs in the measurement of the right of use asset for operating leases in existence at the date of initial application of ifrs 16 being 1 july 2019 at this date the group has also elected to measure the right of use assets at an amount equal to the lease liability adjusted for any prepaid or accrued lease payments that existed at the date of transition on transition for leases previously accounted for as operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months and for leases of low value assets the group has applied the optional exemptions to not recognise right of use assets but to account for the lease expense on a straight line basis over the remaining lease term for those leases previously classified as finance leases the right of use asset and lease liability are measured at the date of initial application at the same amounts as under ias 17 immediately before the date of initial application on transition to ifrs 16 the weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied to lease liabilities recognised under ifrs 16 was 6 3 which is the prime rate plus 2 notes to the half year financial statements for the half year ended 31 december 2019 1 basis of preparation and accounting policies continued b new standards adopted as at 1 july 2019 continued the following is a reconciliation of total operating lease commitments at 30 june 2019 to the lease liabilities recognised at 1 july 2019 operating lease commitments disclosed as at 30 june 2019 a 1 585 366 discounted using the lessee s weighted average incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application a 1 362 065 add adjustments as a result of a different treatment of extension and termination of options 2 877 034 lease liabilities recognised as at 1 july 2019 a 4 239 099 of which are current lease liabilities a 691 119 non current lease liabilities 3 547 980 a 4 239 099 ifric 23 uncertainty over income tax treatment iasb interpretation 23 interpretation 23 uncertainty over income tax treatment interpretation 23 clarified the application of the recognition and measurement criteria in ias 112 income taxes where there is uncertainty over income tax treatments and requires an assessment of each uncertain tax position as to whether it is probable that a taxation authority will accept the position where it is not probable the effect of the uncertainty is reflected in determining the relevant taxable profit or loss tax bases unused tax losses and unused tax credits or tax rates the amount is determined as either the single most likely amount or the sum of the probability weighted amounts in a range of possible outcomes whichever better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty judgements are reassessed as and when new facts and circumstances are presented interpretation 23 is effective for the company s annual financial reporting period beginning on 1 july 2019 the company s existing recognition and measurement accounting policies together with accounting related judgements were in alignment with those required by interpretation 23 and hence no transition adjustment to retained earnings was required the adoption this standard did not have any impact in the disclosure or the amounts recognized in the company s condensed consolidated financial statements other pronouncements other accounting pronouncements which have become effective from 1 july 2019 and have therefore been adopted do not have a significant impact on the group s financial results or position notes to the half year financial statements for the half year ended 31 december 2019 1 basis of preparation and accounting policies continued c significant accounting policies the interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies adopted in the group s most recent annual report for the year ended 30 june 2019 except for the effects of applying ifrs 16 leases as described in note 1b the group has applied ifrs 16 using the modified retrospective approach and therefore comparative information has not been restated this means comparative information is still reported under ias 17 and ifric 4 accounting policy applicable from 1 july 2019 for any new contracts entered into on or after 1 january 2019 the group considers whether a contract is or contains a lease a lease is defined as a contract or part of a contract that conveys the right to use an asset the underlying asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration to apply this definition the group assesses whether the contract meets three key evaluations which are whether the contract contains an identified asset which is either explicitly identified in the contract or implicitly specified by being identified at the time the asset is made available to the group the group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset throughout the period of use considering its rights within the defined scope of the contract the group has the right to direct the use of the identified asset throughout the period of use the group assess whether it has the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used throughout the period of use measurement and recognition of leases as a lessee at lease commencement date the group recognises a right of use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet the right of use asset is measured at cost which is made up of the initial measurement of the lease liability any initial direct costs incurred by the group an estimate of any costs to dismantle and remove the asset at the end of the lease and any lease payments made in advance of the lease commencement date net of any incentives received the group depreciates the right of use assets on a straight line basis from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right of use asset or the end of the lease term the group also assesses the right of use asset for impairment when such indicators exist at the commencement date the group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments unpaid at that date discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available or the group s incremental borrowing rate lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability are made up of fixed payments including in substance fixed variable payments based on an index or rate amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and payments arising from options reasonably certain to be exercised notes to the half year financial statements for the half year ended 31 december 2019 2 basis of preparation and accounting policies continued c significant accounting policies continued subsequent to initial measurement the liability will be reduced for payments made and increased for interest it is remeasured to reflect any reassessment or modification or if there are changes in in substance fixed payments when the lease liability is remeasured the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right of use asset or profit and loss if the right of use asset is already reduced to zero the group has elected to account for short term leases and leases of low value assets using the practical expedients instead of recognising a right of use asset and lease liability the payments in relation to these are recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the lease term on the statement of financial position right of use assets have been included in property plant and equipment and lease liabilities have been included in trade and other payables accounting policy applicable before 1 july 2019 finance leases management applies judgment in considering the substance of a lease agreement and whether it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset key factors considered include the length of the lease term in relation to the economic life of the asset the present value of the minimum lease payments in relation to the asset s fair value and whether the group obtains ownership of the asset at the end of the lease term for leases of land and buildings the minimum lease payments are first allocated to each component based on the relative fair values of the respective lease interests each component is then evaluated separately for possible treatment as a finance lease taking into consideration the fact that land normally has an indefinite economic life see the accounting policy note in the year end financial statements for the depreciation methods and useful lives for assets held under finance leases the interest element of lease payments is charged to profit or loss as finance costs over the period of the lease operating leases all other leases are treated as operating leases where the group is a lessee payments on operating lease agreements are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term associated costs such as maintenance and insurance are expensed as incurred d significant accounting judgments estimates and assumptions when preparing the half year report management undertakes a number of judgements estimates and assumptions about recognition and measurement of assets liabilities income and expenses the actual results may differ from the judgements estimates and assumptions made by management and will seldom equal the estimated results the judgements estimates and assumptions applied in the half year report including the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied in the group s annual report for the year ended 30 june 2019 notes to the half year financial statements for the half year ended 31 december 2019 1 basis of preparation and accounting policies continued e going concern these financial statements have been prepared on the basis of going concern which contemplates the continuity of normal business activities and the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of business during the half year ended 31 december 2019 the group has generated a loss for the period of a 20 980 787 2018 a 15 579 391 and the group has used cash in operations of a 13 372 547 2018 a 10 458 479 on 13 november 2019 the group completed an institutional placement in which it issued 203 389 831 shares at a price of a 0 059 per share and received gross proceeds of a 120 000 000 the group benefits from cash inflows from the u s biomedical advanced research and development authority barda contracts the first of which was awarded to the group in september 2015 these payments from barda offset costs from various activities undertaken to support the fda regulatory approval process for recell in the u s preparation for the planned commercial launch of recell in the u s and recell clinical programs in the u s with the u s fda approval of recell for the treatment of acute thermal burns in september 2018 and the subsequent u s market launch of the product in january 2019 sales of goods are expected to be an increasing source of revenue in the future another potential source of revenue is the barda contract line item covering the initial purchase delivery and storage of the recell system in the amount of us 7 594 620 approximately a 10 300 000 the group expects to be utilizing cash reserves until u s and international sales of its products in existing and expansion markets eventually reach the level to fund ongoing operations the group has historically funded its research and development activities and more recently its substantial investment in sales and marketing activities through raising capital by issuing securities in the company and it is expected that similar funding will be obtained to provide working capital if and when required if the group is unable to raise capital in the future the group may need to curtail expenditures by scaling back certain research and development or other programs as a result of the above the directors are satisfied that there is sufficient working capital to support the committed research and development programs and other activities over the next 12 months and the group has the ability to realize its assets and pay its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business accordingly the directors have prepared the half year report on a going concern basis 2 revenue consolidated 31 dec 2019 31 dec 2018 revenue sale of goods goods transferred at a point in time

accordance with auditing standard on review engagements asre 2410 review of a financial report performed by the independent auditor of the entity in order to state whether on the basis of the

the corporations regulations 2001 as the auditor of avita medical limited asre 2410 requires that we comply with the ethical requirements relevant to the audit of the annual financial report a review of a half year financial report consists of making enquiries primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters and applying analytical and other review procedures a review is

conference call participants jason fairclough bank of america merrill lynch liam fitzpatrick deutsche bank sylvain brunet exane bnp paribas myles allsop ubs investment bank anthony robson global mining research sergey donskoy societe generale tyler broda rbc capital markets ephrem ravi citigroup sandeep peety morgan stanley grant sporre macquarie research martin fewings good morning welcome to our 2019 preliminary results today we have ivan glasenberg our ceo and steve kalmin our cfo with us today thank you for joining us and ivan i d like to invite you up thank you ivan glasenberg thank you good morning thank you for coming for our 2019 results so looking at the highlights for 2019 healthy cash generation during the year and as you ll see 2019 adjusted ebitda was 11 6 billion that s down 26 from the previous year and the major part of that is due to the lower commodity prices during the year and as you note copper was down about 8 zinc down 13 nickel slightly up 6 cobalt was a big one down 57 and if you take the newcastle coal down around about 27 however we still generated a large amount of cash and operating cash from our assets and trading gave us sorry gave us around about 10 3 billion that s down 22 from the previous year shareholders return we returned to shareholders around about 5 billion and as you ll note 2 7 billion was by the way of dividends cash distributions there and 2 3 billion on buybacks during the year 0 3 billion was from the 2018 program net capex was around about 5 billion and as you can see we still had solid margin and cost performance again on our key commodities even though you had this reduction of commodity prices and if you have a look at the ebitda of the mining the margins at the operations still relatively high even with the drop of these commodity prices as i say so if you exclude the ramp up assets we still have ebitda margins at the mining assets of around 37 and as opposed to 41 during 2018 so we clearly kept our costs under control and allowed us still to make those high margin even though we had the drop in the commodity prices coal ebitda the margin is 36 as opposed to 46 the previous year but the costs were still contained and as you ll see in coal we contained the cost still at 45 a tonne which allowed us to make a 26 margin so the full year cost performance in our key commodities displays that we have top quality tier 1 assets and if you have a look at our copper excluding africa which will come in and the benefits of africa will start coming in this year and i think africa eventually subject to the cobalt prices will even hopefully bring the costs lower on the overall copper prices but you ll see we still have 0 81 a pound copper production which is extremely low tier 1 assets as it clearly displays zinc 0 13 nickel 2 77 excluding koniambo and we ll see koniambo continues to perform better and hopefully that will start contributing to margins going forward thermal coal as i said earlier we re still maintaining tight cost around about 45 which allows us to make a 26 margin on our coal assets back to marketing as we ve always said marketing is extremely resilient no matter what the commodity prices are doing and even with the falling commodity prices we still performed well in the marketing sector as you see 2 4 billion which is 2 down on the previous year but a very strong second half in the metal performance and robust oil results throughout the year and even you are all well aware of the cobalt loss we took during the first half so the 2 4 billion includes the cobalt loss during the first half so a very resilient performance across the marketing sector and as i say especially in the second half of the year the metals marketing increased over the year in the second half talk about the balance sheet strong balance sheet we still have available committed liquidity of around about 10 1 billion and we have bond maturities kept about around 3 billion per year net debt 17 6 billion and that includes the 1 25 billion added on because of ifrs 16 accounting rules which will rely which forced to put related lease liabilities on to the balance sheet 2020 we got the idea is to reduce the net debt to ebitda down to 1x also to bring the debt around about to 14 billion to 15 billion which steve has always said that we had liked it within that range and therefore we ll move it around that s where we d like to be even with 1x net debt to ebitda so even with higher ebitda going forward we would still like to keep the debt around about that level we ve recommended a dividend this year of 0 20 which is around about 2 6 billion which will be payable in 2 equal installments over the year talking about sustainability performance fatalities is still an issue for the company and as you will note we fatalities has increased during the year a large result of some of our focus assets which we re still working heavily on and peter is here today and he spoke about it in our investor presentation in december the work being done in that area spent a lot of time at 2 of the problematic assets and we re doing a full restructuring over there in kazzinc and in mopani and hopefully we will start reducing that and become fatality free which is our aim going forward so a lot of work has been spent in that area and peter and his team is employing a lot of people in that area to ensure we start improving considerably there okay this is our commitment of glencore to transition to a low carbon economy and as you are aware in 2019 a large amount of our capital expenditure is towards energy transition materials and basically that is copper cobalt and nickel and if you have a look where our capex has been spent during 2019 it s been in those areas it is the ramp up of mopani it is the katanga asset where we produce a large amount of our cobalt and copper katanga this year we said will produce 270 000 tonnes of copper but it will produce around about 30 000 32 000 tonnes of cobalt so we re starting to transition most of our capital expenditure into that area of the low carbon economy nickel in canada which is used in the battery production we ll talk about that later with increasing production of nickel at sudbury and capital being spent there so what is happening in the other areas of our business coal the scope 3 emissions what is scope 3 emissions we all know scope 3 emissions is the emissions in the production of steel in the production of power and the use of fossil fuels in different forms of energy whilst you are burning at these co2 emissions during the production of those commodities when you are utilizing those fossil fuels and what is happening we looking at our coal reserve base and where our coal production is going it is depleting over the years we are utilizing digging the material out of the ground and has been is depleting especially in colombia and south africa we are depleting reserves so what we say here our projection is by the year 2035 our coal production will reduce by around about 30 and therefore our scope 3 emissions whilst coal is being burnt in those power stations is reducing so what are we doing we are not selling our coal assets to get the scope 3 off our books scope 3 because if you sell the assets and you sell it and you get rid of it or you spin it out et cetera scope 3 emissions will still be occurring what we are doing we are in fact depleting our reserve and therefore glencore is having less scope 3 emissions from the production of each commodity and especially coal as we move into other forms of a better low carbon economy as i say with the production of copper nickel and cobalt so that s where we re going as glencore to reduce our scope 3 emissions automatically reducing as we deplete our reserves going forward if we look at cobalt and as i said an important part of the future to enable the mobility of electric vehicles we are a major producer of cobalt in the world today we produce around about 32 000 tonnes of cobalt the market is around about 110 000 tonnes and going forward as we expand further with katanga hopefully bringing mutanda back up in about 2 years or 3 years depending upon how the market looks and how we transition to the low sulfide copper we ll be a major producer of cobalt in the world and as you are aware with the transition to the electric vehicles and 2 million electric vehicles being produced in the world this year and growing further we believe around about the year 2030 we ll need another 75 000 tonnes of cobalt so a very important commodity but what we have done with cobalt and what we re trying to display in this slide is we have tied up under long term contracts because of the demand for cobalt in the battery making process for electric vehicles we tied up a lot of long term supply contracts and because of us our cobalt being independently audited each year by the cobalt refinery supply chain due diligence standard and this is a standard defined by responsibility mining initiative the battery makers around the world like to have icobalt which is non artisanal cobalt that is produced in a large industrial operation and therefore is artisanal free cobalt so we ve signed these contracts you ve seen them being announced with umicore with gem with sk innovation and samsung and that is tying up a lot of our long term cobalt supply to these major consumers of cobalt which will be producing a large amount of the world s batteries for electric vehicles so that gives you a rundown of the structure of what we re doing going forward and steve will take you through the financials thank you steven kalmin thanks ivan and good morning to those in the room and those that may be listening in on the call i think it s a reasonably clean self explanatory financial report we were here just a couple of months ago updating on the longer term or the medium term where we gave production cost and capex guidance for the next 3 years i ll leave some of that also through the presentation both in terms of the cash flow generation at spot prices today and some cost developments as well that we ve obviously seen with and even on prices as we ve gone through december to where we are today it s pretty much as you were in terms of free cash flow generation because we ve seen some reductions in some of the metals coronavirus sort of discounting on some of those but coal is holding up pretty well gold pgm and cobalt in fact is also up about 15 or so as well so just from a historical perspective ivan has highlighted some of these ebitda 11 6 billion it was a pickup second half over first half we were at 5 6 billion in the first half we ve had the continuation of lower commodity prices which has affected the full year results primarily in copper and in cobalt the industrial business was at 9 billion down 32 marketing had a pleasing second half to the year finishing 2 4 billion as ivan mentioned it was clearly covering some of the headwinds particularly in cobalt for the first half where we announced the 350 million noncash nrv inventory adjustment if you like some of that would have reversed back on a full year basis the cobalt absorbed noncash losses would have been in the 200s in that year but the 2 4 billion reflects the net amount of all that and clearly second half performance was annualizing towards the top half of our range in terms of the cash generation i think the 10 3 billion the cash generated pre working capital is a more indicative headline cash proxy because it sort of accounts for both the cobalt noncash that occurred during the first half and it s pre some tax mismatch or some lag effects that happens which hits us at the funds from operation so the cash pre working capital which you can see was down 22 that pretty much mirrors the ebitda which was down 26 slight improvement because of cobalt being noncash at the time the actual funds from operations 7 9 billion that absorbs that s after interest and tax and tax in particular is something that you should look at as something that was in cash terms relative to headline earnings in 2019 reflects a big catch up in tax paid in 2019 in respect of 2018 we were still working through some tax losses particularly in australia and you ll see that page 27 of the annual report just in the balance sheet the income tax payable itself dropped from 1 1 billion to 350 million of income tax accrual at the end of the year so there was 755 million reduction there as well as some prepayments in some jurisdictions that we expect some refunds as well so there s close to 1 billion of tax that s been absorbed or paid within that funds from operation it doesn t relate to the headline ebitda or cash during that year and is then effectively normalized and reflected in the spot free cash flow generation which i ll talk about later so pro forma really was closer to 9 billion in terms of funds from operations and you ll see the likes of some of that analysis in footnotes that we give throughout the financial statements net debt 17 6 billion i ll talk about that the pathway also towards 14 billion to 15 billion as we look towards 2019 the leases was noncash adoption of ifrs 16 was a major impact in why we re there and not close to the 16 billion there was 1 3 billion of the lease impact 900 million upon adoption as well as some increases that s happened during the year in leasing some of it in the marketing as well each time we charter a ship for more than 12 months today a vessel maybe 18 months or so that suddenly comes on the balance sheet and or a rental of some warehouse for storage of aluminum if you do an 18 month deal that comes on as leasing adjustments in these things those are going to recycle particularly the marketing leases there was 0 6 billion they re going to recycle very quickly the average profile or amortization maturity was way less than 2 years on that particular thrust i ll talk about all that later on 17 6 billion as ivan mentioned looking towards 14 billion 15 billion as our sort of next target or trigger or catalyst at which point we would sort of reconsider that the balance sheet is in a much stronger position to reconsider capital management either in the form of additional dividends or potential buybacks at that particular point in time so if we get to the industrial i think this is all well covered within the report and some of the details ivan still mentioned notwithstanding the lower commodity prices which we ll see in the bridge later on which accounted for by far the majority of the contraction in earnings from 2018 to 2019 about 4 billion of net difference and that was across clearly cobalt 57 that s turned the corner now at least and mutanda certainly helped the rebalancing of that market as well coal itself has found some footings in certain markets as well weak potentially europe is still a bit picked up in the south african and in asian sentiment coal has also picked up a little bit and we ll show the spot cash flow generation also but ivan also mentioned still the ebitda margins the buffer relative to still generating healthy margins within the business on the right hand side you can still see pretty healthy margins notwithstanding that reflects the low cost structure generally within our business the high margin structure ferrochrome is a sort of generally i don t want to say a rounding error but it s a smaller commodity in the business that s been under extreme pressure we saw prices 14 and that whole business accounted for 300 million in the price variance as well we ve announced to people it s well chronicled the pressure the margin the power prices everything that s down there and the industry is trying to sort of respond and we ve announced together with obviously various other companies down there are considering what the appropriate level of production is in these cost structures and how to turn that business around as well and hopefully we will see some improvements going forward on that particular bridge that i mentioned so we the big tower the others are relatively small it s really the price contraction during the year as well 4 3 billion that was 2 billion in coal alone across the various mixes of coal and 2 3 billion was on the metal side of which our overall copper reporting mine was 1 5 billion of that cobalt 900 million and copper 600 million alone so cobalt clearly had a big impact both in pricing and to some extent which will catch up over the next year or 2 is the variance also between production and sales there s been a slow period also in terms of particularly from katanga if you like they also released their results a few days ago they are now 17 000 tonnes of production and about 4 000 4 500 5 000 tonnes of sales there s a buildup of drying capacity leg they ve got to catch up in the processing so anyone with a calculator can work out clearly they re sitting with at least 12 000 13 000 tonnes of cobalt contained down within kcc as well that also affects the timing will also contribute to lowering of costs and cash flow generation forward our spot prices our scenarios do not assume this net sell down we just we sell what we produce but that is also a factor that would have held back reporting of cash and profits during the year as well volume not much to speak of the it was the full year effect of the 2 coal acquisitions can still contribute continue to generate good margins and strong cash flow generation both at hvo and hail creek they were required pathway through 2018 so there was a slight volume impact about 0 4 billion and then there were some negative impacts a little bit koniambo but also some timing differences again of some sales against production which should provide at the point in time that we then go and sell down those inventories it will obviously contribute some earnings going forward there was a little bit in zinc nickel and in coal where we actually had some slight inventory differences cost impact was you had some inflationary impacts clearly in argentina is extreme south africa to a lesser extent you ve got the currency relief on the other side so it s sort of as you were if you look at the currency benefits argentina 130 million south africa 150 million as well those will affect some of the inflation as well as some power prices there was a small noncash or it was an effect also during that particular year where the previous year we have to look at when we re quite extract all those years ago there were some provisions raised at the time for some take or pay provisions relative to spot prices which is just unwinding over a period of time each year we need to look at our long term profiles and see whether any of that provision needs to be increased or decreased and there was a not sort of the prior year was slightly positively affected by a reversal of some of that provision there wasn t the same effect this year so it s a base period where there s a negative there was no negative this year but there s a small positive next year that s why you have a negative variance it was all noncash as that worked its way through the system and african copper that variance of 456 million that s not the price that s just the volume cost variances that was exactly the same variance at the half year so you ve seen a stabilization in that business performance both from the cost as well as the production i think it was about 420 million 430 million at the half year and that s a function of of course mutanda relative to the previous year with not so much on the cobalt side before it went into care and maintenance but there s low production volumes we spoke about ramp and inflation and price pressure on the reagents and the consumables through the first half of the year particularly asset in lime and the first full effect this year of the mining code which started effectively around the middle of 2018 so these were impacts that ultimately if you look at africa copper generally it had a negative ebitda 2019 of 350 million strongly positive in 2018 both cobalt prices volume in mutanda et cetera on the spot scenario as we look into 2020 there s about a 220 million positive so there s going to be a 500 million or so positive variance as we go from 19 into 20 versus the current plans and hopefully we ve reset both operational cost and the likes comfortably so we can deliver on that positive variance as we go forward a few more details on the industrial performance in the usual format that many of you will be familiar page 24 of the presentation don t intend to go through that but that provides a lot more of the detailed building blocks as to how the ebitda of this business arose relative to some of the building blocks in the guidance and some of the information that we provided over the years so they ve come in reasonably close some costs generally a little bit lower production in 1 or 2 departments a little bit weaker but net net we would have exceeded the overall industrial performance of the sort of small model if you like that we do would have beaten on the coal copper side and nickel maybe a little bit weaker on the zinc side so overall as you can see copper is improving as the african business stabilizes and the volume and cost benefits arise that 3 billion was made up 3 3 billion as i said ex africa and negative 300 million for africa to give a 300 million africa was negative 3 billion for the first half as well so it was effectively flat second half and you ve got improving performance there the overall business was 3 billion for the full year and 1 3 billion for the first half so you re seeing that growth in that business we expect that to continue as just on spot prices today where copper s come off cobalt where it is our updated cost and volume guidance will be about 3 4 billion ebitda around spot macros at the moment that business you can see as well hopefully we would have peaked at the 1 48 per pound price that s including the african business and we ve said by 2021 that should be getting across the whole business towards the 1 a pound and you can see on the bottom left ex africa has been very stable the big south american businesses australia et cetera down at the 0 81 a pound so there s been a significant drag through the last 12 18 months we spoke at length about that through the interim results last year in august we gave some updates on plants operational performance katanga itself delivered its targets for the second half and has started reasonably well also for the 2020 as well relative to guidance as well so nickel and coal have come in slightly better as you can see in terms of cost guidance that we ve given through the second half of last year at the bottom on the nickel business at 280 or 3 96 3 98 flat ex koniambo 2 88 to 2 77 not much in there as well and thermal coal has been holding pretty well at the 45 46 cost and the margin of 26 27 so i think our the sort of metrics the building blocks that we provided have shown themselves to be quite useful and we re looking to continually provide and i ll say the 2020 numbers as we work our way through the system as well on the marketing slide as we mentioned before 2 4 billion we needed to catch up clearly in the second half and we have done that across all businesses where we re strong oil is clearly the standout you can see the strength of the diversification across products geography different markets different backdrops of economies to still deliver the 2 4 billion this year as i said still having absorbed the cobalt noncash adjustments which cumulatively over the year having taken the half time score at 350 million for the full year it would have been in the 200s so still significant clearly a less material driver over the full year and something that is obviously less material to have made a bigger disclosure around for the full year as well as i mentioned also on the call earlier on what s something that s lost down in those sort of bottom blue numbers as well but not to necessarily forget is there was quite a good performance in the glencore agri business during the course of 2019 so our share of the net income was 58 million compared to 21 million so off a lower base we re doubling up on that business but the underlying business was circa 10 or so up and but there s high depreciation in everything else which is why we ll end up with a share of net income but that business is doing pretty well and we expect even a better 2020 on 2019 so don t forget that that exists we own 50 of that business and sort of reconfirm the guidance range as well on capex as well no change to the 3rd of december guidance for industrial from 20 21 22 the 5 5 billion 5 billion and 4 2 billion that is fully loaded with industrial leases and everything that we expect of how the debt evolution will go beyond 2020 21 22 we gave the movements we provided the some of the building blocks of what we re still expecting the expansionary on the bottom towards the right hand side up as well is effectively working there hasn t been any new big sanctioning of any sort of major projects there s still the multiple year projects as you d expect in this business as well there s the katanga acid plant that gets commissioned through the first half of this year that s working its way through the system zhairem the big zinc replenishment and mine over within the kazzinc business that gets commissioned during the course of this year hence the big expansion you ll see later on in zinc tonnes in the next couple of years there s almost a parallel 2 mines operating before you do see some declines out there within the next 2 or 3 years united a brownfield coal approval down in australia just to replace some declining tonnes elsewhere and the big refreshment of the whole canadian complex across both raglan onaping depth the whole sudbury basin to extend and preserve 20 plus years worth of life there astron oil refinery is as we spoke last year in december there is a it was part of the commitment in buying that there is an upgrade around turning that into ultimately a good business in terms of margin environments but it still needs to adapt to clean fuels and debottleneck that particular business in terms of throughput that will consume some capex and then generate some reasonable cash going forward all drilling programs are all in sustaining i think we can continue looks like we re good to go the middle graph just wanted to this should be the only time that it was just around the ifrs the leases and just trying to show you how it works through the 120 pages as you go through where we do report on page 51 or so now to the financials where we do show the gross amount capitalized into the assets on both the marketing and the industrial so 5 3 billion on the industrial 438 million on the marketing side of course marketing is mostly leases at shipping and vessels there s no other capex that necessarily goes into that business then from a net cash perspective you then pull out the ifrs leases and the other most of it is page 10 you can see the new leases were added was 582 million there s a small amount of interest that gets capitalized obviously that s noncash as well there s the 652 million the net sale of the pp e in cash terms gives the 4 966 billion that s it s a transition year in respect to the leasing as i said both on the bottom right those 5 5 billion 5 billion 4 2 billion is in terms of that s neutral in terms of balance sheet those are fully loaded capex irrespective there s some small leasing that we still expect in the industrial side 2020 there s a few commitments on some fleet and then it tapers off effectively beyond that and it should be very little on the industrial side in terms of balance sheet as ivan said very very very strong liquidity position 10 billion a very manageable maturity profile no more than about 3 billion still looking towards the longer term 10 billion 16 billion range that s excluding marketing leases because clearly those has no part to play within an overall longer term sort of capital structure in terms of true leverage these are more really short term operating type of consuming expenses within our marketing business whether it s vessels and transport if you like so 17 6 billion was reported net debt 0 6 billion marketing leases we get down to 17 billion we have mentioned that we would like to move towards the 14 billion to 15 billion or close to the 1x and the before we would consider so there is a priority or a natural de gearing that s going to happen through the generation of free cash flow 4 3 billion i m going to talk about that later on 1 point 2 6 billion is the distribution that s been recommended so the surplus cash flow generation above all that s 1 7 billion that will be prioritized towards debt reduction which should see us in the current price environment move to a little bit above 15 billion that s pre any long term monetizations disposals that we may have and also some release of some margin calls there was a big outflow just towards the end of the year 2019 the last 2 weeks we saw big spikes in oil and crude oil and copper both up 5 6 just in the month the year finished at about 66 67 crude we re obviously more down at 57 copper was about 5300 we ve retraced those movements in december and just in that month alone we had 800 million of margin calls go out in respect of our hedging facilities those have all come back since now through january some of that obviously adjust the rmi some of it does result in a non rmi depending on what s been hedged across the book as well so we have seen some partial reduction there and there is a focus still on some noncore long term monetization which i ll talk a little bit about that later on as well so there s sort of the pathway towards 15 billion 16 billion 14 billion to 15 billion the pace of that and the trajectory and acceleration everything else is going to be a function of macros commodity prices how soon do we get there is it 6 9 12 months i mean pick your numbers but it s going to be a positive trajectory on the way down and that s just clearly more headroom more comfort more conservatively structured and it would be a level at which we would then gather around the table and debate as to whether we wish the time frame around capital management additional buybacks and the likes would be back on the table at that particular point in time in terms of potential disposals or monetizations page 26 we just update some of our various stakes listed or otherwise and some potential noncore asset disposals there s not yes 1 billion is still internally a number that we can construct a relatively easy case for delivering on that but in terms of time and quantum it s now going to be a function of us being able to come down the market backdrop to date the environment is very healthy in some areas maybe less healthy in others given things so anything pressures pgm infrastructure low interest rate environment we have clearly positive exposure to some of those there s a noncore asset say i want to just highlight which is probably loss generating over here as many of you know we sold 50 of the mototolo pgm operation in south africa about 12 18 months ago it was 50 50 with anglo we sold it to anglo so they could have 100 but we effectively retained most of the price upside through a 5 to 7 year period so there was a deferred consideration which was not linked to operation they took operational risk but we were there was some price deferral as part of that so there s a series of 5 or 6 years worth of cash flows given the explosion in rhodium palladium platinum and the like our over the next few years our nominal sort of forward curve cash flows in respect of that is in the sort of 400 million to 500 million range at the moment so even in the near years you would get 100 million plus and then it would sort of tail off so that s something we could look at whether you had some of that how do you accelerate it how do you sort of monetize how do you lock it in that something like that can clearly go towards even something like that that was almost off the screen is a reasonable contributor potentially to that and you still have some u s infrastructure long term loans other precious exposures that potentially gets us down there so watch that space we ll sort of come there just to finish up before we get on the 2020 this just shows the in fact the movements in net debt in terms of the typical operational cycle was in fact slightly positive on the right oh boy on the right hand side so we actually this is before noncash leases and a small amount of debt that was assumed in the astron acquisition as well i think there was about 200 million but funds from operations 7 9 billion really 9 billion pre the tax catch up which is almost a working capital type adjustment i spoke about that earlier on we were flat in terms of net acquisitions and disposals last year hopefully we can see some positive movement there which i spoke about earlier on the net cash capex cash i spoke the 5 billion the 5 3 billion of distribution is positive and then you had some noncash 1 3 billion leasing which was the major factor in getting to 17 6 billion where we were at that stage going forward you can see some deleveraging some cash flow potential 5 billion of distribution 5 3 billion last year this year we ve committed to 2 6 billion at the moment cash capex similar levels and hopefully some positive on the acquisition front and still a strong business in terms of cash flow generation so 2020 if we just look at some of that guidance maybe let s if we start on page 18 so there s the production now 2021 22 exactly the same as what we gave 3rd of december no change so we re still comfortable with those numbers there so where do we see some movements 19 to 20 which we spoke about copper and cobalt down on account of mutanda but a cost structure that s improving cash flow business overall improving in the business zinc actually has some strengthening volumes particularly zhairem whilst antamina goes through a stronger zinc period both of those factors start between 21 22 declining because you ve got some parallel mines at kazzinc antamina also normalizes back then you ve got 1 or 2 smaller assets in canada and south america shut in 2022 nickel koniambo should see improvements during this year another 4 000 tonnes there ferrichrome this year around supply management market conditions as to where we are this year coal pretty flat oil does see some reasonable growth out of all the jurisdictions in cameroon equatorial guinea and chad as well so what does that all mean back to the cash flow generation at the moment and the cost structures so copper you can see a declining profile in terms of cost structure 1 20 0 82 that s the same as what we advised a couple of months ago it should see 3 4 billion at current prices being generated within the copper business that does not include additional cobalt sales that are there to be had subject to market price and the likes and drawing capacity that exists down there zinc a slight reduction in cost guidance relative to where we are a little bit by product a little bit currency nickel quite a sharp reduction in price both in actual terms relative to 19 but also against guidance that we gave back in december which was 3 96 down to 3 51 the pgm by product is a major factor but on cobalt out of canada we produce a lot of the rhodium the palladium and the platinum which delivers a benefit relative to december of more than 100 million into the nickel business as well so they will deliver another 0 7 billion and coal 3 2 billion around the spot price at the moment on 135 million tonnes we ve seen costs come down 2 since december 47 down to 45 currencies would play a big part colombia south africa australia low oil prices a little bit as well and the margins of a 74 newcastle which is roughly where it is coking coal has come off has increased a bit 1 60 europe not europe south africa api4 is strong api2 is clearly lagging but across the portfolio we re still well positioned there and then as it all adds up you ve got 12 2 billion of net ebitda at spot prices today generating 4 3 billion of cash flow so still 1 5 more than 1 5x covering the base distribution where we are and the pace of getting some of the targets from the balance sheet and additional capital management is really going to be a function of some of the macros as we go forward i suspect there ll be some questions on that later on so i hand back to ivan ivan glasenberg thanks steve okay what are our 2020 priorities this is the same slide we spoke about in december the important issues the company is focusing on and as i said earlier health and safety is an extremely important issue and peter is spending a lot of time in that and as i say reviewing all our assets and especially the assets where we ve had the fatalities sending in a team to ensure we get 0 fatality throughout the group and a lot of work has been spent on that and hopefully this year we ll reduce it considerably the ramp up development assets as we spoke about in december we got our various ramp up assets to ensure that they deliver and they perform on time and on budget and katanga is a major one the one in africa which is a large asset as we said last year we ended up producing 230 000 tonnes this year we aim to produce 270 000 tonnes of copper and around about 29 000 tonnes of cobalt and it looks like we are on line and we believe we will hit those numbers during this year and we ve had a good start to the year at that asset the mopani smelter restarted has just restarted it s ramping up slowly and also performing well so hopefully we will have a successful commissioning there the asset plant in katanga which should get into operation during the first half of this year is also online on budget so that should perform well and once again the last asset that we ve got in the ramp up phase is koniambo in new caledonia and to ensure that we get operational stability over there and that s the last of our ramp up assets and then hopefully all our assets will be performing well across the group and we won t have any issues at the assets operating efficiency and capital discipline as we ve seen we do have assets which is in the lowest quartile and they re performing well steve gave details how they re going to perform during 2020 and once again to manage the free cash flow of the company in a correct manner strong balance sheet commitment to our bbb investment grade rating and as we said and we emphasized to hit an ebitda net debt to ebitda of 1x and to keep the total net debt 14 billion to 15 billion depending upon the cash flow as this year you saw with the current commodity prices we ll have an ebitda around about 12 2 billion which would generate 4 7 4 6 billion of free cash flow and as we said earlier we ll utilize that for the dividend repayment to reduce the debt down to the 14 billion 15 billion mark underpinning where commodity prices are going to be if there s excess we can continue focusing on more buybacks but once again depending upon where the share price is sitting and how the commodity prices are flowing and whether the cash flow will allow us to continue doing that management we spoke about this in december during this year we will transition to a new management team we ve transitioned most of the divisions to the new management team this is a fourth generation as i mentioned during december a fourth generation of management changes it will continue taking place during this year and we re working on that to ensure that we will have the new management in place as soon as possible confidence stability and consistency through the operation as i said earlier to ensure the assets are performing well balance sheet in good shape return any excess cash to shareholders and be very disciplined on any capital allocation and ensure we re not wasting capital on new assets or expanding assets merely for the sake of increasing volume into the market which could affect the market and not getting the right return for our shareholders so we continue emphasizing to ensure that if there is excess cash in the company it is deployed in the right manner and not just putting assets for the sake of growing the business but if we cannot get the right returns within the business return cash to the shareholders so we ll continue on that program as we have done in the past to ensure we are handing the company in the correct manner so i think that gives you a summary of the results for 2019 and how we see the company going forward so we re open to any questions question and answer session a martin fewings jason ivan glasenberg jason martin jason fairclough sorry steve i wasn t sure if you touched on it now but just in terms of the write downs the 2 8 billion could you just talk us a little bit through that is that a pricing thing or is there something else going on there and just to be clear is that pre or post tax steven kalmin those are post tax numbers so the main i mean if you run through the more material which some of them are pricing impacts some more other events colombian coal is about 1 billion of that circa half across cerrejon and half across prodeco as well that coal is predominantly going into europe historically pricing of api2 it s competing with low gas prices particularly in europe so the overall economics notwithstanding energy mix and the likes that s what s really dented some of the economics and the prospects of getting better value for that product as well so we have taken and particularly longer life assets pricing over a long period of time will have less impact shorter life assets will have a greater impact also in terms of npv so these are not the long life assets like we have in australia and some other operations as well so you re talking 7 years prodeco and then sort of 10 ish or so colombia if you look at the obviously resource base over there so we did take our longer term to api2 prices down i think we give the details on the financials exactly what those assumptions are and that s just across the normal curves would have had that 1 billion or so impact there so that is price related on european competition in terms of prices chad oil there s 500 million or so that was already in the june results as well we have our operating assets on the west side through 3 or 4 different fields they re producing drilling continues fairly straightforward also there we also had some big exploration acreage more on the east side which there is some expiries and continuous processes they need to go to negotiate extend and get those terms the expiration of many of those was during the course of 2019 it was months of discussions and potential sort of negotiations around whether it makes sense to continue to with those projects or on what basis you could continue in the index side with no agreements being reached with the local government so we had to take the full impairment on the whole exploration acreage as well on that side so there was 500 million or so there and then mutanda also something that was done in the august numbers there was 300 million there which was a function of them going into sort of the announced care and maintenance and just what the effect that has on the sort of cash flow profile where you ve stalled on cash and then again long term there wasn t any long term price adjustments that was purely reflecting the sort of pause in business there so those were the main ones martin fewings liam liam fitzpatrick liam fitzpatrick from deutsche two questions on coal firstly on colombia i think you re losing cash at spot prices so how long do you tolerate that before you consider production cuts or something similar and then secondly just on the broader question of a potential spin out is that part of your medium term thinking and if so what would be the potential triggers to that ivan glasenberg yes look colombian coal as you know in glencore if we are still losing cash at any assets we re not going to keep mining if it is cash negative you ve seen what we ve done it before in zinc we ve done it in coal we ve done it in our various operations so we continue assessing prodeco la jagua and calenturitas type operation and if they continue losing cash and we don t see a turnaround in the coal prices which as we said into europe is where the issues occur on api2 yes then we d really got to make a strong decision and see what we do there which we are assessing all the time liam fitzpatrick cerrejon still makes money ivan glasenberg cerrejon makes money no matter cerrejon produces 30 million tonnes so its cash costs are a bit lower it also is contracts are not only into europe where it gets the benefit of the higher pricing so we re carefully monitoring actually what the lng and the gas prices are doing in europe and what effect that s having on the api2 pricing so let s continue reassessing glencore and yes there may have to be some hard decisions made there regarding the coal business right now the coal business continues if there are issues and we re having issues of investors or bankers or people regarding our core business then we got to assess what we do with it but right now it s performing well as you saw the ebitda numbers are good and it continues to remain within our operations and we spoke about liam fitzpatrick and it does decline a little bit ivan glasenberg it declines we spoke about the scope 3 transmissions when the coal is burned in different power stations around the world like all scope 3 around the world ours reduces automatically because our reserves are reducing as steve said colombia by the year 2035 would stop producing both cerrejon and prodeco and therefore we will be reducing our scope 3 emissions projected around about 30 by 2035 south africa also decreases as time goes on the reserve base there australia maintains itself it is the high quality better quality coal so you can continue staying at those levels and we ll continue producing that martin fewings sylvain sylvain brunet quick question maybe on marketing just wondering in the context of disruptions in china whether you have any issues with performance already or if it s too early to say and also in this context if you could talk perhaps to the impact that disruptions in china hiring on the domestic market whether that s creating more opportunities for you to sell into china on coal ivan glasenberg yes the first question a bit too early to say as you know the chinese have just come back from the new year so we re trying to assess what the effect is we haven t had cancellation of shipments we haven t had delays in opening of letters of credits across most of our commodities so nothing really to give a clear answer yet we re closely monitoring it they ve taken an extra week 2 weeks potentially after the holiday period and we ll see what effect that is having on the first quarter consumption so a bit too early to say the second part of your question was about production in china sylvain brunet domestic production yes ivan glasenberg domestic production yes well on coal you know that is the case coal production in china has decreased during the first few weeks of the year and especially since the coronavirus situation so we think that is having a positive effect on the worldwide coal prices because of less production in china and as you know china is one of the largest producers in the world today of coal martin fewings myles myles allsop myles allsop ubs maybe a few quick questions first of all on katanga in the drying capacity how much cobalt would you be able to sell this year and when does the drying capacity get up to fully invested and fully operational steven kalmin it should be through q2 they gave also their release on last week or so where they sort of showed the full capacity reaching because they have 2 drying units one sort of came back still needing some work eventually then there was a bigger job done on 2 2 5 that one is sort of for a month or two is back up but they should be full dry capacity in q2 which will allow for both drying of existing production and clearly catching up on some of the areas as well which one so they can sell more than they produce this year they will have both the capacity and logistics to be able to do that myles allsop okay but we re working on the assumption that you sell what you produce this year and you came steven kalmin that s what we ve effectively worked on in terms of the overall sort of cost guidance and ebitda generation that we give in the copper business at sort of 1 20 katanga itself doesn t specifically give any guidance themselves at a granular level around their level they just talk about production guidance of the 27 000 tonnes plus minus 2000 sales will be a function of just getting up and running myles allsop and with the drc and the new mining code where about the discussions it seems that it s all gone very quiet are we into a period of acceptance now and you just have to live in this new slightly higher tax regime or is there sort of potential pushback there ivan glasenberg look right now it s not a matter of acceptance we continue talking to the government about the new mining code we are paying the higher royalty today and the ops structure we re not agreeing to it so we are stating that it s not under acceptance we still have the old mining code it has a stability agreement in it we re still backing by that but we continue discussions with the government around it and we ll see how we progress but it s not an acceptance of the new mining code yet myles allsop do you feel the political backdrop now is a lot more stable than sort of 12 18 months ago ivan glasenberg it seems okay we ve been dealing with the government on various issues so we continue dealing with them there is stability in the country you don t see any major issues in the country so it looks okay myles allsop another couple of very quick questions just with the capital management should we assume that you can turn it on out of cycle so if you get to your target net debt range tomorrow we could see an announcement a day after in theory that we re going to have excess cash returned to shareholders that s the way steven kalmin yes i mean we have announced buybacks outside of cycles in the past so that possibility in theory clearly it does exist ivan glasenberg yes we can do it any time but you ve got to focus on two things number one okay what the commodity price is what we assume is going to stay going forward are we going to get the 12 2 billion or maybe get a 15 billion ebitda how much cash generated net and then it depends where the share price is sitting again steven kalmin it would be unusual to do it outside of the financial cycles but it s theoretically possible myles allsop and then just on agri you re saying how well it s doing and in the past you maybe spun it out stake you talked about driving consolidation within that space i mean is that very much off the cards at the moment because of the focus on the balance sheet or are those sort of opportunities still in the air and a real possibility ivan glasenberg the agri business the balance sheet is okay within the agri business you also know we have strong partners there so we will it s always been an idea to continue to try consolidate that industry and try to grow that business so they continue to look at opportunities around the world myles allsop so you could do it without injecting any additional cash out ivan glasenberg subject to the type of deal that has to be done martin fewings tony anthony robson tony robson global mining research lng products marketing did well in 2019 could you go into a little few more details there and would you roughly see the split up between metals and energy for marketing similar in 2020 roughly as 2019 steven kalmin well i would say for 20 maybe energy comes off a bit and minerals goes up a bit because you won t have a repeat of the sort of cobalt obviously on the metal side which was a major headwind in the first half slightly less for the full year but it was a negative that we d expect positive this year so that s just on that and on the energy side yes i mean oil did have a sort of a standout year how repeatable that is obviously it remains to be seen but you could have energy coming up a bit with mining but it s very well broad and diversified across the businesses ivan glasenberg the diversity of the different commodities within glencore and the trading business and having the oil it moves around you saw as steve says last year cobalt suffered but the other commodities didn t perform too badly and all performed exceptional well too early to say how it s going to do this year the first month has been relatively good all commodities kicked in nicely during the first months in the trading business so we ll wait and see but as you can see we re always pretty strong since we ve been public we ve used that 2 2 billion to 3 2 billion range and as we ve always said the marketing business is extremely resilient no matter what the movement in the commodity prices martin fewings sergey yes sergey donskoy sergey donskoy socgen two questions from me one on this comment that you made at the very beginning about reducing coal production by 30 by 2035 to meet scope 3 emissions target so far as i understand about half of that will be met through depletion of resources in colombia but the other part is obviously south africa and the question here is this to which extent is your firm commitment and to which extent it s a reflection of the weak price environment and whether you can kind of review this target going forward if the situation improves that s my first question ivan glasenberg yes it s not to do with the weak price environment we re just depleting the reserves reserve base is so much it comes to an end prodeco calenturitas and la jagua comes to the end of its life cerrejon comes to the end of its life i think it s around about 2032 or something like that it also gets to the end of the life you ve depleted the reserves south africa also depletes part of reserve so there s not much you can do about it those are the facts we re going to projecting scope 3 emissions reduction by 30 by the year 2035 steven kalmin so again there s also sorry there s also the oil business that contributes currently and that sort of also goes from where it is to ivan glasenberg and depletes down steven kalmin to almost being done by that so the coal profile is i mean don t assume just take 30 colombia this and try and sort of back solve where it is there s a whole sergey donskoy in south africa in theory at least you can invest in virgin resources but basically you can develop new mines ivan glasenberg can invest in sorry sergey donskoy in new resources you can develop new mines and access new resources quite easily in principle ivan glasenberg on our existing reserve structure to maintain those levels is utilizing our existing reserves in the country now the question do we do you want to you could buy more et cetera but we re also limited to a 150 million tonne cap so the way we see it is what we got what we wish to expand what we wish to do looking across our reserve base et cetera we will reduce scope 3 emissions our projected number is 30 by 2035 sergey donskoy and my second question is on marketing division performance especially metals and minerals the second half number speaking of ebitda was a very big improvement on the first half but that was partly because the first half was affected by one offs if we add back those one offs the increase was about i think 8 half on half and at current levels ebitda from metals and minerals remains and my number is about 15 20 below the average over the last 3 4 years is this a reflection of some structural issues some headwinds in this particular division that may prevent it from achieving those high levels it enjoyed before steven kalmin i mean no there s nothing there s certainly nothing structural it s had some very good years in the past which then become sort of high sort of above average performance so there s definitely been some of those years but there s nothing structural that s reset kind of what we d expect in a normal year or would prevent it from getting back up to those levels but cobalt as you said was the major sort of noncash one off in the first half the 350 million and but if i look across i mean the given sort of south africa ferrochrome that market was tough second half so they would have been sort of below average but no reason that s not structural that gets back up and running at some point so things like your chrome manganese vanadium was below average i would say second half so that can have improvements going forward in terms of singling out ivan glasenberg we ve always said higher commodity prices there s more margin in the business there are more arbitrage opportunities markets are tighter so you re talking historically where we ve been high we had higher commodity prices so it s been a bit tougher while we got this lower commodity prices but as i ve always said the marketing business is pretty resilient even with these lower prices but we ve always said we performed better during higher prices and we re more towards the 3 2 billion as opposed 2 2 billion during higher commodity prices with better arbitrage opportunities markets are a bit tighter sergey donskoy and my last very small question current pretty high gap price gap between south african and australian coal how do you rationalize it it didn t exist historically ivan glasenberg yes i think a lot of it because demand for south african coal is moving towards india bangladesh pakistan and i don t know the exact figure off my head but i think around about 75 of south africa s coal is going to those 3 regions so it s getting that advantage the quality of coal that s required is south african and the lower top quality coal is going into some of those areas so that s i think the reason why you got there so south africa today on spot i think is pricing at around about 88 australia is pricing at about newcastle around about 76 but it s because of the demand for that particular coal in india pakistan bangladesh where south africa s coal is relatively tough you also remember steven kalmin and its supply is constrained south africa s supply is constrained ivan glasenberg and supply is also tight where south africa is exporting around about 73 million tonnes of coal today i think around about that figure and there s no big growth so supply is extremely tight eskom okay is taking a bit less than they re used to in south africa but you ve got certain mines going into eskom export is limited depleting coal reserves once again at various mines in south africa and australia is towards around about closer towards the 200 million tonnes and going into other markets they re not going into that particular market where south africa is getting the advantage martin fewings tyler tyler broda it s tyler broda from rbc two questions from me the first one just on mutanda i guess the cobalt market remains quite oversupplied but you re seeing a lot of demand from potential buyers over time to come in i guess my question would be just in terms of the sulphides project in mutanda when do we expect to see more from that and sort of what would be the timings around bringing that back online and then secondly for steve the we ve seen a big drop in shipping rates over the last few weeks i guess from both an ifrs lease perspective as well as just the marketing business in general could you just kind of walk through how that could potentially affect the profitability ivan glasenberg okay on the first one mutanda as we said we now got it on care and maintenance we re assessing the sulphide peter and his team are working on that it s going to take a bit of time to assess when we could start it up how profitable it would be it also depends the mining code also affects mutanda where we will be sitting on the mining code at the time we do start up and whether that what effect that will have whether we re sitting on the old code or the new code so those are issues we ve got to look at how in sulphide how we re going to process it et cetera so we re looking at various options here but and then i think personally you should take at least 18 months to 2 years before we really could decide whether we get that up and run again however if there is an oversupply in the cobalt market and we believe the world does not need it just yet you re then talking 2022 we got to assess how the electric vehicle battery industry is performing and how much is required into the market at that time i think we re talking today can t remember the exact number around about 37 000 tonnes of cobalt utilized in that area and how does that grow we ve got to monitor that closely and then we ll decide but as you know with glencore we re not going to put a product into a market that is already oversupplied that would have a negative effect on the pricing so we ll assess that very carefully steven kalmin shipping these are very short term contracts that we obviously have that is just a new way of presenting them we ve always had sort of time charters and leases that gets consumed generally within our own business and shipping our own products so it s not a material part of the business so you would there s no big length in shipping that you do worse because prices go up or if prices go up and freight rates that you would it s a small part of just securing the logistics that we need to be able to run the business so no material impact on the business martin fewings ephrem ephrem ravi two quick questions first on the portfolio mix adjustment for coal your assumption has come down from around 10 per tonne at the december stage to around 5 per tonne on 135 million tonnes about 1 billion of incremental ebitda so it s big i understand it does not include the japanese fiscal year assumptions because those contracts are still being negotiated given the spike in coal prices because of the coronavirus impact do you think there is further upside to those portfolio mix adjustment numbers if the japanese fiscal year contracts are now to be better that s one secondly on the ferroalloys business which was a disappointment last year vanadium and ferrochrome prices are both showing signs of life is there a volume upside to be expected this year versus your guidance or is it just going to be price that s going to drive the upside if things get better steven kalmin okay the portfolio mix we do build into that portfolio mix some assumption of that certain percentage of our coal is going to get contracted under the jpu benchmark and what premium that we think is reasonable in the assumption we ll then obviously throughout the year we ll then roll it into actuals rather than a guidance so whether it s sort of historical premiums that we expect for x number of tonnes relative to a sort of a newcastle benchmark i don t know the exact numbers but we sort of i don t know what the premiums are but we build in a normal and then either we will beat that or we will not beat it and then we will come in june or before and we ll either shrink or expand that portfolio adjustment based on that percentage of the tonnes it s not as material across the portfolio maybe as it once was obviously at some point it just locks in your price but in terms of the size of those tonnes it s not quite as material as it once was obviously the strength in the api4 the south african back to that question that was asked earlier on that s also narrowed that gap because it s all pegged off a newcastle historically there would have been a discount in fact there s a premium in that so it s contributing positively and you ve seen also a pickup on the met side which feeds into the portfolio you ve seen 10 sort of it was 1 50 or so through january you ve seen pickups to 1 60 so it s early days in the coal world there can be sort of evolutions but we do try and call it the way we see it at a particular point in time and provide that sort of guidance at sort of 3 2 billion and there s a lot of real estate between now and ivan glasenberg but moving parts in the japanese negotiation we ve got a few different time frames we ve set them steven kalmin the last couple of weeks has been positive on the coal side ivan glasenberg positive and we ll see with the coronavirus exactly what effect it has on the chinese coal production so it s daily monitoring steven kalmin on the ferrochrome side i would say i mean i wouldn t expect a volume upside necessarily pricing wise hopefully given there has been a little as you said pickup on the european side if anything we need to get through the rustenburg process because we had assumed obviously some tonnage coming out at the rustenburg smelters 1 of 4 or 5 complexes that we have down there we announced i think 4 to 6 weeks ago a consultation period effectively around that because it s been losing money and it s the most expensive and has been the most impacted by inflation high prices and the like it s not sustainable it hasn t been producing but its capacity is 250 000 300 000 or so so it s and we had assumed an overall portfolio production wise that included some rustenburg value so let s see where that obviously proceeds but the business particularly that smelter and generally needs to see high prices martin fewings sandeep sandeep peety this is sandeep from morgan stanley i have a question on depreciation it has increased to 7 1 billion versus 6 3 billion last year a delta of 700 million to 800 million so is that a normal run rate that we should think for next few years and then secondly on free cash flow can you give a breakdown of what was free cash flow on marketing and what was for industrial because you used to have a slide in prior presentations steven kalmin yes the depreciation so part of the leasing would have increased depreciation relative to the historical as we ve said we ve added that 1 3 billion of leases these are fairly short term profiles so there s sort of 300 million to 400 million in depreciation just on the leasing change relative to what was what standards applied in the previous years and then it would be just the general commissioning of these various projects and these new expansions so there d be more depreciation as in the oil side and the drilling there d be just assessment of mine lives new projects koniambo now depreciating that previously was all getting capitalized as that sort of production katanga now with the ramp up as it sort of keeps expanding through its 150 235 270 this year its depreciation unit of production at space is quite correlated with that production so you d find these 200 to 300 out of the african portfolio as well would be accounting for that so if you look at it asset for asset wise you would see that it makes sense across the different expansions and where the maturity profile of those assets are but it should be given production levels now i would imagine it should be fairly stable at those sort of levels free cash flow from marketing well i mean 2 4 billion ebit tax across that business we ve always said sort of circa 10 is what the blend would be across the different jurisdictions primarily switzerland obviously the biggest buyer country model there that s circa 10 u s singapore various other places 10 is a reasonable average across the marketing so it just comes down to the interest side and we haven t got that specific number here but i think we might have we can look to reintroduce that in some of the disclosures going forward if it s useful information again rather than a consolidated view i know we did in the past martin fewings grant grant sporre it s a couple of follow up questions first of all on the m a front i mean there is potentially a neighbor within the hunter valley up for sale mount isa is super compelling in terms of industrial kind of synergies potentially as well as marketing synergies and so on i mean are you going to continue to be nimble flexible innovative and see through ways to capture that without meaningfully increasing coal exposure obviously improving the quality of the coal portfolio ivan glasenberg we always look to increase the to capitalize on opportunities but we will have to live within the bands and the commitments we have so as you say we could dispose of things we ve got various assets we could dispose or do something with but something is going to be very compelling for us to look at it there s going to be a lot of synergies you got to give us the right returns et cetera so people are looking at potentially selling assets we re not doing the same as i say we are just purely depleting and we re reducing we re not selling an asset to get rid of our scope 3 emissions but if there s opportunities there we ll look at it but we ll still stay within our limits grant sporre is mount isa from a geographical perspective as good as hvo in terms of ivan glasenberg we cannot comment on that i cannot comment grant sporre and then maybe the second question last question just thinking about succession planning can you remind us what you re looking for have you found any mini mes in the any clones in the ranks and timing and so on ivan glasenberg we always said the board is looking at various individuals throughout the group we ve always said that will be internal there are a lot of internal members within the group who could take over but as i say we ve got to get first in place as i said the fourth generation in place and then we ll move on the last leg martin fewings and jason ivan glasenberg you can ask the chairman yes steven kalmin you have the chairman s list the chairman of the nom committee ivan glasenberg yes jason fairclough just to follow up on it s jason fairclough the to push you a little bit on this i mean why wouldn t you consider external and i guess beyond that where are the guys because when you the new generation used to bring everybody along ivan glasenberg they re working they re working working for the company they re making us money to ensure they re ready for the job jason fairclough proving themselves ivan glasenberg proving themselves if they sit they re not doing much so what were you saying about why not external jason fairclough why not external ivan glasenberg i think we ve got such great internal candidates they ve been with us for many years names have been thrown around and naturally there s someone great out there who could run this company better than the internal guys of course we would have to look at that but right now we think there s such a good bench of internal guys who could take the position definitely i very much doubt if there s anyone better than them outside the company who can run this company better in the future they ve been in this company 20 25 years most of those individuals names have been thrown around they know the company they know the culture of the company they know how this company operates so i think they ll be great for the future of this

thank you
the federal open market committee is meeting today there is a lot to unpack here but let s get one thing straight this is a completely unnecessary rate cut one that is motivated by political expediency not economic needs it is reckless it is irresponsible and it dramatically increases the possibility of another 2008 09 like disaster of all the norms which trump as president of the united states has violated perhaps the single most dangerous one is his politicization of the federal reserve the ramifications are significant potential for long lasting economic damage is getting ratcheted up and the institution of the federal reserve is being damaged do i have your attention yet good because there is a lot more to discuss let s start with the obvious ask yourself why does the greatest economy ever with a 3 8 unemployment rate and 21 54 million new jobs created since january 2010 when the recession ended even need a rate cut there are very few legitimate reasons to cut rates from the low effective federal funds rate of 2 38 some argue underemployment is a reason others say its insurance against an ordinary recession still others say it is needed to reduce the strength of the us dollar to which i call bullshit none of those are persuasive and all of those must be weighed against a basic understanding of what we just lived through a mere decade ago in the financial crisis it had numerous drivers but the entire crisis can trace its roots back to the ultra low rates of the greenspan fed they took rates under 2 for 3 years to 1 for a full year that kicked off a massive inflationary spiral in everything priced in dollars or credit dropping rates raises the risk of a repeat of that disaster that s why the fed had been on the path to normalizing rates the past 24 months avoiding a repeat gfc is why the fed has been moving away from zirp the fed remains on emergency footing and normalizing their monetary posture has been their primary motivation the past few years perhaps you can claim the fed should move more slowly on quantitative tightening e g the unwind of qe but that is trimming the tabs and not much more the more compelling reason for cutting rates is obvious the presidential election next year that is why potus has been jawboning the federal reserve vociferously it an assault on the independence of the central bank unprecedented in modern history 43 of global bonds ex us trade at negative yields source torsten sløk deutsche bank securities as the nearby chart shows global markets don t appear to need a rate cut torsten sløk of deutsche bank securities explains excluding us treasuries us corporate bonds mbs cmbs and abs shows that 43 of the global ex us ig index is trading at negative yields at the moment up from 20 late last year see chart below with this backdrop it is not a surprise if real money investors in europe japan and asia show renewed interest in buying us credit in particular when the fed at the same time is cutting short rates and thereby lowering hedging costs for foreigners buying us fixed income which brings us back to the political motivations of today s rate cut recall trump complained earlier in the recovery that then fed chair janet yellen should be ashamed of low rates and that the fed has created a false stock market now with the economy much further recovered unemployment lower and inflation higher he demands those low shameful rates hold trump s hypocrisy aside and recognize his modus operandi he may be a terrible long term strategist but as we have seen over the past 5 years he is a brilliant short term tactician the tax cuts he passed and now these lower rates both create great very short term results the problem is they are sugar highs that leave you worse off then when you began he will be gone in either 2 or 6 years and the clean up will be someone else s problem that s his mo and the damage he will have wrought will take a generation to repair never give in to blackmailers on the false belief that the first payment makes them go away update 1 july 31 2019 12 55 pm i see a few others have said similar things update 2 july 31 2019 4pm bloomberg

with me i have been humbled on my entire trip by the astounding warmth and the generosity of all the people of africa and especially here in ethiopia it s great to be here i just left a amazing discussion with some really awesome entrepreneurs and business leaders and i hear we ve got a few more of you in the audience today i m a former entrepreneur i love what you do i love risk takers i love those people who are willing to go out and just crush it every day with us here today are three very special ladies azalech tesfaye is right here she has a coffee business that employs 50 people

here today thank you for joining us applause also with us is meseret warner very nice to see you it was wonderful to meet you this morning she is developing a crowd funding platform to channel capital from the united states to businesses in ethiopia and throughout africa don t take all of our capital all right best of luck to you we at the state department are proud that ethiopian chapter president of the africa women s entrepreneurship program is here and then we also have samrawit fikru she s with us as well she founded ride ethiopia s version of uber she s created jobs for more than 11 000

leadership program let s give all of these amazing entrepreneurs one more big round of applause congratulations to you applause stories like this success stories entrepreneur stories like this remind me of america s founding too these aren t just feel good moments they define a nation s future these entrepreneurial activities will define africa s future too we believe that in the united states i believe that i believe as i know most of you do too that every human being african european american you name it wants similar things we want basic security for our families we want opportunity and reward for the hard work that we invest in and we want the freedom to do whatever we want to do wit h our own lives it s how we get there that matters an awful lot i m here today about to talk to you about a couple of things most importantly i want to talk about the next liberation economic liberation a true liberation for africa s entrepreneurs i ll talk about this briefly then i m going to take questions from vera look for starters i think we can all agree that the poverty rate in many african countries remains way too high and while effective foreign aid can help to alleviate the problem it s very unlikely that it will solve it we see this in places all across the world even in america government spending often can t attack the very basis of the problem centralized planning hasn t worked look at the failed socialist experiments of years past in zimbabwe in tanzania and right here in ethiopia even now even as we stand here today south africa is debating an amendment to permit the expropriation of private property without compensation that would be disastrous for that economy and most importantly for the south african people socialist schemes haven t economically liberated this continent s poorest people but we all everyone in this room everyone in this room know the right way forward basic strong rule of law respect for property rights regulation that encourages investment we talked about that with these entrepreneurs this morning you need to get the basic laws right so that investors can come and invest their capital we also need women s full participation in this economic liberation and we need governments that respect their own people these are the fundamental ingredients for true and inclusive sustainable economic liberation we all know the history of the asian tigers the asian tigers lifted themselves up in a span of just a few decades because they liberalized and they opened for trade that can happen right here too and indeed i would argue that it must more than 60 percent of the population in africa is under the age of 25 only nations hospitable to the private sector will stimulate enough growth enough opportunity enough resources enough capital that will deliver jobs and prosperity on the scale that this continent needs and over the timeframe that it requires and to african leaders today future generations are depending on stable corruption free environments that attract foreign investment as the ethiopian proverb says a partner in business will not put an obstacle to it indeed some countries have already taken steps to enhance freedom for entrepreneurs rwanda has exempted small and medium sized businesses from certain taxes it slashed construction spending several times and it s upgraded its power grid togo has knocked down similar bureaucratic hurdles on fees wait times permitting and other impediments for business owners on a broader scale i just came from angola where president lorenco and his team are courageously turning the page on corruption and are privatizing hundreds of state owned businesses and right here in ethiopia right here in ethiopia citizens pushed for change prime minister abiy s bold reforms stimulate private sector growth that can help set the tone for the entire continent none of this is easy if it was easy it would have happened long ago the united states recognizes this but it s moral and it s right and it s necessary there is nothing more noble than allowing our people to have the dignity of work and the united states you should know everyone we believe in you and we ll be with you every step of the way with the right policies and leadership we believe that true economic liberation will happen here in africa if you will all focus on the basics if you ll get it right if you ll get transparency right good governance right american businesses will come we ve been in africa for an awfully long time more capital will flow just these last few days in senegal we signed an agreement where bechtel america s one of america s finest engineering companies will build a road from dakar to st louis transforming infrastructure and creating opportunities i was proud to be part of the signing ceremony there in dakar along with the signing of four other major agreements with american businesses that are going to invest in senegal and in the senegalese people in angola chevron and others are exploring offshore natural gas fields bringing jobs and economic growth right along with them when american capital comes it hires local here in ethiopia coca cola is expanding a new 300 million investment and companies like fedex and citibank are exploring new opportunities as well as for the american government the trump administration wants these trade ties to continue and to expand we re committed to it if there s one thing you should know about our president my boss you should know that he loves deals he wants more to happen he wants more to happen between the united states and nations all across africa that s why the united states launched our new development finance corporation i m sure i ll get a chance to talk more about this with vera it s now just one month old but it s well resourced well funded and well structured the goal is very simple the goal is to catalyze private sector investment in developing countries focusing heavily on priority areas like agriculture like energy and infrastructure sixty billion dollars of capacity 60 billion of finance capacity it will help here in africa and there s more the u s under president trump launched prosper africa the prosper africa initiative which is opening opportunities for businesses on both sides of the ocean we are pushing forward too the w gdp program with the goal of economically empowering at least 50 million women by 2025 we expect more than half of those women to be right here in africa usaid one of our traditional assistance mechanisms is integrating the private sector into its core development work in ways that it s never done before we support the african continental free trade area and we remain committed to our partnership with the african union look not every nation doing business in africa from outside the continent adopts the american model of partnership countries should be wary of authoritarian regimes with empty promises they breed corruption dependency they don t hire the local people they don t train they don t lead them they run the risk that the prosperity and sovereignty and progress that africa so needs and desperately wants won t happen real simple the united states stands for local jobs environmental responsibility honest business practices high quality work and mutual prosperity don t take my word for it look at the facts look at the history we stand for true partnership true economic liberation i want to save plenty of time to have a conversation with vera today so i ll close up quickly so many of you here today i can see from all walks of like we ve got entrepreneurs political leaders media voices i ve got a group of alumni from state department programs you you are the forces that will ensure that those with power who promise liberation understand what that truly means hold onto that true economic liberation delivered the greatest economic growth in human history in the united states of america it can do the same for you my country will proudly walk that path in partnership with you i look forward to our conversation today and may god bless all of you may god bless ethiopia and god bless all of the people of africa thank you applause dr songwe thank you thank you so much for that brilliant speech can we give the secretary another round of applause applause secretary pompeo thank you dr songwe thank you for saving the time for questions we have three or four for you so hopefully you can take them secretary pompeo great i ll answer almost anything laughter dr songwe that s a great inaudible i want to start you have mentioned some of it in your speech already but this is one of your first trips to africa you picked three very interesting countries senegal angola and ethiopia why the choice of countries secretary pompeo so yeah i ve been to africa a handful of times before it s the first time i ve had the chance to be here as the secretary of state the three countries i chose were all at unique moments in their own development history very different different cultures different parts of africa different histories but in each case too with real leaders who are prepared to do the right things to help their countries move forward and when i say real leaders that certainly includes political leaders but it s broader and deeper than that it s the wellspring of the population who s demanding these changes these transformations whether that s in senegal or angola or here i can see it i can feel it i can hear it leaders in the business community leaders in the entrepreneurship world finance leaders nongovernmental organizations who understand that the things that have been done in these countries in the past didn t deliver the outcomes that these people so richly deserve and are determined to push back where there were problems with corruption are determined to deliver these outcomes and are prepared to take real risk to get these fantastic outcomes for their own people and so that s why we went to each of these three places it s been fascinating to see and get to meet and get a glimpse into what s really going on there and i leave here even more optimistic than i came dr songwe wonderful we can feel the energy as you answer the question my second question is linked a little bit to the u s announcement that it will be reducing military aid on the continent and i think it s linked to the fact that you re also increasing economic aid but on the military side you went to west point west point i think for those in the military field is the harvard of the academics secretary pompeo i ll tell the team back there that you said that they ll be very proud of that dr songwe free publicity for west point secretary pompeo exactly dr songwe but i think on the continent we do need peace to have development we do need peace for security and so the question is is it possible that we have the u s work with africa to build a west point on the continent so that we can do exactly what you have done is bring more technology the transfer the knowledge but have the peace builders here with american support is this something that we ll someday we have a west point of africa with u s support secretary pompeo i don t know if that s exactly the right model here but your point is very very well taken two things to say one we are we re constantly the united states has military all across the world we are constantly reviewing our structure are we delivering value are we really increasing security is the model we had for the last 10 or 20 or 30 years working and so we re looking at that we re looking at africa we re looking at other places in the world as well we ll complete the review we ll work it out there won t be big surprises we will work along i ll say this i appreciate as someone who was the director of the central intelligence agency i understand the risks and the inaudible what goes in libya i know what s happening in the lake chad region and i see the challenges from al shabaab in somalia and inaudible in ethiopia we ll be inaudible to provide what the support that is needed your point is very well taken too whether it s a west point or training at our institutions in the united states or training at other western militaries to make sure that that technology and importantly with security leadership and intelligence sharing are really the bedrocks of our capacity to deliver i said this in my remarks yesterday or the day before in the end african security will be generated by africans we have the responsibility and we have the capacity to help african nations to do that to build up their own forces to build up their own capacity your point s very well taken if we can t get security right these economic opportunities will be much more difficult to come by dr songwe thank you secretary i see that you re continuously thinking about the idea so we will come back to that it is an important point for us on the continent moving to that you talked a little bit and with a lot of passion you have yourself started two businesses so you know exactly secretary pompeo i started three but i don t talk about the one that failed laughter dr songwe inaudible says we should talk about that one too so you know better than most what it means to start a business what it means to live and do business in a liberated economic environment as you look at the continent we just had pimco here last week at the economic commission for africa trying exactly to crowd in u s business more into onto the continent what are the two or three things first as a businessman and then as a policy maker that you think american business will be looking for so that we can crowd them in of course the buildout is going to be particularly important because it will help leverage that business but we do need real capital coming in and what do you think when you go you can say to u s businesses about africa and what can you say to our leaders about what u s business is looking for in africa secretary pompeo yeah look i think you all know this there s a handful of things that american businesses want they want to know that their investment if it fails it s because they had a bad business model not because of political risk that s attached to it they want to know that there s a rule of law and the capacity for dispute resolution in a way that s fair and equitable equally importantly for american business especially we need educated talented workforce when these american businesses come they want to hire the best and brightest from senegal from angola from ethiopia from whatever they re investing they want to hire the best and the brightest they need a workforce trained skilled the people that i ve met on my trip i am very confident you all will get there it s got to be scaled up right we ve got tens and tens of millions of jobs to create and we need to make sure that the workforce has the skillset that matches what these american companies will want and then the third thing and i say this often you should all know when american businesses are thinking about coming to someplace they ll call the state department and say tell me about it tell me about what s going to what i m going to see when i get there the most important thing that they ll do is they ll call their buddies look all they ll call is they ll call those who came to that place before and say what was your experience like what were the people like how was it and so it is very important for african countries to be responsive to and nurture those businesses that are already here so that there are models for success there are pathways that can be chartered it will take down that risk enormously and so not only will you see capital we talk about capital coming but you ll see capital that is affordable that is the cost of capital whether it s a bond fund or a leveraged financial institution or angel investor or a private equity fund the rate of return that they ll demand turns on the risk that they perceive and so demonstrating a capability to create opportunity not certainly not guarantees american companies are perfectly prepared to take risk but know that they ll be able to identify those risks measure them and that they won t have surprises from political outcomes that they simply can t deal with and control dr songwe thank you very much and the risk adjusted rate of return on the continent is 8 percent in the u s now it s 1 percent so this is the secretary pompeo it s much less than that yes exactly dr songwe exactly so we hope that they can come and we hope that you will be one of those ambassadors i want to ask a question on something that you worked in a few years back you were not yet secretary of state that was on information financial transparency one of the things that the continent is suffering from and a lot of our investments on the continent would still be public investment and public capital however because of illicit financial flows and corruption we tend to see a lot of our resources going out of the continent in 2016 or thereabouts you actually talked about creating a more sort of financial transparency index so that we could track the resources you have gone to three countries that they re working very hard on trying to ensure that they can forestall corruption and track resources what do you say and how can the u s with your experience help us to improve this fight on illicit financial flows we do need to stem it at some point secretary pompeo this is too i potentially should have mentioned but it s really not something that businesses think about it s about institutions governments places like this that you all work so diligently on it s a thing that america thinks about a lot we want to make sure that we understand where cash is going this is a significant economic factor but it s also a massive security factor too because these go to drugs and trade drug trading and narcotrafficking and trafficking in persons some of the most horrific things that happen in our world if we can find where the money is going we can stem it and reduce that risk so the united states is committed to the international processes that are connected as you see with the financial action task force you see how our global institutions the imf and the world bank always put at the center of their programs transparency and accountability not only for the host nation that they re supporting but they want it in the private sector the commercial sector that they re working in as well i think the world has made progress i frankly think africa has made progress as well the leaders that i spoke with in every country all took on board the desperate they need they had to control that illicit financing they see it they see that it escapes their capacity to control they know that it s bad for their people that it deteriorates from their tax base to generate even further opportunity for their people each of those negative ramifications are serious matters we re committed to that we will we will come to countries when we provide foreign assistance and we ll often come with technical help in addition to the resources the money we ll embed members of our team in financial institutions or in central banks or in other governing agencies law enforcement the equivalent of our justice department who work on these illicit cashflows or finance ministries we ll put our people our technical knowhow these are complicated issues they are international issues they extend far beyond the borders of any one country we collectively have to get it right i spent a lot of time when i was the cia director working on the information side of that to make sure that the data set was available i haven t spent as much time working on the regulatory piece of it but i know the united states is committed to that and it s important to get right here i africa dr songwe the african union and all of the african heads of states believe that without this sort of attacking this kind of corruption and illicit financial flows we will never be able to meet the taking of action which is the scale but the taking of action must happen with women you started your conversation recognizing i think very brilliant ethiopian businesswomen so it s women and it s business and i m sure that we all agree that we cannot move this continent forward without the women the u s has been very forward looking in terms of supporting women business and women entrepreneurs what is the message to africa s women as you leave and you see last week we just launched the african women s leadership fund which is a fund not a sort of supporting women business with the idea of supporting and hopefully getting a lot more billions to women businesses and we know that the u s is working on that and you have been yourself a passionate inaudible secretary pompeo yeah no i do i care about it for multiple reasons my wife is sitting to my right who was a banker who helped provide capital to people in south central kansas rural parts of kansas so we know the challenges that women often face we re committed to this we re committed to all across the world empowering women in multiple ways so we first begin with getting the baseline right to make sure that there aren t legal prohibitions right there aren t barriers legal barriers that prevent women some countries still have those and then we go attack the history because women didn t don t start from the same basis oftentimes there are cultural barriers in many countries and then there s just the simple fact that women have historically taken on a lot of roles where they didn t participate in the economic lives of their nations and so across each of those various pillars we re working hard to make sure that women like these have every opportunity they can some of them are going to fail and many many of them will keep at it and they will ultimately succeed they will drive enormous success for themselves for their families for their community and for their country if we don t get this part right if we don t give a hundred percent of the people in every country this chance to go live their dream and use their minds for the betterment of their community for their country we will leave enormous amount of the opportunity on the table so it s something that the united states is very focused on we ll try and drive it programmatically we ll try and drive it through our commercial programs as well collectively if we can get this right we will take growth from wherever it would have been absent then to multiples of that dr songwe thank you very much we also know that madam pompeo is a strong and avid supporter of women and men in politics because you re here with us so we hope that she can also support those women in politics agenda final question this is your last stop before you leave the continent tomorrow the g20 ministers of finance and governors will be meeting to talk about the state of the world what is the message from africa that you will send to them secretary pompeo there is enormous opportunity not only for africa here but for the world it is a continent that is growing it is a continent that has been behind the power curve in its capacity to achieve all of its opportunity not only the economic opportunity that we have spoken to opportunities for religious freedom opportunities for all of the things that humanity cares so deeply about i would urge them to recommit to this it will have massive economic benefits to places like the united states of america if we get this right the young women that i was with this morning were all exporting to our country what does that mean that means that someone in america decided that there was a value proposition to purchase that product that was made right here in ethiopia the seller benefitted here in ethiopia and that american consumer benefitted as well that trade that commerce that opportunity will benefit our entire world we need to get it right here as well and when we do that it s mutually reinforcing too economic growth and security are mutually reinforcing if we get the economic piece of this right the fewer folks that decide that they want to go create unrest cause trouble create problems for nations so we ve got to get them both right i hope those ministers will all take seriously what i saw on my three visits here in africa dr songwe wonderful thank you very much recommit to africa there is value here is the message from secretary pompeo secretary pompeo amen dr songwe to africa and to the rest of the world thank you so much for being with us and thanks for the proposition secretary pompeo vera thank you thank you all applause
