an introduction to capital control in china for the small medium business owner frank hepworth follow 14 min read dec 9 2019 listen share by frank hepworth and siyang samuel li this short article provides a practical introduction on the foreign exchange environment for those smaller non chinese entrepreneurs who are considering or have just begun operating in china this has been originally written for shekou daily a helpful publication for expatriates operating in shenzhen guangdong china this introduction has been arranged into a china s capital account flow pathways for transactions relevant for the debt equity markets available and inbound outbound direct investment b china s current account relevant for standard business transactions like receiving payment from sale of goods abroad and issuing remittances and c a note on new financial policy and the inbound digital currency electronic payment dcep state backed cryptocurrency for the small medium sized entity receiving funding from abroad is priority and so the capital account garners larger discussion in order to find some sense of peace with china s systems of capital movement a rough knowledge on the policy is necessary and a grasp on the detailed practical regulation is ideal of course though even a masterful familiarity does not lend itself much to making the reality of uncomfortable financing delays any more bearable a common story the small foreign entity operating in china does not receive payment from a chinese supplier in time and has no cash to pay its manufacturing labour the unprepared subsidiary is left staring down administrative penalties while it waits anxiously for banks to process and exchange overseas financial assistance it may or may not arrive in time before the whole supply chain is bunged up these situations arise because in china entities must comply with a restricted capital account policy money cannot be freely moved into or out of the country a restricted capital account policy is the application of capital account controls on the flow of money that enters and exits the country a capital control is any policy designed to limit or redirect capital account transactions in this context a capital account transaction is a transaction that affects china s accounted foreign assets and liabilities generally these controls come in the form of rules taxes or fees that discriminate between domestic residents and those outside the country every country utilizes capital controls of this sort and even the strong use of capital controls is by no means unique to china the european union did in 1992 93 many asian nations did during the crises of 1997 99 and the united states has brought them back into vogue for its trade war with china but unlike these shorter term policies china s use of capital control is long term this is because long term stability is the commonly perceived goal for china s capital account policy the mercator institute for china studies an institution purposed for such subjects identified around 75 multifaceted capital control adjustments implemented between june 2016 and january 2018 alone these capital account restrictions on the economy have prevented china from fully participating in the global financial system and this in turn has led to imbalances the tremendous foreign exchange reserves domination of domestic banks in the financial sector asset bubbles and other symptoms characterize china s domestic economy but china has been largely successful in maintaining the stability it seeks capital controls allowed china to fend off the economic maelstrom its geographical neighbours faced in the 1997 99 crises when compared to the united states china continues to be able to orchestrate its economy in a manner that returns a disproportionately high amount of capital to its middle class however perhaps contrary to a layman s view china has been indeed been moving towards a more open capital account beijing recognizes that there are benefits to reducing the limits on capital flows for starters chinese investors are often good international investors this benefits china as would the pressure from international competition china s domestic financial markets are too comfortable for the big four and this is generally not beneficial for the less established as china opens its capital account the liberalization of the chinese yuan follows the exchange of the yuan into foreign currency and the reverse is a less complicated maneuver for those foreign entities operating in a chinese special economic zone sez as these are the testing grounds for liberalized financial control mechanisms the testing that operators are familiar with within shenzhen a long time sez eventually leads to progress current account foreign exchange items are freely convertible and can be processed by a designated domestic chinese bank on the presentation of the correct documents capital account foreign exchange is more strictly controlled and is subject to registration and or approval with the state administration of foreign exchange safe the customs and qualified domestic banks under the guidelines of the people s bank of china pboc capital account there are three main bodies that put forth the majority of the regulations and manage the flow of foreign exchange in china the first is the state administration of foreign exchange safe the second the people s bank of china pboc and the third is the customs it is safe that more actively manages foreign exchange transactions in china it is these institutions that are directing the liberalization of the chinese capital flows as said in an official english translation of pbc and safe themselves the pbc and the safe have been steadily pressing ahead with the orderly opening up of interbank bond markets in recent years safe often but not always does this through domestic banks that are designated to receive documents and authenticate on its behalf financing inbound a foreign owned invested enterprise fie whether equity joint ventures cooperative joint ventures or wholly owned enterprises must register with a designated domestic bank in order to open a foreign currency bank account to receive any capital contributed in foreign currency from abroad each year an fie needs to submit an existing right registration generally any inbound financing must be registered with safe or pboc foreign investors can make capital contributions into fies using rmb not just foreign currency foreign investors can convert registered capital foreign debt proceeds and repatriated funds into rmb at will i e without needing to produce underlying contracts to support the authenticity when the receiving fie is an enterprise as compared to a financial institution or real estate enterprise it must report the loan information through safe s designated capital account information system the foreign debt contract only takes effect once the safe registration has been completed from january 1st 2020 onwards fies in the greater bay area may only register foreign debts limited to the total of two times its net assets assuming that the fie has its existing right registration submitted through cooperation with the fies domestic chinese bank the foreign exchange process and estimated timeline is the following 1 utilize an rmb basic account to receive the foreign funds approx 2 weeks 2 obtain foreign exchange registration certificate approx 5 10 working days 3 receive funds in foreign capital account approx 5 7 working days 4 inject the capital in a manner in accordance with the fie s articles of association 5 register the foreign capital in a foreign capital exchange approx 5 7 working days once received the registered capital must be used for the purposes it was registered for it cannot be used freely for other more profitable purposes it is for this reason that foreign financing should perhaps not be sent with extra cushion as the extra capital will be left dormant once received and not directly applicable now from january 1st 2020 non investment fies may use registered capital funds to make onshore equity investment provided that the investment does not violate china s foreign investment negative list fies can use converted rmb to make equity investments into other onshore entities these equity investments have restrictions on their scope for example converted rmb cannot be used by fies to construct or purchase a non self use real estate unless the fie is specifically a real estate enterprise an important decision for an fie receiving foreign capital is its permanent decision regarding which cross border financing cap it will leverage as it sounds this acts as a maximum allowable amount of received capital for an fie the options are either the risk weighted debt balance cap or the traditional foreign debt borrowing gap if already decided on the traditional method fies in a free trade zone ftz have one more chance to opt for the risk weighted option once decided it cannot be reversed financing outbound stocks bonds outbound financing transactions are strictly regulated before any outbound financing transaction the onshore lender must apply to safe to obtain a lending quote it cannot exceed 30 of the lender s own equity it is reported that beijing is largely unimpressed with outbound m a activity and is aware of capital flight disguised as investment its tight regulations stem from such mitigative motivations china monitors these capital flows rigorously through many separate investment channels this controlled fashion allows the quick shut down of a channel facilitating unfavourable transactions without affecting international capital flow as a whole the following are the avenues in which a foreign investor s financial institution can be qualified to transact and move capital into china for equity or debt instruments i the hong kong bond market where foreigners can buy bonds in shanghai or shenzhen through the hong kong bond connect ii the china interbank bond market direct where foreigners can buy bonds in china generally iii being a qualified foreign institutional investor qfii which gives access to securities trading in china iv being a renminbi qualified foreign institutional investor rqfii also gives access to securities trading in china and v the hong kong stock market where foreigners can buy stocks in shanghai or shenzhen through the hong kong stock connect the following are the means by which financial institutions can move capital out of china for equity and debt instruments i a yet to be opened hong kong bond market available to chinese investors ii the qualified domestic institutional investor qdii which gives access to securities abroad and iii the shanghai shenzhen stock markets where chinese can buy stocks in hong kong through the hong kong stock connect which of these areas an investor s financial institution has been qualified to operate in determines the investor s options to become qualified financial institutions must comply with the regulation promulgated by safe and pboc recently introduced information circulars discussed below should provide more options to foreign investors once implemented in institutions current account pboc and safe are the authorities with which any foreign invested enterprise in china must interact when receiving payment from abroad or remitting foreign exchange again these institutions are represented through designated domestic banks businesses can convert relatively freely for current account items the proof receipts invoices etc submitted validates the authenticity of the transactions an fie is required by safe to use its converted rmb for payments not beyond the business scope of the company this is interpreted and determined by the domestic bank handling the transaction despite the relatively relaxed proof requirements there are many nuances to the reporting of payments to safe and chinese banks for example fies must report any overseas payment with a payment term over 90 days from the date shown on the import declaration form to safe no matter the amount also that if an enterprise enters into a contract that requires a repayment in a foreign exchange the enterprise must also register the forex repayment within 15 days before the remittance these almost ad hoc requirements make expert counsel a necessity the useful discussion of current account exchange is limited because of this new legislation circulars a note on dcep cryptocurrency two circulars titled peoples bank of china and state administration of foreign exchange facilitate investments by foreign institutional investors in interbank bond markets and circular of the state administration of foreign exchange on further facilitating cross border trade and investments were introduced in october and brought to effect november 15th 2019 they are another release in a chain of liberalizing documents that serve china s opening capital markets to give an idea of what such information circulars released regularly may contain the first circular allows foreign institutional investors to now invest in china s interbank bond markets directly it also allows for non trading transfers of bonds invested directly with bonds invested through the qfii or rqfii program by the same foreign investor with direct transfers also allowed between corresponding capital accounts qfii rqfii custodian banks apply to chinese based clearing houses for the direct investments in exchange for bonds that have been bought from the domestic interbank bond market quotas for qfiis rqfiis have been removed and filing processes have been simplified for the investors of these channels the second circular grants more flexibility to businesses regarding the prepayment put down for a foreign exchange previously it could not be exchanged into rmb it now can for small cross border online goods businesses operating in the greater bay area it is administratively beneficial that if annual goods trade volume is less than usd 200 000 registering on the list of companies that seek to do foreign exchange is no longer required further more flexibility has been granted to loans and collateral accounts a foreign investor can now open more than three accounts for a loan the investor can have more than one specialized account for earnest money pre payment for an exchange investors no longer need a waiting account where income from goods sold sits while waiting for the received payment to be converted and foreign entities can now purchase loans from domestic banks along with non performing assets and other entities financing foreign investment law january 1st 2020 is a date of significance it is when new legislation titled the foreign investment law will come into effect which is of material concern to every foreign owned enterprise the terms are broad and this new legislation can be used to supervise seemingly any inbound foreign direct investment and financing the principles included in the legislation are general and it has been received generally positively by the international community in promoting foreign investment a stated promise of the inbound law is that as long as inbound fdi does not seek to invest in one of china s industries on its negative list the treatment of such fdi shall be no less favourable than that granted to domestic investment upon the implementation of the new foreign investment law the current fie laws will be abolished a 5 year grace period will begin within which companies must comply with the prc company law or prc partnership enterprise law whichever is appropriate an example law that this new regulations introduces for the standard fie that is deserving attention and preparation an fie will be required to contribute 10 of the after tax profit to a statutory surplus reserve in accordance with the company law until the aggregate sum of the statutory surplus reserve reaches more than 50 of its registered capital thus this 10 will be taken out of the funds available for outbound remittance engaging expert counsel for an analysis of how the january 1st 2020 foreign investment law will affect your fie is recommended cryptocurrency and capital control cryptocurrencies play a part in the discussion of capital control in china even when not including the soon to be implemented dcep after all the quintessential cryptocurrency bitcoin btc had a massive 2017 spike in price that was reportedly due to the volume of yuan to btc purchases commentators say 90 of the global btc trading at that time was on chinese cryptocurrency exchanges china recognizes that cryptocurrency presents an unacceptable avenue of capital flight chinese financial institutions have been prohibited from handling btc transactions since 2013 since btc s 2008 inception a swath of cryptocurrencies have been minted based on blockchain technology they are convertible to some fiat currencies on certain online exchanges central banks being pressured by this infringement feel the need to develop their own version of a digital currency building in cryptocurrency s ease of use transfer and tracking characteristics people s bank of china is the pioneer in creating and implementing a serious sovereign digital currency after years of research and patent filings the digital currency electronic payment dcep has been announced by pboc recently as an incoming central bank digital currency cbdc but in its definition dcep is more in peerage with china s m0 the monetary base or so called high power money it appears that the dcep s main effects will be on the facilitation of transactions better wielding of monetary policy and direct access to central bank money by citizens it is to be assumed and hoped that the 2020 expected implementation of dcep will allow for an even more rapid foreign exchange process the growth in the usage of non sovereign cryptocurrencies may implicitly affect countries capital control by acting as a substitute of international method of payment as of november 22 2019 the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies reached usd 212 145 853 246 compared to the usd 3 252 830 million of the us monetary base the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is less than one tenth of the monetary base of the us alone thus the cross border asset allocation effect of those cryptocurrencies is not substantial but of course care should be made in the speculation of future trends what may to come to pass is an internationalized foreign exchange market of sovereign cryptocurrencies ecuador senegal singapore and tunisia have all launched their own state cryptocurrencies estonia japan russia sweden and canada are all reportedly investigating the process of doing the same one can presume that the exchange of such tightly monitored and regulated digital currencies will be simpler than systems at present as for the economic utility derived in implementing these currencies china will stand apart from other nations its uniquely mobile dependent population is the ideal infrastructure for such an innovation as the world will soon see the future interactions of un centralized blockchain cryptocurrencies and central bank policy have yet to be properly seen there is no easy answer to the asset movement effect of them especially as this form of unregulated asset is and has been prone to runaways and crashes but it is for certain that central banks will strive to keep their monetary market stable and will continue to explore the potential benefits of sovereign cryptocurrencies until a clear verdict is reached summary china s restricted capital account policy is a burden for small medium sized foreign owned enterprises operating in the country china is aware of this and is seemingly implementing policies that will reduce the red tape plenty of tape remains hanging however and an fie expecting forex for financing can expect at least seven business days worth of scrutiny current account items like receiving payment for goods sold remittances and the like are a simpler process and require less time and action but have less predictable requirements depending on the nature of the transaction the combination of new information circulars which are binding and the new january 1st 2020 foreign investment law encourage the small medium sized fie to consult expert counsel promptly the inbound digital electronic currency payment reminds readers to keep attuned to the medium term outlook china is experimenting and merchants must go with the flow karnfelt m zenglein mj

december 17 2019 a concluding statement describes the preliminary findings of imf staff at the end of an official staff visit or â missionâ in most cases to a member country missions are undertaken as part of regular usually annual consultations under article iv of the imf s articles of agreement in the context of a request to use imf resources borrow from the imf as part of discussions of staff monitored programs or as part of other staff monitoring of economic developments the authorities have consented to the publication of this statement the views expressed in this statement are those of the imf staff and do not necessarily represent the views of the imfâ s executive board based on the preliminary findings of this mission staff will prepare a report that subject to management approval will be presented to the imf executive board for discussion and decision context enviable achievements but challenges emerged 1 uruguay is in an enviable position in many respects the country enjoys a well functioning democracy political stability strong governance and institutions and a high degree of social cohesion following a decade and a half of robust growth it also boasts high per capita income and low rates of poverty inequality and informality thanks to prudent supervision and regulation the financial sector remains resilient despite regional financial market volatility 2 but imbalances have emerged and external developments remain a headwind growth investment and labor participation have been on a declining trend in recent years and internal imbalances higher fiscal deficits rising unemployment have accumulated debt has increased and inflation remains outside of the target range at the same time external position has remained robust with the current account fluctuating at around zero and sufficient reserve buffers in the past uruguay has taken advantage of the benign global conditions including high commodity prices and robust external demand such favorable conditions however are no longer present with sluggish global and regional growth subdued commodity prices elevated uncertainty volatile capital flows and bouts of financial turmoil in neighboring argentina although low global interest rates provide breathing space 3 the political and domestic economic landscape over the next few years present an opportunity for addressing uruguayâ s economic challenges the new government which assumes office in march 2020 will have a post election mandate and will be helped by a growth boost from the construction of a new paper pulp plant and oncoming public private partnership ppp projects in addition there is consensus across the political spectrum regarding key challenges 4 the authorities should use this opportunity to reverse the accumulation of imbalances and undertake reforms to safeguard achievements and ensure continued income convergence they should reduce debt and bring inflation towards the mid point of the target range they should also leverage uruguayâ s institutional advantages to further improve the fiscal and inflation targeting frameworks and implement structural reforms a revival of productivity growth is critical to sustain the coverage of the welfare state and ensure fairness across generations in this context action is needed to improve education outcomes youth employment private investment and the efficiency of state owned enterprises as well as to ensure adequate pensions for future generations recent developments softened economy 5 the economy softened and inflation remained above target economic activity began to decelerate in 2018q2 and the annual growth in the first half of 2019 was around zero percent consumption stagnated and the expected rebound in capital formationâ following years of underinvestmentâ failed to materialize on the positive side exports have been recovering from their 2018 trough and the current account balance has fluctuated at around zero inflation increased to 8â½ percent in november outside of the target range despite a negative output gap due to both temporary factors and above target expectations 6 spillovers from argentina have been limited to the real sector and exchange rate channels thanks to robust financial sector and ample reserve buffers tourism receipts from argentina dropped by 34 percent in the first half of 2019 compared with the same period in 2018 the authorities allowed the exchange rate to adjust in an orderly manner with the peso depreciating against the u s dollar by 17 percent since end 2018 intervention was geared to addressing disorderly market conditions and was two sided reserves declined from us 15 6 billion in december 2018 to us 14 3 billion in december 2019 25 percent of gdp the financial sectorâ which had markedly reduced its exposure to argentina prior to the onset of the crisisâ remains robust and sovereign spreads are contained at low levels with the depreciation of the currency however deposit dollarization has edged up 7 fiscal balances deteriorated substantially as the economy slowed revenues declined and current expenditures continued to increase the budget for 2020â the last to be prepared by the current governmentâ gives up on the achievement of the 2 5 percent of gdp deficit target and instead foresees a fiscal deficit for the consolidated public sector cps of 4 6 percent of gdp in 2019 excluding the cincuentones transactions and 3 8 percent of gdp in 2020 the underlying fiscal balance has deteriorated since the budget projections as of october the twelve month cps deficit excluding the cincuentones transactions stood at 4 6 percent of gdp aided by the impact of a debt management operation in september 0 3 percent of gdp and by lower interest payments from the central bank excluding the impact of the debt management operation the cps deficit excluding the cincuentones transactions would have been 4 9 percent of gdp the authorities have successfully issued longer term bonds at favorable rates to cover their financing needs 8 the authorities and the imf switched the focus of fiscal reporting for uruguay from the cps to the non financial public sector nfps the nfps based reporting includes all the components of cps except the central bank and provides a more appropriate and clear measure of the underlying fiscal situation the authorities continue to transparently communicate all the details of the fiscal accounts including the impact of cincuentones on fiscal outturns in this context the imfâ s fiscal analysis is based on the nfps fiscal aggregates excluding cincuentones transactions while weo data present the nfps fiscal aggregates including cincuentones outlook and risks expected recovery but sizable risks 9 the economyâ s long term growth potential is estimated at around 2â 2 5 percent taking account of i low and falling investment and ii declining labor force participation partly reflecting demographic trends since 2015 growth averaged at about 1â½ percent compared with an average of about 5 percent during 2006â 14 10 at the same time the outlook has improved staff projects growth to rebound from an estimated 0 5 percent in 2019 to 2 1 percent in 2020 and 2 5 percent in 2021 as investment projects ramp up offsetting possible adverse spillovers from argentina growth is expected to decline after 2021 as these investments run their courseâ but the level of real gdp is expected to be permanently higher by around 1 percent due to the productivity impact inflation is expected to remain at around 8 percent next year and then to decline gradually towards the upper limit of the target range as temporary factors wear off and wage increases follow the declining path agreed in the last round of negotiations 11 uruguayâ s external position is broadly consistent with fundamentals and desirable policy settings staff projects the current account deficit to widen as tourism receipts from argentina settle at a lower level and large investment projects and economic recovery raise imports after the completion of the paper pulp plant exports are expected to increase 12 there are sizable upside and downside risks on the downside economic developments in argentina remain an outsized risk even though the likelihood of direct financial spillovers is small a host of global factors trade disruptions lower growth abrupt declines in risk appetite large swings in energy prices and of local ones loss of credibility due to insufficient fiscal adjustment or delayed reforms and ppp projects may undermine the expected recovery and limit medium term growth on the upside the growth boost from investment projects may be larger than expected given the uncertainty about possible indirect effects policies safeguarding sustainable and inclusive growth a maintaining fiscal sustainability 13 under baseline projections despite an expected improvement in fiscal balances debt is expected to rise staff projects the nfps overall deficit excluding cincuentones to gradually decline from estimated 4 1 percent of gdp in 2019 to 3 9 percent of gdp in 2020 and settle at around 3 1 percent of gdp this reflects a cyclical improvement of tax revenues and state owned enterprise profits as well as some measures to contain expenditures amounting to about 0 9 percent of gdp given the political consensus on the need for fiscal adjustment in addition availability payments related to ppp projects are expected to reach â½ percent of gdp by 2024 nfps debt is expected to increase from an estimated 67 percent of gdp in 2019 to 68 percent of gdp in 2024 14 while gross financing needs are manageable fiscal space is diminishing large financing needs for 2020 are expected to be met in the context of coordinated public sector asset liability management stable local currency funding from domestic institutions the authoritiesâ pre financing policy and sufficient buffers in the form of nonfinancial public sector liquid assets and contingent credit lines sovereign risk spreads remain contained but the fiscal position has worsened debt is elevated and downside risks are sizable despite improvements the shares of foreign currency debt and of nonresident holdings remain relatively high leaving debt vulnerable to exchange rate pressures and changes in risk sentiment as a result uruguayâ s fiscal spaceâ the room for discretionary fiscal policy without endangering the debt sustainabilityâ is at risk 15 there is a need to introduce a credible adjustment plan starting from 2020 to put debt on a firm downward path current fiscal trends if they continue could undermine debt sustainability and investor confidence given sizable downside risks bringing debt to its 2012â 14 levels about 10 percentage points of gdp lower than currently over the longer term would place uruguay comfortably within the range of investment grade peers and rebuild space to accommodate future negative shocks without endangering sustainability 16 given the expected growth support from large investment projects there is room to frontload the fiscal adjustment bringing the nfps primary deficit from its current level of 1 7 percent of gdp to a surplus of 0 9 percent of gdp by 2024 would stabilize debt additional adjustment is needed to tilt down the debt ratio on average a â½ percent of gdp adjustment per year would reduce debt by about 10 percentage points in 10 years in the absence of negative shocks and to the extent that growth picks up the authorities will have more scope to deliver a higher adjustment for the next couple of years this would help reduce debt faster including through lower future interest payments ease the economic impact of the adjustment and reduce the adjustment needs going forward if upside risks materialize windfall revenues resulting from the demand boost should be saved to both stabilize the economy and use the opportunity to reduce debt during good times 17 a combination of measures will be needed a transparent public information and communication strategy would help build consensus around the selected measures a a sustainable adjustment would require limiting the increase in current expenditures if for example current expenditures increase with inflationâ rather than increasing with or faster than nominal gdpâ debt would decline by 8 percentage points by 2024 relative to the current levels however given expenditure rigidities such as in pensions maintaining current expenditures flat in real terms may be too ambitious in addition careful consideration should be given to maintaining adequate provision of key public services and safety nets in this context a combination of measures such as keeping public wages in line with the private sector to attract and retain talent while avoiding excessive costs reducing public employment in non critical sectors through natural attrition and improving the efficiency of spending would support the adjustment b capital expenditures at already low levels should be preserved c there is room to reduce tax expendituresâ exemptions reduced rates and tax creditsâ estimated at about 7 percent of gdp about three quarters of these expenditures are for the value added tax where tax expenditures represent about 40 percent of collections a cost benefit analysis could help streamline exemptions particularly those benefiting higher income groups or those that have not achieved the desired outcomes this would support the fiscal adjustment given the rigid structure of the current expenditures and allow the future use of exemptions as a stabilization tool in case of negative shocks 18 addressing growing pension spending is a priority uruguay boasts a comprehensive social security system an impressive achievement and one of the pillars of the countryâ s social stability with the population aging and given the already high level of pension spending around 11 percent of gdp about a third of total expenditures reforms are needed to ensure sustainability and adequate retirement income for future generations reforms should be based on a comprehensive review of the entire system supported by an informed social dialogue early action will help smooth the transition to a revised system and release resources for other priority areas 19 the adjustment should be accompanied by introduction of a revamped medium term fiscal framework mtff given sizable downside risks particularly if a gradual approach is chosen there is a need to establish credibility of the adjustment plan from the outset the introduction of a new mtff encompassing a binding fiscal rule would enshrine credibility by introducing a fiscal anchor that ensures medium term sustainability it would also help rebuild the necessary fiscal space to counter negative shocks without endangering sustainability an improved mtff could include i a rolling 3 to 5 year projection period irrespective of the governmentâ s term to reduce uncertainty ii a strengthened fiscal rule possibly an expenditure rule combined with a debt anchor iii limited use of escape clauses in exceptional circumstances iv strengthened accountability mechanisms to ensure better adherence to fiscal targets v regular spending reviews to increase efficiency vi more frequent updates of forecasts given frequent shocks vii greater budget unity by setting a spending ceiling that is binding also for autonomous article 220 entities viii better coordination between the office of planning and budget and the budget office of the ministry of economy and finance to link strategic priorities and program evaluations to budget allocations and ix disclosure of risks including those associated with ppps budgetary targets should be set for the nfps in line with the recent shift in the focus of fiscal reporting b lowering inflation and reducing financial dollarization 20 inflation and inflation expectations remain persistently above the top of the target range the stance of monetary policy was tightened in october with the indicative reference for the growth rate of the m1 monetary aggregate lowered from 8 10 percent in 2019q3 to 7 9 percent in 2019q4 while interest rates have increased by about 100 basis points at the short end and by about 20 basis points at the longer end inflation and medium term inflation expectations have continued to increase currently standing at 8 4 percent and 8 percent respectively 21 with the expected growth boost the central bank will have the space to focus on reducing inflation towards the mid point of the target range if inflation stabilizes at current levels it would leave uruguay vulnerable to negative shocks which could raise inflation to double digits accordingly monetary indicative references should be further tightened such that real interest rates rise above the range of estimated neutral rates this should continue until inflation and inflation expectations are firmly at the mid point of the target range keeping inflation low and stable at the middle of the target range would also help support efforts to reduce dollarization and indexation and deepen financial markets and reinforce policy credibility the authorities should also continue to use the exchange rate as a shock absorber and interventions should be reserved for addressing disorderly market conditionsâ as they are nowâ and reserve buffers should be kept above prudential norms 22 further enhancements to the inflation targeting framework could be considered to keep inflation low and stable at the mid point of the target range conducting monetary policy is quite challenging in the presence of a high degree of dollarization low credit to gdp ratio remaining wage indexation and frequent shocks to the exchange rate at the same time a low and stable inflation is key to addressing these challenges enhancements could focus on strategies instruments and communication practices in particular communicating a clearer hierarchy of objectives with the primacy of price stability at the mid point of the target range and explaining in more detail the central bankâ s reaction function would guide expectations towards the mid point of the target range and reinforce the expectations channel 23 continued efforts to reduce the high degree of dollarization and indexation are welcome the revised guidelines for wage bargaining councilsâ which introduced productivity considerations and delinked wages from past inflationâ are an important step towards reducing indexation both macroeconomic and price stability are critical to reducing dollarization in addition continued coordinated efforts to fine tune regulatory measures deepen financial markets and provide hedging opportunities would help further encourage local currency holding c financial sector preserving the resilience and supporting growth 24 the financial sector is resilient but medium term challenges remain thanks to prudent supervision and regulation uruguayâ s financial sector weathered the bouts of financial volatility in argentina well at the same time financial intermediation is chronically low with wide margins between credit and deposit rates in addition credit markets are segmented for dollar and peso loans with very high rates for the latter weakening the monetary transmission mechanism 25 the authorities are proceeding with appropriate steps to maintain financial sector resilience regulation on the net stable funding ratioâ requiring that the liquidity profiles of bankâ s assets and liabilities be alignedâ became effective in december regulation on countercyclical buffersâ requiring banks to accumulate additional capital during boom timesâ will be submitted for public consultation in december in addition investment limits for pension funds were modified to incorporate exposures to ppp projects to limit concentration risks 26 authoritiesâ efforts to deepen financial markets are welcome these include efforts to i create benchmark curves ii increase the liquidity of instruments in secondary markets and iii foster financial inclusion and innovation by providing free access to bank accounts encouraging electronic transactions and analyzing ways to improve the payments system as a result electronic points of sale almost doubled between 2014 and 2019 and the amount of cash withdrawals began to decline in 2018 27 financial regulation should aim to strike the right balance between enabling innovation and competition on the one hand and addressing challenges to financial integrity stability and consumer protection on the other since the introduction of the regulation on peer to peer lending no fintech company has registered continued collaboration across state agencies the central bank and the industry would help advance the common goal of financial development and inclusion while ensuring proper risk management d structural reforms for sustainable and inclusive growth 28 uruguay has distinct structural strengths relative to peers it has strong governance and institutions a well functioning democracy a high degree of social cohesion a strong commitment to free trade as well as low rates of poverty inequality and informality its citizens enjoy a strong safety net and adequate protection of their rights overall uruguay is one of the top performers on many environmental social and governance esg indicators based on the world bankâ s sovereign esg data framework 29 building on these strengths further structural reforms are needed to ensure continued income convergence and maintain social achievements for future generations closing infrastructure gaps is an important step but by itself will not be sufficient to raise growth to the levels seen in the past decade a vibrant private sector is essential to support growth to this end uruguay needs to improve its education outcomes and the business environment in addition a corporate governance reform would improve the management and efficiency of soes which play a key role in the uruguayan economy 30 deterioration in labor market outcomes needs to be reversed employment and labor force participation have been falling in key sectors and the unemployment rate has risen particularly among the young to around 30 percent younger generations bear the brunt of the adjustment during downturns increasing concerns about both intergenerational equity and potential insider outsider issues in addition perception surveys indicate that there is room for further improvement in wage flexibility labor employer cooperation and in conditions for attracting and retaining workers 31 policies should be geared towards delivering high and stable employment while maintaining adequate worker protection changes to the wage council guidelinesâ which introduced productivity considerations and greater flexibilityâ are a step in the right direction further flexibility for small firms low productivity regions and during downturns could be considered to preserve rights and provide incentives for firms to create more stable jobs and invest in on the job training better aligning wage increases with productivity would also help raise skill premium and improve incentives for further education in addition improvements in business labor cooperation and continued focus on education and training to recalibrate skills could support employment similarly youth unemployment should be addressed in coordination with the education reform continued efforts to integrate migrants and female labor into the labor market would help offset pressures stemming from population aging 32 the increase in crime albeit from a low base needs to be addressed before it becomes macro critical in addition in light of increasing money laundering risks the authorities are encouraged to promptly implement recommendations of gafilatâ s aml cft assessment particularly to address risks from foreign

uruguay staff concluding statement of the 2019 article iv mission a concluding statement describes the preliminary findings of imf staff at the end of an official staff visit or mission in most cases to a member country missions are undertaken as part of regular usually annual consultations under article iv of the imf s articles of agreement in the context of a request to use imf resources borrow from the imf as part of discussions of staff monitored programs or as part of other staff monitoring of economic developments the authorities have consented to the publication of this statement the views expressed in this statement are those of the imf staff and do not necessarily represent the views of the imf s executive board based on the preliminary findings of this mission staff will prepare a report that subject to management approval will be presented to the imf executive board for discussion and decision context enviable achievements but challenges emerged 1 uruguay is in an enviable position in many respects the country enjoys a well functioning democracy political stability strong governance and institutions and a high degree of social cohesion following a decade and a half of robust growth it also boasts high per capita income and low rates of poverty inequality and informality thanks to prudent supervision and regulation the financial sector remains resilient despite regional financial market volatility 2 but imbalances have emerged and external developments remain a headwind growth investment and labor participation have been on a declining trend in recent years and internal imbalances higher fiscal deficits rising unemployment have accumulated debt has increased and inflation remains outside of the target range at the same time external position has remained robust with the current account fluctuating at around zero and sufficient reserve buffers in the past uruguay has taken advantage of the benign global conditions including high commodity prices and robust external demand such favorable conditions however are no longer present with sluggish global and regional growth subdued commodity prices elevated uncertainty volatile capital flows and bouts of financial turmoil in neighboring argentina although low global interest rates provide breathing space 3 the political and domestic economic landscape over the next few years present an opportunity for addressing uruguay s economic challenges the new government which assumes office in march 2020 will have a post election mandate and will be helped by a growth boost from the construction of a new paper pulp plant and oncoming public private partnership ppp projects in addition there is consensus across the political spectrum regarding key challenges 4 the authorities should use this opportunity to reverse the accumulation of imbalances and undertake reforms to safeguard achievements and ensure continued income convergence they should reduce debt and bring inflation towards the mid point of the target range they should also leverage uruguay s institutional advantages to further improve the fiscal and inflation targeting frameworks and implement structural reforms a revival of productivity growth is critical to sustain the coverage of the welfare state and ensure fairness across generations in this context action is needed to improve education outcomes youth employment private investment and the efficiency of state owned enterprises as well as to ensure adequate pensions for future generations recent developments softened economy 5 the economy softened and inflation remained above target economic activity began to decelerate in 2018q2 and the annual growth in the first half of 2019 was around zero percent consumption stagnated and the expected rebound in capital formation following years of underinvestment failed to materialize on the positive side exports have been recovering from their 2018 trough and the current account balance has fluctuated at around zero inflation increased to 8½ percent in november outside of the target range despite a negative output gap due to both temporary factors and above target expectations 6 spillovers from argentina have been limited to the real sector and exchange rate channels thanks to robust financial sector and ample reserve buffers tourism receipts from argentina dropped by 34 percent in the first half of 2019 compared with the same period in 2018 the authorities allowed the exchange rate to adjust in an orderly manner with the peso depreciating against the u s dollar by 17 percent since end 2018 intervention was geared to addressing disorderly market conditions and was two sided reserves declined from us 15 6 billion in december 2018 to us 14 3 billion in december 2019 25 percent of gdp the financial sector which had markedly reduced its exposure to argentina prior to the onset of the crisis remains robust and sovereign spreads are contained at low levels with the depreciation of the currency however deposit dollarization has edged up 7 fiscal balances deteriorated substantially as the economy slowed revenues declined and current expenditures continued to increase the budget for 2020 the last to be prepared by the current government gives up on the achievement of the 2 5 percent of gdp deficit target and instead foresees a fiscal deficit for the consolidated public sector cps of 4 6 percent of gdp in 2019 excluding the cincuentones transactions and 3 8 percent of gdp in 2020 the underlying fiscal balance has deteriorated since the budget projections as of october the twelve month cps deficit excluding the cincuentones transactions stood at 4 6 percent of gdp aided by the impact of a debt management operation in september 0 3 percent of gdp and by lower interest payments from the central bank excluding the impact of the debt management operation the cps deficit excluding the cincuentones transactions would have been 4 9 percent of gdp the authorities have successfully issued longer term bonds at favorable rates to cover their financing needs 8 the authorities and the imf switched the focus of fiscal reporting for uruguay from the cps to the non financial public sector nfps the nfps based reporting includes all the components of cps except the central bank and provides a more appropriate and clear measure of the underlying fiscal situation the authorities continue to transparently communicate all the details of the fiscal accounts including the impact of cincuentones on fiscal outturns in this context the imf s fiscal analysis is based on the nfps fiscal aggregates excluding cincuentones transactions while weo data present the nfps fiscal aggregates including cincuentones outlook and risks expected recovery but sizable risks 9 the economy s long term growth potential is estimated at around 2 2 5 percent taking account of i low and falling investment and ii declining labor force participation partly reflecting demographic trends since 2015 growth averaged at about 1½ percent compared with an average of about 5 percent during 2006 14 10 at the same time the outlook has improved staff projects growth to rebound from an estimated 0 5 percent in 2019 to 2 1 percent in 2020 and 2 5 percent in 2021 as investment projects ramp up offsetting possible adverse spillovers from argentina growth is expected to decline after 2021 as these investments run their course but the level of real gdp is expected to be permanently higher by around 1 percent due to the productivity impact inflation is expected to remain at around 8 percent next year and then to decline gradually towards the upper limit of the target range as temporary factors wear off and wage increases follow the declining path agreed in the last round of negotiations 11 uruguay s external position is broadly consistent with fundamentals and desirable policy settings staff projects the current account deficit to widen as tourism receipts from argentina settle at a lower level and large investment projects and economic recovery raise imports after the completion of the paper pulp plant exports are expected to increase 12 there are sizable upside and downside risks on the downside economic developments in argentina remain an outsized risk even though the likelihood of direct financial spillovers is small a host of global factors trade disruptions lower growth abrupt declines in risk appetite large swings in energy prices and of local ones loss of credibility due to insufficient fiscal adjustment or delayed reforms and ppp projects may undermine the expected recovery and limit medium term growth on the upside the growth boost from investment projects may be larger than expected given the uncertainty about possible indirect effects policies safeguarding sustainable and inclusive growth a maintaining fiscal sustainability 13 under baseline projections despite an expected improvement in fiscal balances debt is expected to rise staff projects the nfps overall deficit excluding cincuentones to gradually decline from estimated 4 1 percent of gdp in 2019 to 3 9 percent of gdp in 2020 and settle at around 3 1 percent of gdp this reflects a cyclical improvement of tax revenues and state owned enterprise profits as well as some measures to contain expenditures amounting to about 0 9 percent of gdp given the political consensus on the need for fiscal adjustment in addition availability payments related to ppp projects are expected to reach ½ percent of gdp by 2024 nfps debt is expected to increase from an estimated 67 percent of gdp in 2019 to 68 percent of gdp in 2024 14 while gross financing needs are manageable fiscal space is diminishing large financing needs for 2020 are expected to be met in the context of coordinated public sector asset liability management stable local currency funding from domestic institutions the authorities pre financing policy and sufficient buffers in the form of nonfinancial public sector liquid assets and contingent credit lines sovereign risk spreads remain contained but the fiscal position has worsened debt is elevated and downside risks are sizable despite improvements the shares of foreign currency debt and of nonresident holdings remain relatively high leaving debt vulnerable to exchange rate pressures and changes in risk sentiment as a result uruguay s fiscal space the room for discretionary fiscal policy without endangering the debt sustainability is at risk 15 there is a need to introduce a credible adjustment plan starting from 2020 to put debt on a firm downward path current fiscal trends if they continue could undermine debt sustainability and investor confidence given sizable downside risks bringing debt to its 2012 14 levels about 10 percentage points of gdp lower than currently over the longer term would place uruguay comfortably within the range of investment grade peers and rebuild space to accommodate future negative shocks without endangering sustainability 16 given the expected growth support from large investment projects there is room to frontload the fiscal adjustment bringing the nfps primary deficit from its current level of 1 7 percent of gdp to a surplus of 0 9 percent of gdp by 2024 would stabilize debt additional adjustment is needed to tilt down the debt ratio on average a ½ percent of gdp adjustment per year would reduce debt by about 10 percentage points in 10 years in the absence of negative shocks and to the extent that growth picks up the authorities will have more scope to deliver a higher adjustment for the next couple of years this would help reduce debt faster including through lower future interest payments ease the economic impact of the adjustment and reduce the adjustment needs going forward if upside risks materialize windfall revenues resulting from the demand boost should be saved to both stabilize the economy and use the opportunity to reduce debt during good times 17 a combination of measures will be needed a transparent public information and communication strategy would help build consensus around the selected measures a a sustainable adjustment would require limiting the increase in current expenditures if for example current expenditures increase with inflation rather than increasing with or faster than nominal gdp debt would decline by 8 percentage points by 2024 relative to the current levels however given expenditure rigidities such as in pensions maintaining current expenditures flat in real terms may be too ambitious in addition careful consideration should be given to maintaining adequate provision of key public services and safety nets in this context a combination of measures such as keeping public wages in line with the private sector to attract and retain talent while avoiding excessive costs reducing public employment in non critical sectors through natural attrition and improving the efficiency of spending would support the adjustment b capital expenditures at already low levels should be preserved c there is room to reduce tax expenditures exemptions reduced rates and tax credits estimated at about 7 percent of gdp about three quarters of these expenditures are for the value added tax where tax expenditures represent about 40 percent of collections a cost benefit analysis could help streamline exemptions particularly those benefiting higher income groups or those that have not achieved the desired outcomes this would support the fiscal adjustment given the rigid structure of the current expenditures and allow the future use of exemptions as a stabilization tool in case of negative shocks 18 addressing growing pension spending is a priority uruguay boasts a comprehensive social security system an impressive achievement and one of the pillars of the country s social stability with the population aging and given the already high level of pension spending around 11 percent of gdp about a third of total expenditures reforms are needed to ensure sustainability and adequate retirement income for future generations reforms should be based on a comprehensive review of the entire system supported by an informed social dialogue early action will help smooth the transition to a revised system and release resources for other priority areas 19 the adjustment should be accompanied by introduction of a revamped medium term fiscal framework mtff given sizable downside risks particularly if a gradual approach is chosen there is a need to establish credibility of the adjustment plan from the outset the introduction of a new mtff encompassing a binding fiscal rule would enshrine credibility by introducing a fiscal anchor that ensures medium term sustainability it would also help rebuild the necessary fiscal space to counter negative shocks without endangering sustainability an improved mtff could include i a rolling 3 to 5 year projection period irrespective of the government s term to reduce uncertainty ii a strengthened fiscal rule possibly an expenditure rule combined with a debt anchor iii limited use of escape clauses in exceptional circumstances iv strengthened accountability mechanisms to ensure better adherence to fiscal targets v regular spending reviews to increase efficiency vi more frequent updates of forecasts given frequent shocks vii greater budget unity by setting a spending ceiling that is binding also for autonomous article 220 entities viii better coordination between the office of planning and budget and the budget office of the ministry of economy and finance to link strategic priorities and program evaluations to budget allocations and ix disclosure of risks including those associated with ppps budgetary targets should be set for the nfps in line with the recent shift in the focus of fiscal reporting b lowering inflation and reducing financial dollarization 20 inflation and inflation expectations remain persistently above the top of the target range the stance of monetary policy was tightened in october with the indicative reference for the growth rate of the m1 monetary aggregate lowered from 8 10 percent in 2019q3 to 7 9 percent in 2019q4 while interest rates have increased by about 100 basis points at the short end and by about 20 basis points at the longer end inflation and medium term inflation expectations have continued to increase currently standing at 8 4 percent and 8 percent respectively 21 with the expected growth boost the central bank will have the space to focus on reducing inflation towards the mid point of the target range if inflation stabilizes at current levels it would leave uruguay vulnerable to negative shocks which could raise inflation to double digits accordingly monetary indicative references should be further tightened such that real interest rates rise above the range of estimated neutral rates this should continue until inflation and inflation expectations are firmly at the mid point of the target range keeping inflation low and stable at the middle of the target range would also help support efforts to reduce dollarization and indexation and deepen financial markets and reinforce policy credibility the authorities should also continue to use the exchange rate as a shock absorber and interventions should be reserved for addressing disorderly market conditions as they are now and reserve buffers should be kept above prudential norms 22 further enhancements to the inflation targeting framework could be considered to keep inflation low and stable at the mid point of the target range conducting monetary policy is quite challenging in the presence of a high degree of dollarization low credit to gdp ratio remaining wage indexation and frequent shocks to the exchange rate at the same time a low and stable inflation is key to addressing these challenges enhancements could focus on strategies instruments and communication practices in particular communicating a clearer hierarchy of objectives with the primacy of price stability at the mid point of the target range and explaining in more detail the central bank s reaction function would guide expectations towards the mid point of the target range and reinforce the expectations channel 23 continued efforts to reduce the high degree of dollarization and indexation are welcome the revised guidelines for wage bargaining councils which introduced productivity considerations and delinked wages from past inflation are an important step towards reducing indexation both macroeconomic and price stability are critical to reducing dollarization in addition continued coordinated efforts to fine tune regulatory measures deepen financial markets and provide hedging opportunities would help further encourage local currency holding c financial sector preserving the resilience and supporting growth 24 the financial sector is resilient but medium term challenges remain thanks to prudent supervision and regulation uruguay s financial sector weathered the bouts of financial volatility in argentina well at the same time financial intermediation is chronically low with wide margins between credit and deposit rates in addition credit markets are segmented for dollar and peso loans with very high rates for the latter weakening the monetary transmission mechanism 25 the authorities are proceeding with appropriate steps to maintain financial sector resilience regulation on the net stable funding ratio requiring that the liquidity profiles of bank s assets and liabilities be aligned became effective in december regulation on countercyclical buffers requiring banks to accumulate additional capital during boom times will be submitted for public consultation in december in addition investment limits for pension funds were modified to incorporate exposures to ppp projects to limit concentration risks 26 authorities efforts to deepen financial markets are welcome these include efforts to i create benchmark curves ii increase the liquidity of instruments in secondary markets and iii foster financial inclusion and innovation by providing free access to bank accounts encouraging electronic transactions and analyzing ways to improve the payments system as a result electronic points of sale almost doubled between 2014 and 2019 and the amount of cash withdrawals began to decline in 2018 27 financial regulation should aim to strike the right balance between enabling innovation and competition on the one hand and addressing challenges to financial integrity stability and consumer protection on the other since the introduction of the regulation on peer to peer lending no fintech company has registered continued collaboration across state agencies the central bank and the industry would help advance the common goal of financial development and inclusion while ensuring proper risk management d structural reforms for sustainable and inclusive growth 28 uruguay has distinct structural strengths relative to peers it has strong governance and institutions a well functioning democracy a high degree of social cohesion a strong commitment to free trade as well as low rates of poverty inequality and informality its citizens enjoy a strong safety net and adequate protection of their rights overall uruguay is one of the top performers on many environmental social and governance esg indicators based on the world bank s sovereign esg data framework 29 building on these strengths further structural reforms are needed to ensure continued income convergence and maintain social achievements for future generations closing infrastructure gaps is an important step but by itself will not be sufficient to raise growth to the levels seen in the past decade a vibrant private sector is essential to support growth to this end uruguay needs to improve its education outcomes and the business environment in addition a corporate governance reform would improve the management and efficiency of soes which play a key role in the uruguayan economy 30 deterioration in labor market outcomes needs to be reversed employment and labor force participation have been falling in key sectors and the unemployment rate has risen particularly among the young to around 30 percent younger generations bear the brunt of the adjustment during downturns increasing concerns about both intergenerational equity and potential insider outsider issues in addition perception surveys indicate that there is room for

sudan one of the largest countries in the heart of africa has been struggling to stay afloat economically since the us imposed crippling trade and investment sanctions in 1997 the country also lost is main revenue source oil following the secession of south sudan in 2011 in this comprehensive analysis johan burger examines the status of the country s financial sector and what it needs to do to keep pace with developments in the rest of africa despite the lack of accurate statistics on sudan s total loss due to the us sanctions sudanese sources estimate it at around 500bn with an indirect loss estimated at about 4bn annually the us sanctions included a ban on all kinds of commercial and financial dealings with sudan the sudanese banking sector was therefore effectively cut off from the global financial system the sanctions not only severely damaged the sudanese economy they also included the freezing of more than 7m belonging to the banking sector in sudan the sanctions have caused heavy losses to foreign investors in sudan and added additional restrictions for exporters in commercial transactions the sanctions also led to a loss of trust between sudan and financial institutions and donor countries causing the country to lose predictable resources that were capable of filling in the external gap in the transport sector sudan airways has lost its place as a national carrier as the sanctions denied it access to spare parts and regular maintenance for planes which caused most of its aircraft to be out of service sudan s railway lost 83 of its infrastructure due to the sanctions in the health sector the sanctions prevented sudan from obtaining us medical equipment and medicines and decreased the efficiency of medical laboratories in the country prior to the lifting of sanctions sudan s economy was stricken by very high inflation 31 in march 2017 a fiscal deficit of 17 in 2016 and the sixth worst ranking in transparency international s corruption perceptions index in 2011 south sudan seceded from sudan costing the country 75 of its oil reserves estimated at 3 5bn barrels in 2014 the us tightened sanctions and levied a fine of 8 9bn against bnp paribas for illegal dealings with sudan the us decision to lift economic sanctions on sudan last year constituted a turning point in sudan s foreign relations marking its return to the world trade and financial system the lifting of the sanctions could enable sudan to restore its trade and economic relations and facilitate banking operations and procedures for exports and imports it would also ease access to commodities basic production inputs as well as health and education services in addition the country will now be able to resume its communication with international financial and investment institutions particularly for the sudanese private sector the lifting of the sanctions represents a new shift in commercial transactions both for exports and imports it will also contribute to improving the exchange rate of the sudanese currency the private sector could be the biggest beneficiary as there would be to greater access to financial sources to obtain funds the decision to lift sanctions will have a positive impact on the production sectors in sudan the agricultural sector represents the main production base of sudan s economy and will benefit from greater access to spare parts fertilizers seeds and modern technologies which will increase the productivity and exports it will also boost the competitiveness of sudanese agricultural products in foreign markets according to the central bank of sudan cbos it was only in october 2017 after the us lifted its trade sanctions that the country began receiving foreign currency inflows it confirmed the receipt of international transfers in us dollars to two sudanese banks in what was the first signal of the recovery of sudan s economy the country is hopeful that through helping it to regain access to global financial markets the lifting of sanctions could help draw in badly needed investments and raise the prospects for a recovery of sudan s economy sudan s financial services sector sudan s financial sector continues to be dominated by banks operating under islamic modes of finance and was composed of 37 banks at the end of 2016 equity injections to recapitalise weak banks have led to the cbos and the government fully or partially owning 41 of the banks sudan is characterised by weak financial inclusion and depth which can severely undermine the mobilisation of savings and the reduction of poverty credit to the private sector dropped by 52 3 to 6 7 of gdp at the end of 2016 from the maximum score in 2012 the absence of an interbank market has led to persistent excess reserves however the cbos is in the process of developing an effective shariah compliant liquidity management instrument sudan s stock exchange and insurance sectors are small with the khartoum stock exchange being the principal market for stock exchange dealings in the country nonetheless the online trading system introduced in march 2016 with african development bank afdb support is expected to enhance domestic resource mobilisation such as sukuk bonds on which sudan heavily depends for financing infrastructure and social services though sudan s banking system is still weaker than its sub saharan african counterparts it continues to improve return on assets is high 4 at the end of 2015 and banks overall capital adequacy ratio was 18 7 at the end of 2015 well above the minimum requirement of 10 the asset quality continues to improve with the ratio of non performing loans to total loans trending downwards and reaching 5 1 at the end of 2015 compared to 7 1 the previous year the easing of us sanctions should enable the cbos to strengthen the hard won framework for anti money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism the recovery in correspondent banking relationships should boost private sector activities and enhance access to financial services especially by the most vulnerable through remittances export receipts and import financing going further back in time economic social and human development prospects in sudan have significantly improved since the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement cpa in 2005 however conflict continues between the central government in khartoum and rebel groups in the rural west darfur poverty remains widespread and social services are inadequate to meet the needs of the vast majority of the population sudan s financial system while experiencing substantial growth in recent years remains small relative to its regional peers intermediation is low the equity and foreign exchange markets are shallow and non bank financial markets and institutions are small and underdeveloped still the banking sector forms the backbone of sudan s financial system and is the primary source of funding for the domestic economy public banks dominate the sector and account for around 50 of total banking sector assets systemic risk is estimated to be low largely due to low levels of intermediation and the sector s small size and relative isolation from global financial markets despite recent growth in the banking sector sudan continues to be under banked as most banking and financial institutions are concentrated around the khartoum area only a small share of the population has access to banking services and enterprises often face difficulties in obtaining funding from banks or capital markets in efforts to increase access to finance the cbos established a microfinance unit in 2007 and has since 2009 required all commercial banks operating in the country to have established microfinance offices and allocate 12 of total loans to microfinance lending operations the cbos also introduced the private sector development project in 2009 which offers grants to prospective entrepreneurs via a business plan competition improving banking performance improving banking performance about a decade ago authorities embarked on a series of reforms to strengthen the financial system and improve the performance of the banking sector supervisory and legal and regulatory frameworks were improved particularly in the areas of corporate governance risk management and provisioning restructuring processes were also implemented for two banks including the omdurman national bank to improve their financial position sudan s fixed income market is based on islamic shariah fundamentals government musharaka certificates and government investment certificates similar to conventional treasury bills and government bonds as well as central bank igarah certificates additional islamic certificates are regularly issued by the ministry of finance and national economy as of april 2011 sudan received no long term sovereign rating by any of the three major credit rating agencies a corporate bond market is also present but as of mid 2010 only three corporate entities have been issuing debt instruments the primary market largely composed of the sudan financial services company ltd which markets and trades all government securities does not feature a minimum competitive bidding amount and instead imposes restrictions on purchasing amounts when demand exceeds available supply security instruments are also traded on the khartoum stock exchange and around 40 brokerage firms operate in the market secondary market activity is limited to over the counter trades and is largely dominated by government securities access to securities markets is open to local and foreign investors including banks corporate entities financial institutions and individuals with the exception of igarah certificates that are restricted to banks the insurance sector in sudan is small and penetration is limited factors contributing to low levels of penetration include low per capita income a missing middle class political instability and the prevailing rate of financial illiteracy the state is heavily involved in the sector it accounts for some 40 of total insurance market premiums and owns the largest company sheikan even though the authorities have strived to upgrade the regulatory framework most of the insurance market still does not comply with principles set by the international association of insurance supervisors iais and the powers of the insurance supervisory agency isa are relatively weak as for corporate banks the bank of khartoum is the largest bank in sudan according to the cbos there are currently 34 banks in sudan of these there are a number of foreign banks which include the following abu dhabi national bank qatar national bank national bank of egypt khartoum aljazeera sudanese jordanian bank sudanese egyptian bank saudi sudanese bank byblos bank africa commercial banking sector the commercial banking sector in sudan is weak and small by international standards in addition to the commercial banks the cbos plays an active and sometimes a very direct role in financing the economic activities in the country it strictly controls and directs the commercial banks through pervasive interventionist policies there is hardly any non bank financing sector in sudan in 2015 only two leasing companies operated in the country mainly in the field of equipment leasing the big commercial banks almost never financed such endeavours in the extractive industries with the exception of a few who have entered the field of gold prospecting as investors constrained by their lack of size and the restrictive credit policies of the cbos there is hardly any financing role in the prospecting field for oil gas and mineral activities the sudanese banks have no capital sharing in any of the oil and gas blocks or concessions these are financed by the foreign investors through production sharing agreements psa in consortia of three or four foreign companies the government being one of them with free carried shares held by sudapet on behalf of the sudan government the psas seem to work to the satisfaction of both parties this is manifested by the foreign parties undertaking other associated activities like financing the building of pipelines and refineries and not only prospecting for oil by the end of 2015 the local banking sector played no role in the financing of oil and gas prospecting instead they banks were content with providing traditional banking services to some of the local contractors serving the oil industry these included providing bank guarantees letters of credit and sometimes murabaha cost plus financing for equipment and machinery needed for effecting some contracts in financial terms this comes a distant second to the sums spent on oil and gas prospecting and infrastructure mining is a relatively recent activity in the country with a single notable exception the local banks were never persuaded to finance prospecting operations they focused on financing on a murabaha basis some of the needed equipment and machinery and have yet to provide export facilities or services the cbos can initiate and participate in investment funds to undertake mining for minerals or oil it can persuade or reward banks who finance prospecting which is a risky business the ministry of finance can give guarantees and assured rebates on money spent on oil gas and mining prospecting this is done in most countries of the world the ministry s perspective is that sudan should develop the requisite policies to avoid its extractive industries from falling into foreign hands sudanese banks had opened branches in arab asian and european countries to allow the easy movement of hard currency and to re establish banking relations in anticipation of the decision by the us to permanently lift economic sanctions agreements had been reached to restore links with international banks especially in the uae germany and belarus for investments to flourish it was essential that workable financial exchange systems were in place the united arab bank had approved the bank of khartoum s final licence to practise banking and open branches in the uae an exclusive brokerage group of us companies in sudan and the middle east had given approval for hard currency transfers to be facilitated through sudan s agricultural bank the approval by us banks of hard currency transfers especially in dollars will largely result in a revitalisation of the trade between sudan and the us as well as enable american investment in sudan particularly in agriculture and mining this still seems to be future music as there is currently very little evidence of such trade between sudan and the us in july 2017 the bank of khartoum which already has a branch in bahrain for hard currency transfers received a long term aa rating and a short term rating with a stable outlook from the international islamic rating agency according to yacoub al alem head of the corporate banking group of the bank of khartoum in 2016 in terms of finance corporate clients in sudan enjoyed a broad range of well structured shariah compliant products islamic finance products in sudan are considered to some of the most diverse among countries with predominantly shariah compliant banking practices electronic transactions lagging in terms of non finance products and in particular cash management and electronic transactions the banking sector in sudan still needs considerable development and improvement this would include the following enhancing the existing electronic infrastructure to allow straight through payment processing between banks is a crucial requirement developing flexible cash management products to meet the increased volume of bank notes caused by monetisation of the deficit improving corporate customer services to meet the increasing expectations of corporate clients as the banks are aware of these challenges they have started to address them there is still a lot of work to be done the bank of khartoum adopted a number of strategies at the time to deal with these issues their key strategies in financing government infrastructure include developing deep relationships with key people at federal and state level the bank also played a pioneering role in the developing and marketing of sukuk in sudan which are essential instruments for infrastructure finance some of the challenges in financing such products include the substantial budget deficits and debt burdens at federal and state levels limiting the ability of the government to raise additional finance there were also limited opportunities to diversify project risk as a limited number of syndications were executed high interest rates also rendered many long term projects unprofitable opportunities in agriculture finance the bank of khartoum believes that there will be great opportunities in agricultural finance over the next few years the agricultural and livestock sector is benefitting greatly from the devaluation of the sudanese pound and the resulting enhanced competitive positioning of agricultural exports in foreign markets they plan to get involved in financing all stages of the value chain from farming activities warehouse financing to industrial processing and pre export finance their focus is not only on financing large agribusiness and trading companies but also includes the financing of communities and small farms through microfinance and commercial finance for the youth simultaneously currently the bank of khartoum declares it offers well structured and customized finance solutions needed to facilitate management of working capital and expenditure including mudaraba lc against mudaraba musharaka partnership qard hasan grant istisna mugawala made to order salam purchase with deferred delivery ijarra leasing murabaha cost plus sale bai muajjal deferred sale with its large number of correspondent banks and its international branches in both the kingdom of bahrain and the united arab emirates the bank of khartoum s corporate clients have the capacity to transfer funds globally the islamic trade finance corporation itfc from saudi arabia creates tailor made shariah compliant solutions in this way itfc has managed to harness a diversified portfolio with sugar as one of the major commodities it lent its support to the private sector in sudan by financing a significant sugar deal which helped in advancing the private sector s role through a sustained commitment to improve access to value added and competitive financing the itfc was able to design the first co financed operation provided by the islamic development bank group idb to the private sector in sudan by extending such financing to sudan itfc supported the sugar manufacturing industry in order to get sudan recognised once again as the biggest and the only sugar exporter in the region the itfc has not only creatively designed this operation it has also supported along with the other co financers the biggest agri industrial company in sudan and by this the co financiers supported the agricultural sector representing 27 of sudan s gdp as well as the industrial sector representing 36 of sudan s gdp the itfc believes that this financing operation is a step forward on the way of its strategies to support and develop the economy of sudan however in spite of signs of improvement and despite the us ending a trade embargo banks across the world still seem wary of working with sudan mobile financial services mobile financial services took off in east africa more than a decade ago in sudan however it took quite a bit longer before this phenomenon entered the market in august 2014 zain sudan launched sudan s first mobile financial service called hassa in partnership with the bank of khartoum the service allows all zain customers in sudan to complete a wide range of financial transactions and operations including money transfers and various other transactions such as paying bills and withdrawing cash from atms without the requirement of opening a bank account the hassa service will be made available in 95 of sudan s populated areas and will provide many benefits for the users specifically and the sudanese society in general the sudanese government supported this venture as the extension of financial services to the unbanked in sudan would have a significant impact on the economic development and social enhancement of many communities across sudan in addition the cbos supported the initiative given the envisaged economic and social gains that are likely to accrue from extending banking services to the unbanked as well as for the potential to attract more national savings through formalised channels in order to improve the efficiencies of hassa redcloud s iceni platform a customisable solution for m commerce was contracted to provide hassa customers with access to essential financial services these would include the easy transfer of money doing cash in and cash out transactions and the tracking of accounts after a few months the service has been upgraded and will offer electricity payments mobile payments bank transfers and the ability to purchase mobile airtime from phones additionally customers will be able to use hassa shops or bank of khartoum atms to deposit cash and make withdrawals directly from their mobile accounts conclusion given the lifting of sanctions against sudan the country offers unique investment opportunities and a welcoming business climate for the natural resources mining industry the agricultural industry the livestock industry as well as several others sudan is an emerging investment opportunity offering access to one of the few untouched markets in the world it is important for the normalisation of sudan however that the us removes it from the list of countries sponsoring terrorism the financial services industry is important for the development of sudan it is clear that the banks in the sector make extensive use of shariah compliant products however there are still various challenges for the optimal functioning of the industry one of the most serious issues is the liquidity crunch sudan is currently facing the scarcity of cash is causing countless challenges amongst others the inability to fund its diplomats and embassies at an operational level the development of mobile cash applications will stand the country in good stead it will provide the means for the country to increase the number of consumers included in the formal financial system

open this photo in gallery anti eviction graffiti is painted on apartment buildings in berlin which imposed a five year rent freeze in the city after rents jumped more than 50 per cent in five years lena mucha the new york times news service europe s economy is struggling to gain traction after years of anemic growth but the rock bottom interest rates meant to power a recovery are fuelling a property boom that is creating a new set of problems money is so cheap a 20 year mortgage can be had in paris or frankfurt germany at a rate of less than 1 per cent that borrowers are flocking to buy apartments and houses and institutional investors seeing a chance for lucrative returns are acquiring swaths of residential real estate in cities across europe in some parts of europe said jorg kramer chief economist at commerzbank in frankfurt valuations have already returned to or exceeded levels that preceded the continent s debt crisis a decade ago igniting concerns that the property boom could end badly the risks are real because negative interest rates in europe are cemented mr kramer said what s important for the economy as a whole is to prevent the emergence of a dangerous new bubble demand has surged in the five years since the european central bank pushed one of its benchmark interest rates below zero a step never before tried on such a scale prices jumped at least 30 per cent in frankfurt amsterdam stockholm madrid and other metropolitan hot spots and are up an average of over 40 per cent in portugal luxembourg slovakia and ireland that has made home ownership increasingly unaffordable for almost most anyone except high earners while also driving up rents pushing working class people farther from urban centres a political backlash is unfolding as european mayors intervene in the market with rent controls higher property taxes and subsidized housing programs it plays into a sense of social distress said loic bonneval a sociologist at the max weber centre in lyon a social research organization while low rates helped produce a rebound in the euro zone economists say the policies now appear to be doing more harm than good clouding the bank s efforts to reverse inequality they have not resolved fundamental problems like weak business investment nor have they revived inflation which helps lift wages anywhere but in the housing market the dynamics have totally changed in a short period of time said matthias holzhey the head of swiss real estate at ubs and the lead author of an annual report on property price spikes in major global cities in some parts of europe he said low rates are pushing real estate valuations into the bubble risk zone financial authorities are on alert in september the european systemic risk board an arm of the european central bank that helps regulate europe s financial system called on 11 countries including luxembourg austria denmark and sweden to pursue regulations and tax measures meant to rein in prices and promote housing affordability and availability the bundesbank germany s central bank said recently that real estate in german cities had been overvalued by 15 per cent to 30 per cent in other words that there is a bubble the ubs survey cited munich frankfurt amsterdam and paris as cities at risk and a study by the global accounting firm deloitte touche cautioned that average house prices will exceed precrisis levels if the european central bank keeps interest rates at zero as planned housing prices have risen sharply in the united states as well but there the boom has been driven by individual buyers household debt has been held in check and lending standards have remained relatively tight all factors that reduce the chance of another collapse moreover while benchmark interest rates in the united states have been kept low they were never negative and have now been above zero for several years some economists say that the concerns in europe are overblown and that prices are overvalued but not in a danger zone for one thing job creation from the economic recovery however tepid or uneven has expanded the ranks of creditworthy borrowers and buyers are mainly living in properties or renting them out rather than flipping them as happened before the crisis the supply of urban housing however has failed to keep pace with the resulting demand disrupters like airbnb have added to the crunch by converting residential properties into vacation stays the result is a shortage of affordable housing particularly in the rental sector squeezing middle and low income earners such as teachers firefighters nurses and retail employees who work in cities but cannot afford to live in them the dynamics are worsening as deep pocketed domestic and foreign investors pivot from focusing almost exclusively on commercial real estate to acquiring residential housing around europe pension and insurance funds which typically invest in government bonds have found it impossible to make money off countries like germany where the interest rate paid is less than zero that has driven them into real estate funds which offer high returns in comparison to bonds rents and mortgages consume a quarter of monthly income on average up from 17 per cent two decades ago according to data compiled by housing europe a federation of affordable housing groups one tenth of europeans spend over 40 per cent of their income on housing the rates are sharply higher for the poorest households house prices have risen much faster than citizens incomes said cedric van styvendael the organization s president it s a problem for europe wages and salaries in the euro zone grew 2 7 per cent in the three months to june in 2019 compared with a year earlier the scarcity of affordable housing is fuelling resentment and political strife in madrid and barcelona home prices have jumped more than 30 per cent since 2016 pushing rents up as landlords sought bigger returns prime minister pedro sánchez capped rents in spain this summer at the rate of inflation now 0 4 per cent limiting income for property owners in paris where 70 per cent of residents are renters mayor anne hidalgo imposed new rent controls while rents are limited by strict housing regulations they have risen 40 per cent between 2000 and 2018 as property prices keep climbing they recently broke a record of 10 000 euros 14 570 on average per square metre or about 1 315 per square foot one of the highest prices in europe ms hidalgo is taking other steps to prevent the city from becoming a ghetto for the rich her plans include building subsidized housing that families with modest incomes can purchase at half the market rate few places have felt the impact as sharply as berlin since the fall of the berlin wall 30 years ago workers artists and students have increasingly been displaced by an influx of young professionals with families but property prices and rents have skyrocketed in recent years as home buyers and investors double down the city imposed a five year rent freeze the toughest in europe in the summer after rents jumped more than 50 per cent in five years and gave tenants the right to demand reductions if rents go too high german real estate stocks have slumped since the ruling for kathrin hauer 39 the measures are urgent she was a student nearly two decades ago when she became a tenant in a world war ii era building formerly owned by the east german government on schoenhauser allee a central street ms hauer who works as a costume and set designer for german theatres was long happy with the monthly rent of less than 600 for her apartment which was bought by a small group of investors after communism then in 2016 the building was sold to an investment company last december right before a national law limiting rent increases was to take effect the company announced major construction work that would raise rents on the low income tenants by 250 per cent ms hauer s rent would surge to almost 2 000 a month far more than she could afford this is meant to scare us to get out ms hauer said the tenants won an order from the city s planning department to halt the renovations which included large elevators balconies and floor to ceiling windows soon after in a move that tenants believe was a form of retaliation ms hauer said the investors ordered all the trees in the interior courtyard to be razed and hired a middleman to persuade tenants to agree to the renovations and accept buyouts itai amir the director of the company that now owns the building would not comment for this article wibke werner the deputy director of berliner mieterverein an association of berlin renters with more 170 000 members said that because of the low interest rates investors were betting on concrete gold these investments are designed to optimize returns she said which means rising rents and the crowding out of low income households in denmark which is not part of the euro zone but closely tracks ecb monetary policy benchmark interest rates have been negative for seven years seeking greater returns some danish pension funds are buying large holdings of prime real estate and new buildings to offer for rent but rents have grown so high that the city is considering capping them which could cut into those investments at the same time rates are so low that bargains being offered by banks are hard to pass up in august jyske bank of denmark began offering 10 year fixed rate mortgages at negative 0 5 per cent interest before fees meaning the amount outstanding on the loan will be reduced each month by more than the borrower has paid nordea bank is offering 20 year loans at zero interest while banks have stopped flooding mailboxes with credit card offers a common practice before the debt crisis offering ultracheap mortgage loans is a way of luring new customers that has tempted borrowers in the netherlands to go to extremes while dutch banks took steps to curb lending this year dutch households held mortgage debt of 527 billion euros 768 billion at the end of march equal to nearly two thirds of the dutch economy the dutch central bank warned recently that systemic risk in the dutch housing market posed the biggest threat to financial stability a sudden fall in housing prices could be disastrous for households and banks it said because borrowers are overextended with little room to manoeuvre the european central bank recently called on politicians in euro countries to take bolder steps to prevent asset bubbles from growing this is all new territory mr holzhey of ubs said some caution is warranted because in the past no one really forecast a house price crash he said headlines always said prices are rising but there s no bubble

by alasdair macleod via mises since the turn of the millennium there have been two global bank credit crises the first was the deflation of the dot com bubble in 2001 2 and the second the 2008 9 financial crisis that wiped out lehman brothers it was clear from these events that the debate over moral hazard was resolved in favour of supporting not just the banks but big business and stock market valuations as well furthermore america s budget deficits were becoming a permanent fixture this brings us to the current situation which increasingly appears to be on the edge of another cyclical crisis if so it marks the end of a period of far greater monetary and credit expansion than seen in previous cycles coinciding with a smoot hawley lookalike in the trade war between the two largest global economies the following big picture factors are relevant to the likely timing for a credit crisis global debt has accumulated to an estimated 255 trillion up from about 173 trillion at the time of the lehman brothers crisis an alarming proportion of it is unproductive being government debt consumer loans and funding for financial speculation as well as owed by unviable businesses with annual debt payments already accounting for most of the us budget deficit and that deficit getting larger any rise in dollar interest rates would be ruinous for federal government finances eurozone governments are in a similarly precarious financial position governments are ensnared in a classic debt trap an estimated 17 trillion of global bonds are negative yielding which is unprecedented this is a market distortion so extreme that it cannot be normalised without widespread financial disruption and debtor destruction there is no exit from this condition the repo market crisis in new york indicates the banking system is in intensive care the start of it coincided with the completion of the sale of deutsche bank s prime dealership to bnp it would be understandable if large deposits had failed to transfer with the business and gone to rivals instead the problem has continued indicating that senior bankers groupthink is already turning from greed to fear us bank exposure to collateralised loan obligations and the leveraged loan market comprised mainly of junk loans and bonds is the equivalent of most of the estimated 1 9 trillion sum of bank capital it confirms this article s thesis that the level of ignorance over banking risk is the late stage of the bank credit cycle and likely to be catastrophic the share prices of deutsche bank and commerzbank indicate they are not just insolvent but will need to be rescued and soon banks in other eurozone jurisdictions are in a similar situation however all eurozone countries have passed bail in laws and do not expect to bail out individual banks the upshot is at the first sign of a bail in being considered a flight of large deposits will very likely be triggered and bank bond prices for all eurozone issuers will collapse the room for error in crisis management by central banks is considerably greater than at the time of the lehman crisis eleven years ago an extreme amount of monetary creation over the last ten years and the us china trade war over the last two is horribly reminiscent of late 1929 when the combination of the end of the credit cycle and escalating trade protectionism combined to wreak financial destruction on a global scale even if a halt to the trade war between the us and china is agreed in the coming weeks the crisis has been triggered and our empirical evidence suggests it will get worse it appears that common sense on trade policies is unlikely to prevail because the conflict is far deeper than just trade with the hong kong riots part of the overall picture the chinese believe america has destabilised hong kong and with good reason the us treasury has become dependent on receiving the lion s share of international portfolio flows to support the dollar and finance the us budget deficit and china s own investment demands are a threat with the dollar s hegemony under attack and china seeking those same portfolio flows to invest in her own infrastructure projects through the hong kong shanghai connect link hong kong had to be destabilised for this and other reasons trade tariffs are only part of a wider financial war which is increasingly likely to escalate further rather than abate with his trade policies having backfired badly president trump is now under pressure with time running out before the election in a year s time he is threatened with impeachment by congress over the ukraine affair and his popularity ahead of an election year remains subdued he has even appealed to jay powell chairman of the fed to introduce negative interest rates to boost the economy backing down over china is unlikely because it would be a presidential policy failure what will the developing crisis look like clearly central banks will respond to the next credit crisis with an even greater expansion of money quantity than at the time of the lehman crisis eleven years ago the consequence of this monetary inflation seems certain to lead to an even greater rate of loss of purchasing power for fiat currencies than currently indicated by independent assessments of price inflation we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us monetary inflation is likely to be directed at resolving two broad problems providing a safety net for the banks and big businesses as well as funding rising government deficits therefore the amount of quantitative easing which will be central to satisfying these objectives will soar the effect on markets will differ from being a rerun of the 1929 32 example in one key respect ninety years ago the two major currencies the dollar and sterling were on a gold exchange standard which meant that during the crisis asset and commodity prices were effectively measured in gold today there is no gold backing and prices will be measured in expanding quantities of fiat currency prices measured in fiat currencies will be determined ultimately by the course of monetary policy but in real terms the outlook is for a repeat of the conditions that afflicted markets and economies during and following the 1929 wall street crash a further difference from the depression years is that today western governments have extensive legal obligations to provide their citizens with welfare the cost of which is escalating in real terms add to this the cost of rising unemployment and a decline in tax revenue and we can see that government deficits and debts will increase rapidly even in a moderate recession this brings us to an additional problem likely to be evident in a secondary phase of the credit crisis as it becomes obvious that the purchasing power of fiat currencies is being undermined at a rate which is impossible to conceal through statistical methods the discounted value of future money reflected in its time preference will rise irrespective of interest rate policy consequently borrowers will be faced with rising interest rates to compensate for both increasing time preference and the additional loan risk faced by lending to different classes of borrowers besides closing off virtually all debt financing for businesses and increasingly indebted consumers this will play havoc with governments accustomed to borrowing at suppressed or even negative interest rates prices for existing bonds will collapse and banks loaded up with government debt to benefit from basel committee on banking supervision regulations will find their slender capital if they have any left quickly eroded the world of fiat currencies faces no less than its last hurrah indeed some of the more prescient central bankers appear concerned the current system is running out of road with the dollar as the world s reserve currency no longer fit for this purpose they want to find a means of resetting everything exploring solutions such as digitising currency through blockchains doing away with cash and finding other avenues to try to control the so called vagaries of free markets none of them will work because even a new form of money will require inflation to rescue government finances and prevent financial and economic failure the accelerating pace of monetary creation to address these problems will remain the one problem central to the failure of a system of credit and monetary creation the impossibility of resolving the debt trap that has ensnared us all just as germany found in 1923 monetary inflation as a means of funding government and other economic liabilities is a process that rapidly gets out of its control eventually people understand the debasement fraud and begin to dispose of the fiat currency as rapidly as possible it then has no value the ending of the fiat currency regime is bound to terminate the repeating cycles of bank credit legitimised since 1844 the socialism of money through inflationary debasement will be exposed as a massive fraud perpetrated on ordinary people

china s top leaders have recently begun to tout china s own development success as an example for others to replicate former chinese vice minister for foreign affairs he yafei for example has claimed that the success of the chinese model offers other developing countries an option different from the american model for economic development in his address to the 19th chinese communist party congress in october 2017 president xi jinping argued that china s successful development experience was blazing a new trail for other developing countries to achieve modernization china s belt and road initiative bri launched in 2013 is commonly viewed as the primary vehicle for promoting a china model of development encompassing 123 countries the bri commits china to provide 1 trillion in financing over the next decade for hundreds of infrastructure projects roads railways ports pipelines electrical grids and energy plants designed to connect both land and maritime networks stretching from southeast asia to europe but will it work can other developing countries emulate china s own economic success by riding the bri train probably not this is because the development path promoted through the bri is fundamentally different from china s own experience and where there is overlap the bri emulates the most problematic aspects of chinese political economy by externalizing opaque crony like relations among policy banks large state owned construction firms and local politicians the following comparisons underline these conclusions while the bri promotes an infrastructure first model china s heaviest period of infrastructure investment followed rather than preceded its most rapid era of growth bri boosters view scarce infrastructure as a key bottleneck that holds back rapid development china is offered as an example of how an infrastructure first approach can release the genies of economic growth in fact however china s heaviest period of infrastructure spending followed rather than preceded rapid growth and was only possible due to earlier development successes to be sure china has massively invested in network of roads rails airports seaports electrical grids dams and pipelines yet state controlled infrastructure has been less central to china s development than the private sector which economist nicholas lardy describes as playing a dominant role in china s economic transformation as yasheng huang has documented rural entrepreneurship fueled economic growth during the 1980s well before later waves of infrastructure spending began to swell if there was a china model during the first decades of reform it lay in a localized constantly evolving and experimental process that yuen yuen ang has labeled directed improvisation the heaviest infrastructure spending in china came over the past decade during a period of declining economic growth beginning with the global financial crisis of 2008 chinese leaders have relied upon construction as a prop for employment but this overinvestment led to diminishing returns the incremental capital output ratio fell by half in the decade after 2007 as infrastructure approaches a point of saturation indeed a major motivation for the bri is to put china s construction assets to work abroad as the need for new projects recedes at home a study conducted by oxford economists recently concluded that china is headed for an infrastructure led national financial and economic crisis as a result of wasteful and inefficient infrastructure spending they also warned china is not a model to follow for other economies emerging or developed as regards infrastructure investing but a model to avoid in sum the narrative that state led infrastructure provided the special sauce of chinese growth and one that can be exported abroad is flawed in contrast with the bri model chinese growth was fueled by internal savings rather than external borrowing china s extraordinarily high savings rate accounting for close to half of gdp in recent years has financed high levels of investment in industry and infrastructure in contrast infrastructure investment under the bri is explicitly linked to high levels of external borrowing as in latin america and africa during the 1980s and 90s the current buildup of international debt by many developing countries may prove unsustainable in 2017 bloomberg reported that of 68 countries listed as bri partners the sovereign debt of 27 was rated as junk or below while another 14 were not rated by the top three international rating firms or had withdrawn requests for ratings the center for global development has identified eight countries whose high level of debt distress is directly tied to chinese lending and two dozen countries owe china an amount exceeding 10 percent of their gdp bri loans from the china development bank or the china export import bank typically carry tougher terms than those from the world bank or other international financial institutions interest rates are higher and payback periods are shorter contracts are withheld from public view loans are typically tied to no bid contracts with chinese state owned enterprises soes which rely principally upon chinese inputs and workers borrowers are required to pledge existing assets as collateral and to place significant sums in escrow accounts located within china disputes must be taken to chinese arbitration courts that apply chinese law since 2000 chinese banks have restructured or written off 140 loans to developing countries as the grace periods on many of the large loans of recent years expire the need for debt restructuring will likely grow some recipient governments including those in tanzania malaysia nepal and pakistan have pushed back against the tough terms demanded by china by canceling or renegotiating contracts recipient governments have also become bolder in demanding concessions as they realize that china has few means to compel payments from reluctant borrowers in short debt fueled development is not only risky but also the opposite of china s own path the political conditions that support infrastructure development in china do not exist in many bri countries dams ports highways and the like run up debt displace people damage the natural environment and invite corruption for these reasons infrastructure projects often produce popular resistance despite potential economic payoffs down the road an authoritarian single party state has certain advantages in managing such resistance lee chih horng a research fellow at the longus institute in singapore observes that chinese officials can easily stifle public debate and concerns about infrastructure projects legal challenges are limited by the communist party s ultimate control over the court system the state owns major media outlets and both traditional and new media are subject to various forms of censorship non governmental organizations are limited in size and scope heavily regulated and incapable of directly challenging state priorities grassroots protests mounted by those negatively impacted by infrastructure development are managed through a combination of repression and cooptation political conditions are very different in many of the countries hosting bri projects few developing country governments possess such extensive capacities to control the political risks of infrastructure development as a result many bri projects have become embroiled in controversy resistance and delay popular protest has hindered some bri projects as in indonesia myanmar and bangladesh perhaps due in part to the fact that as journalist tom miller notes chinese firms are happy working with local elites and unelected officials but much less adept at dealing with civil society in other cases such as kenya courts have suspended projects for inadequate social and environmental assessment in pakistan the 54 billion china pakistan economic corridor cpec has been threatened by baloch separatists who have blown up gas pipelines assaulted chinese engineers and attacked the chinese consulate in karachi the pakistan army has deployed 10 000 troops to protect cpec projects given this track record it is perhaps not surprising that one survey of chinese firms found that the number one concern about investing abroad cited by 71 percent of respondents was political risk yin yili vice president of china communication construction company has remarked that chinese firms lack the ability to discern where to invest or effectively manage overseas risks an american enterprise institute study of unsuccessful overseas chinese investment projects found that one quarter failed due to political factors the state owned china export credit insurance corporation that covers government seizures nationalization political violence and other risks has paid out 1 73 billion on claims related to bri investments and exports since 2013 as projects struggle in areas of strategic interest china will be tempted to intervene in order to safeguard its investments its people and its political influence the people s liberation army has been instructed to develop options for protecting overseas interests in some cases china may seek to shore up repressive regimes or bypass democratic institutions in order to avert lost investments and influence in general china s oft touted foreign policy principle of noninterference in the political affairs of other countries has become increasingly untenable rather than boosting developmental states the bri is strengthening rentier states like its east asian neighbors china pursued rapid export led growth built around increasingly diverse and sophisticated manufacturing sectors grounded in close public private partnerships led by a developmental state in china s case state industrial policies and the persistence of a highly concentrated state owned sector were combined with a competitive private sector significant foreign owned enterprises and growth oriented local governments the design of the bri by contrast supports a very different model the rentier state rentier state elites profit by using state resources to siphon riches from narrow flows of commodity exports rentier states are typically authoritarian or semi authoritarian rife with corruption and spend little on the supply of public goods a recent study released by the united nations conference on trade and development found that two thirds of developing countries remain heavily dependent upon commodity exports including agricultural goods energy and minerals rather than helping these countries to escape the economic and political burdens of dependence upon extractive industries the bri is serving to more deeply entrench rentier states that enrich elites via profits from commodity exports while providing few incentives for economic innovation or diversification despite widespread expectations that the bri would allow china to export labor intensive light manufacturing to recipient countries as wages rise in china itself this effect has mostly been limited to a few southeast asian countries in africa by contrast one study finds that few african countries have been able to benefit from large scale chinese investment outside the resource sector this rentier state model is unlikely to yield the rapid diversified growth that china s developmental state achieved where the bri model does replicate aspects of chinese political economy the bri has served as a transmission belt for the export of a particular and relatively recently consolidated fragment of china s political economy according to andrew batson china research director for gavekal the belt and road is really the expansion of a specific part of china s domestic political economy to the rest of the world that is the nexus between state owned contractors and state owned banks which formed in the domestic infrastructure building spree construction that began after the 2008 global financial crisis according to batson the local governments that borrowed heavily for internal chinese infrastructure development are mirrored within the bri by developing country recipients which play a similar role china s large policy banks such as the china export import bank and the china development bank are under enormous pressure to maintain growth at home by juicing credit and to recycle china s dollar surplus by lending abroad meanwhile china s enormous state owned enterprises need a constant stream of infrastructure orders both at home and abroad in order to avoid mass layoffs lee jones and zizheng zou have argued that the bri is less a grand strategic gambit than a response to soe pressures as they attempt to overcome overcapacity resource constraints and declining profits at home as a result central authorities struggle to exert control over banks soes and local governments or to lessen the gap between broad policy pronouncements and on the ground realities the result is that the unbalanced and excessively infrastructure heavy patterns of investment that have distorted china s own economy over the past decade are being promoted abroad through the bri that is not exporting success but rather replicating risk david skidmore is a professor in the department of political science at drake university in des moines iowa usa skidmore is author co author or editor of six books including a monograph titled the unilateralist temptation in american foreign policy routledge 2011 most recently his co authored article on the asian infrastructure investment bank appeared in the chinese journal of international politics march 2019
haunted by trade tensions a manufacturing downturn and geopolitical uncertainty 2019 is set to witness the weakest global economic expansion in a decade at this delicate juncture where the global economy remains fragile even though the financial crisis ended 10 years ago more certainty an anchor if you will is needed that is why the world economy will breathe a sigh of relief as the chinese economy has remained resilient this year synchronized slowdown in global growth the global economy is in a synchronized slowdown said the international monetary fund imf in its latest world economic outlook in the october outlook the imf further downgraded its expectations for world economic growth to 3 percent for 2019 the slowest pace since the global financial crisis growth for advanced economies is projected to slow to 1 7 percent in 2019 while emerging market and developing economies will experience growth of 3 9 percent this year a notable feature of the sluggish growth in 2019 is the sharp and geographically broad based slowdown in manufacturing and global trade the washington based institution said u s gross domestic product gdp increased at a 2 1 percent annualized rate in the third quarter marking a sharp deceleration from the 3 1 percent in the first quarter with growth in consumer spending which accounts for about 70 percent of u s economic activity at a 2 9 percent rate lower than the 4 6 percent growth pace in the second quarter the european union s statistics office eurostat estimated that eurozone growth was a meager 0 2 percent in the third quarter against the previous three months the same as in the second quarter and lower than that of the first quarter moreover the european commission has said that euro area gdp is forecast to expand by 1 1 percent in 2019 downgraded by 0 1 percentage points from its previous projections japan s gdp grew an annualized 1 8 percent in july september the weakest growth seen this year as sales tax hike and weakening external demand are hanging over its economy among emerging market and developing economies india grew by 4 5 percent during july september quarter the slowest growth pace in six years the european bank for reconstruction and development predicted that the russian economy will record growth of 1 1 percent in 2019 south africa s economy shrank by 0 6 percent in the third quarter with its yearly economic growth rate projected at just 0 5 percent according to the un s economic commission for latin america and the caribbean the region s overall growth this year should be only 0 1 percent easy monetary policy mounting uncertainty combined with insufficient technological innovation aging populations and geopolitical disputes have posed challenges to global economic expansion among them rising trade tensions initiated by protectionists and their impact on exports as well as industrial production took a major toll on the world economy according to the world trade organization wto trade flows hit by new restrictions implemented by wto members continued at a historically high level between mid october 2018 and mid may 2019 with the trade coverage of import restrictive measures implemented during the review period estimated at 339 5 billion u s dollars the geneva based organization also said recently that world merchandise trade volumes are expected to rise by only 1 2 percent in 2019 substantially slower than the 2 6 percent growth forecast in april an economic outlook issued this year by the organization for economic co operation and development identified trade tensions as the principal factor weighing on the world economy it underlined that the cycle of trade disputes hurts manufacturing disrupts global value chains and generates significant uncertainty analysts said that behind the main challenges facing the world economy are the trade protectionist moves by certain countries and disruption to the rules based multilateral trading system to dampen the headwinds from slowing global growth numerous central banks including the u s federal reserve and the european central bank have announced interest cuts in an attempt to stimulate economies some of which even adopted unconventional monetary measures such as negative interest rates easy monetary policies across advanced and emerging economies may have helped avert a serious economic downturn in the short run but challenges such as rising debt inflated asset bubbles and increased vulnerability of the financial system have also emerged vitor gaspar director of the imf fiscal affairs department advised policymakers to follow prudent fiscal policies saying that the interest rates are negative in many advanced economies and further decreases in policy interest rates are limited china s role in pursuit of certainty china and the united states have agreed on the text of a phase one economic and trade agreement based on the principle of equality and mutual respect according to a statement issued by the chinese side on friday as the global economy faces downward pressure the agreement will boost confidence in the global market stabilize market expectations and create a favorable environment for normal economic trade and investment activities the statement said policymakers must undo the trade barriers put in place with durable agreements rein in geopolitical tensions and reduce domestic policy uncertainty imf chief economist gita gopinath has said such actions can help boost confidence and reinvigorate investment manufacturing and trade gopinath added in the october world economic outlook the imf projected a modest improvement in global growth to 3 4 percent in 2020 with 1 7 percent for advanced economies and 4 6 percent for emerging market and developing economies next year emerging and developing economies are expected to act as the main engine of the world economy with china s role of a stabilizer and engine china s overall gdp growth reached 6 2 percent year on year in the first three quarters of this year the fastest among major economies worldwide according to official data facing significant external headwinds from trade protectionism in some major economies china has maintained stable growth in 2019 with main economic indicators kept within an appropriate range said yi gang governor of the people s bank of china furthermore kiyoyuki seguchi research director at the canon institute for global studies noticed the chinese economic policies today are marked by a devotion to high quality development rather than quantitative expansion as imf managing director kristalina georgieva said china has been a major growth engine for the world economy and its economic health bears global significance source xinhua

consistently throughout the year at the end of the year the share price ended on a 0 7 premium to the company s net asset value per share 2018 0 6 premium it is also particularly pleasing to note that our portfolio manager s long term strategy continues to deliver excellent returns with 1 000 invested in the company ten years ago now being worth 4 747 this compares to a figure of 2 210 if we had just tracked the company s benchmark index the ftse all share index over the same period share capital consistent demand for the company s shares led to the issue of a total of 27 120 000 new shares during the year this issuance policy ensured that the share price premium was effectively managed throughout the year with the net proceeds received by the company amounting to 226 3 million these proceeds were invested in line with the company s investment objective since the financial year end to the 16 december 2019 being the latest practical date the company has issued a further 6 555 000 new shares raising a further 58 2 million the scale of new issuance during the year exceeded the shareholder authority granted at the february 2019 annual general meeting agm accordingly in advance of the authority level being reached an extra general meeting was held in july 2019 to refresh the new share issuance authority as described in the circular issued to shareholders in advance of that meeting this was to ensure that new share issues could continue uninterrupted at the july 2019 general meeting authority to issue a further 19 7 million new shares was approved by shareholders such authority will again be proposed for renewal at the company s annual general meeting to be held in february 2020 as a consequence of the ongoing share issuance programme the requirement to publish a prospectus arose during the year this prospectus is available on the company s website and it provides authority for the issue of 60 million new shares return and dividend the income statement shows a total return per share of 143 8 pence per share year ended 30 september 2018 93 6 pence consisting of a revenue return per share of 18 3 pence year ended 30 september 2018 16 5 pence and a capital return per share of 125 5 pence year ended 30 september 2018 77 1 pence the company s revenue return during the year was up 10 9 from last year on a per share basis and your board has declared two interim dividends for the year totalling 16 6 pence per share year ended 30 september 2018 15 3 pence a year on year increase of 8 5 this is in line with the board s long term objective of increasing or at least maintaining the total dividend each year in light of the continued strong demand for the company s shares and in order to facilitate dividend payments on a timely and cost effective basis your board continues to elect to distribute the company s income to shareholders by means of two interim dividends rather than wait several months to secure shareholder approval to pay a final dividend at the annual general meeting gearing during the year the company had a secured fixed term committed revolving facility with scotiabank europe plc this consisted of a 75 million facility with an additional 25 million option as at 30 september 2019 a total of 36 7 million had been drawn down under the facility alternative performance measure see glossary having reviewed the pattern of usage on 4 october 2019 the board renewed the facility at an amount of 50 million with the option of an additional 50 million regulatory during 2018 a new uk corporate governance code was published by the financial reporting council which applies to companies with financial years beginning on or after 1 january 2019 a corresponding aic code of corporate governance was published at the beginning of february 2019 also applying to companies with financial years beginning on or after 1 january 2019 the company will report against the principles and recommendations of the new aic code in its next annual report and will continue to update the relevant policies and internal guidelines throughout the year in order to adhere to the new aic code board composition three members of the board i being one of them have served for more than nine years and in accordance with the requirements of the above corporate governance codes we are required to implement a board refreshment programme it would clearly be unnecessarily disruptive for all three of us to depart at the same time so we are adopting a rolling programme of retirements neil collins will retire from the board at the annual general meeting being held in february 2020 so will not stand for re election neil has made a very significant contribution during his time on the board and he will be greatly missed by his fellow directors we have all much enjoyed working with him and wish him all the best for the future david hunt will be the next to retire and will do so next year after the release of our 2020 half year accounts to 31 march 2020 this will enable an orderly hand over of his responsibilities as chairman of the audit committee i will then retire at our 2021 annual general meeting when simon hayes will succeed me as chairman of the board as announced on 9 october 2019 we are delighted to welcome sandra kelly to the board we are very pleased to have appointed a director with such extensive financial expertise and enthusiasm and it is intended that sandra should succeed david hunt as chairman of the audit committee following his retirement next year a resolution proposing her election together with resolutions for those directors standing for re election will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming annual general meeting outlook the result of last week s general election in the uk has removed much of the political uncertainty that dominated the year under review although the brexit process has yet to run its course despite that difficult backdrop the company has again continued to outperform its benchmark and deliver another year of respectable returns to shareholders your board continues to support fully the portfolio manager s strategy of investing in high quality companies that own both durable and cash generative brands we believe firmly that this will continue to deliver strong investment returns to shareholders over the longer term annual general meeting the annual general meeting of the company this year will again be held at guildhall city of london ec2v 7hh please use the basinghall street entrance on friday 28 february 2020 at 12 noon and we hope as many shareholders as

s review nick train lindsell train limited portfolio manager many years ago i came across a comment from george soros about his time as a money manager that really rang true to me however it is now so long ago i read it i can no longer find the quote or vouch for the accuracy of what follows nonetheless i m sure i ve got the gist of it what soros said was something on the lines of i found running money very painful if the fund was doing well i was acutely worried that my performance was about to take a turn for the worse and the only time i felt worse than when we were doing well was when we were doing badly in other words for all of us engaged in putting capital at risk in volatile markets markets driven by rapidly changing economic and political circumstances there is likely never a time when we aren t worried and worry is painful this is true for so called amateur investors i say so called because many such investors are serious talented and are paying themselves through the application of their acumen and for those of us lucky enough to be remunerated for investing other peoples precious savings i was reminded of the soros quote as i reviewed the investment performance of your company fgt over its financial year to end september 2019 on the face of it relative performance was strong over the period or at least for 11 months of the 12 but i have to say that i have felt unusually worried most of this year as fgt s performance and share price rose nicely against the backdrop of a subdued uk equity market don t misunderstand it is gratifying to deliver gains for shareholders especially given that i am one too indeed i have continued to add to my holding throughout the year and to be clear as far as the companies in which we have invested are concerned i continue to be optimistic about almost all of them i will return to that almost later in this report but 2019 has truly felt like an unusual year for the uk stock market with investors both domestic and international transfixed by the b word of course now it transpired that fgt s portfolio was pretty much perfectly positioned for those months of uncertainty fgt benefited from its bias toward global companies like diageo relx and unilever and its lower exposure to domestic oriented uk companies such as banks or retailers in fact we have zero in these sectors in addition we were helped by the near 20 we have in non uk quoted companies such as heineken and cadbury owner mondelez which tended to go up in value as the pound went down fgt s objective is to outperform the ftse all share index but the board permits us to invest up to 20 outside the uk if we think that by doing so we improve the prospects of achieving investors aspirations but there is an important caveat here this is that fgt s portfolio was not positioned in this way because of any brilliant analysis by lindsell train limited and certainly not brilliant analysis by me about the market ramifications of uk economic and political uncertainty in 2019 rather the portfolio is structured as it is because it reflects our long held views about where the best long term investment returns will be earned in other words there was a healthy dose of good fortune helping us in 2019 what is clear is that fgt s short term performance has become increasingly sensitive to the swings in sentiment about uk politics any development perceived as helpful for the pound and the domestic economy has become temporarily at least unhelpful for fgt s net asset value nav because when the pound goes up our overseas earners go sideways or down and the domestic businesses to which we have less exposure go up indeed this is exactly what happened in september 2019 the last month of fgt s financial year it is too soon to say whether these affects will continue in the immediate aftermath of the outcome of the december 12th general election but what i will assure shareholders is that we will not change the strategic positioning of your portfolio in response to such short term fluctuations or putting it differently we do not expect fgt s medium term performance to be effected either positively or negatively by whatever the eventual outcome of the uk s brexit travails politics do matter tremendously for people and to a degree for the economy but it is a fundamental mistake to conflate an economy with a stock market the constituents of a stock market may behave in aggregate very differently from the economy in which they are domiciled and this is particularly true of a stock market as globally oriented as the uk we remain optimistic about the prospects for the ftse all share index and a fortiori for fgt but this is because we remain confident in the entrepreneurial spirit of the uk corporate sector and value the shareholder friendly corporate culture of the uk not because we have any special insight into the geopolitics of the uk s relationship with continental europe now turning to a review of corporate developments in 2019 it is worth noting two pieces of news our best performer in the year was the london stock exchange which as a result has become the biggest holding in fgt the lse made an offer for the old reuters business now called refinitiv and then saw off a possible bid from the hong kong stock exchange both developments were helpful for investors appreciation of the lse the refinitiv deal if consummated will materially increase the amount of proprietary data that the lse can offer its clients as well as making the company even more global meanwhile the hong kong bid albeit abortive reinforces the strategic value of the lse s position in the plumbing of global financial markets the lse has been a wonderful investment for fgt first introduced up to a decade and a half ago we have persistently added to the holding over the years but even so at the september year end price the shares are up over 4 times on the average book cost this is exactly the sort of effect we are looking to capture for fgt shareholders through the application of a really long term approach fifteen years ago the lse s share price was around 4 00 at end september it was at over 73 00 of course over those years there have been times when lse shares looked expensive or when commentators argued that the shares might underperform for a period indeed there were periods when the shares did underperform but in hindsight it is clear that the exceptional profitability of the lse and its unique strategic position mattered much more than investors short term quibbles about its valuation in short the shares of great companies go up over time and go up a lot if you are prepared to be more patient than the average market participant or at least that is our working hypothesis certainly confirmed by the lse s gains this year by stark contrast our equally long term holding in pearson has disappointed us again with its shares falling on its september 2019 trading update that revealed profits for this year will be at the lower end of expectations we respect the senior executives of pearson who are of high integrity and have done as good a job as could be expected during a period of accelerating and unpredictable technology change candidly i am not certain what the correct next decision is as regards pearson shares at least if you are an owner but i assure fgt shareholders that the experience of holding it is a powerful reminder to us that even the strongest franchises or collections of intellectual property and pearson had both can be undone by the kind of disruptive technology change that we ve experienced in the second decade of the 21st century there is a lot more that i could write about for instance the encouraging business performance of the global brands that drive the earnings of so many of our biggest holdings or speculating about what might be the long term implications of the woodford affair on the fund management industry in general and on the business of hargreaves lansdown in particular hl remains an important holding in fgt or noting that we have recently initiated a new holding slowly building a position in a company that has been deeply out of favour for a number of years but these topics will have to be developed in our monthly newsletters once there is greater clarity i am going to conclude by pointing out that there is an important flip side to the factor that i blamed in a previous paragraph for pearson s struggles disruptive technology change the flip side is that technology change is also creating new opportunities for new and old companies to improve their products or services and what drives equity markets higher over time are the productivity gains and new wealth created by such technology change on this analysis we must actually be in some kind of golden era for equity investing if that seems an absurdly optimistic claim then consider on the day i write this report the s p 500 and nasdaq indexes in the us have just hit all time highs up over 20 year to date meanwhile the ftse all share index is now up over 9 in calender 2019 and is only 5 below its peak hit in 2018 in other words despite worries about trump trade wars and all the rest stock markets have gone higher so like soros by all means worry but not to the extent that you despair and lose your exposure to wealth creating companies nick

considered whether brexit poses a discrete risk to the company while the election result removes a major uncertainty at the time of writing it is still not clear how the exit from the european union will be achieved it is also worth noting that your company s shares are priced in sterling while many of the portfolio investments are effectively priced in foreign currencies as a result sharp movements in exchange rates can effect the net asset value see the notes to the financial statement for the foreign currency sensitivity analysis furthermore whilst the company s current shareholders are predominantly uk based unexpected changes in investor sentiment or tax or regulatory changes could lead to short term selling pressure on the company s shares which potentially could lead to the share price discount widening overall however the board believes that over the longer term brexit is unlikely to affect the company s business model or whether the company s shares trade at a premium or discount to the net asset value per share long term viability statement in accordance with the uk corporate governance code the directors have carefully assessed the company s position and prospects as well as the principal risks and have formed a reasonable expectation that the company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next five financial years to make this assessment and in reaching this conclusion the audit committee has considered the company s financial position and its ability to liquidate its portfolio and meet its liabilities as they fall due the portfolio comprises principally of investments traded on major international stock exchanges 95 of the current portfolio could be liquidated within 30 trading days 68 in seven days and there is no expectation that the nature of the investments held within the portfolio will be materially different in future the expenses of the company are predictable and modest in comparison with the assets and there are no capital commitments foreseen which would alter that position and the company has no employees only its non executive directors consequently it does not have redundancy or other employment related liabilities or responsibilities the audit committee as well as considering the potential impact of its principal risks and various severe but possible downside scenarios has also considered the following assumptions in considering the company s longer term viability there will continue to be demand for investment trusts the board and the portfolio manager will continue to adopt a long term view when making investments and anticipated holding periods will be at least five years the company invests principally in the securities of uk listed companies to which investors will wish to continue to have exposure the company will maintain its bank loan facility regulation will not increase to a level that makes running the company uneconomical and the performance of the company will continue to be satisfactory alternative performance measures the financial statements set out the required statutory reporting measures of the company s financial performance in addition the board assesses the company s performance against a range of criteria which are viewed as particularly relevant for investment trusts which are summarised in the company

operations therefore the company has not reported further in respect of these provisions the board responsibility for effective governance and for the overall management of the company s affairs lies with the board the governance framework of the company reflects the fact that as an investment company it has no employees and outsources company secretarial administration marketing and risk management services to frostrow and portfolio management to lindsell train the board s key responsibilities are to set the strategy values and standards to provide leadership within a controls framework which enable risks to be assessed and managed to challenge constructively and scrutinise performance of all outsourced activities and to review regularly the contracts performance and remuneration of the company s principal service providers the directors have decided that given the size of the board it is unnecessary to form separate remuneration management engagement and nomination committees the duties that would ordinarily fall to those committees are carried out by the board as a whole the audit committee the audit committee s key responsibilities are to monitor the integrity of the annual report and financial statements to oversee the risk and control environment and financial reporting and to review the performance of the company s external auditor all independent non executive directors are members of the committee copies of the full terms of reference which clearly define the responsibilities of the audit committee can be obtained from the company secretary they will be available for inspection at the annual general meeting and can be found in the corporate information section on the company s website www finsburygt com meeting attendance the

to the board on 9 october 2019 all of the directors with the exception of sandra kelly attended the annual general meeting held on wednesday 27 february 2019 the general meeting held on 29 july 2019 was attended by david hunt kate cornish bowden and simon hayes directors interests the beneficial interests of the directors in the company are set out in the directors reumeration report directors independence the board consists of seven non executive directors each of whom is independent of frostrow and lindsell train no member of the board has been an employee of the company frostrow lindsell train or any of its service providers accordingly the board considers that all the directors are independent and there are no relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect or could appear to affect their judgement the chairman has a seat on the board of the company s aifm by virtue of the company s minority partnership interest in frostrow it is a non executive position and therefore the board does not believe that this compromises his independence from the company board evaluation during the year the performance of the board its committees and individual directors including each director s independence was evaluated through a formal assessment process led by the chairman this involved the circulation of a board effectiveness checklist tailored to suit the nature of the company followed by discussions between the chairman and each of the directors the performance of the chairman was evaluated by the other directors under the leadership of david hunt the chairman is satisfied that the structure and operation of the board continues to be effective and relevant and that there is a satisfactory mix of skills experience length of service and knowledge of the company the board has considered the position of all of the directors as part of the evaluation process and believes that it would be in the company s best interests to propose them for re election save for neil collins who will be retiring from the board sandra kelly joined the board on 9 october 2019 accordingly her appointment will be proposed to shareholders for ratification at the forthcoming annual general meeting policy on director tenure the board subscribes to the view expressed within the aic code that long serving directors should not be prevented from forming part of an independent majority it does not consider that a director s tenure necessarily reduces hisher ability to act independently the board s policy on tenure is that continuity and experience are considered to add significantly to the strength of the board and as such no limit on the overall length of service of any of the directors including the chairman has been imposed in view of its non executive nature the board considers that it is not appropriate for the directors to be appointed for a specified term although new directors will be appointed with the expectation that they will serve for a minimum of three years subject to shareholder approval appointments to the board the rules governing the appointment and replacement of directors are set out in the company s articles of association where the board appoints a new director during the year that director will stand for election by shareholders at the next annual general meeting when considering new appointments the board will seek to add persons with complementary skills and experience which fill any gaps in the board s knowledge and who can devote sufficient time to the company to carry out their duties effectively the company is

ihs markit downgrades global recession probability to one in five tweet after weakening considerably in 2019 global growth is expected to stabilize at a rate of 2 5 percent in 2020 before edging up 2 7 percent in 2021 according to the annual top 10 economic predictions released today by business information provider ihs markit nyse info despite historically high levels of policy uncertainty the probability of a recession has decreased for 2020 and now stands at one in five while the global economy seems to have dodged a recession risks remain daunting said ihs news alert markit chief economist nariman behravesh in the near term the biggest threat is either an escalation of the u s china trade conflict or the spark of trade conflicts in other regions notably europe premature repeal of fiscal stimuli is another potential risk to the stabilization we forecast a return to global growth is most likely in the second half of 2020 we are watching trade and industrial production in europe and china for the green shoots of accelerating growth noted behravesh the u s economy is expected to expand at a rate of 2 1 percent in 2020 down from the stimulus driven average of 2 5 percent recorded from 2017 to 2019 growth will be supported by a few special factors including the phase one trade deal with china as well as solid consumer spending however the run up to next year s presidential election could provide some policy surprises both positive and negative which could affect the outlook the results of the u k election suggest that while the worst of the brexit uncertainty may be over there is still a hard slog ahead ihs markit expects uk gdp to drop from 1 3 percent in 2019 to 0 5 percent next year the eurozone s economic expansion will stabilize at 0 9 percent in 2020 after a growth slump this year as low inflation and easing financial conditions continue to support consumer spending in the coming year china s economy will continue its downward trend slowing to 6 0 percent growth in 2020 the decade long deceleration is a result of an aging population and a sharp drop off in productivity growth meaning that potential growth in china is lower now than a decade ago and is set to fall further ihs markit predicts china s growth rate will slide further in 2021 unless the government enacts a more aggressive stimulus program other top 10 predictions include while the abe government s larger than expected fiscal package will neutralize much of the negative effects of japan s october sales tax hike japanese real gdp will remain weak expanding 0 3 in 2020 emerging market growth will continue to be lackluster in 2020 the simmering trade war and the continued decline in china s rate of expansion mean there is little scope for growth in the emerging world to rise much if at all from current rates more local concerns such as riots in latin america and faltering growth in india are also worrisome as is the record level of debt in the emerging world commodity prices continue to look soft in the first half of 2020 with prices stabilizing in the second half of 2020 ihs markit expects the average price of dated brent to drop from 64 per barrel in 2019 to 57 in 2020 as growing non opec production and sluggish liquids demand growth keep the oil market in surplus global inflation will remain subdued at 2 7 percent next year the global monetary easing cycle will likely come to an end in 2020 as global growth faded this year the u s federal reserve lowered the federal funds rate three times the european central bank ecb began a renewed bond purchase program and more interest rate cuts and major emerging market central banks lowered their policy rates signs of solid growth in the united states suggest that the fed may not feel the need for further insurance cuts ihs markit expects the u s dollar will climb another 3 0 percent over the next two years before beginning a long and gentle retreat for the complete top 10 economic predictions for 2020 report please contact as predicted in last year s top 10 global growth decelerated in 2019 though even faster than ihs markit predicted declining from 3 2 percent in 2018

zionists and by nuclear terrorist racist zionist run genocidally racist democracy by genocide neo nazi and australia subverting apartheid israel this extraordinary silence over apartheid israel by the us lackey australian coalition government and labor opposition and by mendacious and cowardly mainstream australian journalist politician academic and commentariat presstitutes is testament to the extraordinarily pervasive subversion and perversion of racist white australia by one percenters racist zionists apartheid israel zionist subverted america and zionist subverted britain in a decent world it really should not be required but in zionist subverted us lackey australia it is necessary to declare whether you belong to the decent 50 who vote to support human rights for all including the right to a modestly decent life and are opposed to racism and war or to the indecent neoliberal trumpist 50 who variously vote for one percenter interests human rights abuse war racism bigotry corruption environmental destruction and deadly inequity while cowardly mendacious zionist subverted us lackey australian mainstream presstitutes endlessly demand respectful conversation this isn t really possible with the indecent trumpist 50 who are well described by the nazi era and dr strangelove reminiscent acronym sieg stupid ignorant and egregiously greedy and who wittingly or unwittingly vote for scumm socially conservative unforgivable mass murderers if you think that this is just a teensy weensy bit strong just consider that the conservative coalition that presently rules australia has committed australia to all post 1950 us asian wars atrocities that have been associated with 40 million asian deaths from violence or from war imposed deprivation to the zionist promoted endless us war on terror aka the war on muslims muslim genocide and muslim holocaust involving 32 million muslims deaths from violence 5 million or from imposed deprivation 27 million in 20 countries invaded by the us alliance since the us government s 9 11 false flag atrocity that killed 3 000 people and to the global avoidable mortality holocaust 15 million avoidable deaths from deprivation each year and 1 500 million such deaths since 1950 of course none of these atrocities are reported by the mendacious australian mainstream media politician academic and commentariat presstitutes and accordingly things are getting even worse history ignored yields history repeated thus australia is among world leaders in 15 areas related to climate criminality specifically 1 annual per capita greenhouse gas pollution 2 methanogenic livestock exports 3 natural gas exports 4 recoverable shale gas reserves that can be accessed by hydraulic fracturing fracking 5 coal exports 6 land clearing deforestation and ecocide 7 speciescide or species extinction 8 coral reef destruction 9 whale killing and extinction threat through global warming impacting on krill stocks 10 terminal carbon pollution budget exceedance 11 per capita carbon debt 12 ultimately ghg generating iron ore exports 13 climate change inaction 14 climate genocide its coal exports ultimately kill 75 000 people per year and 15 increasing ghg pollution post paris contrary to the paris agreement demand to decrease ghg pollution australia with 0 3 of the world s population contributes 2 0 of global greenhouse gas ghg pollution and 4 5 if one includes australia s huge exported ghg pollution via exports of coal gas iron ore and methanogenically derived meat australian labor leader of the opposition anthony albo albanese thinks that this is double dipping but others differ australia clearly massively and inescapably contributes to global ghg pollution via its world leading coal and gas exports indeed while the coalition government is held hostage by climate change denialist troglodytes labor is far more positive about renewable energy and a green economy however the horrible reality is that the liberal party national party coalition government and the labor opposition aka the lib labs have a common climate criminal policy of unlimited export of coal gas iron ore and methanogenically derived meat australia makes a disproportionately huge contribution to a worsening climate genocide that is set to kill 10 billion people en route to a sustainable human population of only 0 5 1 0 billion by 2100 presently about 1 million people die from climate change each year about 20 million people are displaced as refugees annually due to climate change and environmentally displaced people now total about 200 million 8 million people die annually from air pollution with this including 10 000 australians and 75 000 people who die annually from the long term effects of pollutants from the burning of australian coal exports further the myopia mendacity and neoliberal values of the liberal party national party coalition and labor the lib labs and consequent egregious inequity ignorance and inaction mean that 85 000 australians die preventably each year from life style or political choice reasons the breakdown including some overlaps being as follows 1 26 000 annual australian deaths from adverse hospital events 2 17 000 obesity related australian deaths 3 15 500 smoking related australian deaths 4 10 000 carbon burning pollution derived australian deaths 5 4 000 avoidable indigenous australian deaths 6 5 600 australian alcohol related deaths 7 2 900 australian suicides circa 80 being veterans 8 1 400 australian road deaths 9 630 australian opiate drug related deaths with 570 linked to us restoration of the taliban destroyed afghan opium industry and 10 300 australian homicides 80 being of women killed domestically australian voters are like mushrooms kept in the dark and fed manure and have an uninformed democratic choice between an australian killing coalition and a more assertedly altruistic but nevertheless horribly complicit labor indeed i recently precipitated violent argument at a dinner party by declaring there s bestiality paedophilia and incest and then there s voting for the coalition in short while all of these 4 perversions are repugnant the neoliberal and racist coalition policies are immediately deadly for australians at home 85 000 preventable australian deaths annually and australian subjects abroad e g 7 million occupied afghan deaths from violence or war imposed deprivation in gross violation of the un genocide convention and of the geneva convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war articles 55 and 56 of this geneva convention unequivocally demand that an occupier must provide its conquered subjects with life sustaining food and media requisites to the fullest extent of the means available to it an imperative grossly ignored by successive australian coalition and labor governments french economist thomas piketty has recently analysed the rise of xenophobic trumpism in short economist thomas piketty has analysed the rise of inequality driven trumpist populism and increasing support by ignorant and xenophobic poor people for the right that serves the interests of the wealthy and opposes the centre left that is paradoxically increasingly supported by high education and high income voters piketty s brahmin left versus the merchant right analysis deals with france the us and the uk but is relevant to trumpist brazil eastern europe bjp ruled india and australia at this critical time of existential threat to humanity from nuclear weapons and anthropogenic climate change piketty has an extremely important message for progressive science informed left politics without a strong and convincing egalitarian internationalist platform it is inherently difficult to unite low education low income voters from all origins within the same party a recent survey found that only 25 of australian voters trust people in government but this trust would largely evaporate if they were apprised of the massive lying by omission and lying by commission of mendacious australian mainstream media politician academic and commentariat presstitutes unlike france the us and the uk australia has an excellent compulsory preferential voting system for the house of representatives in which if a candidate does not receive 50 of the vote then second preferences of other parties are taken into account in an unexpected result in the may 2019 federal election the right far right liberal party national party coalition was returned to power with 52 of the two party preferred vote to whit 41 4 of the primary vote plus most second preferences from the racist bigoted and populist one nation party 3 1 and the populist united australian party of a mining billionaire clive palmer 3 4 with the remainder from preferences from other parties the ostensibly centre left but rightist dominated labor party received 48 of the two party preferred vote to whit 33 3 of the primary vote plus most second preferences from the pro peace pro equity pro environment and pro human rights greens 10 4 with the remainder from preferences from other parties the coalition and labor have many common policies notably almost blind support for the us and apartheid israel highly abusive and indefinite imprisonment of refugees without charge or trial on remote off shore concentration camps commitment to deadly neoliberal economics and climate criminal support for unlimited exports of coal gas iron ore and methanogenically derived meat the big difference between the feral coalition and an aspirational labor is that the war criminal climate criminal extreme neoliberal and australian killing coalition fervently believes in these policies whereas labor while espousing them at least knows that they are utterly wrong wedged cowardly immoral conflicted and us lackey labor reminds one of the 1953 song be prepared by anti racist jewish american mathematician and satirist tom lehrer don t solicit for your sister that s not nice unless you get a good percentage of her price nevertheless the high education professionals and informed proletariat of the left support the greens or labor and see a well intentioned but pragmatic and morally flawed labor as vastly better than the present troglodytic anti science bigot backed and heartless right far right coalition government that outstanding human rights advocate professor gillian triggs described as ideologically opposed to human rights peace is the only way but silence kills and silence is complicity racism is vile and apartheid in particular is regarded by the un as a crime against humanity war is the penultimate in racism and genocidal war is the ultimate in racism while the presently dominant neoliberalism demands maximal freedom for the smart and advantaged to exploit human and natural resources for private profit altruistic social humanism socialism eco socialism the welfare state seeks to sustainably maximize human happiness opportunity and dignity for everyone through pragmatic culturally sensitive and evolving intra national and international social contracts however neoliberalism remains the dominant ideology in rich and racist australia white australia has been deeply racist since the war criminal british invasion in 1788 and commencement of a 2 century and indeed ongoing aboriginal genocide and aboriginal ethnocide 2 million indigenous deaths from violence 0 1 million or from deprivation and disease of 350 750 indigenous languages and dialects pre invasion only 150 survive and all but 20 are endangered war is the penultimate in racism and as a uk or us lackey australia has invaded 85 countries with 30 of these invasions being genocidal presently australia is helping the us occupy afghanistan and the joint us australia electronic spying base at pine gap in central australia is a crucial part of us nuclear terrorism and also targets illegal us drone strikes in 7 countries from libya to pakistan from the 19th century onwards white australia has had deep fears about asia and china in particular australia is linked to the us via the anzus treaty the australia new zealand and us treaty that despite the best desires and efforts of australia does not guarantee us protection the us will do what is in the interests of america nevertheless a cravenly us lackey australia has participated in all post 1950 us asian wars conflicts associated with 40 million asian deaths from violence or war imposed deprivation in the hope that such complicities will somehow guarantee us protection china is now australia s biggest trading partner and australia clearly needs to balance this economic dependence on china with its alliance with an increasingly anti china us however the us lackey australian government and us entwined australian intelligence have chosen to adopt the aggressive american anti china stance in various areas despite expert advice to be more balanced thus former coalition pm fraser 2010 slavish devotion to the us a foreign policy folly for australia to participate in a conflict with china is totally contrary to our interests former labor pm paul keating was even blunter may 2019 when the security agencies are running foreign policy the nutters are in charge they ve lost their strategic bearings these organisations and november 2019 my concern is that what passes for the foreign policy of australia lacks any sense of strategic purpose the whispered word of communism of old is now being replaced by the word china the reason that we have ministries and cabinets is that a greater and eclectic wisdom can be brought to bear on complex topics this process is not working in australia the subtleties of foreign policy and the elasticity of diplomacy are being supplanted by the phobias of a group of security agencies which are now effectively running the foreign policy of the country the australian media has been recreant in its duty to the public in failing to present a balanced picture of the rise and legitimacy and importance of china preferring instead to traffic in side plays dressed up with the cosmetics of sedition and risk philipp ivanov ceo asia society australia sensibly argues for a frank and multi faceted government business educational institutional and community engagement with china 2019 today s china is more global more powerful more willing to project its power and more sensitive to criticism and just as hard working and dynamic as it has been for centuries the big guy is making his presence felt sometimes in ways we find admirable in the global economy science and technology but also in ways that make us uncomfortable on the streets of hong kong the treatment of uighurs in xinjiang and china choosing to silence or ban those critical of its government from visiting the country living with china will not be easy but a co ordinated and long term policy development effort led not only by government but business educational institutions and the community can safeguard australian interests as china continues to grow in power and influence while preserving and if possible expanding the very real benefits gained through engagement china can be praised for its huge technological and economic advances and for bringing 800 million people out of dire poverty thus annual avoidable deaths from deprivation total zero 0 in authoritarian china as compared to 4 million in democratic india however china must also be legitimately criticized for the death penalty urban pollution a one party state and the maltreatment of uighurs and dissidents indeed the great successes of china derive from science and altruism which are based on finding the best models for reality and society respectively just as genetic diversity was required for darwinian natural selection so diversity of ideas is required for selecting the best models for reality and society one hopes that china will perceive this and find a way to maximize human rights free expression and diversity of ideas australia is in the grip of us promoted sinophobic hysteria that posits chinese espionage subversion perversion and indeed military threat to australia and the region a detailed account of this threat thesis is silent invasion china s influence in australia by clive hamilton professor of public ethics at charles sturt university canberra and this position has been taken up vigorously by the mainstream right as a result there is greatly increased sinophobia and criticism of china federal legislation has been passed with anti chinese intent that constrains foreign purchase of australian real estate other foreign commercial activity e g by huawei foreign donations to political parties and other foreign engagement in australia including collaborative research at australian universities however us inspired anti chinese xenophobia in australia invites critical assessment of some good things that china is doing and some bad things that the us alliance is doing i e those in glass houses shouldn t throw stones with this background we can consider the present sinophobic hysteria of us lackey and pro apartheid israel australia and succinctly compare these china bashing claims with actual realities in china versus realities in the us alliance countries of apartheid israel the us the uk france and australia 1 apartheid china firmly opposes apartheid but australia and the us alliance fervently support apartheid israel and hence apartheid the un describes apartheid as a crime against humanity and has promulgated an international convention on the suppression and punishment of the crime of apartheid nuclear terrorist serial war criminal genocidally racist democracy by genocide apartheid israel determines that 72 of its now circa 50 indigenous palestinian subjects who are occupied palestinians cannot vote for the government ruling them i e egregious apartheid the un regards apartheid as one of the worst of human rights violations the 2016 un security council resolution 2334 condemning illegal israeli settlements and other israeli war crimes in the occupied palestinian territories was passed unanimously except for an obama america abstention rather than veto a former coalition foreign minister julie bishop disgracefully disputed the illegality of zionist west bank settlements and the same position has now been adopted by the us trump administration bishop notoriously threatened to withhold any federal funding from australians supporting boycotts divestment and sanctions bds against apartheid israel noting that anti racist jews are prominent among those supporting bds 62 china and the uk supported the un security council resolution 2334 but trump america and us lackey australia subsequently vehemently opposed the resolution this making them number 1 and number 2 respectively as supporters of apartheid israel and hence of race based neo nazi apartheid indeed professor ben saul quotes a coalition foreign minister boasting that australia is more pro israel than 99 per cent of the world political candidates who support apartheid israel and hence apartheid are utterly unfit for public life and being a member of parliament in a in a one person one vote democracy 2 climate change intergenerational equity china leads the world in renewables but australia and us are among world leaders in climate change inaction the world is existentially threatened by nuclear weapons and man made climate change the solutions have been succinctly stated by eminent physicist stephen hawking we see great peril if governments and societies do not take action now to render nuclear weapons obsolete and to prevent further climate change australian mps and media frequently describe china as the biggest greenhouse gas ghg polluter in the world but this must be considered on a per capita basis all men are created equal per capita ghg pollution taking land use and ch4 into account and in units of tonnes co2 equivalent per person per year are as follows 2016 analysis australia 52 9 116 if including its huge ghg generating exports united states 41 0 uk 21 5 apartheid israel 20 2 china 7 4 and india 2 1 china is indeed the world s biggest greenhouse gas ghg polluter but on a per capita ranks far below australia apartheid israel and the us on a per capita basis for some poor countries exporting ghg pollution is their only option accordingly a fairer measure of climate criminality is per capita ghg pollution weighted for gdp per capita and on this scale the scores are as follows qatar 924 3 united arab emirates 337 0 australia 306 8 672 8 if including its huge ghg generating exports canada 234 0 new zealand 218 7 united states 207 1 uk 92 9 apartheid israel 71 9 china 5 2 and india 0 3 further china leads the world in terms of renewable energy installation 728 gw power capacity as of 2018 twice that of the us australian politicians and media harp on china s world leading ghg pollution china s use of australian coal and iron ore and australia s asserted global insignificance however while australia has only 0 3 of the world s population it is responsible for 4 5 of global greenhouse gas ghg pollution with its exported ghg pollution included further australia is among world leaders in 15 areas of climate criminality specifically environmental vandalism driven by remorseless neoliberal greed namely 1 annual per capita greenhouse gas pollution 2 live methanogenic livestock exports 3 natural gas exports 4 recoverable shale gas reserves that can be accessed by hydraulic fracturing fracking 5 coal exports 6 land clearing deforestation and ecocide 7 speciescide or species extinction 8 coral reef destruction 9 whale killing and extinction threat through global warming impacting on krill stocks 10 terminal carbon pollution budget exceedance 11 per capita carbon debt 12 ultimately ghg generating iron ore exports 13 climate change inaction 14 climate genocide and approach towards omnicide and terracide and 15 increasing ghg pollution despite paris commitments to lower ghg pollution the german climate performance index has the following rankings for climate change action 1 is best 58 the worst sweden 1 india 6 and china 27 with the bottom rankings assigned to australia 53 iran 54 korea 55 chinese taipei 56 saudi arabia 57 and the us 58 while china is leading the world in uptake of renewable energy the us has withdrawn from the paris climate agreement and australia is flouting the paris climate agreement demand to decrease ghg pollution australia s domestic ghg pollution has been steadily increasing since the climate criminal coalition came to power in 2013 3 democracy an altruistic chinese one party state versus corrupt australian and us neoliberal corporatocracies at the most fundamental level of understanding democracy means practical realization of the basic wishes of the people e g a long life a long life for children and grandchildren and modest but good employment housing health education opportunity and dignity in bringing 800 million people out of dire poverty and through massive economic advances one party state china has satisfied these basic democratic wishes of the chinese people annual avoidable deaths from deprivation total zero 0 for one party state china as compared to 4 million for ostensible democracy india in which these fundamental demands have not been met australia has an excellent compulsory and preferential voting system australia claims to be a democracy but in reality is a one percenter us and zionist subverted and perverted kleptocracy plutocracy murdochracy lobbyocracy corporatocracy and dollarocracy in which big money purchases people parties policies public perception of reality votes political power and thence more private profit indeed 70 of australian daily newspaper readers have been captured by the right wing us murdoch media empire and in the may 2019 federal election a right wing billionaire clive palmer spent an extraordinary for australia 60 million on nation wide anti labor advertising labor lost australia has a democratic house of representatives in which the members are elected from equal sized electorates noting that indigenous australians could only vote since 1967 but in the senate the small state of tasmania population 0 5 million has the same numbers of senators 12 as new south wales population 7 5 million no wonder former australian labor pm paul keating famously described the senate as unrepresentative swill now we all love democracy because it enables largely untrammelled dissent and 3 5 year changes in government without bloodshed and trauma however perversion of democracy by the big money of one percenters and big corporations corporatocracy has had the consequence of cowardly political short termism thus scientists have been publicly warning of the threat of global warming from ghgs since the 1980s but as set out in 2017 and 2019 analyses by ripple et al and co signed by 15 000 and 11 000 scientists respectively trends in several dozen key areas over this period have been quasi linear and heading in the wrong direction under successive anti science pro coal pro gas pro oil climate criminal coalition governments australia s domestic ghg pollution has been increasing rather than decreasing as demanded by the 2015 paris agreement professor jorge randers an author of the the limits to growth in 1972 the report to the club of rome has commented on this deadly political stasis and climate change inaction in democratic countries i am a climate pessimist i believe regrettably that humanity will not meet the climate challenge with sufficient strength to save our grandchildren from living in a climate damaged world humanity regrettably will not make what sacrifice is necessary today in order to ensure a better life for our ancestors forty years hence the reason is that we are narrowly focused on maximum well being in the short term this short termism is reflected in the systems of governance that we have chosen to dominate our lives both democracy and capitalism place more emphasis on costs today that on benefits forty years in the future what can be done can democratic society be modified to solve the climate challenge i predict it will be the chinese who solve the global climate challenge singlehandedly through a sequence of 5 year plans established with a clear long term vision and executed without asking regular support from the chinese they are already well on the way for the benefit of our grandchildren us and zionist subverted mainstream australia routinely and falsely describes apartheid israel as the only democracy in the middle east when a there are other democracies in the middle east cyprus turkey iran iraq and lebanon and b apartheid israel is only a democracy by genocide of 14 million palestinians 7 million are exiled and cannot step foot in what has been the land of their forebears for millennia 5 million occupied palestinians have zero human rights and cannot vote for the government governing them apartheid and about 2 million lucky israeli palestinians can vote but exist as third class citizens under over 60 race based neo nazi discriminatory laws that invite them to leave if they don t like it pro apartheid australia is second only to trump america as a supporter of apartheid israel in the sense of democracy as satisfaction of fundamental popular wishes apartheid israel also fails because of the horrendous and deadly deprivation imposed on millions of exiled palestinians in middle east refugee camps 5 million occupied palestinians and indeed many of the 2 million lucky palestinian israelis thus the gdp per capita is 36 000 for israelis as compared to a deadly 4 000 for occupied palestinians whose life expectancy is 10 years less than for israelis each year about 5 000 occupied palestinians die from israeli violence 550 or from israeli imposed deprivation 4 200 china is routinely and falsely lambasted by right wing australian politicians and mainstream media as an authoritarian state that is not democratic the falsehood of this claim is apparent when one considers that most basically democracy is about expression of the will of the people thus the most fundamental wishes of the people are surely to live for their children and grandchildren to live and for a modestly happy life for all with reasonable economic security health and education the chinese system has brought about 800 million people out of the direst poverty and has been able to satisfy these fundamental desires for 1 4 billion people china has a democratic system in this fundamental sense of satisfying the basic wishes of the people thus annual avoidable deaths from deprivation total zero 0 for china as compared to 4 million for the ostensible democracy india australia is one of the world s oldest parliamentary democracies but since the us government s 9 11 false flag atrocity successive australian governments have introduced over 70 anti terrorism laws with bipartisan coalition and labor support that egregiously violate australian civil rights to the extent that australia has become a pre police state in this neo fascist and racist australia the disabled the sexually abused poor and indigenous australians have a life expectancy about 10 years less than that of white australians while the gdp per capita is 55 000 for australia about the same number of indigenous australians die avoidably each year on a global comparative scale 4 200 out of an aboriginal population of 0 7 million as do indigenous palestinians 4 200 out of an occupied palestinian population of 5 million in the sense of democracy as satisfaction of fundamental wishes one percenter dominated australia fails to deliver 3 million australians live in poverty and about 85 000 australians die preventably each year from deadly life style and political choice reasons ditto corporatocracy and lobbyocracy america where money buys votes civil liberties have been grossly eroded the voters have to choose between the republican billionaires or the democrat billionaires and 1 7 million americans die preventably every year from lifestyle or political choice reasons 4 free speech china censors and bans google but google censors and holocaust ignoring us alliance countries ban effective free speech free speech is vital for science scholarship and for an informed public that is vital for democracy whether of the one percenter dominated parliamentary democracy kind as in australia or the more general satisfaction of fundamental popular wishes kind as in china and cuba indeed just as genetic diversity is required for natural selection and evolution of better adapted organisms so diversity of ideas is required for societal selection of more useful memes or ideas china evidently restricts free speech by a persecuting and imprisoning dissidents b intimidation as a result of such persecution of dissidents and c other censorship this is a mistake and one hopes that modern china having made such spectacular advances e g peace and security equal rights for women population control taking 800 million people out of dire and deadly poverty world leading adoption of renewable energy fantastic technological and economic advances and abolition of avoidable mortality from deprivation will also rapidly achieve major progress in the areas of human rights and free speech mps and other public commentators in general in us lackey australia are torn between supporting the anti china rhetoric and actions of america or watching their tongues self censorship because china is australia s biggest trading partner indeed 2 right wing china bashing mps have recently been banned from entry to china for criticizing human rights abuses in china however australian mps and other commentators while legitimately criticizing the widely reported detention of 1 million uighurs in chinese re education camps they have absolutely nothing to say about the highly abusive over 50 year imprisonment by apartheid israel of presently 5 million occupied palestinians without charge or trial in the gaza concentration camp 2 million or in west bank ghettoes 3 million just as china censors over its uighur re education policies evidently aimed at stopping a potentially very bloody uighur independence or separatist movement so mainstream australian heavily censors legitimate criticism of past and present genocidal crimes of the us uk and apartheid israel thus in the 1942 1945 ww2 bengali holocaust the british with australian complicity deliberately starved 6 7 million indians to death for strategic reasons in bengal and the neighbouring provinces of assam bihar and orissa but searches of the abc australia s mendacious and taxpayer funded equivalent of the uk bbc for the terms bengali holocaust or indian holocaust yield zero 0 results similarly 35 million chinese died in the ww2 chinese holocaust under the japanese 1937 1945 but a search of the abc for chinese holocaust again yields zero 0 results the ongoing palestinian genocide 2 2 million palestinian deaths from violence 0 1 million or from imposed deprivation 2 1 million since the british invasion of the middle east in 1914 is similarly unreported a search for the term palestinian genocide yields zero 0 results similarly deaths from violence or imposed deprivation total 4 6 million 1990 2011 iraqi genocide and iraqi holocaust 7 0 million 2001 onwards afghan genocide and afghan holocaust and 32 million the ongoing post 9 11 muslim genocide and muslim holocaust since the us government s 9 11 false flag atrocity all atrocities in which a serial war criminal and deeply racist australia has been involved yet abc searches for the terms iraqi genocide afghan genocide muslim genocide and us did 9 11 all yield zero 0 results in contrast an abc search for the holocaust synonymous in the west for the ww2 jewish holocaust 5 6 million jews killed by violence or deprivation and to the near total exclusion of the ww2 european holocaust 30 million slavs jews and roma killed 1941 1945 yields 375 results an abc search for aboriginal genocide actually yields 3 results but none actually immediately mention the australian aboriginal genocide the 231 year atrocity in which about 2 million indigenous australians were killed by violence 0 1 million or through imposed dispossession deprivation and introduced disease google has been effectively banned in china by the great firewall however google itself is engaged in massive censorship of progressive media sites so that items ranking high on page 1 of a bing search are totally disappeared or effectively disappeared by the google robot noting that 92 and 95 of google searches stop after page 1 and page 2 respectively numerous examples can be given but for example the carefully documenting website climate genocide is about the acute and existential threat of climate change to humanity and the biosphere whereas a bing search for climate genocide yields a website of this name as result 2 on page 1 a google search fails to find the site on exhaustive searching however repeating the search with omitted results included finally finds this important site as item 6 on page 1 for the neocon american and zionist imperialist nazi subverted western mainstream presstitutes the greater the atrocity the more assiduously do they attempt to bury it 5 human rights and freedom from child abuse china little emperor syndrome versus horrendous child abuse in the us australia and apartheid israel white australian journalists politicians and commentators legitimately complain about human rights abuses in china e g censorship the death penalty as in the us constraints on freedom of speech the one party system maltreatment of dissidents and mass detention of uighurs however pro apartheid australia should also examine what is happening to the human rights abuse of children within the us australia in apartheid israel and in the occupied palestinian territories in comparison with treatment of children in china in china the former one child policy addressed the urgent and indeed global problem of over population in the interests of future generations several recent reports collectively endorsed by thousands of expert scientists have warned the world that time is running out to save humanity and the biosphere from further catastrophic climate change and further massive biodiversity loss massive harm has already occurred due to continuing carbon pollution population growth and economic growth and it is clear that zero growth in these areas is insufficient thus using coral reefs as a canary in the mine coral experts have determined that world coral reefs started dying when co2 reached 320 ppm at which time 1963 the human population was 3 3 billion or about half of that today 7 4 billion there must be negative carbon pollution atmospheric co2 draw down to 300 ppm co2 negative population growth population decline by about 50 and negative economic growth degrowth by about 50 to halt and reverse this worsening disaster the former one child policy of china has meant especially kind treatment of children by parents and grandparents the little emperor syndrome children in china as in other countries are schooled in patriotism but have the benefit of a non religious education system which means that they escape the horrendous religion based intellectual child abuse that is widespread in us alliance countries thus only 15 of americans have been educated to accept the darwinian theory of natural selection whereas the remainder have been evilly brainwashed into believing unsubstantiated religious fairy tales the same evil of intellectual child abuse is massive in australia the uk and apartheid israel about 25 of australian children suffer child sexual abuse as compared to 18 of american children and 17 of apartheid israeli children nearly 50 of apartheid israeli children suffer from physical sexual or emotional abuse apartheid israel has a shocking record of over 70 years of horrendous maltreatment of indigenous palestinians who presently number 14 million and of whom about 50 are children 5 million occupied palestinians half of them children three quarters women and children continue to be indefinitely imprisoned without charge or trial and deprived of all human rights in west bank ghettoes 3 million or in the blockaded shelled rocketed and bombed gaza concentration camp 2 million apartheid israel abusively imprisons abuses tortures and blackmails palestinian children in israeli prisons attempting by these evil means to force them to spy on friends and relatives 6 human rights and the right to life 800 million chinese out of deadly poverty versus us alliance passive mass murder of muslims the great china success of bringing 800 million people out of poverty was associated with a huge decrease in infant mortality in under 5 infant deaths per 1 000 live births from 195 1950 to 12 2017 the gdp per capita 2017 and infant mortality per thousand live births 2017 are 500 and 94 8 us alliance occupied somalia 1 900 and 110 6 us and australia occupied afghanistan 4 300 and 15 4 occupied palestinian territories 16 600 and 12 china 49 900 and 4 3 australia 43 600 and 4 3 uk 59 500 0 055 and 5 8 us and 36 200 and 3 4 apartheid israel annual avoidable deaths from deprivation total 110 000 92 000 and 4 200 in occupied somalia occupied afghanistan and occupied palestine respectively but total zero in china australia the uk and the us the horrendous poverty annual infant deaths and annual avoidable deaths from deprivation in occupied somalia occupied afghanistan and other countries invaded by the us alliance is evidence of war criminal violation by the us alliance of articles 55 and 56 of the geneva convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war that unequivocally state that the occupier must supply its subjects with life sustaining food and medical services to the fullest extent of the means available to it the most fundamental human right is the right to life while legitimately criticized for the one party state the death penalty censorship urban air pollution and harsh treatment of dissidents china has been hugely successful in radically reducing infant mortality and maternal mortality in tibet and in china as a whole in stark contrast the war criminal us alliance occupation of neighbouring afghanistan continues to be associated with an under 1 infant mortality and maternal mortality incidence that is 7 times higher and 4 12 times higher respectively than that in tibet evidence of gross violation of the geneva convention and the un genocide convention by the us alliance including australia while china can be and must be properly criticized over human rights issues power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely it has respected the fundamental right to life of its subjects by bringing 800 million people out of poverty with attendant huge decreases in infant mortality maternal mortality and avoidable deaths from deprivation in stark contrast the rich and serial war criminal us alliance the us uk apartheid israel and australia have been involved for decades in passive mass murder of their overseas muslim subjects in gross violation of the geneva convention 7 human rights and the right to live peaceably in your own country observed by china but grossly violated by the genocidal us alliance china is heavily criticized in the west for the rigor of its application of its laws and sovereignty in xinjiang and tibet regions that were incorporated into china about 900 years ago at roughly the same time as the english were variously conquering the celtic entities of cornwall wales scotland and ireland realistically china is no more going to surrender these economically and strategically vital regions than the us is going to surrender alaska ethnically cleansed diego garcia or ethnically cleansed guantanamo indeed the us subverts all countries in the world has nearly 800 military bases located in over 70 countries and has invaded over 70 countries over 50 since ww2 by way of example in the korean war the us killed 28 of the north korean population there are over 70 million refugees in the world today and they are mostly derive from us alliance wars on non european and muslim countries us alliance us uk australia and canada backed apartheid israel has ethnically cleansed 90 of palestine of 14 million indigenous palestinians 7 million exiled palestinians are violently excluded from the land continuously inhabited by their forebears for thousands of years 5 million occupied palestinians are excluded from all human rights and are highly abusively confined under israeli guns to west bank ghettoes 3 million or to the blockaded and bombed gaza concentration camp 2 million and nearly 2 million lucky palestinian israelis are third class citizens of apartheid israel under over 60 nazi style race based laws as uk lackeys or us lackeys australians have invaded 85 countries as compared to the british 193 countries france 82 the us 72 52 after ww2 germany 39 japan 30 russia 25 canada 25 apartheid israel 12 and china 2 of these 85 invasions by australians about 30 have been genocidal in the last millennium the english have invaded 193 countries nearly every member of the present un and many of these invasions have been genocidal thus from a qualitative perspective the uk imposed australian aboriginal genocide was the worst in human history 2 million deaths from violence 0 1 million or from imposed deprivation and disease and of 350 750 unique languages and dialects in in 1788 only 150 survive today and of these all but 20 are endangered however from a quantitative perspective the 2 century british imposed indian holocaust was the world s worst genocide 1 800 million indian deaths from imposed deprivation 8 international rules based order largely observed by china but grossly violated by us alliance apartheid israel and us lackey australia us lackey australia echoes the us position that chinese island building on uninhabited atolls in the south china sea is illegal and against the international rules based order of course the south china sea is named thus because it is off the southern coast of china and not off the coast of california or australia the serial war criminal us alliance absurdly argues that the chinese are threatening commerce in this region commerce that is overwhelmingly dominated by chinese commerce is china going to destroy its own commerce iranian origin australian senator sam dastyari was forced to resign from the australian parliament for receiving gratuities from the chinese and expressing an opinion on the south china sea sympathetic to that of china and contrary to the official line laid down in us lackey australia by the serial war criminal americans the us alliance including us lackey australia fervently supports a nuclear terrorist racist zionist run genocidally racist serial invader serial war criminal democracy by genocide apartheid israel that grossly violates the following key elements of international law the geneva convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war international convention on the suppression and punishment of the crime of apartheid convention on the rights of the child un charter un declaration on the rights of indigenous people universal declaration of human rights convention relating to the status of refugees and the un genocide convention with the fervent support of the us alliance including us lackey australia apartheid israeli exceptionalism means that it simply ignores resolutions and determinations of the un general assembly the un security council notably and most recently unsc resolution 2334 the un human rights council the international court of justice and the international criminal court us lackey australia and the other democratic and european us alliance countries legitimately criticize china as an authoritarian one party state but ignore the reality that in fervently supporting apartheid israel they are fervently supporting the abomination of apartheid that is utterly condemned by the un as a crime against humanity 9 nuclear weapons eminent physicist stephen hawking has bluntly declared we see great peril if governments and societies do not take action now to render nuclear weapons obsolete and to prevent further climate change the upper estimates of stored nuclear weapons are as follows us 7 315 russia 8 000 apartheid israel 400 france 300 uk 250 china 250 pakistan 120 india 100 and north korea circa 10 india pakistan apartheid israel and north korea have not ratified the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt one can well understand why china believes it needs a nuclear deterrent to genocidal american militarism in short china has suffered 3 centuries of devastation from imperialist invaders from the mid 18th century onwards india and china that had both led the world economically in the 18th century with each the contributing about a quarter of world gdp were progressively and rapidly devastated by genocidal european imperialism thus india s percentage of world gdp was 24 1750 17 1820 5 1950 and 7 2008 and china s percentage of world gdp was 22 1700 33 1820 5 1950 and 18 2008 the economic strangulation of india and china was deadly thus 1 800 million indians died avoidably from deprivation under the british 1757 1847 20 100 million chinese died from violence and deprivation during the british imposed opium wars and the linked tai ping rebellion and 35 million chinese died in the ww2 chinese holocaust under the japanese 1957 1945 the mass starvation of about 30 million people in china during the great leap forward 1958 1962 is attributed in the complicit west to policy failures by mao zedong but the active military and economic hostility of the us alliance and slow recovery from imperialist devastation were clearly also major contributors i f stone s brilliant the secret history of the korean war exposes a hidden us strategy of engineering an excuse for nuclear devastation of china and the soviet union likewise christopher hitchens the trial of henry kissinger details the real us nuclear threat to india in 1971 when india was forced to intervene to stop the pakistan imposed bangladeshi holocaust bengali holocaust bengali genocide the us destroyed hiroshima and nagasaki with nuclear weapons threatens to use nuclear weapons and indeed has recently threatened north korea and iran with total annihilation australia is critically involved in us nuclear terrorism through electronic spying bases notably pine gap the hosting of nuclear weapons carrying us warships and its degenerate opposition to a nuclear weapons ban australia was also involved in uk nuclear terrorism through the testing of british nuclear weapons and delivery systems the mendacious and traitorous us lackeys running australia nutters according to former pm paul keating have made australia a key nuclear target in any tit for tat escalating nuclear exchange thus after a limited us first strike on a nuclear armed opponent any escalating nuclear response would initially target australia rather than us bases or cities apartheid israel has up to 400 nuclear warheads together with missile delivery systems including germany supplied submarines zionist domination of us foreign policy dates from israeli acquisition of nuclear weapons with us and french assistance in 1967 indeed apartheid israel was prepared to use nuclear weapons on a demonstration basis when it invaded all of its neighbours in 1967 israeli brigadier general itzhak yaakov was in charge of this program but was imprisoned for revealing the existence of this secret plan while non nuclear weapons iran is subject to deadly sanctions by the us the zionist subverted mainstream media don t breathe a word about apartheid israeli nuclear weapons the world cannot afford to have any nuclear weapons and certainly not 400 in the hands of a mere several million genocidally racist zionist psychopaths 10 scholarly research sinophobic australia and the zionist subverted us constrain university research in the interests of foreign nuclear terrorist powers china and india were a world leaders in science and technology before the enlightenment and liberalism paradoxically unleashed european high technology wars on these countries in the 18th century in my biochemical scientific career i had little occasion to refer to chinese or indian researchers but this changed in the 1990s as chinese and indian students flocked to western universities and science in china and india escalated thus for example the 2015 nobel prize in physiology or medicine was awarded to professor youyou tu for her key role in the discovery of the extremely important anti malarial natural product artemisinin that i necessarily referred to in my encyclopaedic 2003 book biochemical targets of plant bioactive compounds the international and collaborative scientific culture is one of the great outcomes of the enlightenment but is now being constrained through the militarization and politicization of academic research by nuclear terrorists rogue states notable the us and apartheid israel thus us lackey australia passed the australia united states defence trade cooperation treaty related defence trade controls bill that makes it an offence punishable by 10 years in prison for an academic without a permit to inform non australians in conversation tutorials lectures conference papers scientific papers etc about numerous technologies and thousands of chemicals and organisms listed in a presently circa 400 page defence and strategic goods list the australian review has commented since 1998 chinese collaboration has soared from zero to 15 per cent of australian scientific research however impelled by the present hysterical sinophobia the present us lackey australian coalition government has set out guidelines to counter foreign interference in the australian university sector that is aimed squarely at china to the detriment of the international collaborative scientific research ethos this all adds to a sinophobic and mccarthyist ambience in australia indeed i used to say china is getting more like australia and australia is getting more like china it also adds to massive censorship and self censorship in australian universities that have become increasingly corporate and driven by censorial corporate brand considerations of course the current sinophobia in australia masks massive military related collaborative research involving australia and the nuclear terrorist and serial war criminal rogue states of apartheid israel and the us the incoming coalition government suggested in 2013 that it would stop federal funding of people supporting boycott divestment and sanctions bds against apartheid israel noting that leading figures in the bds movement are anti racist jewish scholars and writers the degenerate pro apartheid trump administration is reported to be moving to withhold federal funding by executive order from universities deemed insufficiently supportive of apartheid israel e g by permitting bds activism on campus indeed a significant reason in addition to the overwhelming pro brexit reason for jeremy corbyn s unpopularity and the labour loss in the uk elections was the utterly false defamation by the zionists mainstream media and tories of anti racist jeremy corbyn the anti racist labour party and a large body of anti racist jewish humanitarians as anti semitic simply because they support human rights for palestinians of course a those falsely defaming anti racist jews are most certainly racists and anti jewish anti semites b those opposing human rights for palestinians are most certainly racists and anti arab anti semites and c false defamation of anti racist jews ultimately led to the ww2 jewish holocaust 5 6 million jews killed by the nazis just as denial of palestinian human rights led to the ongoing palestinians genocide 90 of palestine ethnically cleansed with more adumbrated and 2 2 million palestinian deaths from violence 0 1 million or from imposed deprivation 2 1 million since the uk invasion of the middle east in 1914 11 subversion and security threat minimal chinese influence despite massive trade versus massive subversion of australia by the us uk apartheid israel and traitorous israel lobby silent invasion china s influence in australia by the otherwise very progressive and admirable professor clive hamilton professor of public ethics at charles sturt university canberra explores increasing chinese influence in australia but does so in an excited polemical fashion that crosses the boundary between critical academic discourse and the xenophobia paranoia jingoism and sinophobia that are now dominant in a china bashing australia of course australia should be concerned about its sovereignty and security but china is now australia s biggest trading partner and it is quite expected for legitimate chinese influence to increase in lobbyocracy and corporatocracy australia the more so as the world becomes increasingly disenchanted with racism bullying and serial genocidal violence from australia s military ally zionist subverted america the australian government has reacted to the sinophobia of the us dominated australian mainstream media by sensibly legislating for abolition of foreign political donations and prohibition of foreign purchase of old housing while conversely smearing chinese australians implicitly smearing australians seeking engagement with china excluding involvements of a major chinese telecommunications company huawei and bullying universities over research collaborations with china former palestinian ambassador ali kazak there is nothing asio suggests any chinese lobby of doing that the israeli lobby has not been doing for over 30 years any chinese lobby is child s play in contrast to the well established israeli lobby no country has more interfered spied and endangered australia s security sovereignty and the integrity of its national institutions than israel and its powerful lobby by their own admission the lobby receives funds from israeli institutions coordinates and cooperates with the israeli government and embassy and has established a long tradition of strong public advocacy on behalf of israel to shape the opinion of members of the australian public media organisations and government officials in order to advance israel s own political objectives indeed the very absence of any public discussion of the massive zionist israeli uk and us subversion of australia is evidence of the massive degree of that subversion see a huge book could be written about zionist israeli uk and us subversion of australia but it would never be published indeed any new revelations about such subversion involving australian intelligence operations would result in up to 10 years in prison brian toohey s excellent book secret the making of australia s security state details secret dealings of australia with the uk and us but only mentions apartheid israel once israel is the only country to have successfully demanded that it be allowed to operate key systems independently of the us page 190 australia passed legislation mandating acquisition of all metadata who speaks to whom and when with acquisition of what they actually say requiring a judge s permission however australia belongs to the white anglosphere 5 eyes intelligence sharing club the us uk canada australia and new zealand and the us shares such bulk intelligence information on australians with nuclear terrorist serial war criminal apartheid israel the result of this is that there is comprehensive silence by australian media about zionist and apartheid israeli subversion of australia thus 2 patriotic and anti racist jewish australians have written about the pro zionist led coup that removed pm kevin rudd in 2010 but this is resolutely ignored by australian media indeed the us and uk complicit cia backed coup that removed the progressive whitlam government in 1975 see john pilger is presented by mainstream media as a democratically endorsed action to save the australian economy from asserted mismanagement the profound legacy of the 1975 coup was blind cowardly traitorous and bipartisan agreement on all the way with the usa from the liberal party national party coalition and the labor party aka the lib labs meanwhile the cold war slogan of reds under the bed has returned with chinese under the bed sinophobia and china bashing in a xenophobic fearful and pre police state australia that will swallow anything about the dreaded chinese that is sourced to us lackey australian intelligence while ailing australian and world hero julian assange has been deserted by the us lackey lib labs his wikileaks news organization revealed that former pm rudd had suggested war with china to hillary clinton if china did not play ball while also preparing to deploy force if everything goes wrong and that former australian ambassador to the us kim beazley promised that australian forces would be involved in the event of a us war on china in contrast back in the 1950s pm robert pig iron bob menzies who had permitted pig iron exports to japan when it was devastating china had declared that australia would have nothing to do with a us war on china over taiwan the bottom line is that china is australia s biggest trading partner and without compromising any of its asserted pro human rights values australia should engage with china in a frank informed polite and sensible fashion as advised by former coalition pm malcolm fraser and former labor pm kevin rudd 12 racism china opposes apartheid and has only invaded 2 countries in 900 years whereas the us alliance is pro apartheid and has invaded numerous countries as outlined in 1 apartheid above china is implacably opposed to apartheid whereas australia the us uk france canada and australia are fervently pro apartheid israel and hence fervently pro apartheid apartheid is regarded by the un as a crime against humanity war is the penultimate expression of racism and genocide is the ultimate in racism xinjiang and tibet were incorporated into china about 900 years ago at roughly the same time as the english were variously conquering the celtic entities of cornwall wales scotland and ireland border spats with india and vietnam aside china has effectively only invaded 2 countries in a millennium a remarkable record noted by former australian labor pm kevin rudd in stark contrast in a mere 230 years as uk or us lackeys australians have invaded 85 countries with 30 of these invasions being genocidal as compared to the british 193 france 82 the us 72 52 after ww2 germany 39 japan 30 russia 25 canada 25 apartheid israel 12 and china 2 13 south china sea the south china sea is called thus because it is off the coast of south china and not off the coast of california or australia setting aside arguments about the legality or otherwise of china s island building on uninhabited coral atolls china clearly has a major security threat from an exceptionalist serial invader and nuclear terrorist america that is surrounding china in a war like fashion and threatens the huge commerce to and from china via the south china sea china has been engaged in ship borne trade and fishing in the south china sea for thousands of years whereas the invasion colonization and genocide based entities of the usa and australia date back to a little over 2 centuries see also 14 territorial occupation of uninhabited areas 14 territorial occupation of uninhabited areas china has built islands on uninhabited coral reefs in the south china sea to protect china and its gigantic ship borne commerce from an aggressive serial war criminal and nuclear terrorist us alliance with the arctic sea ice melting and the northwest passage opening up the exceptionalist and endlessly bullying us rejects canada s claim to the passage australia lays claim to about 40 of the uninhabited continent of antarctica in a claim dating back to the british empire in 1841 and recognized only by new zealand the uk france and norway 15 territorial occupation of inhabited areas china stay home policy versus ongoing european us alliance imperialism xinjiang and tibet were incorporated into china about 900 years ago at roughly the same time as the english were variously conquering the celtic entities of cornwall wales scotland and ireland as uk or us lackeys australians have invaded 85 countries with 30 of these invasions being genocidal as compared to the british 193 countries france 82 the us 72 52 after ww2 germany 39 japan 30 russia 25 canada 25 apartheid israel 12 and china 2 the us has about 800 military bases in over 70 countries the us alliance is presently violently occupying somalia and afghanistan and is engaged in warfare in 20 countries us lackey australia is involved in occupied somalia and occupied afghanistan and via the joint australia us electronic spying base at pine gap in central australia targets illegal and war criminal us drone strikes in 7 countries apartheid israel occupies the territory of 4 countries palestine libya syria and jordan and routinely bombs lebanon syria iraq and the gaza concentration camp mighty china has only 1 overseas military base specifically in djibouti which one supposes is to help ensure the safety of its huge trade with europe via the red sea and the suez canal china s last military action was a brief border spat with vietnam in 1979 40 years ago 16 treatment of protesters none killed by police in hong kong protests versus 250 palestinians killed and 20 000 wounded in ongoing gaza concentration camp massacres by apartheid israel this year marked the 30th anniversary of the massacre of about 3 000 protesters in beijing deliberately not named in this article in an attempt to evade automatic robot based chinese censorship of this atrocity as reported by the australian abc however while for example british and australian media report the 1919 jallianwala bagh massacre by the british in amritsar 400 sikhs killed and the 1960 sharpeville massacre by south african security forces 69 africans killed there is an almost complete british and australian censorship of the 1942 1945 bengali holocaust ww2 bengal famine ww2 indian holocaust in which the british with australian complicity deliberately starved 6 7 million indians to death in bengal orissa bihar and assam for strategic reasons australia was complicit through withholding food from its huge wartime grain stocks from starving india that provided 2 4 million soldiers towards the allied war effort racist white australia has a thing about asians and almost completely censors out the ww2 chinese holocaust 35 million chinese killed under the japanese 1937 1945 however things have changed for the better by 2019 thus in the huge repeated million strong democracy demonstrations in hong kong over the last 6 months only 2 people have been killed none by the police in stark contrast according to the palestine chronicle january 2019 the great march for return began on march 30 since then over 255 palestinians have been killed and over 20 000 injured yet an anti arab anti semitic and us lackey australia remains second only trump america as a supporter of serial war criminal apartheid israel and the cowardly racist mendacious and zionist subverted australian abc the taxpayer funded equivalent of the uk bbc overwhelmingly ignores the increasingly desperate plight of the palestinians while quite properly giving nightly coverage of the hong kong protests palestinian deaths from violence or imposed deprivation in the ongoing palestinian genocide total 2 2 million this now being of the same order of magnitude as deaths in the ww2 jewish holocaust 5 6 million jews killed through violence or imposed by the nazis the crimes of apartheid israel exceed those of apartheid south africa and likewise demand comprehensive boycotts and divestment and sanctions bds against apartheid israel and all its supporters until a secular unitary state is achieved as in post apartheid south africa 17 war and invasion of other countries unlike the serial war criminal us uk us alliance and australia china has been remarkably peaceful and non aggressive internationally to reiterate xinjiang and tibet were incorporated into china about 900 years ago at roughly the same time as the english were variously conquering the celtic entities of cornwall wales scotland and ireland as uk or us lackeys australians have invaded 85 countries with 30 of these invasions being genocidal as compared to the british 193 countries france 82 the us 72 52 after ww2 germany 39 japan 30 russia 25 canada 25 apartheid israel 12 and china 2 china has a millennial record of extraordinary peacefulness and non aggression in relation to other countries final comments this essay has been written in attempt to balance the sinophobic hysteria coming from australia and the us no doubt china as a major power plays hard in its own interests at home and abroad china raises major human rights concerns specifically in relation to an being authoritarian one party state abuse of police powers power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely the death penalty maltreatment of dissidents censorship constraints on free speech and the short term mass imprisonment of a reported 1 million uighurs in re education camps however china must be given great praise for bringing 800 million people out of poverty massive improvements in health education economic security and human dignity opposition to apartheid a remarkable historical record of non aggression and a world leading uptake in renewable energy in contrast us lackey australia the us and the european us alliance countries are ostensibly libertarian in comparison with china but manage to minimize effective free speech in the interests of their neoliberal one percenter rulers and have appalling records of war criminal violence against scores of impoverished countries that reached genocidal depths in the 21st century and continue unabated zionist subverted australia is second only to zionist subverted trump america

following brexit johnson can still opt out of signing an eu trade deal although the impact of this would be catastrophic for both the british and eu economies an eu uk customs union in goods is off the table because it would restrict britain s ability to sign ftas with third parties the so called norway plus option is also a non starter because it would simply place britain under eu rules in a pay and obey with no say scenario thus a wide ranging fta is the only realistic option on the table but there s one other alternative transforming britain into the singapore of europe a low tax lightly regulated financial services and investment centre anchored off the coast of europe this if it came to pass would send shivers up the spine of brussels as investment capital would run not walk to london uk drug prices under the nhs are currently capped but that could easily change following brexit johnson s problem is that donald trump will likely demand trade concessions that will be politically difficult for westminster to give him limited liability for us tech firms deep access to uk public procurement markets and submitting to investor state dispute settlement isds washington wants total market access in any uk us fta donald trump can be expected to ask boris johnson for extensive access to the uk economy getty this would give trump s administration carte blanche to pick off the juicy parts of the british economy despite trump s public protestations to the contrary britain s national health service is very much on the agenda with the us government seeking zero restrictions on its firms access to uk service supplier markets uk drug prices under the nhs are currently capped but that could easily change the abortive eu us transatlantic trade and investment agreement abandoned in 2015 is indicative of the british government s priorities under ttip britain could have ring fenced the nhs it opted not to make no mistake big pharma and other multinationals on capitol hill ran a successful lobbying campaign that brought you the tpp australia had to shirt front the us on biologics and patent evergreening to stop washington gaining a complete regulatory victory over the governance of pharmaceutical intellectual property unsurprisingly trump views london as easy pickings for its part washington has its own deep divisions with brussels france and the eu are introducing taxes on the digital economy hitting apple google and facebook squarely in the hip pockets trump has ordered an inquiry into the french tax meanwhile microsoft and google have proved to be lucrative targets for eu anti trust regulators in 2007 microsoft was hit with the biggest eu fine in history while in 2019 google was stung with 1 5 billion 2 43 billion in penalties in 2018 the eu commission forced apple to pay back more than 14 billion in taxes owed to the irish government due to irish tax incentives that broke eu rules advertisement if you think brexit isn t about tax think again in 2011 at the height of the greek crisis the eu sought to implement a financial transaction tax ftt member governments killed the proposal but it was sufficient to spook david cameron into promising a brexit referendum as he saw only too clearly the ftt s implications for london the world s biggest financial centre in 2019 the ftt pressed by berlin and paris has come much closer to fruition like the last boat out of dunkirk london may have narrowly avoided what it despises most constraints europe s reaction to johnson s victory has been muted german business deeply embedded in the british manufacturing industry welcomes clarity and will likely work to ensure an fta in goods to ensure the integrity of its supply chains privately eu officials are dubious that johnson can negotiate a uk eu fta inside 12 months indicating brussels could seek an extension of the transition period beyond december 2020 to save johnson the political costs of making the request himself in the british eu negotiations johnson s leverage is two fold the uk supply chain is critical to eu manufacturing particularly in automotives while london effectively issues and underwrites much european debt almost 7 per cent of uk gdp is in financial services with london accounting for half of that piecemeal ftas with the us canada australia and new zealand are no substitute for uk eu trade volumes the frankfurt and paris bourses pale in comparison with the london stock exchange s market cap but in order to remain competitive british banks must retain passporting access to the eu single market swiss banks long partnered with london to obtain eu financial services access have already begun the large scale transfer of assets and offices to the continent for many uk banks brexit began in 2018 both berlin and paris have sought to take advantage of brexit by encouraging uk based banks to relocate to frankfurt and paris westpac cba and macquarie are among the australian banks that have established offices and transferred staff to the continent as an eu member the uk financial services sector has unfettered access to the eu single market in financial services london conducts 70 per cent of euro currency based transactions more than germany and france combined despite britain s non membership of the eurozone which accounts for much of the opprobrium from berlin and paris from 2011 until 2015 the european commission mounted a case against the british government that sought to deprive london of its lucrative euro currency trade ironically in a precedential case the eu s court of justice overruled the commission and reiterated britain s right to conduct euro trade but following brexit the uk will no longer be afforded either the court s protection or an automatic right to single market access in 1959 britain formed the european free trade association with six of its closest trading partners including denmark sweden and switzerland in 1961 it unceremoniously dumped its efta partners and applied for eu membership the quantitative limits of efta markets meant british growth was stifled today 45 per cent of uk exports go to the eu while 50 per cent of british imports are sourced from europe sixty years after efta piecemeal ftas with the us canada australia and new zealand are no substitute for uk eu trade volumes the bottom line is that no country has ever become more prosperous by abandoning regional trade agreements

one month since the start of the popular revolt in chile feminist and libertarian communist statement a preface to october 18th on october 18th a popular rebellion broke out in santiago chile that quickly spread throughout the country the demonstrations that began in response to a spike in the public transportation fare quickly transformed in a matter of days into a social upheaval rooted in mass discontent over 30 years of privatization and precarious economic policies as the phrase circulating through street graffiti and social media states it s not about 30 pesos it s about 30 years on october 18th a popular rebellion broke out in santiago chile that quickly spread throughout the country the demonstrations that began in response to a spike in the public transportation fare quickly transformed in a matter of days into a social upheaval rooted in mass discontent over 30 years of privatization and precarious economic policies as the phrase circulating through street graffiti and social media states it s not about 30 pesos it s about 30 years the cost of living in chile rose substantially in 2018 2019 as an example on april 2018 the government announced a 30 increase in personal taxes applicable over the next three years in january 2019 state officials announced a 6 4 increase in tag toll roads in the santiago region in may electricity bills increased 10 5 in september the isapres private health insurance rose 50 on average for ges premiums associated with illnesses that the state is required to cover while fonasa state insurer rose its premiums 3 at the beginning of october electricity rose once again 9 2 all of this has occurred in a context in which 50 of all employees receive an income less than 400 000 chilean pesos 496 usd per month while the cheapest rents in santiago can run between 200 000 and 285 000 chileanpesos 250 350 usd unsurprisingly the household debt has reached a record high of 73 3 in relationship to disposable income during 2018 the 30 peso subway increase announced in october was the spark that ignited the flame these previously mentioned economic policies have made life precarious for the working class and was complemented by a series of state repression strategies to violently contain the growing discontent in chile the year of political and social discontent began on march 8th 2019 has been a year of milestones the first being the march 8th feminist strike a historic moment in chile marking feminism s entry into the political field of social movements their front and center slogan against the precariousness of life has proven to be a central slogan used in the mobilizations that broke out since october 18th although feminism was invisibilized during the first weeks of the protests in the days since feminists organized a presence at the marches raising concrete demands the feminist movement of which the march 8th feminist coordinator has been a fundamental proponent has developed a transversal struggle against the patriarchy capitalism and racism highlighting the necessity for feminists to be present in all neighborhood assemblies cabildos neighborhood councils and community onces teatime it has been feminists who denounced before anyone else the disappearences and the use of sexual violence as a torture mechanism against women during the demonstrations replicating methods employed by the genocidal military dictatorships in latin america in the 1970s and 1980s we see this current moment both as a popular reaction against neoliberal policies and an incipient regional anger and disillusionment with the left governments that formed the so called pink tide which came to power with popular support and hope inspiring various sectors of the international left but created more continuity than change high school students one of the most active groups in the demonstrations since the 2006 militant student mobilizations known as the penguin revolution have suffered a year of extreme repression there were widespread media images this year of the riot police attacking students at the national institute a prestigious all male public school in an attempt to implement policies of state control and repression inside the schools the safe classrooms law is an attempt to break the legacy of the student movement the national institute students who have played an emblematic role in directing the student movement were subjected to police violence such as the expulsion of student leaders and were criminalized by media outlets 2019 has been a year of

their call to join the evasion movement grew in popular support on friday october 18th piñera s government responded with even more repression transforming the peaceful act of evasion into a battle against the riot police when city and government officials closed the entire santiago subway system forcing thousands of workers to pack crowded buses or walk home the citizen response was not of frustration toward the students but solidarity the people as a whole rose up to evade fight against the police and attack and loot in mass the businesses that created precarious conditions in chile isapres health insurers afp pension funds administrators enel electricity distributor large supermarkets and retail stores given this scenario the government strategy has been to increase their repressive strategies against protesters on friday october 18th president sebastian piñera declared a state of emergency that enabled the government to place military forces in the streets and establish a military curfew for the santiago area the people far from being intimidated stood firm in the streets and defied the military curfew by banging pots and kitchen utensils caseroleos building barricades and attacking the military and the police with rocks or other things the widespread discontent reflects anger over years of neoliberal policies and state repression that the people have endured there are 24 reported deaths over 200 people have lost sight in an eye due to rubber bullets and pellets and there are at least 52 complaints of sexual violence by the hands of the police or military since the protests began on october 18 the social movement slogans no more afp and end the commodification of education health housing transportation and natural resources as well as the call to replace the 1980 constitution drafted during the pinochet dictatorship 1973 1990 resonate at protests across the country the governments 30 year indifference to popular demands underscore that the only way to end the neoliberal experiment is through a grassroots movement to transform society unfortunately there is no peaceful way out there is no solution to the conflict while the military is in the streets and a government deal is unacceptable while human rights abuses continue against working people chile in global context the oppressive situation imposed by the political and economic system in chile institutionalized by military dictatorship and continued by the concertación center left governments is not an isolated case in either the region or the world in ecuador haiti lebanon

driven by the honduran oligarchy and army ten years of neoliberal policies has left honduras in a major political crisis leading the population to protest against repression corruption and privatization in recent months in other parts of the world with us and european complicity a genocidal military campaign by the turkish state is underway in syria turkish military encroachment aims to reverse the liberated cantons community life and the socialist project led by the ypg ypj and kurdish people s militias in catalonia some weeks ago masses took to the streets in support for self determination independence and in repudiation of the judicial ruling that imprisons those who fight we have also seen ecuadorian indigenous people and workers organize a revolt that halted a state

is another story through the destruction of hundreds of symbols of colonization in squares and towns something new is being woven throughout chile slowly but surely hundreds of territorial assemblies cabildos and community onces consolidating a new form of popular power historical forms of organization by the working class are being reinvigorated once encased in our collective memory we are

neoliberal project the state has no solution and we cannot trust the regime s political parties who make agreements among themselves and behind closed doors and who are trying to promote a peace

ecobank group ceo ade ayeyemi talks to african banker about the bank s performance and the implications of the digital revolution for banking ecobank announced record profits when it released its results in march this year this is a remarkable turnaround for an institution that had taken impairment charges of 864m in 2016 insiders attribute this largely to the sterling leadership of group ceo ade ayeyemi ayeyemi regarded in the industry as a pure banker due to his affection for facts figures and other statistics is also a stickler for fine detail the way he approached this interview reveals his cartesian thinking he dissects a problem like a surgeon and qualifies his answers with a rational explanation often within an economic context he shows cause and effect how outcomes can be affected by which lever you choose to pull ayeyemi joined the bank four years ago at a time when it had gone through turmoil due to internal leadership issues with the acrimonious departure of a former ceo thierry tanoh taking over from albert essien a veteran at the bank who had been promoted to steady the ship in 2015 ayeyemi also had to navigate a downturn in africa s economic fortunes two of africa s largest economies nigeria and south africa had both entered their first recessions in two decades in 2016 the bank after the impairment charges posted a loss the charges related to bad legacy loans incurred as a result of poor management in some subsidiaries ayeyemi quickly but quietly replaced those culpable he managed to restore the bank to profitability the following year and set challenging targets increasing profitability and also introducing a breathtakingly ambitious digital roll out aimed at nothing less than a goal of securing 100m digital clients by 2020 20m clients have signed up so far but the momentum should bring many others quickly at the helm of a bank present in 36 countries in africa ade ayeyemi has a unique vantage point not only overlooking the continent s different economies but also the banking sector as a whole in this exclusive interview with omar ben yedder he provides fascinating insights into the workings of african economies as well as operations at ecobank how happy are you with the way the bank is performing and where it s heading we re happy with the 2018 results they re the outcome of a lot of effort by our people this confirms the strategy of the firm in terms of identifying the issues we need to work on working on those issues and then being able to start delivering results that demonstrate the potential that the firm has is your cost income ratio at around the 60 mark not too high compared to some of your competitors the cost income ratio should be in the mid 50s but it s not something that will happen instantly that s the direction that we re going in we also believe that it s not just a cost matter it s also a matter of income so we need to start growing income to survive and thrive the firm needs to use resources efficiently the resources that need to be used efficiently are both our cost resources in terms of our capital as well as our human capital resources therefore in allocating the assets of the firm we will try and be as efficient as we can how would you best describe your time at the bank i think the underlying thrust is securing the foundation of the firm that s what we said in 2015 we want to secure the foundation of the firm to make sure that when it starts growing that growth is sustainable into the future how did the market receive your 500m eurobonds and are you happy with the yield that you got on those we re happy with the reception of the market to the instrument we put in place it was done when the market was volatile and it was very supportive so we re pretty happy with where we are we then did a tap for 50m and we re also happy with the level of subscription we were able to do the tap within a range much lower than when we did the primary issue so that confirms that the market continues to look at the story of the firm positively regarding the 2018 results did it come as a surprise that the operations in zimbabwe were so successful the way we look at it is that there are opportunities in many african countries it is important for one to be discerning enough to take advantage of an opportunity and for us to prepare for the risk that is embedded in some of those countries our on the ground knowledge of the country and our association with the country is what ensures that we are able to do that our success is not just in zimbabwe i think it s across a number of our other countries i do not want my colleagues in ghana to hear for example that they are not successful or my colleagues in francophone west africa to hear they are not successful what we have done in cameroon or south sudan can be characterised as a very good job i think as an institution our understanding of the market our taking risk very prudently has meant that we have been able to extract opportunities out of the market what is the current environment across the markets you are operating in the current market environment i would say is getting better we re not at the end of the cycle yet but we are not seeing the recession we experienced a couple of years ago ultimately when you re speaking to investors foreign investors one of the main issues is managing the foreign exchange risk you used the nafex rate to reinstate your nigerian results as opposed to the central bank exchange rate can you explain your rationale there we did not reinstate our results because that s a technical accounting term which could mean the results were incorrect and you have to reinstate them we did not reinstate results when we convert currencies to us dollars the reporting currency of the group we use the official exchange rates that we can find and transact in the market in the nigeria situation the only market that existed for a long time that you could call official was the central bank of nigeria rate in the course of 2018 the nafex became an official rate on bloomberg and transactions were being done at that rate we then made the choice in 2018 to use the nafex rate because it s a market rate and one recognised by the central bank of nigeria and quoted on bloomberg you raised a broader question on how we manage exchange rate risk that is embedded in the businesses across africa where we operate what we do is to manage our businesses in a way such that the return on equity is greater than the cost of equity since the equity in the various countries is held in local currency ultimately the inflation that is the driver of the position of currency is embedded in the interest rates and therefore the cost of capital once you use that once you re measuring your operations around that to cater for the depreciation in the currency then over time you would be able to immunise your business to currency fluctuation we don t hedge because there are not enough hedge instruments with enough depth in the market if you look at a place like nigeria for example the way the exchange rate moves is in step function and therefore any hedging that one does will be just throwing money away the best way to hedge against exchange rate in most of our countries is to actually manage your business so that your return on equity is much greater than the cost of equity do you believe we should just liberalise exchange rates and let the market decide or do you believe in controlling them within certain bands the monetary authorities have numerous objectives that of price stability and they also have the objective of ensuring that the economy grows in a smooth and predictable way the authorities through the monetary policy community have a lot of information and data more than what the private sector economic agents like myself will have access to on the basis of that they make choices and decisions and trade offs that allow them to determine the path of exchange rates and the path of interest rates having said that i m always an advocate of what is predictable and that predictability means that you apply economic science to the data and therefore can predict the direction of the exchange rate that direction is the function of inflation between two currencies inflation in us dollars and inflation in the country where you have predicted if that inflation in the local currency is higher than the inflation in the us it means that inevitably the currency will depreciate to the extent of that inflation differentiator that is standard economic science now whether the outcome is exactly that is something that happens over time but i can t tell the central bank or the monetary policy authorities what to do they have their own objective i can manage my business and make sure that whatever happens is not detrimental to my shareholders there was a time when there was a bit of uncertainty in the boardroom amongst ecobank shareholders pic ifc nedbank and qnb there was talk that qnb wanted to take over the bank is that all settled and are the shareholders happy from where you stand i can respond to facts since i joined the organisation the shareholders have been very collegiate amongst themselves and have been very supportive with what the firm is trying to do i cannot respond to market rumours but i have direct contact with all the shareholders across pic ifc qnb nedbank and they ve been working together in a very co operative way that s what i see because we transact with them in some of those transactions nedbank is a participant qnb is a participant and i don t sense animosity among the shareholders when we spoke a couple of years ago the big pivot was setting a target of 100m digital customers by 2020 are you happy with the progress that you re making i m happy with the progress that we re making during the period of fix and foundation we got our customer base to 20m i m sure you re familiar with the maths of compounding and the way it works it grows incrementally i m very proud of the work that our team has done both in terms of people who are front facing the product guys as well as the people in the back offices trying to ensure that we strengthen the foundation of the firm and we are now leveraging that to go forward working with the key technology partners and providers do you see the whole industry being transformed by the technological shifts such as alipay or wechat i think the idea of making a payment for a transaction has been there since the venetian times what technology has enabled is that the exchange of goods and the banking of the money happen simultaneously that s the only thing that has changed whether people use mobile phones to make a payment that s just a channel whether people use cards to make a payment that s just a channel the fundamental that has happened is that the payment and the banking of the money happens simultaneously what has happened is that transactions that historically happened in the various ledgers of the merchants now happen directly in the accounts of the bank so the transactions get miniaturised and you have thousands and of transactions that s the first thing the second is the growth of logistics that enable people to order buy and get products delivered to them in their various locations that now enables people to buy as needed people no longer buy in bulk because you can order what you like on a just in time basis the fact that the banking environment now allows you to settle that purchase instantly through technology means that people can actually get that done instantly the current level of technology means you can send payments remittances from anywhere to anywhere again instantly without the need to aggregate amounts and kids can now go for lunch dinner and share the bill again instead of one transaction you have multiple transactions hitting their bank accounts but one threat is that they may bypass the banking system if you go back to my original economic premise the exchange of goods and services for money has not changed it s the channel that has essentially changed therefore somebody still needs to bank the money you use the word bypass i don t know what that means people that use mobile money is that the bypass mobile money is a conduit through which the money gets into the bank account the mobile money doesn t have a banking licence and therefore does not keep the money mobile money is a replacement for the cash that people used to keep in their pockets it s a replacement for the bullion van carrying the cash to the bank i think about it in terms of partnership there are things that we can do best as a bank there are things that other people can do in a collaborative way to enable us to get a better product to society from what you re saying the number of transactions is going to increase so that can only be beneficial for an institution such as yours or people offering those channels the number of transactions is going to increase is going to be beneficial to the economy and society as a whole because people can actually do more in addition that data then forms the basis of analytical work more data enables more planning to be done and more planning enables better coordination and management of the economy is regulation changing fast enough from your perspective to enable you to do what you want to do the simple answer is yes i m one of those people at the ground level of economics that believes that regulation is a good thing because it provides confidence to the public that the market will not fail the function of the regulation is to inspire confidence and ensure that market participants behave properly what is your opinion about the current rates of saving in africa should they be higher the savings rate has to be sufficient to support the investment that is required in the overall economy and for the future when you use the word high that is a nominative value statement i wouldn t normally use savings on a global level is sufficient for the global investment that needs to happen the issue then is whether that savings is efficiently allocated among countries let me give you a very specific example if you go to the african countries today you will see plenty that needs to be done hospitals roads etc that need to be built when you go to the developed world you see a surplus malls that are empty parking lots where there are no cars there you see less and less of infrastructure that needs to be built that means the demand for investment is lower therefore your return on savings in those countries will be lower then in the places where a lot of those things need to be done that means that the demand for investment is high and it could be higher than the savings rate of those countries to even that out involves the process of global reallocation of savings therefore i m a supporter of the various international bond markets that the various african countries have been coming to the level of savings in some of our countries is not high enough it needs to be higher but at the global level the level of savings is sufficient for the investment that needs to happen do you as a bank see the fruits of a pro industrialisation policy in different countries the level of industrialisation needs to increase africa has self sufficiency in the primary products both in terms of agriculture as well as mineral resources but is deficient in terms of the finished goods we re exporting cocoa seeds and importing chocolate it s just not the right way to do things especially because the technical knowledge and the thinking process that is then required among the youth of the countries is then lost that to me is a very long answer to your question about industrialisation but i see a lot that we need to do and we need to do it quickly is the private sector taking enough risks and how does this work in terms of lending the question is not lending because lending itself is just a consequence of a project that is bankable what we need to do more of is to create bankable projects to be able to supply what is required in our countries lending is just one of the consequences of that you don t give money to somebody and then say go and find a project that s the best way to throw money away when you look at the african private sector and also the private sectors from elsewhere would you say that we are bold enough and take enough risks you hear people like dangote saying we need to think bigger and bolder i speak to people in the power sector for example who tell me a lot of the risk is borne by government as opposed to by the private sector investor which is not the right way of doing things your question is whether people are taking enough risks and the short answer to that question is no when you go to a place and there s a queue that is a physical manifestation of shortage when you go to want to park in a shopping mall and there s no place to park that s a physical manifestation of shortage whenever there s a physical manifestation of shortage economic science tells us that this is a signal to the producer to bring more goods to the market when the producer is not bringing more goods to the market to alleviate that shortage it means that the producer is not doing enough and that s my definition of risk that you re not doing enough to solve and satisfy that demand the question of power is a different question take nigeria the aggregate production of power in nigeria today in the official domain is about 2 500mw sometimes 5 000mw that power production in nigeria today is about the same amount of power production in bradford in the uk now is that the total power consumption in nigeria no because individuals use generators to produce power independently in their houses and power production from generators is about 10 times what the public utility is charging to scale up the public utilities therefore we have to have a proper price mechanism that is cost reflective and allows the utilities to supply power in a place like nigeria at a profit wherever a supplier cannot supply at a profit they will reduce the supply to the barest minimum what does the african continental free trade agreement mean from a banking perspective dr kwame nkrumah understood that for as long as we are fragmented and cannot act in unison we cannot be taken seriously by the rest of the world taken seriously in the global context means our markets are large enough to excite manufacturers of goods and services and current technologies when those markets are fragmented they are going to say what is the size of togo 7 5m is not good enough what s the size of ghana 25m that is more what is the size of côte d ivoire 25 million that s more what s the size of nigeria 200m but they are poor what is the size of cameroon 20 something million yes but when you put all of that together what is the size of africa 1 2bn that is a lot that s why india attracts more investment than africa the size of the economy is the same the size of the population is the same africa s resources in terms of land mass are 10 times india but india attracts more has more say in the global economy it is one economy africa has 54 separate ones there s no difference between california and mexico they are next door neighbours why is one poor and one rich because california is within the umbrella of the united states that market size is important and that is what the continental free trade agreement is seeking to address a large common market is what we should seek for the continent that s one of the ways of solving the problem of poverty in terms of the policy makers focusing on the nitty gritty in terms of making it happen is there a message from the private sector the message from the private sector is that this needs to be done again if you ask me not as a banker but as an african i would rather people migrate from lagos to accra or from accra to calabar than have the young kids of africa who see no hope in their situation having to migrate across the sahara and becoming food for fishes in the mediterranean it s not right we all have to be very clear that this is the problem we re trying to solve related articles ecobank s ade ayeyemi give banks the

briefing highlights morneau s political minefield stocks canadian dollar oil at a glance manufacturing sales slip amid strike required reading minefield as bank of nova scotia puts it bill morneau s challenges make for a political minefield the federal finance minister faces extreme pressure trying to pull everything off particularly under a minority government as became even clearer when he unveiled his economic and fiscal update monday minister morneau once again takes the reins of the canadian economy this time facing a slowing economy and stretched household balance sheets following a prolonged period of global uncertainty said rebekah young scotiabank s director fiscal and provincial economics in a minority government context he faces a political minefield at all levels of government as he steers the fiscal path forward open this photo in gallery finance minister bill morneauadrian wyld the canadian press as the globe and mail s bill curry reports the liberal budget deficits are under pressure from a hefty adjustment to pension and benefit costs plus the government s tax changes that means fatter than planned deficits at a time that mr morneau s mandate letter says that among other things he has to continue to reduce the government s debt as a function of our economy and preserve canada s coveted triple a credit rating that rating is not currently under threat by the way but monday s statement showed just how difficult mr morneau s task will be toronto dominion bank senior economist brian depratto calculated the long term hit like this the deficit increases by 27 8 billion through fiscal year 2023 24 stronger than forecast revenues would mean an additional 13 billion over the five years add to that 1 5 billion in annual revenue that s supposed to come from a spending review what you end up with are deficits about 7 billion more on average than expected pegged at 28 1 billion in the next fiscal year keeping in mind that that deficit is seen as modest at about 1 2 per cent of gross domestic product one can still make the argument that this government is broke and it s not the best time for being broke the government is so broke that it faces trouble on the debt side just days after receiving his mandate the minister already falls short of a key fiscal anchor of declining debt as a function of the economy said scotiabank s ms young the debt to gdp ratio will in fact increase marginally this year to 31 per cent of gdp where it will stay until before it begins to decline marginally she added with substantial platform commitments still outstanding the minister will face tough choices if he is to credibly reset debt on a downward trajectory as per his mandate not only that ottawa s projections are based on steady economic growth noted royal bank of canada senior economist josh nye any economic downturn in the coming years would cause debt to gdp to rise substantially as did a decade ago he said canada s debt to gdp ratio is still two percentage points higher than it was prior to the 2008 09 recession there s little room to deviate the government has less flexibility to embark on major new spending measures unless policy makers are willing to ram up revenues elsewhere or they are willing to let the deficit run even higher said bank of montreal chief economist douglas porter given the advanced nature of this economic cycle and an already tight job market such a deficit bump seems far from prudent scotiabank s ms young agreed there is little headroom left for additional platform commitments absent additional revenue generating measures ms young said recall net new spending under the liberal platform amounted to about 4 billion next year ramping up to 9 billion by she added net metrics obscured a much bigger spend with one part savings measures to offset two parts of new spending pledges this update wisely holds off on additional spending commitments in light of the current debt ratio path it will be hard to prepare for the next recession no economists aren t saying we re staring a recession in the face but there s going to be one at some point particularly given the long running nature of the current expansion and as ms young noted mr morneau has to be ready for that in past canadian recessions deficit spending has typically increased between 3 to 6 per cent of gdp peak to trough above and beyond its starting fiscal position ms young said we have estimated canada would need to run a deficit peaking at around 4 per cent of gdp or about 75 billion annualized over six quarters to respond to a recession today she added beyond preserving fiscal firepower the minister would be wise to also evaluate his policy tools to tackle a recession before they are needed including strengthening automatic stabilizers the bank of canada may have to do more than it counted on when it recently held its benchmark overnight rate steady at 1 75 per cent the central bank said it would take federal fiscal measures into account when it next updates its projections it stands by to cut rates if needed but so far has marched to its own drummer holding that key rate steady while other central banks eased if the federal government can t offer much more on the fiscal front the onus will fall more heavily on the bank should the economy soften more than expected in 2020 said bmo s mr porter in other words it looks like government spending will be less stimulative than previously believed next year slightly increasing the odds of rate cuts read more markets at a glance read more

imf executive board meeting on the first pci review is tentatively scheduled for late february 2020 recent economic and financial developments as well as short term prospects are positive economic growth remains strong supported by robust activity in the industry construction and tourism sectors improved performance in the transport sector and recovery in agriculture output after two years of drought real gross domestic product gdp growth is estimated at 5 7 percent in the first half of 2019 and projected at 5 2 percent for the year inflation has remained low declining to 0 7 percent in october 2019 it is projected at 1 percent at the end of the year the external position strengthened further in 2019 reflecting strong performance in exports of goods and services notably tourism and increased remittances as well as deceleration in imports projections for 2019 indicate that the current account deficit would narrow to 2 5 percent of gdp in 2019 5 3 percent of gdp in 2018 while international reserves would be above 5 months of prospective imports of goods and services the fiscal position is expected to strengthen further in 2019 and 2020 revenue collection improved compared with last year however it was slightly below projections mainly because of the adverse impact of import deceleration on taxes on international trade and slow disbursement of grants the slow execution of capital outlays kept total expenditures below projections leading to a much higher primary surplus than anticipated revised projections for the year show that the overall deficit would decline from 2 8 percent of gdp in 2018 to about 2 percent of gdp in 2019 for 2020 the overall deficit is budgeted at 1 7 percent of gdp predicated on the expected continued strong economic growth and implementation of measures aimed at broadening the tax base increasing tax compliance improving efficiency in revenue collection agencies and strengthening capital expenditure management fiscal consolidation efforts combined with progress in public enterprises reforms is expected to bring the stock of public debt to some 119 percent of gdp at end 2020 low inflationary pressures and an

transmission mechanism in june 2019 the bcv reduced the overnight interest rate corridor by 150 basis points financial sector indicators improved in 2019 though banks assets quality is weakened by the persistently high level of non performing loans npls which reached 12 1 percent of total loans at end september 2019 in this context the resolution of legacy loans that accounts for the largest share

for their hospitality and close cooperation the policy coordination instrument pci is available to all imf members that do not need fund financial resources at the time of approval it is designed for

every once in a while in certain countries and cultures new words are added to the lexicon brexit fake news crypto in venezuela bitcoin and hyper inflation are perhaps two of the most mentioned words in daily conversation the country s economy has been nose diving since president nicolás maduro came to power in 2013 but it has now reached unprecedented lows the international monetary fund says inflation of the venezuelan bolivar is expected to hit a startling 200 000 per cent this year a cup of coffee that cost 150 bolivars in november 2018 now costs 18 000 bolivars a university professor earning 2 5 million bolivars a month makes just enough to buy about one kilo of meat or a dozen eggs with each paycheck christopher sabatini senior research fellow for latin america at chatham house describes the situation as the worst economic and humanitarian crisis in the world in which there has never been a war throughout history people in certain places have undergone a process which economists like to call the discovery of advantages of backwardness they take techniques that have worked well in more advanced parts of the world and apply them in less developed regions the changes they introduce make those techniques work so well that a region which was once the periphery becomes a centre in its own right in venezuela fintech and more specifically cryptocurrency is increasingly popular fintech and financial inclusion unlike traditional money cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are built on a decentralised electronic ledger called blockchain the ledger isn t controlled by a central bank or finance ministry but by multiple users around the globe running nodes or copies of the entire ledger on their computers which can t be cut off or censored more than the economic and political crisis a feeling of distrust has permeated every level of venezuelan society people are looking for ways to operate outside the system just to buy goods and services there are stories of employees leaving their office jobs to stand in line under the hot sun in supermarket queues so they can buy produce to be sold on the black market where they can make more money than having a regular nine to five choosing cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in venezuela over the bolivar is just another survival strategy there is a lot of cryptocurrency going on but it s not very open like you would have in the united states and other countries says steven malca president of the south america initiative a us based ngo providing humanitarian aid the government hasn t outlawed cryptocurrency per se but they prefer people to use something they call the petro venezuela s petro national cryptocurrency was launched by president maduro in october 2018 as an alternative to the ever declining bolivar it is supposed to be backed by venezuela s rich oil reserves but as with anything backed by the government in caracas the petro has failed to take off critics say it is another government ruse to circumvent international sanctions more importantly the average venezuelan more concerned about where their next meal is coming from just doesn t know enough about it can cryptos save the day you have to educate people says mr malca in the united states and europe we are able to sit down and research about these things in venezuela the average internet connection is a quarter of a megabyte or one megabyte at the most people still don t have access to this type of information and they are afraid to use something that is not tangible and yet amid the chaos and lack of information there is evidence cryptocurrency is making some sort of difference when we give people crypto we also set up stores which accept payments in crypto and have cash out partners so they can exchange crypto for cash says joe waltman executive director of givecrypto a non profit that distributes cryptocurrency to people in poverty when we track a number of impact metrics such as food security and the psychological wellbeing of the people we give crypto to we see significant statistical improvement in both of those areas they are eating more and feeling much less stressed when receiving our aid even cryptocurrency isn t immune to market volatility however two years ago there was a sort of bitcoin frenzy triggering wild price fluctuations throughout the market cryptocurrencies are an attractive censor proof tool for remittances but volatility can make crypto tokens a dangerous medium for transfers and savings in a country where people s daily lives are dictated by the value of their currency the last thing needed is another element of uncertainty confidence trust and credibility on one hand cryptocurrency has allowed some venezuelans with access to computers knowhow and blockchain technology to receive money from their family and friends abroad on the other hand the system is still far from inclusive at times it can be highly discriminatory says dr sabatini the very poor don t have access to online accounts or relatives living abroad so while crypto is helpful it is not a magic bullet historically successful economies have always been propped up by two pillars confidence and trust when things go as they should people feel confident to invest and buy things when times get tough there is still trust that institutions will be up to the challenge at the most fundamental level the problem in venezuela is one of credibility all over the world people living under oppressive regimes have found ways to get on with life in many cases with the help of technology in venezuela crypto in the form of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies might provide a beacon of hope but they won t be the solution the linchpin of monetary stability is confidence says dr sabatini at every turn maduro s government has demonstrated its partisanship its corruption its lack of transparency and its willingness to manipulate fiscal currency and monetary policy people s reserve of confidence has evaporated and it s going to take another government to restore that regardless of developments in the fintech industry
asia china and russia have proposed reducing sanctions on north korea so that they can ease back into global trade and help denuclearization talks however the us disagreed saying that any reduction in sanctions would be premature as they believe north korea is escalating tensions in the region reserve bank of india governor shaktikanta das said on monday that there is scope in india for cutting interest rates further and the central bank will use it when required after studying growth and inflation data the monetary policy committee mpc surprised markets and analysts this month by holding rates steady after trimming the key interest rate by 135 basis points since the beginning of the current rate reduction cycle in february das said markets were surprised when the committee started cutting rates in february but subsequently accepted that it was right in doing so he also said both the government and the central bank had taken steps to help the economy recover but the outcome of events in the global economy would play a role online sales in india accounted for 1 6 of total retail sales with intra regional trade in south asia remaining low the world bank said on monday in a

us americas tomorrow the house will determine whether the two articles against trump provide sufficient support for impeachment last week the house judicial committee found president trump guilty of two impeachable offenses abuse of power and obstruction of congress the democratic led house believes trump abused his power by asking ukraine to investigate hunter biden s questionable business

a decade ago democrat politicians and their cultural and academic allies were singing the praises of hugo chávez and his economic miracle in venezuela from bernie sanders to salon to joseph stiglitz and sean penn chávez s version of socialism had transformed venezuela lifted up the poor and set an example for the united states and latin america today venezuela takes its rightful place with the left in the orwellian memory hole sanders no longer brings it up on the campaign trail stiglitz has not made a public comment on the venezuelan economy or chávez s successor nicolás maduro the left either claims that venezuela never really tried real socialism yahoo finance or simply pretends that the country and its brutal kleptocracy are nonexistent or at best irrelevant to the latest collectivist policies being thrown out by democrat politicians yet neither venezuela nor its policies are irrelevant in us politics on the contrary they are the staple of some candidates running for the presidential nomination of the democratic party their proposals are much closer to the chávez maduro variety of socialism than any of them or their media allies are willing to admit while they insist that they want to create a new denmark what they are fashioning is a domestic version of the latest latin american tragedy to understand why this is so we first need a refresher course on what has happened in venezuela first chávez directed almost all his political rhetoric toward poor people in the country and against those who were wealthy now it is important to remember that latin america has had much greater contrasts between wealth and poverty than what we generally see in the united states and europe the classical liberalism that encouraged free trade and produced the open economy in the usa did not take root south of the border the economies in latin america historically have been much more highly regulated and more protectionist than what has been the case in this country and that means fewer economic opportunities for the masses this fact has not kept socialists from claiming that latin american countries practice untrammeled free enterprise and so politicians there with encouragement from the american left have maintained that authoritarian socialism is necessary to narrow the standard of living gap between rich and poor in those nations in the case of venezuela the chávez government nationalized the oil industry not an insignificant thing given that venezuela sits upon the world s largest reserves of crude oil venezuela hardly is the only country with a government owned oil sector the oil producing facilities of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec nations all are state owned as is norway s petroleum producing sector whatever the inefficiencies of socialism in the energy sectors however the people running the nationalized oil industries at least have had the foresight to maintain a workable capital stock drilling and transportation of crude oil is highly capital intensive which means that a sizable portion of oil revenues must be plowed back into working capital in order to keep the oil fields productive chávez had different and more delusional ideas about how to run venezuela s newly nationalized oil industry first like the cartoon version of the latin american dictator he replaced much of the private workforce with political cronies which guaranteed that the industry would be poorly managed second he spent oil revenues for political purposes ostensibly to build schools and hospitals as the narrative goes and his spending spree somehow drastically reduced the nation s rate of poverty there is some truth to the idea that at the beginning vast wealth transfers will make the recipients better off but this always is temporary because the productive individuals and industrial sectors having their assets confiscated will not go on producing at the same high level in the case of the venezuelan oil boom chávez s scheme had its inevitable meeting with reality at first the vast wealth transfers did make some people better off in part because the nation had enormous oil revenues and oil prices were at historically high levels around the world however even then the oil money was not enough to cover the chávez spending spree and his government resorted to what latin american dictators from central casting always do print money and lots of it the high oil prices did not last and venezuela saw a combination of falling prices and falling production as capital equipment in the neglected oil fields wore out and oil revenues dropped precipitously that meant even more money printing and burgeoning hyperinflation to go with it as one would expect from the cartoonish chávez who mercifully would die of cancer and leave his government in the hands of the even more thuggish maduro but what does that have to do with the platforms of bernie sanders elizabeth warren and other democrats after all while they talk of democratic socialism none are calling for anything that seems to be as radical as anything done in venezuela but guess again their platforms are closer to those of chávez and maduro than they will admit the venezuelan authorities seized the assets of oil companies and other firms and then spent their revenues on things not related to the businesses his supporters say that chávez s government built hospitals and schools providing services for poor people that in return provided chávez his votes as pointed out before whatever chávez and maduro did with the oil revenues was not sustainable because the government failed to maintain the capital and oil prices fell drastically leaving the government to print money the rest is very sad history other than sanders no candidate has called for directly nationalizing the oil and gas industries although warren and sanders have called for shutting down at least some fuel production and it is clear that they would like the industry to disappear altogether with windmills and solar energy providing the bulk of us energy thus whatever income equality schemes they have planned using oil revenues is not one of them sanders has promised to provide five years of pay and benefits for energy workers that lose their jobs under his energy or lack of energy plan instead of milking the oil industry for political cash sanders and warren have found what they believe to be an eternal source of revenue the wealth of american billionaires through proposed wealth taxes and other acts of property confiscation warren and sanders seem to believe that they can fund trillions of dollars in new programs seizing the assets of people like bill gates and jeff bezos and turning them into new revenue that would work economic miracles elsewhere declared sanders say bill gates was actually taxed 100 billion we could end homelessness and provide safe drinking water to everyone in this country bill would still be a multibillionaire while warren hasn t made the claim that confiscating most of gates s wealth would end homelessness and provide clean water for the nation she has made a big deal of the fact that the proposed tax would only be two cents on the dollar but also would accomplish all sorts of wonderful things i will deal with sanders s claims later if the facebook posts by my progressive friends are accurate a small number of billionaires controls most of the wealth in the world and this tiny cadre of people is hoarding all the money and leaving everyone else in the world out in the cold while this might seem like a cause for action there is much that the progressives warren sanders and their economist allies are not saying and what is left out is the most important thing contrary to what one reads in the new york times or the nation people like jeff bezos are not hoarding anything and they certainly are not creating poverty according to economists thomas piketty and gabriel zucman among others capital owners receive increasing returns on their investment and so as their businesses grow they gain an increasing share of the proceeds leaving workers and everyone else out in the cold getting beyond all the numbers that these economists are presenting there is a logical construct that must be satisfied for their claims to be true if they are correct then over the past two decades which have seen exponential growth in web based enterprises and the rise of billionaire fortunes we would expect to see a corresponding number of people around the world slide off into poverty after all if bill gates and jeff bezos are gobbling up all the wealth and income then there would be a constantly decreasing amount for everyone else which only can mean that the rest of the world is getting poorer there is no other possible outcome yet that is not what we have seen over the past two decades poverty rates worldwide have fallen not risen the numbers are irrefutable and more important if they are true then warren and sanders along with their supporting economists are wrong even warren and sanders however recognize that most billionaires are not receiving these huge sums of money as cash income the way the rest of us receive paychecks instead they seem to understand that the vast holdings of billionaires are in non cash assets such as stocks or property furthermore getting an accurate and timely assessment of those assets would be difficult to put it mildly zucman and others have said that governments simply can seize the assets like stock holdings and sell them on open markets and in their view make the markets more efficient which would is a heroic assumption getting beyond the practicality of such taxation there is the problem of the assumption behind it governments would gain new tax revenues but the economic behavior of the people being taxed would not change one has to understand how someone like bezos gained his wealth in the first place before he founded amazon in 1994 using 300 000 he received from his parents he had other tech jobs but hardly commanded anything close to his current wealth amazon he told other investors was a huge risk and he warned them that it had maybe a 30 percent chance of success like so many other internet startups from that era it took a long time for amazon to turn a profit but when many of the dot com companies imploded at the turn of this century amazon managed to survive not that long ago the wealth that amazon currently represents did not exist we are speaking of a firm that is only twenty five years old google is younger than that and in its early days was up for sale for less than a million dollars these companies and many like them grew and thrived because they provided something of value for their customers and clients this last point is important because to listen to the political rhetoric coming from sanders and warren one would think that people like bezos and gates raided everyone else s bank accounts and unexplainably managed to hoard the money for themselves neither of these candidates seem to have a clue that the asset values of these billionaire portfolios have come from entrepreneurial activity in which these people risked their own personal wealth to build companies that had no guarantee of success what these political candidates and their economist supporters seem to believe however is that if they seize huge assets from these people 1 they easily can convert them into cash without destroying their value and 2 their actions will not have any negative effect on the creation of wealth so that every year these billionaires and their companies will continue to fill the government coffers full of cash paying for every political promise one can imagine earlier in this article i pointed out sanders s assertion that if he could confiscate more than 90 percent of bill gates s assets the result would be no more homeless people living on the streets and clean water for all americans the causality chain is murky to say the least and sanders does not explain how his plan would work or how it would get people off the streets and clean up the nation s drinking supply apparently he assumes that such things are self evident but the government has been throwing billions and billions of dollars at these issues for years and homeless people seem to be increasing especially in the places that progressives govern besides performing all sorts of government financed wonders warren and sanders seem to believe that those being taxed would not change their behaviors and that confiscating large amounts of assets from growing firms would have zero effect on business growth the closest analogy i can find is from the cult film animal house in which the band marches into the wall i am sure that sanders and warren would respond that they would issue threats against the firms and anyone trying to change their wealth status as though one can build wealth through threats of government punishment like chávez and maduro who believed that the oil revenues would last forever warren and sanders believe that they have found their fountain of funding the confiscation of billionaires assets and like chávez and maduro they seem to believe that american businesses would continue to grow that entrepreneurs would pretend that the government didn t regard them as public enemy number one and that their taxation schemes would provide lots of funding for free healthcare education and much more the oil revenue stream in fact did run dry or nearly so but the flood of new programs and benefits was still there including the new hospitals and the like as we know the chávez maduro regime simply printed money and lots of it but paper money was not a replacement for real assets and we know the rest of the story the vaunted new hospital construction became the hospitals with no medicine consumer goods disappeared from the shelves as did basic food items all that was left was the inflation and the memories of a better time likewise whatever new flood of programs sanders and warren would fund through mass confiscation of private assets would not last very long before the funding dried up of course one can imagine that they would take the maduro option blame capitalism and print money such points are obvious and should be obvious to anyone capable of logical thinking that so many voters pundits academics and media figures are taken in by the warren sanders schemes does not bode well for our economic and political future destroying wealth makes us poorer not wealthier and if american voters are not able to understand that simple point they will find out the hard way but they will find out whether or not they understand why the calamity has hit them is another issue altogether as american voters seem increasingly determined to vote for politicians who can create the biggest fantasies

president trump claimed a multi front victory last week in his bid to reshape u s trade policy under his america first philosophy extracting fresh commercial concessions from mexico and china while stripping the world trade organization of its powers to restrain the tactics he used to secure them combined the efforts show an approach toward u s trading partners and multinationals that is focused more on forcing corporations to produce domestically and sell american made goods abroad than on helping them expand their global manufacturing footprint on tuesday the white house announced the rewrite of the country s largest trade deal the 1994 north american free trade agreement winning approval not only from the compact s mexican and canadian partners but from longtime nafta opponents among congressional democrats and organized labor on friday the administration brokered a limited truce with beijing following a year and a half long trade war putting further tariffs on hold and securing an unusual chinese pledge to boost imports of u s goods by a specified dollar amount while trade talks between the two sides continue in between those two announcements the u s on wednesday effectively crippled the geneva based wto trade court that was launched in 1995 to prevent the kinds of trade wars mr trump has deployed to coerce america s trading partners to the bargaining table over the past two years the administration has blocked the appointment of judges to the court and because its remaining members terms are expiring the panel as of last week no longer had enough members to issue decisions and enforce wto rules many economists business leaders and members of congress from both parties say mr trump s efforts have done little to boost economic activity other than by defusing the uncertainty he himself stoked with his disruptive acts but many agree that this was the week where the first three years of trump administration trade policy all came together said clete willems who worked as a white house trade adviser until april mr trump s administration will now turn to negotiating the next phase of a deal with china though election year politics and stiff chinese resistance might make such an agreement difficult and to reaching new or expanded pacts with other trading partners including japan and the european union a new agreement with the u k is also a priority after last week s sweeping election victory of prime minister boris johnson s conservative party makes a british departure from the eu almost certain mr trump took office in january 2017 with a clear vision for how he wanted to upend the longstanding american approach to trade his predecessors he has said repeatedly negotiated bad agreements and he vowed to rip them up he wanted to focus more on concrete outcomes cutting the trade deficit boosting u s manufacturing rather than bolstering transparent market opening rules he believed previous presidents had been too responsive to multinational companies too deferential to multilateral rules and too timid about wielding american power unilaterally the public details of the phase one china deal were vague with many disputed issues left to later negotiations but one provision the u s announced was what it characterized as a promise by beijing to boost imports of u s goods and services over the next two years by at least 200 billion over 2017 levels roughly a doubling within four years that many analysts consider unlikely beyond the top line number we have a list that will go manufacturing agriculture services energy there ll be a total for each one of those robert lighthizer mr trump s chief trade negotiator told cbs s face the nation sunday those specific targets echo various import and export quotas that washington imposed on japan in the 1980s a managed trade approach that u s governments came to shun over the past 30 years the new nafta rebranded the u s mexico canada agreement or usmca followed 2 1 2 years of negotiations after which mexico agreed to provisions designed to strengthen its workers labor protections those included measures allowing americans to monitor conditions there in ways some mexicans feel intrude on their sovereignty the goal is to raise the cost of manufacturing in mexico and shift production that had moved there under the original nafta back to the u s while that contrasts with the earlier pact s objectives of expanding trade and raising the manufacturing efficiency of a unified continental bloc it encapsulates trump trade policy mr lighthizer said sunday he doesn t want american manufacturing workers to have to compete with people who are operating in very difficult working conditions another last minute change in usmca was the removal of a provision for u s drugmakers forcing other countries to extend their patent protections something the pharmaceutical industry had succeeded in making standard in new trade deals the usmca also drops protections for american multinationals investing in other countries another hallmark of recent u s trade agreements both changes show how mr trump sees trade deals as less about helping multinationals do business abroad than encouraging them to focus production at home this is the first trade agreement the u s has ever done that raises trade barriers and degrades investor protections said daniel price a top trade official in the george w bush administration skeptics saw in last week s frenzied activity the limits of unilateral american might in bending the global trading system to its will the friday agreement with beijing in particular was less the sweeping market opening than a cease fire trump was right to call china out on their violations of rules and norms said fred bergsten a trade expert at the peterson institute for international economics but he has been going at them for three years unleashed a lot of firepower and has gotten essentially nowhere on the big issues he added that mr trump s disdain for multilateralism undercut his goals china can stand up to us one on one but it cannot stand up to us if we maintain our alliance structure farmers fret that the gains mr trump touts might not even sufficiently offset their losses to date from his actions the american farm bureau federation noted friday that china went from the second largest market for u s agricultural products to the fifth largest since the trade war began yet to trump supporters the latest deals show that the united states has a great deal of leverage when that leverage is used effectively said stephen vaughn who worked until april as an administration trade negotiator shaping each of its initiatives this u s is actively making its own trade policy right now and that s going very well mr trump s tactics in pursuing the usmca and china deals marked a sharp break from his recent predecessors he imposed tariffs unilaterally to force concessions mexico and canada agreed to rewrite nafta in part to get mr trump to remove steel and aluminum tariffs he had placed on them and to respond to mr trump s threats to add new levies on cars the china import pledge was given in part to get mr trump to drop new tariffs on 156 billion in chinese goods scheduled to take effect sunday since the wto s creation a quarter century ago american presidents have avoided using those unilateral powers instead taking their complaints to the wto and letting the judges there determine whether the u s had a legitimate grievance and if so the proper response mr trump has regularly said the geneva trade court treats the u s unfairly arguing american interests were better served by undermining the institution after last week s neutering of the trade court other countries will have a harder time using the wto to challenge american actions the president s critics cite studies showing modest gains at best for the economy and argue that positive market response to the recent announcements reflect more relief that the administration appeared to cease disrupting the system than any celebration of substantive progress made if your metric is that we ve stopped bleeding ourselves then these have been a plus said robert zoellick a former chief trade negotiator in the bush administration from 2001 to 2005 if your metric is whether we re expanding trade opening markets and setting higher standards then these have been a total waste of time despite warnings that the president s tactics would tank markets and the economy both have remained strong throughout his term this might have been trump s best week in the white house said stephen moore a fellow at the conservative heritage foundation and an informal adviser to the president he noted that in addition to the trade deals you had a monster jobs report dec 6 when the unemployment rate matched a half century low of 3 5 and then by some benchmarks the stock market hit an all time high source dow jones

our outlook for slow sustainable growth in 2020 leads us to believe that stock selection has the potential to provide stronger returns in the year ahead though we expect a modest decline of growth in several major regions including the us the eurozone and china said john leonard global head of equities for macquarie investment management macquarie sees the following market themes across its 12 boutique equity investment teams managers do not anticipate a sharp drop in economic activity despite potential headwinds associated with trade disputes the us presidential election and growing debt levels globally if the environment remains stable opportunities could be found in the united states in other developing markets and in emerging markets our view is that investor sentiment seems to expect that the us economy will continue to grow in 2020 given the combination of a strong labor market and robust consumer spending the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd forecasts that the chinese economy may grow at a slower rate in 2020 than over the past decade which may affect companies and countries around the world but macquarie believes the chinese economy remains quite robust china s sphere of influence continues to expand particularly in clean energy and 5g communications technology managers are optimistic about the outlooks for sectors such as software internet and mobile technology especially among small cap equities several teams believe that healthcare spending globally appear likely to continue to rise as the populations of developed countries continue to age value teams continue to search for income generating securities which would likely benefit if the market environment remains somewhat volatile portfolio managers covering materials and natural resources have a generally positive iew on protein producers and lumber but believe small cap energy producers could face some headwinds global fixed income as we look towards 2020 the key question on our minds is can the insatiable chase for yield extend the cycle again said brett lewthwaite chief investment officer and global head of fixed income for macquarie investment management the global central bank pivot that we witnessed in 2019 back to the resumption of unthinkable support and easing has reignited the chase for yield this occurred despite a deterioration in global growth fundamentals led by china and the bond market s warnings of a possible recession against this backdrop recognize the bond market rarely gets it wrong and a sustained curve inversion of the yield curve and proliferation of negative yields globally warrants close attention acknowledge the usual signs of a recession appear absent yet some signals and late cycle cracks are appearing pay close attention to economic data from china and watch credit markets in particular high yield spreads for signals as to whether this cycle can once again be extended continue to hold and accumulate

will rediscover capitalism that doesn t mean it will become a western democracy it means locals will return to investing in the stock market relying less on old fixed income and real estate from a top down perspective russia will continue its tortoise pace towards private business expansion and a shrinking of a state that s gotten too large thanks in part to numerous failed private banks taken over by the state in recent years skyscrapers and luxury residences are still being erected in moscow s financial district despite five years of sanctions minority shareholders matter more than ever now even state owned companies are spreading the wealth returning profits to shareholders in the form of hefty dividends but the main trend that will continue apace into 2020 for russia is that the locals have become more trusting of the stock market they re investing and holding for longer periods long term for a russian investor is about a year as a result of this change russia s financial services

in 1960 cuba and hong kong had a similar level of gdp per capita at around 4 500 in today s money by 2018 cuba s gdp per capita had risen to around 9 000 by contrast hong kong had reached 64 000 per capita a similar level to the us and switzerland over 60 years cuba had doubled its economic prosperity where hong kong had achieved a 14 fold increase in the early 1960s hong kong and cuba faced a choice each government needed to determine what economic policies to pursue whilst they broadly voiced the same objectives to improve living standards manage unemployment and develop their economies they would end up following very different solutions and helpfully for those interested in the results of economic policy they would largely remain true to their choices for the following six decades in cuba the crony capitalist regime of fulgencio batista was overthrown by an alliance headed by fidel castro on 1 january 1959 castro had communicated little by way of an economic agenda other than a commitment some years earlier to land reform when he took control he appointed a liberal president and prime minister even six months after the revolution in july 1959 the one certainty castro asserted was i am not a communist and neither is the revolutionary movement but being a consummate politician castro knew that he could not leave a policy vacuum his land reform agenda would need to be followed by a more active agenda than the coalition government was likely to develop to create his economic plan he turned to an unlikely source his deputy in the revolutionary army che guevara meanwhile hong kong was also questioning what economic direction to take hong kong had made a surprisingly rapid recovery from the desolation of wartime japanese occupation the entrepôt trade with china had bounced back only to be decimated by us sanctions on china during the korean war remarkably a nascent textile industry founded by entrepreneurs fleeing communist china emerged taking up the slack soon spindles were spinning yarns looms were weaving cloth dyes were colouring fabric and needle workers were sewing garments a wave of competitively priced textiles hit the us and uk markets and although prime minister macmillan and president kennedy championed free trade in general in practice they tried to protect their decaying domestic industries in 1960 arthur clarke the financial secretary the equivalent of finance minister argued hong kong could continue until markets were closed to exporters or we can do something to plan our economy abandon laissez faire and move to regulation and control since he was retiring he left the decision to his successor john cowperthwaite these two men che guevara and john cowperthwaite would be the architects of a great natural economic experiment most people today think of che guevara as a revolutionary who fought against capitalism authoritarianism and us imperialism less well known is that guevara was central to the creation of cuba s economic policy in the early 1960s policies that remain largely unchanged he ran the land reform programme was president of the national bank of cuba minister of industry member of the national directorate for the economy member of the council of ministers and chief negotiator with the soviet bloc guevara would steer castro and cuba towards a marxist economy he led the collectivisation and nationalisation of agriculture nationalised virtually all industrial and commercial activity introduced central planning established price controls and rationing replaced the currency and seized most savings set the wage levels of all jobs set industrial policy and investment and controlled all foreign exchange and bartered with russia china and other communist countries cowperthwaite spent much of his first year as financial secretary persuading the us and the uk to remain open to imports from hong kong he then turned to the question posed by his predecessor many including the government and civil service in london were keen that hong kong follow the emerging uk consensus of industrial planning keynesian deficits nationalisation activist economic policies high inflation high levels of government spending and high taxation how much of this emerging global consensus did cowperthwaite and his colleagues adopt virtually nothing cowperthwaite defended the free market laissez faire free trade low taxation privately owned model where firms risking their own money decided where to invest and which industries to liquidate the sunday times would note that it was one of those glorious accidents that a man unversed in the 20th century s fad for socialism could apply his 18th century ideas in a territory unencumbered with democracy governors came and went but cowperthwaite kept balancing budgets lowering taxes and keeping markets open including the market in immigrants the times 3 february 2006 friedman 1953 noted that we must rely on evidence cast by the experiments that happen to occur milton friedman 1953 introduction and a key feature of this comparison between hong kong and cuba is its longevity and stability of policy in part due in each case to the lack of democracy and whilst natural experiments are never perfectly controlled so that no single natural experiment can be viewed as dispositive the constancy of policy stance has been matched by a remarkable and consistent difference in outcome anyone interested in the link between economic policy and prosperity will find lessons as to what worked in this period in hong kong and equally powerful lessons as to why cuba has failed to deliver affluence for its people with the rise of self employment in cuba and the troubles in hong kong this important natural experiment may be coming to an end but its lessons will remain valid whatever the future holds for the people of cuba and of hong kong maddison project database version 2018 bolt et al 2018 the data for real gdp per capita in

as the end of the year and the decade approaches wall street strategists have been delivering their expectations about where the stock market will close out 2020 the next year will bring with it myriad market moving events including the 2020 presidential elections and next phases in u s china trade relations market pundits across wall street have each delivered their ideas for how these and other catalysts will shape equity markets in 2020 their theses come as stocks have flirted with fresh record highs time and again in the fourth quarter of 2019 as global growth concerns receded from a fever pitch earlier this year as of mid november the s p 500 was up more than 23 for the year to date here s a summary of what some of wall street s top strategists are telling their clients for next year updated as new 2020 views become available wells fargo target 3 388 eps 166 recession risks in the rearview mirror but a correction could be coming over the past couple months strategists expectations for a market melt up early next year have far outpaced fears of a recession from earlier this year the swift about face in sentiment however could pose a risk to markets in 2020 according to wells fargo advertisement advertisement since the stock market sell off this past august the frequency of bloomberg r word mentions are down nearly 70 and the vix index has retreated to 40 below its long term average chris harvey wells fargo chief equity strategist wrote in a note the last time sentiment felt this positive 4q17 on the heels of tax reform stocks initially rallied in 1q18 before running head first into a 10 correction for 2020 investors should brace for a more volatile equity market harvey said with the vix vix volatility gauge back down around 12 and investment grade credit spreads shrunken down to about 100 basis points we see material scope for an upward move he added a 10 stock market correction in 1h20 is possible we can envision one in late march early april when the fed s balance sheet possibly stops growing harvey said with emphasis his if we do see a healthy equity sell off in 1h20 we would buy weakness all else equal until that time we recommend reducing portfolio risk slowly and opportunistically wall street s 2020 price targets with this in mind harvey downgraded semiconductors to neutral from outperform noting that this high risk early cyclical group has outperformed expectations and many of the reasons for the upgrade have already played out on the other hand the value group of reits has underperformed the market since june and is approaching technically oversold levels harvey added advertisement advertisement wells fargo s price target of 3 388 suggests stocks will ultimately end slightly higher next year with gains mostly held back by still sluggish increases in company profits as harvey points out most of the s p 500 s 27 gain for the year to date was driven by a price to earnings multiple expansion meaning stocks have gotten more expensive in absence of major earnings growth this in turn was driven by declines in both treasury yields and credit spreads this year neither of which will likely continue next year harvey said story continues we take a more conservative stance on 2020 eps growth harvey said a number of economic factors that are positively correlated with eps growth should improve ism ism services and capacity utilization however other factors will likely be neutral to negative credit spreads volatility and unemployment he added the net result is an spx eps estimate of 166 or 5 growth from the current estimate of 158 50 wells fargo price target introduced december 19 2019 fundstrat target 3 450 eps 178 2009 was the best analog for 2019 in fundstrat s view 2018 was a proper bear market and a reset of economic and fundamental expectations taking this approach 2020 will represent the second year of a bull market analogous to 2010 when stocks limped out the gate but ultimately ended the year 12 8 higher advertisement advertisement we stated at the start of 2019 that 2009 was the best analog for 2019 and we believe this remains correct fundstrat head of research tom lee said in a note three major phenomena will take place in 2020 and help propel stocks higher lee said purchasing managers indices will rebound after hitting a bottom this year and corporate earnings per share will recover lee predicts each of these occurrences had also taken place in 2010 in the wake of a series of federal reserve interest rate cuts and easing of financial conditions and third 2020 will have the added bonus of extra fiscal stimulus from japan and europe as policymakers turn to fiscal rather than monetary policy to boost growth further amid already negative interest rates fundstrat s 2020 target of 3 450 is based on predicted eps growth of 10 this implies however that p e will remain roughly flat at 17 88x advertisement advertisement the last 2 years have been about p e de rate in 2018 re rate in 2019 but in 2020 we see eps being the key lee said fundstrat price target introduced december 19 2019 oppenheimer target 3 500 eps 175 significant focus will be placed on corporate earnings growth news of a phase one trade agreement pulled concerns of a u s china trade war escalation mostly off the table and positioned stocks to vault even higher next year according to oppenheimer the change in status of the trade war by virtue of a phase one agreement in principle presents an opportunity for markets to move higher near term and on further news of progress related to the phase one process the final hammering out of details before it s signed and the further phases that are likely to follow john stoltzfus chief investment strategist for oppenheimer wrote in a note advertisement advertisement we see room for higher valuations in the new year but believe significant focus will be placed on corporate earnings growth as trade war uncertainty is reduced further over the next phases of negotiations he said beyond improving sentiment around trade a number of factors drove the s p 500 s surging growth through the end of 2019 including stronger than expected corporate profit trends and oil prices firming economic data and improving clarity and communication from federal reserve officials equity market gains since the september 20 2018 peak through today do not suggest to us the presence of animal spirits or irrational exuberance but rather an about face and an acknowledgement in hindsight that it wasn t so much a deterioration of economic or business fundamentals in q4 of 2018 that dragged the s p 500 down nearly 20 but rather an overblown misinterpretation of economic slowing related to the trade war monetary policy and a ramp up in oil production initiated by opec stoltzfus said while risks remain such as a negative reversal in trade talks a misstep in monetary policy or rapid market melt up and correction stocks are likely to end next year higher according to oppenheimer advertisement advertisement the firm s 2020 s p 500 price target of 3 500 implies a 20x multiple of its 2020 earnings estimate of 175 and represents 9 7 appreciation from closing prices monday from current levels a price target of 3 500 in our view appears attainable for the s p 500 in 2020 considering the strengths and resilience of the u s economy a potential improvement of the global economy tied to lessening of tensions that have impeded economic progress over the past 18 months and the capability of the federal reserve to navigate uncertain waters he said oppenheimer price target initiated december 17 2019 piper jaffray target 3 600 eps 180 50 overall fundamentals appear supportive for a continuation of risk asset outperformance the stock market is poised for another year of double digit returns according to piper jaffray advertisement advertisement the firm s price target of 3 600 represents upside of about 13 6 for the s p 500 based on closing prices dec 13 that s also the most bullish price target seen by yahoo finance to date as we look ahead to 2020 overall fundamentals appear supportive for a continuation of risk asset outperformance and based on current expectations catalysts are in place for growth to come in better than feared a consortium of piper jaffray analysts wrote in a note we suspect interest rates and curve spreads will gradually rise as a result and also help alleviate recession fears they added trade policy remains a key risk however similar to 19 we believe trade related volatility will be temporary and represent a buying opportunity by these analysts measures the technical setup for u s equities remains bullish heading into 2020 driven by a rotation from safe havens like treasuries and gold into risk assets like stocks advertisement advertisement large caps and growth have held on to their leadership credentials but participation has broadened out into cyclical sectors along with value and smaller cap stocks the analysts said on the s p 500 momentum has been reset from overbought levels with key resistance coming into play at the recent november high of 3 154 support on the index sets up at 3 120 followed by 3 100 which we view as a key level for bulls to defend as a downside violation would imply an additional 2 0 2 5 pullback meanwhile the domestic economic expansion is set to outperform against low expectations and help contribute to equity appreciation next year the analysts view a robust labor market accommodative monetary policy stable improving housing market

jpmorgan strategist dubravko lakos bujas advertisement advertisement next year we see the s p 500 rising further to 3 400 on global cycle recovery partial trade deal pro growth election year rhetoric and neutral investor positioning he said domestic stocks faced two main headwinds in 2019 tighter monetary policy and higher tariffs which in turn contributed to a slowdown in global business and profit growth lakos bujas said he estimated the cumulative damage from tariffs alone slowed 2019 earnings per share growth down to just 1 from an estimated rise of 8 in absence of import duties heading into 2020 these drags are expected to at least partially reverse lakos bujas said easier monetary and fiscal policies are in motion globally with majority of benefits expected to flow through the economy in the coming quarters and for trade lakos bujas expects an at least partial deal between the u s and china sometime ahead of the 2020 election upside for earnings growth and s p 500 appreciation will depend primarily on the magnitude and timing of the trade deal s he said in the event of a full deal and reversal of all tariffs eps would rise to as much as 184 or an increase of 12 a year on the flip side an escalation of tensions and increase in tariffs would lead to eps growth of just 4 to 171 jpmorgan estimates but the firm s base case scenario of 180 in eps implies a partial trade deal and roll back of list 4a tariffs first applied in early september by jpmorgan s measure earnings growth likely bottomed in 3q and should stabilize in 4q followed by an earnings recovery in

canaccord genuity target 3 440 eps 172 a move back toward the peak valuation of this cycle canaccord genuity cites the federal reserve s suggested pause on interest rate adjustments as creating a tailwind for both economic and earnings growth contributing to a higher s p 500 in 2019 in an updated note the firm raised its price target for the s p 500 to 3 440 from its 3 350 price target initiated in may the bullish story for 2019 was based on the economy experiencing a non recession slowdown that was dramatic enough to cause the fed to reverse the policy mistakes made in late 2018 canaccord genuity analyst tony dwyer wrote in a note the fed s pivot to easing this year and bringing key rates down by a total of 75 basis points has driven a rebound in u s economic data and will likely contribute to a pick up in earnings growth next year dwyer said canaccord expects eps growth will be between 5 6 in 2020 but from a lower base of 162 a share in 2019 bringing their eps estimate for 2020 down to 172 from the 176 seen previously in addition to raising our growth rate assumption we are also raising our multiple assumption from 19x to 20x dwyer said this reflects the fed literally telling us they will ease further on any weakness and will not raise rates until inflation is meaningfully above their target which likely won t happen for the foreseeable future dwyer outlined a series of interconnected factors that informed his bullish thesis for the s p 500 next year he expects monetary policy will remain accommodative due to persistently low core inflationary signals this will in turn drive an abundance of available credit for companies and consumers to use to invest and grow we expect a move back toward the peak valuation of this cycle as long as our core

brexit as politicians realize that growth is a vital requisite to their staying in power and postponing a 2000 02 economic and market downturn an onslaught of brokerages now offering zero fee trading could usher in greater public participation in the stock market and help drive the s p 500 as high as 3 950 emanuel said at the same time however the s p could fall as low as 2 560 in the event that a reversion to the pre 1989 cold war multiple regime happens as a result of geopolitical miscalculations upside surprises for 2020 could be higher inflation a quiet fed and a 2020 political outcome

in 2020 after more than a year s worth of choppy equity trading which had been driven by gyrating interest rates and an ongoing u s china trade war according to jefferies just over twelve months ago the equity markets were selling off as the u s fixed income markets choked on expectations of further rate hikes equity strategist sean darby said but in the year since the fed cut rates three times and returned to making large scale asset purchases which in part helped to drive a more than 20 gain in the s p 500 in 2019 if 2018 was a year of policy over tightening then 2019 was a year of unwinding policy mistakes darby said hence 2020 looks to be the year of normalization as a number of macro factors recede darby also noted that rhetoric around u s china trade discussions has become more upbeat recently alleviating a key overhang of trade policy uncertainty for major companies plus 2020 earnings will have fully lapped impacts from the trump administration s 2018 corporate tax cuts which had driven tough comparisons and lowered earnings expectations for companies throughout much of 2019 2020 ought to see some normalization as earnings growth moves back in tandem with gdp darby said in summary equity investors are likely to be focused on the traditional drivers for u s markets namely earnings growth darby conceded that the 2020 presidential elections could generate some idiosyncratic risks for sectors like health care financials and technology depending on the prevailing policies of newly elected officials his base case however is that neither party will win both the house and the senate creating a hurdle for politicians trying to implement policies that could impact any of these companies operations heading into 2020 sector leadership will likely be driven by cyclicals assuming the recent upturn in global economic data carries through next year darby said s p 500 valuations don t necessarily start off as inexpensive as other bourses but the cyclicals offer a lot of earnings upside if the global economy begins to resynchronize darby said moreover 2019 saw unprecedented risk aversion and there is plenty of room for assets to move away from fixed income into equities given the potential inflation risks in turn this leads us to the biggest risk for 2020 which is a switch from low volatility bond proxies into the real economy cyclical growth stocks he said we expect earnings to accelerate back to trend of circa 10 real interest rates to remain negative alongside a steep yield curve darby said this ought to mean that the s p 500 can

using macro and political dynamics to create opportunities in the health care financials and energy sectors these three aforementioned sectors could be particularly impacted by the outcome of the 2020

including her desire to end offshore drilling and drilling on federal land reduce greenhouse gases increase regulation on big banks impose regulation on private equity control drug prices make the u s government the sole health care insurance payer break up big tech companies increase gun control and reallocate reduce defense spending tschosik said as election winners become clear we expect some sectors to mean revert to more normal valuations as political risk is priced out tschosik said again we suspect health care financials and energy are likely to have the most political risk priced in

transition toward cyclical value equities sectors ste marie said the outsized value reversal seen last september was relatively rare and these tend to be followed by value outperformance over the next 12 to 18 months equity indicators are mostly flashing mixed signals ste marie said and investors distrust seems as high as ever in equities as outflows surged for u s mutual funds and etfs at the start of december but stocks could nevertheless be poised for a boost in 2020 in an improving economic environment over the next two years we expected the u s and canadian job market to remain robust no sustained spike in jobless claims with high consumer confidence consumption and accommodative monetary policy no hikes until mid 2021 ste marie said the steep fall in yields has already started to

estimated 165 for 2019 eps the forecast assumes further progress on trade talks between the u s and china including at least a modest de escalation of tariffs further progress on the u s china trade conflict in early 2020 could help keep u s economic growth at or above the trend for the current economic expansion and support corporate revenue growth lpl strategists led by john lynch said in a report we believe any small steps forward on trade could increase business confidence and spark capital investment lifting corporate profits however until we have clarity on trade we would not expect 2020 earnings to improve meaningfully from 2019 levels lynch said lpl s 2020 year end fair value target range for the s p 500 is between 3 250 and 3 300 implying a trailing price to earnings ratio of 18 75x the firm believes this valuation will be supported as inflation remains muted and interest rates hold at relatively low levels the low end of lpl s range implies appreciation of just about 4 for the s p 500 from closing prices december 2 versus the more than 20 advance the index has posted so far in 2019 but domestic equities still remain more attractive than those from international developed markets lpl said given that the u s economic backdrop and prospects for corporate profitability still look stronger than those of many developed global peers we recommend tactical investors consider focusing the majority of their equities allocations here at home as u s economic growth expectations have held up well compared with global trends lynch said we recommend a balance of growth and value styles with an emphasis on large cap stocks over their small cap counterparts as the business cycle moves into its latter stages he added we continue to prefer cyclical sectors as the u s economic expansion continues and technology still leads this bull market we expect industrials to benefit from a potential pickup in capital spending if there is further progress on a u s china trade

the firm s chief strategist binky chadha one of the more bullish prognosticators on wall street for the s p 500 this year is calling for the index to end 2020 at 3 250 the same price target he had for the blue chip index in 2019 that implies just 4 appreciation from closing prices on december 2 equity traders may have gotten ahead of themselves in pricing in a rebound in macroeconomic data and corporate earnings chadha said which could keep the s p 500 range bound next year what s priced in a strong rebound in macro growth with the isms rising to around 57 and earnings growth to 15 chadha said this year the s p 500 has climbed to new all time highs despite continued slowing in both suggesting the markets are pricing in a rebound in fundamentals supported by recent green shoots optimism after appreciating 20 this year the s p 500 has seen its multiple expand 19 1x earnings at this level valuations are at the high of their historical range having been higher only 10 of the time over the last 85 years chadha said however while this multiple is relatively high on a historical basis it is not too far above fair value 18 7x indicated by its fundamental historical drivers chadha said these include earnings relative to normalized levels the payout ratio interest rates and inflation volatility where the multiple goes over the course of the next year will depend on how these drivers evolve chadha said aside from typical fundamental drivers next year s elections will also provide a market moving event for traders to eye as chadha sees it the risks from the election will be to the downside for equities the us presidential election will make it difficult for the fundamental uncertainty emanating from us trade policy which has plagued corporates and been a key driver of the us and global growth slowdowns to dissipate completely chadha said this argues for a break in the downward trajectory of growth and some bounce not a rebound to the peaks of this cycle as the markets are already pricing deutsche bank price target introduced december 2 2019 rbc capital markets target 3 350 eps 174 a year of moderation turbulence and transition in the u s equity markets rbc capital

the u s equity market said lori calvasina head of u s equity strategy for rbc down years are rare in the u s equity market outside of periods associated with growth scares recessions or financial market bubbles with those scenarios unlikely in the year ahead we expect 2020 to be another positive year for the u s equity market however calvasina added that she remains on guard for a pullback in the months ahead given recent equity positioning by institutional investors driven by what she believes is a fear of missing out in late november positioning in u s equities in the futures market among asset managers has been slightly above its july 2019 september 2018 and 2007 highs which all marked major peaks in the u s equity market resulting in pullbacks that ranged from 7 to 20 over the past few years she said this keeps us on guard for a period of significant consolidation near term and will be an overhang on 2020 performance if not resolved before year end as calvasina puts it the stock market may have gotten a little too excited about the economy recently and especially as the federal reserve has telegraphed a near term pause to interest rates while the u s expansion is poised to continue in 2020 it may grow with less gusto than some market participants may be pricing in she said realization by equity investors that the u s is likely to see moderate as opposed to rapid economic growth in the year ahead could be a catalyst for profit taking calvasino said in terms of investing style rbc is maintaining a slight preference for value over growth stocks dove tailing off the rotation that began late in the summer on the heels of improving economic data and a steepening of the treasury yield curve the firm also said it is tilting in favor of cyclicals assigning overweight ratings to financials and industrial sectors and given rbc s concerns of a near term pullback it also maintained an overweight rating on utilities to keep some defensive exposure rbc is

closing prices nov 25 the decline will be driven by an intensifying corporate profit squeeze even as concerns of a no deal brexit and escalating u s china trade dispute abate a tug of war currently exists between two scenarios for 2020 a mild recession and a fourth mini cycle since 2009 the analysts said we are cautious against this backdrop but not blindly bearish the s p 500 is likely to remain range bound from here with limited downside if we factor in our central scenario of a mild recession consensus earnings growth forecasts will likely be revised down for 2020 and we don t see massive p e contraction in the search for yield environment in fact we continue to stay away from u s tech and small caps the analysts added under the mid cycle mindset however we see an upside risk to 3 400 for the next few months but that won t likely last a balance of support from monetary policy in the u s and fiscal stimulus abroad could help drive risk assets in 2020 the analysts said in the u s there may be limited room for further fiscal loosening after president donald trump implemented his corporate tax reform 2018 but this phenomenon is less of a concern abroad as countries in the euro area and japan increasingly turn to fiscal policy to stimulate growth as their interest rates already hold in negative territory with a global economic slowdown limited room for further

year is just lukewarm growth won t get much more sluggish but it won t rocket higher either for both the u s and europe our estimates for modest eps growth are predicated on the view that the current global slowdown in manufacturing is unlike to morph into a full recession next year and will thus remain a soft patch equity strategist maneesh deshpande said in particular we expect em growth to start rebounding japanese and u s growth to pick up after declining a bit further and eu growth to remain at current low levels deshpande added citing a recent pick up in global manufacturing purchasing managers indices however in our opinion the recovery from the current slowdown is unlike to be v shaped symmetric the main reason for this is that contrary to popular belief the u s china trade war has not been the sole contributor to the economic slowdown and the self imposed deleveraging by china to slow credit growth has also played an important role deshpande added he said he believes non u s economic growth peaked in late 2017 much before the start of the u s china trade war with all this in mind deshpande considers the current market environment to be akin to historical easy soft patches wherein the central bank steps in and cuts interest rates to spur growth even in absence of an official recession during the previous five soft patches since the 1950s which took place in 1966 1984 1989 1995 and 1998 u s equities have risen by about 40 on average in the two years after the start of a fed easing cycle mostly driven by an expansion in valuation as opposed to growth in earnings looking to next year deshpande also said european equities may outperform against u s stocks particularly as political risks like brexit wane across the pond but pick up in the u s amid the 2020 elections he expects europe s stoxx 600 index stoxx will appreciate by 5 3 in 2020 to 430 representing about the same level of appreciation as anticipated for the s p 500 while our price

stocks next year a handful of rotations will take place in 2020 and ultimately lead to modest appreciation in the s p 500 according to bank of america merrill lynch strategist savita subramanian sees the 2020 presidential elections as the marquee event for next year with the policy implications of the winner of the white house serving as a key consideration for investors but elections aside subramanian outlined five key rotations that will punctuate the coming year leading to a shift in leadership among sectors and asset classes first will be a rotation from bonds to stocks she said the allocation decision is a no brainer the s p dividend yield beats the 10 year subramanian said this rarely happens but 94 of the time that it has stocks have beaten bonds by 20ppt avg over the next 12 months second subramanian said she sees emerging markets em and european equities as potentially offering more upside than u s stocks especially against a backdrop of low interest rates abroad and already packed positioning in domestic equities but for those who remain parked in u s stocks subramanian suggested a preference for domestically focused sectors like financials and discretionary given an increasing tilt toward protectionism from u s and global political leaders third subramanian called out a shift from the trade war to a tech war as tech companies increasingly become caught in the crosshairs of geopolitical tensions bank of america downgraded the information technology sector to marketweight from overweight in consideration of these risks fourth will be a shift to value stocks from their growth and momentum counterparts the former refers to stocks typically valued trading at low multiples of their net worth value has never been this cheap subramanian said adding that value s market cap has shriveled to levels historically followed by recoveries financials the largest value sector is bank of america s highest conviction overweight sector call fifth and finally subramanian highlighted an increasing emphasis among investors on environmental social and governance considerations indicating that companies outperforming next year may coincide with those most heavily focused on maximizing their social impact bank of america merrill lynch price target initiated november 20 2019 goldman sachs target 3 400 eps 174 2020 election outcome a risk to equities a unified government after the 2020 elections represents a downside risk to stocks according to goldman sachs in a revised equity outlook goldman sachs strategist david kostin lowered his earnings per share view for s p 500 companies to 174 from the 177 seen previously while he maintained his previous base case target for the blue chip index to hit 3 400 in 2020 he noted that political factors could prevent stocks from appreciating to this level a durable profit cycle and continued economic expansion will lift the s p 500 index by 5 to 3 250 in early 2020 kostin said however rising political and policy uncertainty will keep the index range bound for most of next year the outcome of the 2020 election remains a primary source of uncertainty and not just over who s sitting in the white house but also over where control lies in congress in the united states equity returns during periods of divided federal government have typically exceeded returns achieved when one political party controls the white house senate and house of representatives kostin said since 1928 excluding recessions when the federal government was controlled by a single party the s p 500 median 12 month return equaled 9 in contrast the median annual return under a divided government was 12 kostin said during the next 11 months shifting electoral prospects of candidates will be reflected in real time prediction markets and sector and stock performance he added during the subsequent two months s p 500 performance will depend on the actual election outcome a united government would facilitate easier passage of policy touted by some early candidates including a proposed roll back to the 2017 corporate tax cut goldman sachs estimated that every one percentage point change in the effective corporate tax rate would translate to an about 1 change in s p 500 eps a unified federal government post election could prompt investors to assume the tax cut is reversed and lower projected 2021 eps to 162 7 year year growth compressing the p e multiple to 16x consistent with an index level of 2 600 kostin said that said prediction markets current suggest that the most likely 2020 election outcome is a divided government in this scenario clarification of policy will expand the p e multiple to 18 6x and push the index to 3 400 by year end 2020 kostin said goldman sachs eps projection revised november

investment strategist brian belski wrote in a note we believe the same can be said to a large degree for equity markets namely the federal reserve s pivot to cutting interest rates beginning in 1995 ushered in a goldilocks period defined by low rates steady growth and u s large cap quality stock outperformance belski explained a quarter century later a similar environment is currently under way he added as belski sees it the fed s shift to cutting interest rates three time this year after hiking them four times in 2018 set the stage for u s large cap high quality and brand name companies to outperform their global counterparts heading into 2020 belski s notorious bull market is poised to continue for u s equities with a still accommodative fed and other factors at play bmo s bullish base case for the s p 500 to end next year at 3 400 is predicated on three main factors the firm s expectation that the federal reserve will hold rates at least through the 2020 presidential elections that improving prospects of a phase one u s china trade agreement will continue easing markets worries and that investors will continue seeking out firms with stable earnings thereby favoring u s companies bmo acknowledged a bear case scenario of 2 775 for the s p 500 in the event that trade negotiations lose momentum tariffs cut into margins and multiples contract quickly as investors begin pricing in a downturn but in bmo s bull case scenario the s p 500 would surge to 3 675 likely in the event of a substantial trade agreement between the u s and china igniting corporate investment and propelling global growth but regardless of where on the dart board the s p 500 ultimately ends in 2020 bmo remained resolute in its conviction that this more than decades long bull market is set to last we made a prediction in 2010 that u s stocks were likely entering a 20 year secular bull market belski said we are sticking with that call to be clear we are not maintaining our longer term bullish position to be stubborn he added rather many of the same core principles remain in place namely u s corporate superiority in terms of earnings stability cash flow innovation product and services and company management bmo capital markets price target introduced november 21 stifel target 3 265 eps 169 63 stocks may go down before they go up trade talks will be a key driver of the stock market s appreciation or lack thereof heading into 2020 according to stifel strategist barry bannister bannister updated his target for the s p 500 to end 2020 at 3 265 up from a previous target of 3 100 the new view also includes a recommendation for a revamped investment strategy favoring a long cyclical short defensive posturing versus the defensives and bond proxies play the firm had leaned on for the past year through october although we see a return of 5 for the s p 500 in 2020 we see twice that return or 10 for long cyclical short defensive industries in 2020 bannister said like many other strategists bannister highlighted the recent rotation to cyclical stocks as a reflection that the fed s recent campaign to unwind some of its interest rate hikes through 2018 had revitalized high growth companies and by bannister s measure only about one third of the cyclical rotation his firm predicts will take place by december 2020 has so far occurred the fed has belatedly done its part to revive cyclical growth so now it s up to trade bannister said with emphasis his stifel thinks cyclical stocks run up and the s p 500 as a whole will follow the direction of manufacturing activity growth a sector that comprises a small portion of the overall domestic economy but is highly levered to u s china trade talks by bannister s measure activity in this sector is poised to trend higher he anticipates that the institute of supply management s manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi will rise to 53 in 2020 indicating expansion at a faster rate versus this past october s contractionary reading of 48 3 but the s p 500 may already have gotten ahead of itself running up before pmis have actually staged their recovery as a result a market correction or drop of around 10 in the s p 500 could take place before an anticipated rebound next year one wrinkle is that our s p 500 price model also suggests a brief late 2019 s p 500 correction perhaps with trade policy as a fundamental catalyst bannister said stifel price target raised to 3 265 from 3 100 november 20 2019 credit suisse target 3 425 eps 173 cyclical leadership cyclical stocks will lead next year s market rally according to credit suisse the firm s s p 500 price target of 3 425 implies an about 9 8 gain from closing prices nov 15 the upbeat outlook assumes that s p 500 revenues will grow in line with nominal gross domestic product margin headwinds will recede and become substantially less onerous and buybacks will remain robust and next year reacceleration in economic growth will drive a rotation to cyclical stocks golub added this would reverse a trend from earlier this year when growth stocks outperformed and value stocks lagged economic data has decelerated over the past 1 years resulting in the outperformance of low vol and growth stocks at the expense of value golub said this leadership shifted more recently on aggressive fed action 3 cuts and improving economics our work indicates that this rotation will continue through the early part of 2020 absent a v shaped bounce in the data similar to 2016 2017 we expect this rotation to fade as we move further into next year he added credit suisse upgraded economically sensitive groups including financials industrials and materials to overweight from market weight and energy to market weight from underweight the firm downgraded defensive sectors including staples utilities and reits to underweight from market weight and communications from overweight to market weight credit suisse price target introduced november 18 2019 a trader looks up at a chart on his computer screen while working on the floor of the new york stock exchange united states tags business morgan stanley target 3 000 eps 162 u s remains our least preferred region u s equities may underperform their global counterparts next year according to morgan stanley the firm set its base case s p 500 target at 3 000 implying an about 3 9 decline from closing prices on nov 15 in a more optimistic bull case the s p 500 could reach as high as 3 250 strategists including andrew sheets and michael wilson wrote in a note but their more pessimistic bear case sees the s p 500 falling to as low as 2 750 in the u s we continue to expect earnings growth to remain under pressure as our earnings model projects another year of flat to modestly down earnings as margin pressures continue to mount the analysts said the forecasts from our economics team which have slow growth and accelerating wage gains are likely to amplify these margin pressures and weigh on the outlook for earnings further which should translate into better earnings growth outside the u s u s stocks have been the leader in global equities so far in 2019 and european shares have also posted sizable gains stocks in both regions have benefited from easier monetary policy and lower interest rates as their respective central banks stepped in to help spur growth while acknowledging a likely rebound in global economic growth next year the analysts said they expect any such pickup in growth will be mild by historical standards the path for global growth may look better next year but our economists project that the rebound is only to modest levels of economic growth that in many cases are still below trend the analysts said with many valuations across major equity markets already having rebounded to slightly above five year averages we don t think it prudent to rely on more multiple expansion in what is still a fairly tepid growth environment this means that forward returns at this point need to be driven by a realization of the earnings growth that is already in the price the u s remains our least preferred region given limited scope for multiple rerating or incremental flows and earnings expectations that look materially too high to us the analysts said we see the biggest potential upside in markets with a clearer path to achievable earnings growth japan and em or scope for some multiple re rating on falling political risks with europe being one such example they added morgan stanley note published november 17 2019 ubs target 3 000 eps 170 equities have further to discount ubs also thinks stocks are going down in 2020 as ubs equity strategist francois trahan sees it investor sentiment toward equities has turned overly optimistic in recent weeks bets against renewed volatility vix have risen as the s p 500 sailed to record levels volatility shorts have seen more intensity in recent weeks than at any point since the recovery of 2009 highlighting the consensus belief that financial markets are moving past the slowdown heading into the fourth quarter of 2019 stocks were led higher by cyclicals like transports and energy as economic data improved from the doldrums earlier this year but these sectors may not continue to sustainably until leading economic indicators have truly bottomed for the cycle trahan said starting around october there s been a significant change in sentiment and there is now a widespread perception among investors that equities have fully discounted the u s economic slowdown and begun to price in an eventual recovery trahan said it is certainly true that the s p 500 index is a leading indicator of the u s economy what is not so clear is whether the s p 500 has appropriately priced in the slowdown in the right context it appears more likely that the slowdown is not behind us just yet we believe the recovery will get priced in at some point in 2020 but the process has not begun at this stage he said historically it s taken about two years for a change in u s interest rates to be fully reflected in u s gdp trahan said with that logic given that interest rates last hit their peak in late 2018 after the fed s fourth rate hike of that year gdp should reach a bottom in late 2020 most previous business cycles saw the s p 500 hit a low and then start to recover 5 7 months before gdp bottomed he added based on a review of the seven major fed induced slowdowns of the last five decades if history was a perfect guide then the u s economy would bottom exactly as interest rates suggest in november of 2020 and equities would begin to discount that in q2 20 or thereabouts trahan said who knows if things will work out exactly that way but we expect this dynamic to play out in early 2020 if instead we went with consensus and assumed that the s p 500 is already pricing in a recovery then the low point in the s p 500 s return was this past june which would argue that the low point in gdp growth would be in q4 of 2019 or about six months later that would be a full year before what interest rates suggest and a first in the modern era trahan said nothing is impossible of course but it seems more likely to us that u s equities have further to discount he said ubs note published november 13 2019 emily mccormick is a reporter for yahoo finance follow her on twitter emily_mcck read more from

methodical and evidence based approach to screening quality dividend stocks for reasonable or attractive valuations that way you can always know reasonable and prudent places to put your hard earned money to work source imgflip morningstar is a good but not perfect place to start looking for good ideas morningstar is typically though not always a good starting location for blue chip income investing ideas that s because they are 100 focused on long term fundamentals rather than 12 month price targets like most sell side analysts the ones that issue buy sell hold recommendations most of their fair value estimates are reasonable though not always more on this in a moment so here are all my blue chip watch list stocks that morningstar estimates are at least 20 undervalued source morningstar data as of december 13th even with the market near all time highs you can see that at least according to morningstar there are plenty of quality names available at bargain prices we disagree with some of these valuations imperial brands otcqx imbby is just 31 undervalued for example but for the most part these are quality companies trading at attractive valuations but you can t just look at any one analyst s fair value estimate and know if it s a good buy that s because every company has its own risk profile and differing business models mean that a 20 discount to fair value of a highly cyclical company like commodity producers isn t the same for one with very stable and recession resistant cash flow like a consumer staples company this is where looking at morningstar s star ratings is a good next step these ratings which correspond to a reasonable buy good buy and very strong buy recommendations factor in a company s risk profile industry trends management quality and morningstar s definition of moatiness which i sometimes disagree with but are for the most part on the money when it comes to corporations morningstar s moat definition is based on their belief that a company can maintain returns on invested capital above its weighted cost of capital using their assumptions plugged into the capm model for 20 years or longer wide moat and 10 years or more narrow moat i look for competitive advantages that allow returns on invested capital above the industry norm and above the cash cost of capital which matters more to the ability to grow dividends over time here are my watch list companies that morningstar considers 5 star strong buys source morningstar data as of december 13th q quantitative non analyst model estimate note that morningstar s discount to fair value estimates for 5 star stocks can vary widely from its 51 estimates margin of safety for 7 11 average quality imperial brands to just 23 and 21 for 11 11 super swan quality epd and 9 11 blue chip quality lnc respectively morningstar s approach to valuing companies is similar to my own where quality is taken into account quality score out of 11 example good buy discount to fair value strong buy discount very strong buy discount 7 average quality at t t ibm ibm 20 30 40 8 above average quality walgreens wba cvs health cvs 15 25 35 9 blue chip quality altria mo abbvie

caterpillar cat microsoft msft lowe s companies low 0 10 20 click to enlarge to me a super swan dividend king like 3m is more attractive 20 undervalued than a lower quality company like ibm that s 35 undervalued but at the right price even an average quality company that has a safe dividend that s likely to grow at all is a potentially attractive investment at least for some people s needs however while 5 star morningstar stock is usually a good long term investment it s important to remember that some of its recommendations can be far off the mark i use a 100 pure f a s t graphs powered historical valuation method that only looks at historical and objective data and sometimes disagrees with morningstar typically these disagreements are minor sometimes they are not for example sources morningstar dividend kings valuation total return potential lists morningstar usually has similar estimates as us for most sectors but for popular momentum stocks like many tech names they often appear to try to justify rich valuations for example here are the p e multiples they use to determine fair value for super swans nike microsoft and unitedhealth nike 36 p e morningstar fair value historical p e range 22 26 microsoft 29 p e morningstar fair value historical p e range 16 20 unitedhealth 21 p e morningstar fair value historical p e range 14 18 source f a s t graphs factset research the purple line is morningstar s fair value p e ratio for these three rapidly growing super swans fair value is the price from which investors can expect to fully participate in a company s future growth and realize total returns equal to yield plus long term growth rates source f a s t graphs factset research the last time msft traded at morningstar s fair value p e it delivered flat returns for the next 11 years despite 180 eps growth and 1050 dividend growth over that time the fair value multiples that morningstar s analysts sometimes use are not just objectively too high but fly in the face of what real investors risking real money have valued each company s earnings and cash flows source imgflip valuation can t be known with exact precision but ultimately a company s earnings dividends and cash flows are worth what investors have paid for them over periods of similar fundamentals how can you tell whether morningstar s fair value estimates are reasonable or just plain crazy by looking at objective metrics like p e ratios price to earnings vs historical norm while no single valuation method is perfect which is why dk uses 10 of them a good rule of thumb from chuck carnevale the sa king of value investing and founder of f a s t graphs is to try not to pay more than 15 times forward earnings for a company that s the same rule of thumb that ben graham the father of value investing considered a reasonable multiple to pay for a quality company this is because p e ratios are the most commonly used valuation metric on wall street and 15 0 p e being a reasonable price for quality companies is based on mr carnevale s 50 years of experience in asset management valuing companies he bases that on an earnings yield of 6 7 inverse of a 15 p e being roughly equal to the 200 year return of the stock market chuck also considers 15 times cash flow to be prudent for most companies as do all the founding dividend kings here are dozens of blue chip companies with very low forward p es and their five year average p es note that some industries are naturally prone to lower multiples such as financials due to more cyclical earnings which is why you want to compare their current p es to their historical norms morningstar offers 5 year average p es but 10 20 years is better for factoring in industry sector downturns source morningstar data as of december 13th don t forget that p e ratios for mlps reits and yieldcos are not a good indication of value since high depreciation results in lower eps price cash flow is a better approach with such pass through stocks historical p e and a 15 0 rule of thumb are not perfect 5 year average p es can give a false reading if something extreme happened like a bubble or industry crash causing the energy p e ratio averages to become absurd similarly when fundamentals change then fair value p e ratios can fall for example walgreen s wba 20 year average p e is 21 5 during a time of 10 6 cagr growth and including a peak p e of 60 2 during the tech bubble since the aca aka obamacare passed in 2010 the average p e has been 14 6 despite nearly identical growth rates of 9 6 cagr however management s long term guidance is for 4 to 6 cagr growth which means that expecting walgreens to return to its long term average of 21 5 is unrealistic source f a s t graphs factset research if management achieves 5 long term growth then the graham carnevale fair value p e rule of thumb would apply however investors should assume that wba will trade at its 14 to 15 modern era p e due to increased regulatory risks walgreens could still deliver exceptional long term returns from its current single digit p e but the point is that you should use rules of thumb in concert with a company s own market determined historical valuation range another important metric to check is price to cash flow which replaces the p e ratio for reits yieldcos mlps midstreams and many lps price to cash flow vs historical norm while earnings are usually what wall street obsesses over it s actually cash flow that companies run on and use to pay a dividend repurchase shares and pay down debt thus the price to cash flow ratio can be considered a similar metric to the p e ratio but a more accurate representation of a company s value chuck carnevale also considers a 15 0 or smaller price to cash flow ratio to be a good rule of thumb for buying quality companies at a fair price buying a quality company at a modest to great cash flow multiple is a very high probability long term strategy again comparing a company s price to cash flow against its historical norm can tell you whether it s actually undervalued i use 10 year average cash flows and morningstar only offers 5 year averages for cyclical companies sometimes that can cause skewed results which is why we use longer time periods and as many of our 10 valuation metrics as are industry appropriate here are the companies on my watch list with the lowest price to cash flows source morningstar data as of december 13th again historical price to cash flow estimates are not perfect terraform power terp a level 8 11 quality yieldco was run into the ground and nearly bankrupted by its former sponsor sunedison which did go bankrupt brookfield asset management bam rescued it and turned it into a great high yield dividend growth stock which justifies a much higher valuation similarly 9 11 blue chip quality dividend champion ugi corp ugi shows up on this screen as a potentially attractive buy at just 7 4 times cash flow actually ugi is about 14 overvalued right now there are many forms of cash flow including ebitda ev ebitda and ebit pre tax profits source f a s t graphs factset research at its recent peak ugi was 34 overvalued yet trading at just 7 2 times ebitda if you just used the rule of thumb that 15 times earnings and cash flow including ebitda were reasonable you might have considered ugi a great bargain at its dangerous bubble valuations never forget that market determined fair values always take priority ugi is worth about four to five times ebitda that s not my opinion it s the market determined fair value of ugi based on what real investors have paid for its ebitda over the last 20 years or consider ebit which shows ugi to be the most overvalued at its recent bubble peak ugi traded at 10 7 times pre tax profits seems pretty reasonable right actually 6 to 8 is the historical ebit multiple outside of bubbles source f a s t graphs factset research notice how i use many fundamental metrics looking at relevant fundamentals that s because any one metric might give an outlier estimate that could lead you to invest in a bubble stock and expose yourself to massive valuation and volatility risk looking at up to 10 metrics if they all apply to the company and excluding outliers is the best way i know to reasonably estimate what a company s fundamentals are actually worth in any given year p e to growth ratio growth at a reasonable price and putting it all together according to chuck carnevale and ben graham buffett s mentor and the father of value investing a 15 p e is prudent for most companies even slow growing ones but if a company is able to grow especially fast over 15 over time it deserves a higher multiple that s because the compounding power of time means a company that grows at a faster rate can generate many times greater wealth and income for you how much your money will grow based on company growth rate and time period long term growth rate 10 years 20 years 30

table is simply meant to illustrate a point it s not actually possible for any company to grow 50 annually for 50 years which would mean earnings and cash flow growing nearly 1 billion fold it would have to literally take over the world most investors depending on their needs and ideal asset allocation can likely achieve 5 10 returns over time warren buffett is one of the greatest investors in history with about 21 cagr returns over 54 years since 2000 the s p 500 s earnings growth has been about 5 5 cagr which is why a company that can realistically grow much faster may be worth a higher than normal p e or price to cash flow this is where the p e to growth or peg ratio comes in while this method is limited by what growth assumptions you use it s a quick and dirty way to screen for potentially attractive dividend growth investments when used in conjunction with other methods the s p 500 s peg ratio is currently 1 8 3 6 depending on the growth estimates you use a peg of 1 0 or less is generally excellent here are my watch list stocks with pegs of close to 1 as estimated by morningstar s forward growth forecast some of those growth estimates are likely to be proven wrong source morningstar data as of december 13th peg is a good way to strive for growth at a reasonable price or garp however the obvious flaw is that it s based on forward projections that can be wrong all valuation metrics have their limitations which is why you shouldn t rely on just one for example fedex fdx is a great company trading at a nice discount which is why dividend kings deep value portfolio bought it but its peg is not 0 45 which implies about 30 long term growth 6 12 is realistic here are the peg ratios of some of these companies using factset data and consensus growth estimates fedex 10 0 forward pe 11 5 long term growth 0 87 viacomcbs viac 7 0 forward pe 5 long term growth 1 4 delta air lines dal 9 2 forward pe 10 0 long term growth 0 92 marathon petroleum corp mpc 8 3 forward pe 13 4 long term growth 0 62 imperial brands plc otcqx imbby 6 2 forward pe 3 5 long term growth 1 8 broadcom avgo 50 3 forward pe 8 0 long term growth 6 3 what s up with broadcom s 6 3 peg that s due to earnings being released and management reporting net income which includes the impact from discontinued operations was 2 724 million or 6 43 per diluted share this compares with a net income of 12 610 million or 28 44 per diluted share in fiscal year 2018 avgo earnings release emphasis added f a s t graphs uses a blended eps meaning it takes the last year s results and then proportionally applies the next year s consensus estimates based on how far along in the year we are for example if we re halfway through 2020 then it would use 50 of 2019 s results and 50 of 2020s 22 98 adjusted eps to calculate the p e ratio for broadcom in reality broadcom s 69 decline in eps for 2019 is a one time artifact created by selling non core assets and integration costs 2018 operating income 20 82 per share 2020 consensus operating income 22 98 per share for calculating avgo s peg it makes sense to exclude the outlier fiscal 2019 results given that its cash flow metrics were all up nicely over the past year owner earnings buffett smoothed out fcf per share up 12 in 2019 operating cash flow share up 12 fcf share up 16 beating management guidance by 6 and allowing for a 23 dividend hike for 2020 ebitda share up 13 ebit 13 for the same reasons that eps declined but the point is that screening a company via all of these approaches can minimize the chances of overpaying for a quality name make sure to check that earnings and cash flow are growing so you don t buy a value trap by mistake for example cfr passes all these value screens historical discount to fair value 7 good buy based on quality forward p e 13 0 vs historical 15 to 16 fair value pe range peg 13 9 5 long term consensus growth 1 37 first you need to know what companies are worth owning dividend king s motto is quality first valuation second and proper risk management always that s where a good watchlist is useful next you need to know what a company s worth today that involves looking at several fundamental valuation metrics such as dividends earnings and cash flow when you find a company that is both above average quality and trading at a below average valuation you have truly found a powerful tool that can help to achieve your long term financial goals quality stocks at 52 week lows are great screening candidates source google sheets data as of december 13th bolded companies are within 5 of 52 week lows note that like any valuation screening tool 52 week lows are not sufficient but a place to begin your research is simon a very strong buy right now based on 2020 s estimated fair value of 183 simon valuation matrix metric historical fair value 2019 2020 2021 25 year average yield 4 79 175 182 190 ffo 15 181 191 198 affo 15 164 173 180 ebitda 12 5 187 189 204 ebit 19 172

safety for 2020 is most definitely a very strong buy but note that ugi is near its 52 week low as well and as we saw previously that stock is overvalued even factoring in 27 eps growth expected in 2020 due to a major acquisition ugi is at best fairly valued for 2020 based on eps and overvalued based on metrics like ebtida 2020 fair value 39 and ebit also 39 i maintain a master list that takes every company i track for dividend kings and applies an 11 point quality score based on dividend safety the business model and management quality 7 average quality seek 20 discount to fair value and limit to 2 5 of invested capital or less 8 above average quality company seek 15 discount to fair value or better limit to 5 10 of invested capital 9 blue chip company limit to 5 10 of invested capital and seek 10 discount to fair value 10 swan stock buy with confidence at 5 or greater discount to fair value or better limit to 5 10 of invested capital 11 super swan as close to an ideal dividend stock as you can find on wall street fair value or better limit to 5 10 of your invested capital a score of 7 is average quality which means a 2 or smaller probability of a dividend cut during a recession based on how much s p 500 dividends have been cut in past economic downturns 2 was the highest average cut during the 1990 recession all other recessions were less source moon capital management nber multpl com i ve programmed that watch list to track prices and use the 52 week low as a means of knowing when a blue chip or swan stock is within 5 of its 52 week low and potentially a buffett style fat pitch investment this means a quality company is trading near its 52 week or often multi year low undervalued per other valuation methods offers a high probability of achieving significant multiple expansion within 5 10 years and thus delivering double digit long term total returns over this time period another method you can use is to target blue chips trading in protracted bear markets such as sharp discounts to their 5 year highs buying a company at multi year lows is another way to reduce the risk of overpaying and boost long term total return potential source morningstar data as of december 13th not all stocks that are deeply in a bear market are good buys perrigo prgo is down 71 from its highs when it was in a dangerous bubble source f a s t graphs factset research perrigo has suffered fundamental deterioration due to falling generic drug prices and is expected to grow just 1 to 4 in the future that means that its fair value p e range is 10 5 to 14 and it s capable of delivering 0 to 10 cagr long term returns depending on its growth rate in the above table i ve set it up to show all the methods we ve discussed today you can thus see that most of the above companies are potentially fantastic long term buys based on many important valuation metrics including morningstar s qualitative ratings of management quality moat and margin of safety it s important to remember that no single valuation metrics or screening tool is sufficient on its own it s just a source of ideas for further due diligence only if a stock is attractively valued via many methods is it a true bargain this is what i mean by fat pitch investing buying them when they are at their least popular be greedy when others are fearful it doesn t mean buying some speculative small company with an untested business model in the hope that it becomes the next amazon amzn the goal is to buy quality blue chips whose fundamentals are firmly intact and whose valuations are so ridiculously low that modest long term growth can deliver 15 25 cagr total returns as the market realizes its mistake mind you it can take a long time for coiled springs like these deep value blue chips to pop sometimes 5 10 years but as long as their business models remain intact and they keep growing cash flow and dividends they eventually will which is why seven of the nine best investors in history have been value investors bottom line nothing but good news is great for fundamentals but you must always consider valuations when making reasonable and prudent investment decisions last week brought nothing but great fundamental news out of washington the uk and the december fed meeting all of these things bode well for the global and us economies in 2020 by significantly reducing recession risk but that merely means the best bull market in us history is likely to continue as of november 21st best bull market keeps getting better source ycharts pullbacks and corrections are

this article first appeared in personal wealth the edge malaysia weekly on december 9 2019 december 15 2019 the asean market today boasts favourable demographics a thriving tourism industry less market volatility and the ability to benefit from trade tensions however many investors are still oblivious to such advantages due to the reputation the region garnered after the 2008 global financial crisis says jp morgan asset management alexander treves managing director and head of investment specialists for asia emerging markets and asia pacific equities at jp morgan asset management says asean is a big growing and diverse market with a lot of attractive qualities unfortunately these have largely been forgotten by investors after the global financial crisis asean went through a binge eating phase of double digit credit growth unhedged us dollar borrowing steep hikes in minimum wages and a lack of infrastructure investment but a detox period did take place bad bank loans were recognised there were tax and oil subsidy reforms and more investment into infrastructure as a result investors could see that the region was on a stable footing while asean was going through a period of resetting the attention turned to north asia there are many reasons why that happened including the emergence of a shares as an investable asset the chinese economic miracle and the rise of really impressive local franchises often in technology companies such as samsung electronics or taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co ltd says treves compared with many markets around the world asean is attractive because it is less volatile if we look at the volatility of the various msci country indices over the last 10 years we can see that emerging markets as a whole and even europe have been a lot more volatile than asean that is not to say it is without risk but it is less volatile than many people would intuitively think he says asean also has an advantage in terms of size and population as a whole the region is the third largest population bloc in the world after china and india the opportunity lies in the impact of the sizeable population as an economic bloc asean is the world s sixth largest economy up from no 12 about a decade ago depending on which forecast you use it could be the fourth largest in the next decade says treves it is also a diverse market with countries of various economic capacities singapore is a small but developed first world country thailand is a bigger less developed country growing at a steady pace indonesia is a huge market that sees rapid year on year y o y growth the region also includes less developed countries such as vietnam and myanmar which come with their own set of advantages treves thinks investors have not realised the opportunities presented by the asean market we have yet to see big positive inflows into these markets which one would expect if investors had fully recognised these opportunities what we can see is that the cumulative equity flows into asean were somewhat positive in 2016 2017 and year to date but they were negative in 2015 and 2018 he says market catalysts one of the catalysts that may bring investors back to the market is the tourism boom asean is the fastest growing region in the world for tourism capturing 9 of all international tourists as at april last year five year compound annual growth rate of tourist arrivals stood at 7 9 compared with europe s 2 8 the americas 3 7 and the middle east s 4 3 some of the most visited cities in the world are in asean bangkok singapore and kuala lumpur asean has received an outsized contribution from tourism to its economy compared with its economic size this translates into emerging consumers especially in countries like vietnam as people get wealthier they start moving more money into discretionary rather than staple goods says treves in markets such as singapore we look at banks they may be less dynamic than the financial institutions in other parts of the region due to their more developed economies but they have good yields high quality managers and robust balance sheets something we can enjoy in indonesia where the population is bigger and less wealthy investors may find financial franchises that present growth opportunities another catalyst is trade asean is currently the fourth largest trading group globally says treves when i was a child nothing i owned was made in china they were all made in hong kong taiwan or south korea as china opened up and the manufacturing sector grew the country became the low cost manufacturer of choice for the world then the chinese economic miracle happened which means it became a relatively more expensive place to make things quickly according to jp morgan s data workers in thailand indonesia and vietnam are now cheaper than those in china chinese companies are now manufacturing and assembling products in countries like vietnam where the cost of labour is half of that in china i think what have sped things up are the trade tensions which have caused companies to accelerate their capacities outside mainland china and into asean will the money flow back to china if it reaches a trade deal with the us we do not think so because other places are cheaper and also because the us and china are moving from a unipolar world to a multi polar one says treves trade will be at the epicentre of that for some time because of issues such as intellectual property transfer it is worth remembering that this is one of the rare issues that the us has bipartisan support for he adds that executives in china looking to make investment decisions will want to keep moving things away from the mainland due to the trade tensions risk according to jp morgan s 2018 data south korean companies spent more on foreign direct investment fdi in vietnam than in china vietnam is a much smaller country and way less populous than china it has fewer manufacturing nodes and hubs than china but south korean companies are spending a lot of money there says treves indonesia is another interesting country to look at it has seen huge improvements in infrastructure lowering logistical costs and potentially driving fdi in 2008 infrastructure was less than 1 6 of the country s gdp a decade later it has increased to about 2 7 between 1998 and 2004 under a different government there were very small additions to toll roads in indonesia over six years on aggregate there were only 47km of toll roads built in 2019 we forecast 871km a totally different magnitude says treves indonesia is no 46 on the 2018 logistics performance index up from no 63 in 2016 thailand rose to no 32 from no 45 while vietnam moved up to no 39 from no 64 during the same period india south korea and taiwan did not move much in the rankings this does not mean these countries are not improving says treves it is just that other countries are improving faster logistics is crucial because if chinese companies want to make more things outside of china they need to make them in places that have the infrastructure to support their businesses take india the attractive part of the stock market is dominated by indian companies that sell goods and services to local consumers despite the fact that it is a market with a workforce cheaper than those in asean this is partly because it does not have the right logistics he says at the portfolio level however investors should focus on the quality of each company rather than the economy says treves not every company in an economic environment is equally good we are very specific about finding businesses that are attractive in different markets at different points of time to capitalise on the opportunities in asean investors can leverage the manulife asean equity fund which was launched in mid october according to its product highlight sheet the wholesale feeder fund invests at least 95 of its net asset value in the jpmorgan funds asean equity fund the remainder is held in cash money market instruments and placements of deposits with financial institutions the fund is suitable for sophisticated investors with a long term investment horizon who seek capital appreciation and wish to participate in asean equity markets the minimum initial investment amount is rm5 000 for rm hedged class or us 5 000 for us dollar class

one of the problems with inflation is that the official way it is measured has been adjusted over time to keep it low meanwhile the way it is experienced by the average american is no longer captured by the official measurements and is much higher in reality unfortunately raises in salary and government benefits such as social security or veterans pensions are often based on the official inflation rate which is low the costs americans pay for goods and services however often rise at a rate much higher than the official rate their income raises are based on this leads to an imbalance in the personal finances of many who experience a lower standard of living as they progress through retirement governments like inflation because they can make money from it without raising tax rates governments usually fight deflation because when the cost of living decreases so do tax revenues as an example think about the new wage increases that will take place next year by raising the minimum wage many states are scheduled to see hourly wages rise by government decree in january so people will be earning more money source of greater state and federal income taxes and the cost of goods and services will also rise allowing businesses to afford the higher wages these cost increases in turn produce higher sales tax revenues for local municipalities and states without them having to raise the tax rates everyone except the american public wins at all levels of government when inflation grows the signs are everywhere and the federal reserve is no longer hinting about their desire for higher inflation rather they are broadcasting it loud and clear while 2 used to be the stated target for inflation today it is viewed as a desired average over a period of time since previous years saw sub 2 inflation inflation will be allowed to run higher than 2 for awhile to help it average out what is inflation and why should it matter to us inflation is the rate at which the cost of goods and services rises in fiat currency terms inflation is sometimes mistaken for growth and can create a vicious cycle of higher costs slightly higher wages and higher taxes it can also mean a higher currency price for gold and precious metals over time golden hedge against inflation a simple way to protect yourself and your family is by owning precious metals there is an established floor underneath the price of gold or silver which is the cost to mine and refine the metals while this base fluctuates somewhat above or below this trend line it is generally close to it in other words prices for precious metals usually do not stay lower than the cost of production for extended periods of time this means that when official inflation raises our pensions or social security by the obligatory 1 2 gold and silver have a baseline price that rises with the unofficial inflation rate of 7 8 which is more reflective of the true cost of living increases experienced by average americans for example the cost of fuel has been removed from official inflation calculations but is still an important component of everyday life including for mining operations it has been said the cure for low prices is often low prices that is when the cost of a good or service falls below the cost to produce that good or service fewer are produced in the case of gold or silver mines cannot produce metal at a loss forever they will shutter a mine rather than operate at a loss for an extended period when mines are shuttered supply is decreased when supplies are decreased as demand is constant prices must rise to the point of mine profitability before shuttered mines are opened again the prices for gold and silver are currently near the cost of production which allows them to offer protection from future increases in inflation as felt by the consumer the reverse is also true the cure for high prices is often high prices when prices rise above a profitability trend line production is increased to capture the higher prices this can lead to an oversupply in the market which tends to decrease the price as an example there is currently an over abundance of new automobiles in the marketplace this has led to lower prices as manufacturers and dealers have begun to offer discounts as high as 20 25 below the normal price the same can be said about our currency the dollar the federal reserve has been creating billions of dollars each month to support the economy by injecting these dollars into the financial system as dollars become more plentiful in the economy their value or worth decreases this is manifested in the form of higher prices for other goods and services in dollar terms this phenomenon has also been occurring in other countries which has led to an increase in the price of gold in local currency terms to record levels in over 70 nations 500 billion reasons to own gold recently the federal reserve has pledged to inject 500 billion into the financial system near year end to make sure there is plenty of liquidity available this is in addition to the hundreds of billions that have been added each month for the repo crisis that started in september this year what was described as a temporary policy has been expanded and extended several times already since then we should remember that sometimes temporary government policies can have an air of permanence about them in 1971 president nixon removed the implicit gold backing of the dollar when he temporarily closed the gold trading window to convert dollars into gold you can hear him use this word temporarily here this temporary policy has held for over 17 000 days and counting and has seen gold rise over 4200 in dollar terms even with the current 20 25 discount on new automobiles 2 400 will not purchase a new car as it would in 1971 because dollars have lost value since then with the stated goal of increasing inflation and the new temporary policy of injecting hundreds of billions of dollars into the financial system gold is set to continue to climb another way to look at this is dollars are set to lose value over time compared to gold or other goods and services what makes gold unique is that it is easy to store and does not deteriorate or rot over time it is difficult to store donuts milk gasoline or shingles for the house for use in 5 10 years or longer but it is easy to store gold which can be sold in the future for enough currency to purchase whatever is needed at that time with interest rates at the bank deliberately set below the rate of inflation and the stock market at all time highs gold silver and platinum continue to offer a safe haven with the opportunity for growth

on the peace pipeline system from new projects including phase vi nebc montney infrastructure the wapiti lateral as well as increased volumes at existing locations the pipelines division will also

plant and polypropylene pp upgrading facility pdh pp facility one of our highest priorities is prudent and disciplined capital allocation we invest in strong franchises with significant contractual underpinning and good counterparties all ingredients to delivering consistent industry leading returns further we continue to execute pembina s strategy within our financial guardrails stated scott burrows pembina s senior vice president and chief financial officer it takes commitment and discipline but pembina and its stakeholders have been rewarded and we intend to maintain our approach moving forward noted mr burrows business update pembina continues to be squarely focused on delivering transportation and midstream services that enable our customers to reach the best possible markets for their products at a competitive cost thus enhancing their netbacks collectively the following developments support the ongoing build out of our integrated value chain and highlight pembina s unique capability to quickly and cost effectively add up to 300 000 barrels per day bpd of incremental peace pipeline system capacity renewal of peace pipeline system phase i ii contracts and additional firm service contracts peace pipeline system expansions optimization and capacity potential incremental fractionation facilities prince rupert lpg export terminal expansion and ethane supply to support alberta s petrochemicals diversification program pembina s liquids pipelines are now connected to all major export facilities and world scale storage facilities in alberta including the 10 million barrels of storage acquired from kinder morgan further through the acquisition of the cochin pipeline pembina has strengthened its capabilities and connectivity within its condensate business in addition pembina s ngl pipeline systems are connected upstream to major pembina and third party gas processing facilities and downstream to all major ngl fractionation and storage facilities in the fort saskatchewan alberta area this connectivity provides our customers with unparalleled flexibility in reaching their desired markets renewal of peace pipeline system phase i ii contracts and additional firm service contracts pembina continues to progress the renewal of the legacy peace pipeline phase i and ii contracts a portion of which were previously extended as part of the phase iii expansion pembina is engaged in ongoing discussions with customers and is highly confident that the majority of the remaining contracts nearing maturity will be renewed or their firm capacity resold given the tolls are substantially lower than current posted tolls this will allow us to maintain pembina s current earnings profile while providing exceptional value flexibility and reliability for customers not available elsewhere producer demand for pembina s transportation services across the liquids rich areas of the western canadian sedimentary basin wcsb continues to grow since may 2019 pembina has continued to secure firm service commitments on the peace pipeline system while extending many in the process this continues pembina s recent track record of systematically growing and extending the contracted revenue profile of these pipelines in response to customer demand and in lock step with our announced expansions firm volume commitments now will reach approximately 1 1 million bpd in 2022 peace pipeline system expansions optimization and capacity potential once the first stage of phase ix is complete pembina will have 1 1 million bpd of market delivery capacity into edmonton alberta across the peace and northern systems and will have completed its objective of achieving segregated liquids transportation service for ethane plus propane plus crude and condensate between gordondale alberta and the edmonton alberta area full product segregation is a significant accomplishment that will drive operational and capital efficiencies strengthen pembina s competitive advantage and ultimately benefit our customers there are numerous advantages associated with product segregation including most notably the avoidance of product batching which increases pipeline utilization minimizes product interface and requires less operational storage finally it also supports potential capacity increases through optimization and more efficient and ultimately cost effective lateral connectivity to the pipeline as well as optimal flexibility in future mainline expansions the elimination of batching and other hydraulic optimization initiatives which pembina refers to as phase x could create up to an incremental 100 000 bpd of capacity with minimal capital spending in addition pembina continues to have the ability through a second stage of the phase ix expansion to add approximately 200 000 of capacity to its pipelines from fox creek alberta to namao alberta through the addition of pump stations on these mainlines land for these additional pump stations has been acquired and all the upstream infrastructure required to access this capacity will be in place with the completion of the peace phase vi ix expansions incremental fractionation facilities with the increasing amount of oil and condensate resource being developed along our pipeline systems and the anticipated startup of lng canada s phase i liquified natural gas project on canada s west coast pembina continues to receive customer requests for incremental fractionation services for associated natural gas liquids increasingly we are observing customer demand for incremental natural gas liquid barrels particularly from the montney play to move westward for export given this shift in wcsb product flows pembina is pursuing multiple developments in parallel both within the existing redwater fractionation complex as well as northeast british columbia nebc which will facilitate this movement and actively respond to producers evolving needs pembina currently has in excess of 1 500 acres at the company s existing redwater fractionation complex and has secured 540 acres in nebc where pembina is evaluating new fractionation facilities based on the design of the rfs ii and iii facilities and associated rail infrastructure the peace pipeline provides location optionality to construct required ngl fractionation facilities in multiple locations to meet customer demand for services and provide maximum diversification to premium ngl markets such as through pembina s prince rupert export terminal and its expansion or through value added upgrading to polypropylene prince rupert lpg export terminal expansion pembina continues to advance construction of its prince rupert lpg export terminal the project is on track to provide customers with export service beginning in the second half of 2020 the anticipated startup of this facility has generated significant interest from our customers and offtakers and pembina is pleased to announce an expansion of this terminal the prince rupert terminal expansion which will increase propane export capacity to approximately 40 000 bpd the prince rupert terminal expansion is expected to cost approximately 175 million and has an anticipated in service date in the first half of 2023 subject to regulatory and environmental approvals the incremental capacity from the expansion will closely match the proposed nebc fractionation facility s propane production and the in service dates of the respective facilities would be closely aligned ethane supply to support alberta s petrochemicals diversification program pembina s existing infrastructure ideally positions the company to be a significant supplier of ethane to support the government of alberta s petrochemicals diversification program this program is designed to provide government support and incentives to build facilities that may include a world scale ethane cracker in alberta through the continued expansion and hydraulic optimization of the peace pipeline system expansion and optimization efforts on the alberta ethane gathering system and the current capability of the vantage northern and brazeau systems pembina has concluded it can provide over 100 000 bpd of incremental highly reliable diversified low cost ethane transportation to the edmonton alberta area much of which may be sourced from existing or future pembina facilities this opportunity aligns with our customers needs and the government of alberta s goal to provide a made in alberta petrochemical solution resulting in significant investment and

india s model bit 2015 model bit as of date only 12 bits are in force bahrain bangladesh bulgaria czech republic latvia libya lithuania romania senegal serbia sudan and syria india is currently renegotiating its bits in terms of the model bit with oman mauritius israel hong kong san marino iran switzerland morocco kuwait ukraine and the united arab emirates india has concluded negotiations

india is a signatory to several tax treaties as well as intergovernmental agreements such as the general agreement on trade in services gats india has also signed framework agreements with the association of south east asian nations asean mercado común sudamericano mercosur and the european union eu 1 2 what bilateral and multilateral treaties and trade agreements has your jurisdiction signed and not yet ratified why have they not yet been ratified as stated above india has terminated 69 of its bits since march 2017 from the current list of existing bits to which india is a signatory india has not ratified three bits india has also not ratified four other trade agreements the making of international treaties is an executive act accordingly in order to ensure that india is in a position to discharge all obligations under a given treaty the process of ratification is undertaken only after the relevant domestic laws have been amended or the enabling legislation has been enacted in cases where there are no domestic laws on the subject while there is no publicly available information on the status of the ratification of treaties the long drawn out process may cause some delay in concluding the ratification 1 3 are your bits based on a model bit what are the key provisions of that model bit indian bits were largely based on the model india bit 2003 on december 28 2015 the model bit was introduced this was seen as india s reaction to the large number of treaty claims brought against india over the past decade through the model bit india has adopted an approach which tilts in favour of the state some of the key provisions of the model bit are outlined below a the model bit seeks to narrowly define investment by adopting a hybrid asset enterprise based definition an enterprise has been defined to mean any legal entity constituted in compliance with the laws of the host state and having its real and substantial business operations in the territory of the host state for the purpose of the definition of an enterprise real and substantial business operations are required to satisfy certain cumulative criteria such as the enterprise must i be a commitment of capital or other resources ii for a certain duration iii for expectation of profit or gain iv involve the assumption of risk and v be of significance for the development of the host state b the definition of investor includes both natural and juridical persons who own or control an investment in the host state c the model bit does not include a most favoured nation obligation or a broad fair and equitable treatment obligation instead the model bit provides for a defined scope of standard of treatment the 2015 model bit however does accord full protection and security to the investor and its investment and also extends national treatment to investors d notably the model bit requires an investor to exhaust local remedies before initiating arbitration proceedings 1 4 does your jurisdiction publish diplomatic notes exchanged with other states concerning its treaties including new or succeeding states india does not maintain publicly accessible treaty preparatory materials 1 5 are there official commentaries published by the government concerning the intended meaning of treaty or trade agreement clauses the government of india does not publish official commentaries concerning the intended meaning of a treaty or trade agreements however india has recently concluded a i joint interpretative note with bangladesh and a ii joint interpretative declaration with colombia to facilitate interpretation of the treaty provisions 2 legal frameworks 2 1 is your jurisdiction a party to 1 the new york convention 2 the washington convention and or 3 the mauritius convention india is party to the united nations convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign awards 1958 new york convention india is not however a signatory to either the convention on the settlement of investment disputes between states and nationals of other states the washington convention or the united nations convention on transparency in treaty based investor state arbitration the mauritius convention 2 2 does your jurisdiction also have an investment law if so what are its key substantive and dispute resolution provisions in addition to compliance with statutes that govern every contract india is an exchange controlled jurisdiction and investments made by non resident investors require compliance with the foreign exchange management act 1999 and regulations fema further depending on the target entity investments may also require to be made in compliance with the securities and exchange board of india act 1992 and regulations that apply to an entity whose shares are traded on a stock exchange further if the investment crosses certain thresholds one needs to comply with the competition act 2002 there are also specific verticals where specific laws may be applicable for instance the insurance act 1938 that governs the investments made by a non resident disputes in india are adjudicated in a manner similar to other commonwealth jurisdictions they are dealt with by either the civil courts or specialised tribunals given the backlog of cases in indian courts large commercial contracts often provide for adjudication of disputes by arbitration 2 3 does your jurisdiction require formal admission of a foreign investment if so what are the relevant requirements and where are they contained the principal law governing foreign investment in india is the fema the rules prescribed under the fema and circulars issued by the reserve bank of india rbi additionally the department of industrial policy and promotion dipp makes policy pronouncements on foreign investment through press notes or press releases which are notified by the rbi such regulations press notes press releases circulars etc together constitute the regulatory framework for foreign investment in india foreign investment can be made either 1 by the automatic route which does not require formal prior approvals from the rbi or 2 by the government route which requires prior approval from the concerned ministries departments through a single window the foreign investment facilitation portal fifp the fifp is administered by the dipp ministry of commerce and industry and the government of india however the government route is mandatory in investments made beyond certain thresholds in some sectors such as mining defence broadcasting telecommunications and banking 3 recent significant changes and discussions 3 1 what have been the key cases in recent years relating to treaty interpretation within your jurisdiction the indian courts have not yet had the opportunity to interpret the terms and or standards of protection under an investment treaty however in the case of union of india v khaitan holdings mauritius limited cs os 46 2019 i as 1235 2019 1238 2019 the high court of delhi did indirectly touch upon treaty interpretation in this case the indian government had filed a suit before the high court of delhi to seek an anti arbitration injunction on the grounds that khaitan holdings mauritius limited khaitan did not satisfy the definition of investor under the india mauritius bit while holding that this issue is a matter to be decided by the arbitral tribunal the high court of delhi observed in passing that a khaitan was purely an economic entity b the india mauritius bit does not expressly exclude indirect investments from protection under the treaty and c where expropriation is done for a public purpose after following due process of law no compensation is payable 3 2 has your jurisdiction indicated its policy with regard to investor state arbitration investor state arbitration began to gain major traction in india as a result of the treaty award passed against india in white industries australia limited v republic of india white industries in may 2002 the investor claimant white industries australia ltd obtained an icc award against coal india limited a state owned indian company for a period of over nine years white industries sought to enforce this award before the delhi high court finally in 2010 white industries took the matter to investment treaty arbitration under the indiaaustralia bit on the grounds that the inordinate delay in indian courts to enforce the arbitration award violated various substantive protections afforded under the said bit white industries led to a drastic shift in india s stance on investor state arbitration which is clearly reflected in india s model bit india recently concluded bit negotiations with brazil while the text of the india brazil bit is not available at present it has been widely reported that the bit does not contain a provision for investor state arbitration india also recently approved a bit with cambodia which is the first bit to be based on the model bit 3 3 how are issues such as corruption transparency mfn indirect investment climate change etc addressed or intended to be addressed in your jurisdiction s treaties the model bit lays down certain obligations pertaining to corruption these obligations provide that an investor shall not i offer promise or give any undue pecuniary advantage gratification or gift whatsoever either ii directly or indirectly to a iii public servant or official of the host state as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do any official act or iv make any illegal contributions to candidates for public office or to political parties amongst others the model bit provides for transparency in the form of specific disclosures to be made by an investor from time to time as well as transparency in arbitral proceedings the model bit has omitted the mfn obligation altogether further the cumulative requirements to constitute an investment as outlined in detail in question 1 3 above leave little scope for an indirect investment to be afforded substantive protections under the model bit finally the model bit carves out broad exceptions for actions or measures of the host state which have been taken with a view to protect and conserve the environment 3 4 has your jurisdiction given notice to terminate any bits or similar agreements which why as of 2019 india has discontinued 69 of its bits refer to question 1 1 above 4 case trends 4 1 what investor state cases if any has your jurisdiction been involved in as of september 11 2018 a total of 24 treaty arbitrations have been initiated against india as per publicly available information including the website of the united nations conference on trade and development unctad of these 24 arbitrations 12 are pending 10 have been settled and an award has been passed only in three the white industries award discussed in question 3 2 above was decided against india however in what may be termed as india s first known victory in treaty arbitration louis dreyfus armateurs sas v the republic of india india defeated a claim of usd 36 million by louis dreyfus a french investor under the france india bit according to publicly available information on october 8 2018 a common arbitral tribunal constituted in astro all asia networks and south asia entertainment holdings limited v india brought against india under the india uk bit and the india mauritius bit passed two awards in favour of india however it appears that the awards were passed on account of the withdrawal of the claims by the investors and accordingly full costs have been awarded to india the same has not been updated on the unctad website as of date 12 treaty arbitrations are pending against india 4 2 what attitude has your jurisdiction taken towards enforcement of awards made against it as it has been noted in respect of question 4 1 above of all the treaty claims that have been made against india only one has resulted in an adverse award white industries according to publicly available information coal india limited paid aud 9 812 077 to the investor there are no known cases at present wherein india has sought to resist the enforcement of unfavourable awards 4 3 in relation to icsid cases has your jurisdiction sought annulment proceedings if so on what grounds india has not sought annulment proceedings in relation to icsid cases 4 4 has there been any satellite litigation arising whether in relation to the substantive claims or upon enforcement no please refer to questions 3 1 and 4 2 above 4 5 are there any common trends or themes identifiable from the cases that have been brought whether in terms of underlying claims enforcement or annulment of the 12 treaty arbitration cases pending against india a majority of the cases include a claim for indirect expropriation the most prominent ones being the claims brought by nissan motor company limited nissan and the vodafone group which relate to taxation measures adopted by the indian authorities the vodafone group initiated treaty proceedings against india under the india netherlands bit as well as the india uk bit for the retrospective application of indian tax laws to the vodafone group s transaction with hutchison telecommunications nissan on the other hand instituted arbitration proceedings against india under the comprehensive economic partnership agreement cepa with japan for the improper roll back of investor promotion subsidies that were offered to nissan for setting up a manufacturing plant in the indian state of tamil nadu it has also been observed that there is a trend amongst investors to institute parallel commercial proceedings for instance devas multimedia a mauritian entity pursued treaty arbitration against india for the termination of its contract with government owned antrix corp ltd the commercial wing of the indian space research organisation devas multimedia also pursued a parallel commercial arbitration under the investment contract in which it received a favourable award for an amount of usd 562 5 million as far as the treaty arbitration is concerned the investor has received a favourable determination on the issue of liability the valuation of which is currently pending investment arbitration disputes in india have been growing in number mostly in sectors such as telecommunications oil and gas 5 funding 5 1 does your jurisdiction allow for the funding of investorstate claims third party funding has not been blessed with specific legislation in india although there is no express bar on obtaining third party funding tpf tpf agreements will nevertheless be subject to several complications due to the lack of legislative framework to regulate such funding 5 2 what recent case law if any has there been on this issue in your jurisdiction the subject of tpf is still at a very nascent stage in india and there is no recent case law that adequately addresses the subject however the supreme court of india has in bar council of india v a k balaji ors 2018 5 scc 379 observed that there appears to be no restriction on third parties funding litigation and getting repaid upon the outcome of the litigation interestingly the icc award issued by sir philip otton in the arbitration between norscot rig management pvt ltd norscot and essar oilfields services limited award has been brought for enforcement before the high court of bombay in the award sir otton held amongst other things that norscot ltd was entitled to the costs of litigation funding which it had obtained in order to be able to bring the arbitration the decision in the enforcement proceedings initiated by norscot before the high court of bombay is likely to be a landmark decision on the position of tpf in india 5 3 is there much litigation arbitration funding within your jurisdiction in practice tpf institutions have claimed to pursue opportunities in india due to the absence of publicly available data on the subject it is however not possible to provide a definitive position on this 6 the relationship between international tribunals and domestic courts 6 1 can tribunals review criminal investigations and judgments of the domestic courts article 14 2 of the model bit clearly states that in addition to the specified limits on a tribunal s jurisdiction the tribunal will not have jurisdiction to re examine any legal issue which has been finally settled by any judicial authority of the host state it also provides that the tribunal cannot review the merits of a decision made by a judicial authority of the host state however the bar on a tribunal s jurisdiction to review judgments of domestic courts is not absolute insofar as article 3 of the model bit provides that each party shall not subject investments of investors of the other party to measures which constitute a denial of justice under customary international law thus it appears that where the tribunal is required to decide as to whether the host state s treatment of an investor constitutes denial of justice the tribunal would be in a position to review the decision of domestic courts 6 2 do the national courts have the jurisdiction to deal with procedural issues arising out of an arbitration the delhi high court in antrix corporation ltd v devas multimedia fao os comm 67 2017 highlights some of the procedural difficulties associated with arbitrations seated in india devas initiated arbitration proceedings before the international chamber of commerce icc for wrongful termination of the contract by antrix corporation limited antrix see question 4 5 above the arbitration clause pertaining to the appointment of arbitrators substantially departed from the icc rules in relation to the appointment of arbitrators icc notified the parties that it was not in a position to make such a departure from its rules antrix objected to the position taken by the icc and filed an application before the chief justice of india under section 11 for appointment of an arbitrator of the arbitration and conciliation act 1996 arbitration act thereafter antrix filed an application under section 9 of the arbitration act for interim reliefs before the bangalore city civil court seeking to restrain devas from proceeding with the icc arbitration which was contrary to the parties arbitration agreement in april 2014 the icc arbitration was stayed by the chief justice s designate and was only subsequently dismissed by the supreme court finally the icc tribunal awarded devas usd 562 5 million on the basis that antrix had wrongfully terminated the agreement with devas upon obtaining the award antrix ltd proceeded to file a section 9 application to attach antrix s bank accounts in the delhi courts finally the delhi high court held that designating a seat does not automatically confer exclusive jurisdiction upon the courts of the seat in indian seated arbitrations parties do in some cases run the risk of arbitration related proceedings being dragged before different forums it must be noted however that the icc award was passed in relation to the commercial arbitration proceedings initiated against antrix the outcome of the treaty arbitration between devas and antrix is still pending 6 3 what legislation governs the enforcement of arbitration proceedings the enforcement of a foreign award in india is governed by part ii of the arbitration act which incorporates the provisions of the new york convention with respect to enforcement of a domestic award the same is governed by part i of the arbitration act pertinently the delhi high court in union of india v vodafone group plc united kingdom anr vodafone case cs os 383 2017 held that investment arbitration disputes are fundamentally different from commercial disputes and are thus not governed by the provisions of the arbitration act an appeal before a division bench of the delhi high court is currently pending 6 4 to what extent are there laws providing for arbitrator immunity a new provision has been introduced in the arbitration act by way of the arbitration and conciliation amendment act 2019 amendment act the amendment bill has been passed by the indian parliament the newly inserted section 42b now in force provides that no suit or other legal proceedings shall lie against the arbitrator for anything which is done in good faith or intended to be done under the arbitration act or the rules or regulations made under it 6 5 are there any limits to the parties autonomy to select arbitrators where india is the seat of arbitration the parties choice of arbitrators would be subject to schedules v and vii of the arbitration act on october 23 2015 india became the first jurisdiction to statutorily adopt the iba guidelines on conflicts of interest in international arbitration iba guidelines in schedules v and vii schedule v contains circumstances under the orange list and schedule vii contains circumstances under the red list of the iba guidelines parties can however waive the bar on the appointment of an arbitrator where such arbitrator is squarely covered by the circumstances under schedule vii after a dispute has arisen between such parties 6 6 if the parties chosen method for selecting arbitrators fails is there a default procedure where india is the seat as per section 11 of the arbitration act if the parties chosen method for selecting arbitrators fails a party may apply to the supreme court in case of an international commercial arbitration to take the necessary measures to secure an appointment the amendment act now provides for appointment of arbitrators by arbitral institutions designated by the supreme court for international commercial arbitrations however as of date the amended provision has not yet been brought into force 6 7 can a domestic court intervene in the selection of arbitrators as addressed in question 6 6 above in arbitrations where india is not the seat there would be no court involvement in the selection of arbitrators 7 recognition and enforcement 7 1 what are the legal requirements of an award for enforcement purposes under article i of the new york convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards 1958 embodied in the first while india became a signatory to the united nations convention on the jurisdictional immunities of the states and their property on january 12 2007 the same has not yet been brought into force it is however indicative of india s inclination to more formally adopt the qualified immunity approach which has in any case been adopted by indian courts in ethiopian airlines v ganesh narain saboo ethiopian airlines 2011 8 scc 539 the supreme court held that ethiopian airlines was not entitled to sovereign immunity with respect to a commercial transaction which was in consonance with the growing body of international law principles 7 4 what case law has considered the corporate veil issue in relation to sovereign assets as highlighted in the preceding question the supreme court in ethiopian airlines made it abundantly clear that a corporate entity which carries on business or trade in india does not fall within the protection of the doctrine of sovereign immunity as embodied in section 86 of the cpc in qatar airways v shapoorji pallonji 2013 2 bomcr 65 the bombay high court placed reliance upon the decision of the supreme court in andhra pradesh state road transport corporation v income tax officer air 1964 sc 1486 to hold that in dealing with corporations established by a state the corporation though statutory or not has a personality of its own and this personality is distinct from that of the state or other shareholders in this context the supreme court also referred to the observations made in tamlin v hanna 1950 1 k b 18 that the corporation is its own master and is answerable as fully as any other person or corporation it is not the crown and has none of the immunities and privileges of the crown its servants are not civil servants and its property is not that of the crown these decisions collectively lay down a position that so far as commercial actions of a given corporation are concerned the corporate veil may not be lifted for the purpose of claiming sovereign immunity published in international comparative legal guide iclg date november 1 2019 the content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter specialist advice should be sought about your

textilewas once a thriving industry in east africa today the region sees anopportunity for growth even though the problems have not gone away plus there is a china connection at the 10thedition of the annual textile event origin africa dar es salaam october28 30 representatives from the cotton farming sector the creative industries fashion design and several governments all stressed the importance for eastafrica to get more deeply involved in global value chains how to get there easy question difficult answer textilewas once a thriving industry in east africa and once again according to jasbedi honorary chairman of the african cotton textile industriesfederation actif it has a window of opportunity for growth antoinettetesha director textiles apparel of consulting company msingi eastafrica ltd from nairobi supports the optimistic vision of actif msingidesigned a textiles industry strategy for the ugandan government and tried toestimate the impact of the textiles and apparel industry on exports andemployment in east africa not including ethiopia and other countries from thehorn of africa focusing on kenya tanzania uganda and rwanda the msingiconsultants expect high growth rates in the east african textiles and apparelindustry resulting in 2 7 billion exports and 200 000 jobs by 2030 icacapp for small farmers thecotton boards of the east african countries are expecting much from thehundreds of thousands of small cotton farmers in east africa they hope thatfarmers will be able to at least double the yield per hectare adapt farmingpractices to climate change and increase the share of organic cotton kaihughes executive director of the international cotton advisory committee icac argued during origin africa that seed development has to be a priority however small farmers don t need bt cotton to increase their productivity hesaid bt cotton does not increase yields it only protects cotton from pests it makes sense to grow bt cotton in large fields of 200 hectares or more notin the very small fields he pitied the african smallholder farmers who mostlydon t have any information about the impact of climate change icacwants to change this hughes announced the introduction of an icac app thatwill be given for free to the member governments it will be an exceptionalanalytic tool which will inform smallholder cotton farmers in their ownlanguage about local weather forecasts and pests and what to do about it hughes also insisted that the governments would have to play a more active rolein teaching farmers best practices and in financing cotton research though it s generally admitted that african cotton is of fairly good quality often it is internationally sold at a discounted price so it s not surprising that many farmers shift to other crops in malawi for instance the number of cotton farmers decreased from 300 000 to 80 000 in the last few years while cotton production fell from 100 000 metric tonnes to 15 000 metric tonnes fortunately organic cotton gets a premium price with a share of only 1 per cent organic cotton is still a marginal phenomenon in the global cotton market but in africa organic cotton is strongly on the rise per cent in the last two years according to marco mtunga director general of the tanzania cotton board in tanzania the share of organic cotton is nearly 10 per cent after china india and turkey tanzania is the world s biggest producer of organic cotton also in uganda production of organic cotton is achieving high growth rates it s clear that organic cotton is a market niche in which east africa can be successful african cotton african textiles much to the regret of east african governments most of the region s cotton is exported to countries like china and india that s not what the governments want they want to develop a complete cotton textile supply chain in their respective countries their development strategies are not totally similar just like ethiopia in the horn of africa also kenya tanzania and zambia are east african countries with a strong desire not only to increase significantly their cotton production but also to retain much more added value in the country some other countries like botswana want to become successful garment exporters but don t dream of building a supply chain with spinning weaving and textile processing mills they think it s more realistic to import yarns and fabrics at sharp prices from the most competitive asian textile countries tesha remarked during origin africa that east africa has a comparative advantage compared to countries like bangladesh vietnam sri lanka and cambodia which built successful garment export industries though they have never been cotton growing countries in tanzania the government is of course happy with the growing number of jobs created by companies like jd united manufacturing from china denim articles mainly for vf the tanzanian sumitomo japan 50 50 joint venture a to z textile mills knitted garments or mazava a company of the winds group with headquarters in hong kong 15 000 employees focus on performance wear however the government would be pleased if instead of cmt cut make trim garment factories a number of local and foreign investors would set up fob oriented companies in tanzania producing yarns fabrics and apparel in integrated hi tech factories that would enjoy economies of scale the government s textile vision is not yet clear should tanzania specialise in bed linen and napkins or rather in clothing textiles or in both should the country try to attract denim manufacturers or should after all the government of tanzania use its scarce financial resources to boost investments in a highly labour intensive cmt garment industry tanzania with its 60 million inhabitants needs jobs the more so since president john magufuli has urged women to stop taking birth control pills saying the country needs more people comparing tanzania with india the consultants of msingi east africa pointed out that the monthly wage in tanzania is only 90 95 around half that in india at 160 180 also the power cost is lower at 6 9 us dollar cents per kilowatt hour compared to 10 12 us dollar cents in india thanks to the textiles policy initiated by its first president 1961 85 the legendary julius nyerere tanzania has a complete cotton to clothing supply chain will it eventually decide to make a priority of the development and modernisation of the textile and garment sector adam zuku ceo of tegamat the textile and garments manufacturers association of tanzania says the government has the intention to boost the sector now action must follow and action means money mtunga confirms that the government is ready to take action designers want recognition as never before female fashion designers raised their voice during origin africa 2019 after having listened to some speeches they criticised the male sector experts and even the tanzanian deputy minister of industries stella manyanya for not referring to the potentially important role of fashion design in the regional cotton to clothing supply chains and in service oriented garment exporting factories the minister was however warmly applauded when she proposed that tanzanians should be encouraged to wear traditional clothing every friday and sunday the holy days of respectively muslims and christians tanzanian fashion designer and entrepreneur kemi kalikawe brand naledi reacted when experts talk about the future of the african cotton to apparel value chain not only the smallholder cotton farmers but also the designers are mostly forgotten however at the end of the day we the designers are the ones who create most value unfortunately in my country this is not recognised by the government and by the large clothing companies i went to india and saw there that designers can work with factories and that factories want to work with designers at the same time i learnt that east african designers lack up to date training for working with factories and brands we should learn making patterns and using cad unfortunately here in tanzania we don t even have fashion schools that s why i founded the naledi fashion institute and the naledi fashion incubator tanzanian designer jamilla vera swai remarked international designers and brands are very interested in our creations and shows however though they get inspiration from us our creative work is not respected or rewarded as intellectual property tesha stressed that african fashion is one of the few fashions worldwide to have a strong identity she pleaded for keeping this precious heritage alive a key event making east african fashion visible to the world is the annual swahili fashion week which this year will take place in dar es salaam from december 6 to 8 the event was launched in 2008 by mustafa hassanali the chairman of the tanzanian fashion association africa united in afcfta on may 30 africa made history as the agreement establishing the african continental free trade area afcfta officially entered into force with 54 of the 55 member states of the african union signing the agreement small eritrea is the only exception africa brought into being the largest trading bloc since the formation of the wto in 1995 the bloc will unite 1 3 billion people create a 3 4 trillion economy and boost trade within the continent itself experts say that african and international investors will both benefit from the agreement as afcfta will make it easier for businesses to expand operations across the continent many observers are sceptical they point to the meagre results of existing regional trade agreements in east africa inter country trade remained modest in spite of eac east african community comesa common market for eastern and southern africa and sadc southern african development community sceptics are wondering how many years it will take for the afcfta to function effectively the rules of origin are still to be negotiated and many obstacles need to be removed what s the use of 90 per cent tariff liberalisation between two countries by july 1 2020 if no navigable roads connect these countries
australian capitalism s exposure to the recessionary slide trade war tensions and political upheaval sweeping the globe was underscored by yesterday s release of the government s mid year economic and fiscal outlook myefo despite record low interest rates and large tax handouts mostly to companies and the wealthy the deepening economic slump forced the liberal national coalition government to drastically cut its forecasts for economic growth and tax revenues predictions made in the last official forecast issued during the may 18 federal election campaign have been shattered almost 22 billion has been wiped from the forecast budget surpluses for this and the next three financial years due to revenues plummeting by almost 33 billion forecast household consumption growth of 1 75 percent in 2019 20 is a full one percentage point below the 2 75 percent tipped in may the fall in retail consumption spending is so steep that goods and services tax gst revenue which is directed to the state governments will fall by 9 9 billion over four years including 1 8 billion this year as a result there will be sharper cuts to both federal and state government social spending and public services on top of a 1 4 billion reduction already made in federal spending this financial year largely through cuts to welfare and public service staff levels this means an intensified assault on the living standards and social conditions of the working class which have already suffered from years of stagnant or lower real wages sending household debt levels to among the highest in the world even according to the latest equally unreliable predictions in the myefo report average wages growth will continue to stall at 2 25 to 2 5 percent not enough to cover the real cost of living rises for working class households for the next four years at least this is a far cry from the pre election claims of wages rising by 3 25 percent by 2020 21 the government remains determined to produce a budget surplus this year for the first time since the 2008 09 global financial crisis in order to meet the demands of the money markets but the myefo update halves the 45 1 billion in cumulative surpluses over four years predicted in the pre election update the myefo downgrades gross domestic product gdp growth for this year from 2 75 percent to 2 25 percent which indicates near contraction compared to population growth unemployment forecast for this year and next has risen from 5 percent to 5 25 percent that figure is a vast underestimate of the real levels of joblessness and casualised under employment a revealing indicator of a worsening downturn is that the forecast for business investment growth was slashed from 5 percent to 1 5 percent this year corporate investment is drying up with dire implications for the future even though the reserve bank of australia rba has cut its official interest rates three times since the election to an historic low of 0 75 percent far below the emergency level of 3 percent in 2009 the myefo says global economic momentum has weakened since the election with the us china trade war brexit and financial instability in italy turkey and south america major factors this continued uncertainty has weighed on business confidence and investment intentions particularly in manufacturing the budget papers say treasurer josh frydenberg attempted to put a positive spin on the result saying it still showed the economy was expected to grow faster than any nation in the g7 as if that were a comfort the australian economy s remarkable resilience has occurred in the face of strong global and domestic economic headwinds he said while a severe drought and huge bushfires have reduced output it is the global slump that is predominantly driving the headwinds frydenberg rejected calls by sections of business for increased government spending to try to stimulate the economy instead he expressed the hope that an end to the us china trade war and the brexit impasse would lift business and consumer sentiment let s just wait and see what happens from here frydenberg said in reality the aggressive us drive to counter the rise of china or any other perceived rival will only deepen while the fallout from brexit is unlikely to ease compounded by uncertainty over uk european union economic arrangements corporate leaders are frustrated that the government s pre election pledge to eradicate net debt by the end of next decade has been abandoned since the 2008 09 breakdown governments have accumulated 329 billion of net debt nearly 20 percent of gdp prime minister scott morrison recently said the government would not be panicked into bringing forward stimulus measures this reflects the dictates of the financial markets s p global ratings warned that spending restraint by the government was important to maintain its aaa credit rating in a statement frydenberg and finance minister mathias cormann pointed to the perilous reliance of the economy on foreign funds they said we consider strong fiscal outcomes to be important for our aaa rating on australia because of the economy s high level of external liabilities compared with its aaa rated peers the pair vowed that government spending would be restricted to grow by just 1 3 percent annually in real terms over four years this is less than the population growth of around 1 6 percent so the deterioration of public services and infrastructure will worsen especially in the large cities perversely the australian share market rose to a near record high after the myefo release this was partly due to hopes of a boost from the global market reaction to the conservative government s election victory in britain and washington s claims of a deal with china but it was fuelled by expectations that the rba would have to cut interest rates further in the new year possibly to 0 25 percent and resort to pumping money into the economy via quantitative easing lower interest rates already have channelled money into the stock exchange chasing higher speculative returns frydenberg said lower rates had helped stop a slide in property prices this was good for the economy because it plays into households confidence for millions of people however a renewed bubble in house prices means higher mortgages and rents while slashing social spending the government is continuing to pour billions of dollars into war preparations the latest auditor general s report also released yesterday shows that the cost of 26 military projects has risen by a total of 24 billion compared to what was originally announced taking their bill up by nearly 60 percent to 64 1 billion the response of the labor party and the australian council of trade unions to the myefo was to back business calls for measures to stimulate spending and boost productivity this is in line with labor s further lurch to the right since its election debacle to openly advocate pro business and wealth creation policies corporate figures and media platforms urged the government to further gut spending and cut corporate taxes to drive up profits the murdoch empire s australian editorial today declared the coalition must turn the screws on a heaving social welfare bureaucracy the australian financial review demanded supply side reforms to make workplaces flexible and a pro growth business investment

aix ceo tim bennett it is necessary to show success story in kazakhstan in order to attract other countries and companies to aix a year ago kazakhstan s first president nursultan nazarbayev solemnly unveiled the first trading session on astana international exchange aix the trading platform was designed as a platform for the countries of the central asian region to allow companies to attract foreign investment from around the world aix ceo tim bennett talked in an interview with interfax kazakhstan on how the work on attracting participants from the other countries is ongoing what the advantage of kazakhstan s exchange over the lse platform what the future for green and islamic finance is like kazakhstan s authorities have repeatedly stated that the astana international financial centre aifc and aix will be a regional platform for attracting investments and other financial transactions in september you said that aix is ready to provide its platform to uzbek companies to attract investments what progress is available in this aspect here are a few things to take into consideration yes our platform is designed for the entire region because investors from london are also equally interested in uzbek companies and brokers want to provide them with trading services and sell uzbek securities but we must understand one and a half two years ago there were no private companies in this country as such everything was kept in state ownership their privatization program for both state owned assets and assets owned by business should reach a certain stage of development it will take them time to reach the level of kazakhstani companies another important distinguishing feature is that we do not just invite uzbek companies to raise capital on the aix platform but offer to work together with them this will give uzbekistan access to investors in global markets we have built a working platform in kazakhstan however unlike the lse where issuers must play by its rules use its brokers and its services we offer other terms and conditions this may be a small batch of uzbek companies which can use their brokers bankers their service providers and we will provide a platform with access to international investors we do not say that we are better we simply voice our proposal is there interest in aix on the part of the other central asian countries we are negotiating with officials from uzbekistan and in principle similar deliberations and discussions are ongoing with the other countries in the region however kazakhstan and uzbekistan are a large part of the central asian economies therefore our goal in kazakhstan is to launch and put the process on track we also want to start such process in uzbekistan as well but in order to attract states and companies it is necessary to show a success story this is the best attraction strategy so we are now focused on showcasing our success in kazakhstan are there any plans or expectations on listing new companies on the exchange excluding those who have to be floated as part of the state privatization program how many companies are approaching you ready to consider your platform for their offerings in general there are many such companies we work very hard but it is necessary to understand that as an exchange we do not take such decisions on behalf of companies they have to consider factors such as the right time for listing the price that investors are willing to pay and whether there is in principle interest on the part of investors there are companies which were very attractive 12 months ago but now they are void of interest this happens not only in kazakhstan but around the world aspects such as trade wars have an impact on that you know china sets prices for raw materials the recession is also expected in 2020 so these factors need to be taken into consideration i underscore once again that we are operating we are open and so to speak in the full scale operational phase and for several months we have been showing good indicators in terms of integrated capital market development in kazakhstan where both domestic and foreign investors are present returning to the so called market conditions which are the factors that determine many decisions then these are trade wars interest rates recession commodity prices tourism they determine the needs whether there is any interest in these companies and the need to enter the capital market aix is only one year old most platforms in the world are 25 50 100 years old my experience in developing markets shows that we need to arm ourselves with patience yes one can judge us by annual results but still it is better to focus on 4 5 year results because i see a huge interest in kazakhstan in the five year term on the part of foreign investors wherever i travel across kazakhstan i always see a huge potential to use this capital for development we have the main base ingredients it is necessary just to put them together also aix was designed as a platform for attracting the belt and road project investments can you talk through this initiative we see more and more that investors have an interest either in concrete projects or in projects sectors we saw this with regard to islamic securities and green finance as well these are those projects and businesses that meet a certain list of criteria similarly we devised a list of criteria for the belt and road initiative in order to define whether this company or project is part of the initiative we also worked out an analysis process to check whether a company or a project meets the criteria in particular these are projects to be implemented in kazakhstan the central asian countries and other states as part of the belt and road initiative the nurly jol program privatization and infrastructure projects as well as initiatives within the china kazakhstan production capacity cooperation fund framework when investors whether chinese ones or from other countries are interested in participating in projects related to the belt and road initiative we tell them here is our list of projects or companies that meet the criteria of the initiative choose how do you assess the aifc readiness and the system as a whole for islamic and green finance i know that the aifc carried out meticulous work on devising criteria for islamic securities and green finance i also know that the green finance team is working on projects and businesses which comply with green finance principles we are also in talks with investors who are interested in eco projects however such projects require certain time to reach a certain stage of development not every day someone decides to build 500 million worth of wind farm or invest in building a school according to sharia canons therefore here we say that the development of such projects takes time how do you assess the prospects for natural development of islamic and green finance in kazakhstan it is no secret that the kazakh government is making every effort to ensure the green economy and islamic finance take hold in the country and sometimes there is a feeling that this is being done too vigorously i do not quite agree with you these are projects that imply the availability of signs of green economy or energy as well as compliance with sharia canons therefore a large independent investor is unlikely to be found who would come in and say that he is ready to invest 1 5 billion in the construction of a wind farm more often the government will be 100 or 50 source that is development and investment in this infrastructure will come from either the government or government entities in general the portfolio of such projects will be initiated on their part but this is good because there is simply the staggering demand on the part of investors for both green projects and though a little bit less for islamic projects therefore if the government wants to raise capital for the development of the country it should reckon current trends and what is of interest to the investor since islamic and green investors also represent a very large pool their interests must be taken into consideration in october aix jointly with renaissance capital organized a series of meetings of kazakh companies with investors in london tell us how these meetings went as many as 10 kazakhstani companies attended which met with 23 various management funds the kazakhstani companies represented various sectors these were entities included in the privatization program such as kazmunaygas kazakhtelecom and air astana and large financial companies such as halyk bank and small businesses there were also companies which are not listed but considering such prospects and they were satisfied with the level of interest from the management funds there were nearly 100 face to face meetings they met with management companies foundations that are interested in emerging new markets you said that your potential issuers were among the companies participating in the meetings with the investors would it be possible to talk through whether you are expecting offerings or for the time being is all this provisional plans companies which plan to raise capital begin a preparatory process two three years in advance the main factors that they focus on are market conditions and investors interest therefore we cannot say specifically about dates or a timeframe in the past 3 6 months we have viewed situations internationally when companies were planning an ipo but after a road show with investors they saw that there was no strong investors interest and decided not to go public that is market conditions also affect investors interest to this end it is worth mentioning that the government has repeatedly confirmed its commitment to the privatization program through the fund samruk kazyna and i believe this entire process is transparent i am sure that the program will be implemented in the coming years also as part of our event the companies attended which are listed on other exchanges and now examining opportunities in kazakhstan a large number of companies and projects in kazakhstan is active in the oil gas and natural resources sector and they need capital investment therefore we also work with them in order to understand what the needs and interests of investors are to help them with types of securities they could issue that is some sort of matchmaking when we help them find a match between their expectations and investors needs so that both shareholders and investors understand what to expect from each other the project portfolio also includes chinese investors showing their interest in the belt and road initiative projects there are few such projects because they are long term predominantly infrastructure and resources also chinese investors mainly consider the local currency and chinese yuan and the last thing it is worth noting that we started from scratch there was no significant market here for debt financing capital investment the local market was illiquid therefore it will take a certain number of years to build up an investor base and the london event was quite successful to this end it is also necessary to update a local domestic investors database of course give our investors confidence that there will be bidding that the price will reflect the real value the company cost what investment funds took part in the meetings with kazakhstan s companies mostly these were companies from the uk and based in europe representatives of the funds were persons specializing in investments in the emerging and eastern european markets including kazakhstan their current investment volume nears 30 40 billion now we are working to develop the marketplace when we were beginning 18 months ago we had nothing now we need to create some sort of market and therefore we need both sellers and buyers the more sellers we have the more buyers will be and the more buyers we have the more sellers we will have and this marketplace develops in this way company by company investor by investor issuer by issuer but we need a platform where everyone will get together both domestic and foreign investors now we are working to develop the integrated platform the meetings of kazakhstani companies with investors in london were very successful however anyway we measure success in dollars or in attracted investments and it takes months and years to take such decisions so now we say that the event was successful but prospects will tell in general feedback has been received from companies and investors who say they would like to participate again in such an event therefore we are examining the possibility of holding such an event next year in london as well as possibly in new york and we see a certain demand from asia therefore we are discussing the possibility of holding such an event in 2020 with some of our brokers thank you for the interview december 2019 2024 interfax kazakhstan news agency copying and use of these materials without reference to the source is prohibited
a senior editor once told a nervous new recruit that to write like the economist you just pretend you are god wilson who died of dysentery in 1860 is less remembered than his son in law and successor as economist editor walter bagehot zevin does not share a sentimental view of this prolific writer and editor as the greatest victorian as the historian jacques barzun described him more pragmatic than wilson bagehot did favor a permanent graduated income tax and in his 1873 book lombard street the idea of a central bank as a lender of last resort but his love of finance clashed with democratic demands he wanted a government that was maximally compatible with the needs of finance when he was feeling sad bagehot is reported to have made a habit of going to the bank to run his hands through heaps of coins the thesis of his book the english constitution written in 1867 was that the british government worked not because of the separation of powers but because the real work of governing was done by the cabinet while the monarchy put on a performance of governing to please what he called the vacant many every person has a right to so much power wrote bagehot as he can exercise without impeding any other person who would more fitly exercise such power a view far more aristocratic than libertarian in all cases it must be remembered he declared that a political combination of the lower classes as such and for their own objects is an evil of the first magnitude bagehot s belief in the british ruling class s special fitness also extended to questions of empire both wilson and bagehot were broadly believers in liberal empire and wilson approved for example of the opening of china by violence in 1857 the paper wrote we may regret war but we cannot deny that great advances have followed in its wake bagehot for his part thought the british the most enterprising the most successful and in most respects the best colonists on the face of the earth the economist celebrated british imperialism above others assuming its good intentions and that it worked to promote trade but it rarely criticized it stayed silent on the discovery of british run concentration camps in the second boer war for example zevin argues that the economist s pro finance position necessarily made it a cheerleader for empire since empire was the framework within which wealth was being created but liberalism has many currents and in response to imperial abuses and demands for social reform in the early twentieth century the economist entered a new period its editorial line acted as a kind of barometer of liberal conventional wisdom responding to the atmospheric pressure of world events editor francis hirst who took the top job in 1907 held much like hobson that the scramble for africa was the result of financial imperialism rather than the means to pass on the supposed blessings of civilization hirst condemned military aggression arguing that reducing spending on arms was the only way to carry out needed social reforms while keeping taxes low perhaps hirst s statement that the british constitution was only a mask over the face of plutocracy was not so analytically distinct from bagehot but hirst at least meant it as a criticism

the nhs was a key issue in the general election us hmo style health maintenance organisations integrated care systems are being set up all over england provided largely free at the point of use since 1948 and funded by taxation as a publicly provided service with nationalised hospitals the nhs provided healthcare for all according to need up to 2012 life expectation increased every year in the frantic battle to win the election tory pm boris johnson constantly reiterated that his one nation government of four months duration is putting record amounts of money into the nhs this is not true the so called extra 35bn per anum to be reached by 2023 4 is in fact around only 20 5bn which theresa may announced in september 2018 when inflation is taken into account this does not remotely make up for the billions taken out of the national health service england nhse budget by the tory lib dem coalition between 2010 and 2015 and then from 2015 to date we have suffered nine years of flat line funding of 0 1 pa the nhs needs 4 per anum increases just to stand still and keep up with population needs let alone address the backlog of capital spending needed to address crumbling infrastructure labour s proposals for funding would increase funding per anum by around 4 neither the tories nor labour like to mention the millstone of the private finance initiative pfi used to build new hospitals around 11bn of new hospitals are costing the treasury 88bn of long term debt john major s government initiated this scheme and new labour s blair and brown implemented it the labour manifesto said it would eliminate pfis over time the tory manifesto did not mention it the pfi new hospital building scheme has resulted in the biggest hospital closure programme in history started by the tories and accelerated in the blair years with the darzi nicholson plan to close 60 district general hospitals dghs all over the country scores of hospitals have been closed in this reconfiguration through the device of closing the maternity paediatrics and a e departments this is still in full swing with acute hospitals going in dorset lincoln essex london etc johnson had the cheek to propose the tory manifesto in the west midlands town of telford in the full knowledge of the green light to close telford s a e at night so that sick emergency patients will have to be shipped up to wolverhampton and even stoke to get emergency care putting their lives at risk every time a dgh is closed the neighbouring hospitals become full to capacity resulting in sick hospital patients languishing in corridors it is outrageous that the excuse of purdah during the election meant that the hospital statistics on a e care black alerts etc were postponed till friday 13th december the day after the election so the full scale of the acute hospital crisis was hidden from the public during the election meanwhile a new study has shown that over 5 000 patients have died prematurely over the last three years because of lying on hospital trolleys for extended periods these patients could have been saved had a timely hospital bed and full care been available corbyn s labour party has rightly made a big issue of nhs privatisation which started mainly under margaret thatcher but then proceeded apace under blair s concordat with the private sector in 2000 and the diversion of nhs patients into the private sector on patient choice blair s health advisor from 1997 to 2004 was simon stevens the same stevens who currently controls the nhs commissioning board nhs england nhse as chief executive this process accelerated after the tory lib dem coalition brought in the health and social care act 2012 which made it mandatory for nhse and ccgs clinical commissioning groups to put every nhs contract over 615 000 out to tender on the market at the same time a decision was made to cut training for all nhs professionals which has resulted in the current shortage of over 100 000 nhs staff meanwhile the 40 year long bed closure programme has left the nhs the most under bedded health service in europe labour s manifesto stoodfor reversing this act and making in house provision the default option rather than outsourcing and for ending privatisation corbyn rightly made a key issue of the secret trade talks of government officials with the us government regarding the purchases of drugs from the us giant pharmaceutical companies at grossly inflated prices but it is not just pharmaceuticals which have been discussed as the retired us trade negotiator david hennig explained everything is potentially up for grabs in a trade negotiation and these have been going on for two years at least what was missed out of the election debate is that nhs clinical care is already being packaged up into business structures ready for american corporate investment as we speak simon stevens was brought back from the us where he was head of global health and vice president of unitedhealth the biggest american health insurance company from 2004 to 2014 there he became the big guru for spreading american accountable care methods all over the world the then tory pm david cameron installed him as chief executive of nhs england nhse in april 2014 with the full powers of the health and social care act behind him stevens inaugurated the five year forward view fyfv of october 2014 to end district general hospitals and independent contractor gp surgeries and replace them with the us model of accountable care organisations acos he called the latter new models of care amid a spin campaign promoting them as care in the community and joined up care around the patient and integrated care these work on the same principles as american health maintenance organisations hmos i e they are profit making bodies which make their money by denying necessary care the less care you give the more money you make john ehrlichman told president richard nixon in 1971 hmos and acos make their money by using a cheaper skill mix of staff forcing doctors to adhere to so called efficient managed care plans and incentivising them to reduce hospital care on 7th january this year the americanisation programme in the uk took a giant leap forward with simon stevens nhs long term plan and the agreement by the doctors union the british medical association bma to five year national gp contract reform in england to implement the nhs long term plan 31 1 19 within six months 7 000 gp practices were herded into 1 259 giant primary care networks pcns taking their nhs registered patients with them as the clinical delivery arm of 42 integrated care systems in england the national nhs in england has effectively been divided into 42 public private partnerships run to make profit from shared savings schemes these profits are extracted by incentivising gps to reduce hospital care outpatient appointments elective operations and emergency care to nhs patients in england the role of the gp is being changed from patient advocate to care denier in the financial interests of the network and the ics integrated care systems icss prepare the ground for icps integrated care providers which would be able following changes to the law in feb 2019 to provide all types of medical and social care on one nhs long term contract never seen before in nhs history johnson s tory party manifesto was committed to passing all the legislation demanded in the nhs long term plan in the next three months if they won a majority now they have and pushing ahead with the plan would make icps legal with contracts which could be held by new statutory nhs trusts with investment opportunities for private partners through joint ventures this colossal conspiracy has been largely kept under wraps by the mainstream media political parties and the trade unions on 2 12 19 an interesting letter appeared in the guardian from a dr robert oulton from godalming surrey he referred to a guardian leader article on nhs privatisation on 28 11 19 and then commented global capital is certainly desperate to get its hands on 130bn guaranteed annual revenue but why use cumbersome insurance schemes when you can go straight to the heart of these riches in the public purse and drink deep nhs england has been spending the last three years trying to address this in yet another reorganisation largely unnoticed by the public and press its solution to combine ccgs 191 in england into larger integrated care systems ics 44 projected which will be able to commission a single integrated care provider icp to operate all nhs health provision in the ics area whatever emerges from all this there can be little doubt that the nhs is being reorganised to make possible the acquisition of public contracts at a scale that finally makes sense to global capital it s high time nhs england s plans for the health service were given proper public scrutiny he is saying that nhse is handing nhs clinical care on a plate to american corporations as profit making investments under the current secret massive reorganisation plans professor allyson pollock and others drew attention to these changes in january 2018 in a seminal paper she and other prominent health campaigners wrote a letter to the guardian on 6 12 19 titled private contracts are at the heart of the nhs crisis it starts the nhs crisis isn t just about lack of funding over the last 30 years the nhs has been structurally dismantled under successive governments leading to many of the serious failings that we are witnessing us companies like kaiser permanente mckinsey centene and unitedhealth optum have been significantly involved in this and the delivery of nhs services us hmo style integrated care systems are now being installed throughout england the letter suggests that the only way to reverse these processes is by passing the nhs re instatement bill there is silence however on the forced incorporation of general practices into networks built into icss as a result of the shocking collaborative role of the bma with nhse without nhs registered patients and subordinate gp practices icss could not get off the ground the union did not even allow gp members a vote the only political party to oppose stevens nhse plans to americanise the nhs through this massive secret structural change is the workers revolutionary party the news line daily newspaper has consistently drawn attention to the fyfv and the hospital and gp practice closures the wrp has campaigned for the reopening of all nhs facilities the nhs long term plan and the role of gp contract reform in establishing new primary care networks as the building blocks of icss was reported in january 2019 march may and june 2019 news line archives the great nhs heist by dr bob gill issued in a podcast in april warned that the advent of pcns as part of the ics hmo model would end the traditional gp patient relationship and hasten the end of british general practice the recent film of this name highlighted the colossal profits made by us pharmaceutical and insurance companies whilst millions of americans die young from lack of healthcare it showed the critical role of stevens and nhse in this process in england no amount of parliamentary legislation to restore the nhs even if it were to get the necessary votes can return the nhs as a publicly owned and provided system providing care according to clinical need and not profit so long as capitalism exists especially in the current global crisis where big corporations are scouring the world for easy profit opportunities from the public sector it will take a mass revolutionary movement of the working class to get rid of capitalism and build a workers government and a planned socialist economy to restore the nhs on founding principles and all the public services that is why the wrp stood candidates in the general election the revolutionary leadership must be rapidly built to lead this struggle
this means that india is committed to more than meeting the goals of its national contributions in the 2015 paris climate agreement it is going to overdeliver in the parlance of economists this development is all the more astonishing because just a few years ago india was a villain when it came to coal use in 2015 modi s ruling party had wanted to more than double india s mining of coal to 1 5 billion metric tons by 2020 despite the risks this posed to the climate and the country consequently with this massive reduction in the cost of renewables india is able to shift away from the world s dirtiest fossil fuel and to much cleaner sources it s a stunning change and one that could have profound implications on the world energy market while western countries continue to baulk at reducing their reliance on fossil fuels india is accelerating its plans to lock in a sustained aggressive reduction in the carbon emissions intensity of its economy in fact india s prime minister narendra modi is targeting a fivefold expansion of the electricity generated from renewable energy sources by 2030 and this from a country that has already doubled its renewable energy in the past three years the reasons for this change are complex and interlocking but one aspect in particular seems to stand out the price for solar electricity has been in freefall to levels so low they were once thought impossible for example since 2017 one solar energy company has been generating electricity in the indian state of rajasthan at the unheard of guaranteed wholesale price of 2 44 rupees per kilowatt hour or 3 us cents in comparison the average price for electricity in the united states is presently about 13 19 cents per kilowatt hour and some locations in the country pay far more as recently as 2008 the average homeowner on block island rhode island paid a staggering 61 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity before any other fees or charges which can nearly double the price and businesses had it even worse with some business owners reporting electric bills of as much as 30 000 per month in the often grim world of climate reporting there is at least one upbeat story india has been aggressively pivoting away from coal fired power plants and towards electricity generated by solar wind and hydroelectric power this means that the amount of carbon dioxide the country emits into the atmosphere should come down dramatically this story was originally published by bulletin of the atomic scientists and appears here as part of the climate desk collaboration the rapid diversification of india s electricity sector is creating an abundance of jobs and bringing an influx of new investment needing to reach 500 billion over the coming decade if the targets are to be met while reducing india s emissions profile a perfect storm in a good way several developments have come into play at once that together have made for this startling climate friendly transformation of india s energy policy they can be generally categorized as coming from two camps one environmental and one financial on the environmental side india had no choice but to deal with its poor air quality and water scarcity on the financial end unreliable power supplies and india s historic and growing dependence on imported fossil fuels were an ongoing drag on its domestic economic growth and this change of course also raises other questions such as why india and why now what are the factors driving this energy transition from coal to renewables the environmental costs of increasing economic growth similar to china s growth since the start of this century india has been on an industrialization path that has pushed the country s economy to grow at over 6 percent annually since 2010 in the coming decade the indian government is targeting 6 to 8 percent annual growth but such sustained economic growth comes with an ever increasing environmental cost take air pollution over the last couple of weeks residents in the capital of new delhi have likened their hazardous air quality to living in a gas chamber while flights to the city have been diverted due to poor visibility reported in the australian financial review in fact a recent new york times article used new delhi as an example of some of the world s worst air quality noting that at 900 micrograms of fine particulates per cubic meter of air the city was blowing past the e p a s definition of hazardous air which maxes out at 500 and into extreme territory while seasonal factors are clearly at play the deteriorating air quality is an all too powerful symbol of the growing environmental costs of strong economic growth for the people of india and the right to breathe clean air is gaining traction as a demand among schoolchildren forced to stay locked indoors similarly clean water is also becoming a critical issue the electricity sector still the dominant energy source in india is still largely based on coal and this sector of india s economy is one of the largest consumers of the country s scarce water meanwhile increasing economic growth means that the government must meet the burgeoning power demands of the population but with the overall total water supply slowly declining and pressing agricultural needs 70 percent of india s farming output is irrigation based there are simply not sufficient water resources for a continued expansion of the coal power sector at the same time india is genuinely committed to overdelivering on its national contributions to the 2015 paris climate agreement and locking in a sustained aggressive reduction in the carbon emissions intensity of its economy indeed india is on track to boast just 2 percent growth in carbon emissions in 2019 the country s lowest rate of carbon emissions growth this century assisted in part by the slowing economic growth rate in tackling air pollution water scarcity and the paris targets it might appear that india is driving its energy transformation because of domestic environmentalism but this is not really the case finance is the central driver india is embracing renewables and new energy technologies due to the compelling economic benefits of the rapid expansion of a cheaper electricity supply creating a low cost electricity supply in 2017 india s then energy minister piyush goyal introduced online competitive reverse auctions where suppliers can view the current bid and make lower bids if they wish to win the right to build new renewable energy infrastructure across india this encouraged each indian state to compete with others given that both local and international developers were able to choose sites with the best wind and solar resources the indian states of gujarat and tamil nadu offer some of the best sites in the world the results of these reverse auctions were staggering companies collectively bid for more capacity than was being auctioned by up to ten times this high investor interest allowed the government of india to select the lowest cost bids ultimately benefitting india s electricity consumers fearful of missing out the trend continued in subsequent reverse auctions with investors bidding aggressively with cheap offers putting enormous downward price pressure on reverse auction results this in turn encouraged the state and central governments to encourage this investment boom further by removing legal and regulatory barriers lending truth to the adage that the flow of money through a system tends to organize it with such powerful forces at work prices kept dropping previously expensive renewable energy prices dropped by some 50 percent over 2017 for both solar and then wind while investors offered 2 40 3 00 rupees per kilowatt hour this put domestic renewable energy prices about 20 30 percent below the cost of india s existing domestic coal fired power generation costs and even below the cost of plants powered by imported coal or imported liquified natural gas india s thermal and renewable capacity additions in megawatts source central electricity authority mnre ieefa estimates subsequent reverse auction tenders reconfirmed this situation highlighting the growing range of investors who wanted to participate in india s renewables boom domestic power companies were all interested including state owned enterprises not too subtly nudged by their government ministers to back this national mission using surplus capital they might have otherwise had to pay out as dividends and private industry leaders like the massive adani and tata groups domestic renewable energy specialists were also bidding they were often backed by global private equity and international investors who had jumped aboard as well such as japan s softbank australia s macquarie group goldman sachs of the us singapore s sembcorp and temasek clp power hong kong finland s fortum and france s edf the bidding for renewable projects became so frenetic that five leading indian billionaires wrote a joint letter to the prime minister demanding limits to the injections of foreign capital they said they could not compete with the flood of international investment that was driving electricity prices down and crowding out india s domestic giants the government reluctantly complied putting a cap of 1 billion per bid per participant an astonishingly good problem to have india had been suffering from acute electricity supply shortages for a decade and now it was being overwhelmed with new investment in ultra low cost electricity supply the result the government of india enabled 40 billion of new investment and a doubling of renewable energy capacity in just over three years to 83 gigawatts by september 2019 with another 45 gigawatts of large scale hydro electricity to give a sense of scale the hoover dam generates 2 gigawatts buoyed by the success india s initial target of 175 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2022 was expanded to a target of 275 gigawatts by 2027 then in september 2019 prime minister modi proclaimed a new target of 450 gigawatts by 2030 or another 500 billion of investment in the coming decade in addition to low cost electricity the government of india had introduced another key benefit into its auction process not only were the bids being offered about 20 to 30 percent below the wholesale price of electricity they were also fixed at a flat rate for 25 years in doing this india created a deflationary low cost electricity system running on zero inflation a fixed rate is a very material benefit for investors given consumer inflation was running at 10 percent annually when modi was first elected prime minister in 2014 india entered the first decade of the 21st century on a path of massive coal fired power generation investment with plans reaching over 600 gigawatts india now exits this decade with over four fifths of this high emission high pollution investment intent now shelved uncompetitive against zero emissions renewable energy what s more the indian government s plans include a progressive expansion of electric vehicles putting the country on a path to progressively reduce reliance on expensive high emissions oil imports the energy transformation continues despite the economic slowdown while the indian government has embraced the deflationary opportunities in renewable energy investment the technology driven disruption of its energy system has a long way to go and it has by no means been entirely smooth sailing the national electricity grid is showing signs of serious congestion from the rapid influx of intermittent renewable energy generation the gold rush for the best wind and solar sites of a few select states has put intense pressure on the grid created energy distribution bottlenecks and provoked some policy contradictions including increased state government charges on renewable energy the government of india has also come up against push back from its domestic manufacturing industry seeking and winning tariff protection from the ever lower priced solar module imports from china prime minister modi campaigned on a made in india manufacturing upswing but the domestic solar industry to date has been unable to compete with the rapid innovation and huge economies of scale inherent in china s solar module export industry the government s subsequent import duties on chinese solar modules not only raised solar tariffs by 10 to 20 percent but caused a 12 to 18 month installation delay as the new rules were all too slowly clarified these issues will likely be short lived however as the same imperatives that first triggered this boom continue to remain to fight the environmental costs of india s economic growth and to lower india s energy costs prime minister modi s target of ensuring an uninterrupted supply of electricity to all households industries and commercial establishments highlights the government s well publicized commitment to transforming india s electricity system the energy security gains of a reduced reliance on fossil fuel imports are clear as are the benefits of diversifying india s electricity system from its historic overreliance on heavily polluting coal fired power generation and the benefits extend well beyond its borders as india benefits from the shift to domestic renewable energy other emerging market nations are watching keen to leverage the same benefits for their own countries and therein lies a key path to global decarbonization and a much needed solution to limit global warming and none too soon
