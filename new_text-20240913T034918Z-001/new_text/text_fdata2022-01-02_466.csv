animal testing as of this year we re really happy that virginia has taken this step monica engebretson the public affairs head for north american cruelty free international said virginia was the fourth state to pass such a law and since then four more states have as well virginia is still very much a leader and this adds to momentum for what we re really hoping to do is pass a federal law engebretson said other laws among some of the other new laws the dmv can issue what are called identification privilege cards to undocumented immigrants another law prevents many public colleges and universities from asking for a person s criminal history during the admissions process however it does allow for that question after someone has been admitted and for the admission to be revoked if

loss sales from low alcohol beverage coolers produced outside of virginia with new products manufactured by virginia distillers or products with alcohol by volume above 7 5 percent animal cruelty hb

maverick make ford segment sports car as we saw at this year s sema show in las vegas the 2022 ford maverick is primed for aftermarket customization ford showed off a full roster of customized mavericks including a sporty creation from tucci hot rods pictured below that has already garnered several orders from customers we are excited to see how owners customize their mavericks in the future but if you currently have one and want to start with a simple modification mrt has two new exhaust systems to fit the bill both systems are designed for maverick models equipped with the 2 0 liter ecoboost four cylinder this engine produces 250 horsepower and 277 lb ft going out to front or all wheel drive unfortunately mrt doesn t have an exhaust system for the maverick hybrid at least not yet close the sport exhaust is the cheaper and more aggressive sounding option of the two it retails for 635 99 but is currently marked down to 529 99 as of this writing mrt builds its exhaust using 2 5 inch t304 stainless steel made in the usa making it corrosion resistant the sport version features a straight pipe design that s much louder than stock it doesn t sound throaty like a v8 powered pickup truck but the maverick sounds reminiscent of a focus st with this exhaust equipped close maverick owners who want their truck to be louder than stock without as much drone should opt for the street exhaust setup this exhaust retails for 791 99 but is currently on sale for 659 99 the street version features an axle back straight muffler design giving it a noticeable growl that s less overpowering like the sport exhaust the street exhaust is made from corrosion resistant 2 5 inch t304 stainless steel we d expect these aftermarket exhausts to have a small impact on fuel economy and performance but mrt doesn t mention any specific gains from either system combined with an aftermarket tune the ecoboost engine can likely produce well over 300 horsepower and will sound like a hot hatchback
trinny woodall anyone can turn a genius idea into a mega brand you just need perseverance and lots of passion says trinny woodall she shares the hard won wisdom that turned her own start up dream into a multimillion pound business trinny woodall i had 5 000 voices in my head from all the women we d met so many conversations were about make up women were confused by all the products out there and didn t know what suited them to launch a business and grow it into a multimillion pound empire in less than four years takes some serious determination but anyone who follows trinny woodall and there are a lot she s amassed one million followers on instagram 1 9 million on facebook knows from her daily videos that she has the kind of boundless energy that practically fizzes out of your screen the former what not to wear presenter 57 launched her beauty brand trinny london a range of make up and skincare housed in space saving stackable pots in 2017 she d spent the previous four years perfecting the products and developing the brand s signature match2me technology an online tool that solves the russian roulette of ordering make up on the internet by helping customers to find the right shades for their complexion thanks to the clever stack concept and game changing tech trinny london has been a phenomenal success the company now employs 194 people sells 187 different products and has customers in 167 countries a pot of trinny london miracle blur an ingenious line filling primer for your skin is sold every 60 seconds despite the pandemic the company made 45 million in revenue in the last financial year i went to a networking event recently and six people who d said no to investing in the company when i was fundraising pre launch came up to me and said i wish i d made that investment says trinny it was such a good feeling starting a new venture in midlife may be daunting but trinny insists we shouldn t define ourselves by age we have to keep challenging ourselves and think what do i really want from life here she shares what she s learnt from launching a business in her 50s and her advice for how you can get started too know your skills my career has been about evolution rather than reinvention how can i take the skills i already have and do something new with them i spent years doing tv makeovers all around the world i ran myself into the ground and by 2013 i knew i wanted to change direction i didn t want to be on a plane 64 times a year any more but i still wanted to work with women and make them feel inspired i had 5 000 voices in my head from all the women we d met so many conversations were about make up women were confused by all the products out there and didn t know what suited them at the same time i d started making my own diy stack decanting my make up into little pots it simplified and streamlined everything people kept asking where they could buy them that was the spark that became trinny london if you re in midlife and would like to change lanes whether you re a stay at home mum who wants to launch a business or you ve had enough of the corporate world start by identifying your existing skill set what do you excel at or know lots about are you phenomenally organised super creative brilliant at running school events ask a friend if you re not sure now how can you take those qualities and spin them into a business is there a service or product that you wish existed in your life you know you ve landed on a great idea if it s something you get really passionate about i was telling a friend about the idea for trinny london and he said when you talk about it your whole face lights up this idea is your passion do it knock on every door to get my idea off the ground i needed to find venture capitalists manufacturers and packaging companies so i thought who do i know who might have a friend in those fields i created a spreadsheet for each area i needed help with and every week i wrote down five people i was going to email if i didn t get a response i d follow up saying just in case you missed this i d love your help is there anyone you know who can help me everyone knows somebody who knows somebody sometimes it took me three jumps to get to the person i needed you ve got nothing to lose by asking for a favour they might want one from you in the future the worst thing they can do is say no or ignore you my motto is you never know what s behind a closed door assistants are very important they are the gatekeepers to most busy people i m not saying send flowers and chocolates but when you email and call be friendly have a chat the next time there s a gap in their boss s diary they might think of you perseverance is key i spent a year on research and development but by 2014 i realised i needed more money if i was going to continue it happened at a very tough time in my life my daughter lyla was 11 years old and her father my ex husband had just died at his funeral a friend said maybe the last thing you need right now is to be taking a big risk perhaps you should get a job and have some security i remember thinking i just can t give up on this idea perseverance is as important as passion as an entrepreneur you often have to ask yourself what am i prepared to do so i looked at every single one of my expenditures what was a necessity what was an indulgence i had a huge mortgage so i rented out my home and found a smaller place to live i sold my 20 year collection of designer clothes and raised 60 000 the money kept the business alive for another nine months enough time to prepare for a proper round of fundraising with investors don t dilute your vision i went to lots of investors and they all gave me different advice they d pull apart my idea and say why aren t you doing it like this from having total faith in my concept i started to question it one investor said the only people worth selling to online were millennials but i knew that with the right personalisation i could give older women the confidence to buy make up online too i knew these women i had spent decades working with them that knowledge supported me i realised that if i listened to every piece of advice it would dilute what i felt most passionate about part of my journey has been learning what advice to take on board and what to regard as simply one person s opinion i used visualisation exercises to stay focused so i imagined the trinny london products being made in the factory i imagined them being packed up and shipped i imagined a woman using the make up for the first time and it giving her confidence if you start doubting yourself it helps to think of all the benefits your business will deliver to your future customers have a really clear vision of what you want to achieve it s that little shift in mindset that will help you convince other people that it can work setbacks get less scary the first prototype of the trinny london stack was appalling it looked cheap and clunky it was a horrible moment and i actually cried but i kept going eleven prototypes later we got it right the setbacks don t stop even when things are going well last year we had an early version of our mascara ready to launch we were very busy and a couple of things fell through the cracks the outside of the mascara tube hadn t been sealed properly so all the decoration and branding rubbed off we had to dump 50 000 worth of stock it was a financial blow but i knew it was the right decision bringing out a product that wasn t high quality would damage the brand in the long run for the first few years you re in business you worry over every decision it was only recently that i felt confident the business wouldn t disappear overnight because of one wrong move when i started trinny london it felt like i was walking a tightrope 20 feet off the ground today it s more like two feet i don t have so far to fall now i have a strong foundation to keep growing the business got a bright idea here s how to get it out of your head and on to the kitchen table trinny woodall check out your idea on google if it exists how are you going to do it differently step 1 find out if it exists check it out on google do a minimum of seven searches if it s already out there don t panic how are you going to do it differently step 2 check your concept ask a couple of friends would you use this tell me truthfully then ask someone you re not as close to such as a neighbour or acquaintance can i pitch you something and you tell me what you think if a few people say i would use that it gives you a bit of momentum step 3 consider funding where might you start do you want to put in your own savings can you take a bank loan if you have friends or work contacts willing to invest look into the government s seed enterprise investment scheme seis it allows individuals to claim 50 per cent tax relief if they invest in your start up the secrets of social media success trinny woodall if anyone leaves a comment on my channels i like it and respond have a conversation social media is an essential part of any business launch although the algorithms that power them are complicated they tend to promote channels where there is strong engagement with followers if anyone leaves a comment on my channels i like it and respond the more you can create a two way interaction the better be your true self what s your true self it s when you feel most passionate and emotive that s what cuts through when someone speaks from the heart my social channels started gaining traction when i switched from posting posed photos to making videos where i chatted about something that i loved and felt excited about create a community when starting out lots of small brands post things like the first 20 people to share this can get a free product it s quite a commercial approach to gaining followers but it can become a race to the bottom instead consider what feelings you want people to associate with your brand rather than chasing numbers build a community that people want to be part of and that reflects the ethos of your business how to nail a pitch when meeting

if you ve been following the headlines over the past few days you could be forgiven for thinking we re heading for some sort of financial armageddon the doomsters are out in force warning of a cost of living catastrophe hurtling towards us in april the resolution foundation think tank says families will see 1 200 added to annual bills because of soaring gas prices and looming rises in national insurance it is true that we face steep inflation that has worrying echoes of the 1970s and it is vital that we protect the poorest and most vulnerable from serious financial shocks as the boss of age uk points out on page 6 we cannot allow a situation where elderly people turn off their heating in a panic over surging bills but the hard facts about britain s economy and our remarkable bounce back from the ravages of lockdown tell a very different story to the one those determined to talk down britain would have you believe the resolution foundation think tank says families will see 1 200 added to annual bills because of soaring gas prices and looming rises in national insurance stock image let me explain to start with we have a stronger job market than at any time in most people s lives certainly since i began work in the 1960s the most recent official statistics show there are more job vacancies than ever before in our history more than 1 2 million to be precise meanwhile it is true that consumer inflation at 5 1 per cent is already a real concern and will go higher but it is equally true that average earnings are up in real terms that is after allowing for inflation by 3 1 per cent year on year next take overall growth the key driver of jobs prosperity living standards and so on in this country there were many reports that the uk was one of the hardest hit by the pandemic the international monetary fund imf for example reported our economy shrinking by nearly ten per cent in 2020 that may be true though we often find years later that the stats were wrong but the imf also expects growth in 2021 to have been 6 8 per cent if that turns out to be right it would be the fastest growth since 1941 furthermore the imf expects five per cent growth this year to start with we have a stronger job market than at any time in most people s lives certainly since i began work in the 1960s the most recent official statistics show there are more job vacancies than ever before in our history more than 1 2 million to be precise stock image you start to see the point i hope the economic picture depends on which aspect you look at and in britain there is a tendency at least among a sizable chunk of our society to focus on the negative rather than the positive on that score we are not alone many people across the developed world albeit less so in booming china and india display a similar negativity bias and the better educated people are the stronger that bias seems to be steven pinker the bestselling canadian professor of cognitive psychology gives us a clue to why his research identified a form of intellectual one upmanship in complaining about modern society say things are getting worse and you are seen as a sage say they are getting better and you are classed at best as naive and at worst as a fool whatever the reason for our pessimism the plain truth is that it is often absurd and almost always deeply paralysing if everything is terrible you can t fix things that need fixing because you don t know where to start that is not to defend blind optimism and there have to be real concerns that financial markets may have become over optimistic with the ftse 100 roaring to its best year since 2016 it is simply to say that we should look at the world economy and britain s place in it with a calm and balanced eye and ignore anyone who twists the data to score political points in the coming year i think there will be three big themes that dominate our economy one is that the world is still in the early stages of its recovery from the carnage caused by covid 19 that is positive the second is that there is the gnawing problem of inflation that is negative and third there are huge structural shifts taking place as the world adjusts to a post pandemic economy and the uk to a post brexit one that i hope will on balance be a positive for britain the recovery point is simple the world is still putting everything back together again and that will take several years but after a serious recession and my word we have had that there are always several years of decent growth interspersed with bumps along the way the bank of england has started to raise interest rates and the federal reserve in america and the european central bank will do the same file image for the uk as one of the most open economies in the world to trade and investment this is important if the world has a good run and it is hard not to see this as a year of solid growth the uk will get its share of the expanding cake that five per cent growth the imf expects would be just fine inflation is a huge worry at a global level the uk inflation rate at 5 1 per cent is actually a little lower than germany s 5 2 per cent and a lot lower than the 6 8 per cent in the us the bank of england has started to raise interest rates and the federal reserve in america and the european central bank will do the same but it would be daft to assume the odd quarter point on interest rates will hold things down when energy prices are soaring the bank of england cannot do anything to cut your gas bill although the government can and might and saying this is a global issue does not help anyone on a fixed income particularly pensioners the best hope is that by the end of this year the inflation pressure will have eased a little and pay rates have kept rising as they are at the moment eventually inflation will be brought under control meanwhile the thing to do will be to focus on helping those hardest hit that could mean extra support with bills for the elderly and hard up or cutting taxes where it helps to quell the storm meanwhile the thing to do will be to focus on helping those hardest hit that could mean extra support with bills for the elderly and hard up or cutting taxes where it helps to quell the storm file image and the third big feature of this year the wave of structural changes raging across the world it is hard when you are in the middle of a revolution to see what is transient and what will be permanent but we do know that some of the shift to online retailing will stick the high street will recover but we will go on ordering stuff and having it delivered as well we will go on to some extent at least working remotely more often than we used to foreign travel will recover but only in fits and starts and i suspect business travel will be radically reduced all we know for certain is that businesses large and small have not only proved very resilient in the face of chaos they have also learnt new and more efficient ways of working so as the chaos retreats there will be net gains to efficiency we are learning to do things differently and better that also applies to trade with europe it does look as though exports to the eu have held up while imports have fallen it certainly has not been the disaster we were warned about though for some industries the shift has been tough the important thing is that year two of the post brexit transition will be easier than year one and that is surely the big point about 2022 the world has been coping with tough times and in the main coping pretty darned well the uk is coping pretty well too my judgment is that it will continue to do so

montezuma castle is a national monument located in the western us state of arizona although the name of the monument suggests a connection with the aztecs montezuma castle was in fact built by the sinagua a pre columbian culture that lived in the area moreover the monument is not a castle but a cliff dwelling consisting of several levels montezuma castle is located near the town of camp verde in arizona in the mid 1860s the first american settlers arrived in the verde valley and montezuma castle was declared a national monument in 1906 one of the first in the usa these 19th century settlers also gave the monument its present name the story goes that some of these settlers were veterans of the mexican american war and may have seen action in mexico city the former capital of the aztec empire apparently the structure reminded these veterans of the aztec buildings they saw in mexico assuming that what they saw was built by the aztecs they named it after montezuma who lost the empire to the spanish the sinagua montezuma castle however was not at all related to the aztecs in fact it was built by the sinagua a pre columbiannative american culture that inhabited the area curiously the name sinagua means without water in spanish though it is unknown why the culture was named as such the sinagua also left behind petroglyphs such as these gittinsj cc by sa 3 0 the sinagua built montezuma castle between 1100 and 1350 ad and occupied it until 1425 ad during their occupation of the site the sinagua left behind various materials and artifacts which allowed archaeologists today to gain some insight into this culture the archaeological evidence suggests that the sinagua relied on both hunting gathering and agriculture for their subsistence regarding the latter they grew primarily maize squash and beans practical and ornamental toolsrecovered from montezuma castle also suggest that the sinagua were skilled craftsmen moreover many of the artefacts found at the site were determined to be of a foreign origin this suggests that the sinagua were accomplished traders and that montezuma castle was a bustling trade center during its heyday montezuma castle the most visible accomplishment of the sinagua people nevertheless was montezuma castle itself this monumental structure is situated about two thirds of the way up a 45 7 m 150 ft high limestone cliff montezuma castle is therefore considered as a cliff dwelling montezuma castle is a five story pueblo with a floor space of about 381 m2 4100 ft2 the sinagua constructed the walls of montezuma castle using limestone and mud mortar the walls at the base of the structure were found to be 61 cm 2 ft thick narrowing to half that thickness by the time they reached the top the roof of the pueblo was framed by large beams covered by smaller beams and subsequently covered with thatch and mud sideplan of the structures at montezuma castle over five levels us national park service public domain it is still a mystery as to why the sinagua abandoned montezuma castle by 1425 and various speculations have been made one of these for instance suggests that overpopulation led to a depletion of the local resources which ultimately forced the sinagua to leave another suggests that high levels of arsenic in their water source led them to seek other sites for habitation after the sinaguans left montezuma castle was first inhabited by other native americans before the arrival of the american settlers during the mid 1860s over the centuries montezuma castle was protected from deterioration thanks to the low humidity and the fact that it is built in an alcove in the cliff face which sheltered it from the elements the arrival of white settlers however threatened the survival of the structure once the site became known to the americans montezuma castle attracted various individuals from amateur archaeologists to looters who ransacked the place consequently the structure was weakened and towards the end of the 19th century montezuma castle was in danger of crumbling saved from destruction fortunately in 1897 the arizona antiquarian society fortified the structure and repaired montezuma castle to the best of their ability thereby rescuing it from destruction in june 1906 the american antiquities act was signed and later that year montezuma castle was declared a national monument by president theodore roosevelt the site is one of the four original national monuments declared by roosevelt montezuma castle s status as a national monument ensured its protection by the state visitors can no longer climb to the monument itself danita delimont adobe stock today the site of montezuma castle is open to the public and formal ranger tours as well as a self guided loop trail are offered since 1951 however visitors have not been allowed to climb up to the national monument so as to minimize further damage to montezuma castle top image montezuma castle photo source pamela au adobe stock by wu mingren
washington cnn democratic lawmakers say president joe biden s hands are partly tied when it comes to sending new military equipment to ukraine to fend off a potential russian invasion because congress has still not passed a budget for 2022 that would unlock vital additional assistance to the country in a letter to senate minority leader mitch mcconnell and senate appropriations vice chairman sen richard shelby on monday democratic house reps tom malinowski steve cohen gerald connolly and marcy kaptur urged republicans to come to the table to hash out the 2022 appropriations bill in part because doing so is necessary to unlock vital additional assistance to ukraine at a moment when russian forces are massing on its borders threatening an invasion state department officials expressed similar concerns in a briefing to the house foreign affairs committee last week and members came away concerned by the possibility that ukraine could be left increasingly vulnerable if a new spending bill isn t passed soon rep malinowski told cnn as you know the administration is maximizing its ability to deliver essential military hardware to the ukrainians in the face of putin s brinksmanship the lawmakers wrote in the letter but the administration could begin to do much more with the increased assistance designated in fy22 appropriations for ukraine as long as we continue to operate on a continuing resolution the president s hands are partly tied they added limited to providing equipment already in stock or in the pipeline and unable to use the millions of additional dollars that congress has designated to support ukraine s self defense the administration last week transferred the final elements of a 60 million security assistance package to ukraine that biden approved earlier this year pentagon spokesman john kirby said during a press briefing last wednesday the assistance included small arms and ammunition that were set to arrive in the country late last week the national defense authorization act passed last week authorized roughly 300 million for additional security assistance to ukraine but those funds still need to be appropriated the lawmakers wrote that the fy22 appropriations package would complement already flowing emergency aid and allow the administration to send more anti tank weapons for ukrainian soldiers facing down russian tanks more grenade launchers to take on russian attack helicopters more night vision systems to deal with putin s little green men as well as enhanced air defense and anti ship systems us european and ukrainian officials have been sounding the alarm for weeks over a major russian troop buildup near the ukrainian border that secretary of state antony blinken warned could be a rehash of russia s invasion of ukraine in 2014 in a virtual meeting with russian president vladimir putin last week biden warned of severe consequences should russia move to attack ukraine again i made it absolutely clear to president putin that if he moves on ukraine the economic consequences for his economy are going to be devastating devastating biden told reporters on friday

see a shark there it was probably one of the most terrifying experiences of my life said harvey clark director of animal care and professor of shark biology at dalhousie university the water was colder than what sharks usually favour and the nearest colony of seals sharks favoured meal was a kilometre away and yet there it was as soon as i saw the tail disappear i knew it was a great white we went down and the water was really murky so we couldn t see much as we were just deciding to head back to the boat i looked up and saw this huge tail disappearing just out of sight in the murky water maybe 30 feet away as soon as i saw the tail disappear i knew it was a great white i tried to get my buddy s attention but he was looking in the opposite direction i started banging on my tank to get his attention when the shark passed by again my buddy still didn t hear it was on that pass i got a good look at the animal it was a 10 foot long untagged female it just kind of cruised along slowly and looked at me then disappeared again when it came back for a third pass my buddy saw it and we both couldn t believe our eyes we both couldn t believe what we had seen and how close the shark had gotten i gave him the signal and we took off for the boat both of us knew that this was not a safe situation for nova scotians such sightings are becoming a kind of new normal sharks aren t everywhere but it suddenly seems they could be due to historically high seal populations the gulf stream conservation efforts and the twitter feed of a shark named hilton that was tagged and tracked to nova scotia by researchers advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content 12ft 1326lbs white shark hiltontheshark continues to ping off cape sable island nova scotia pic twitter com hfuk4btdoe ocearch ocearch november 18 2017 hilton one of over 100 sharks tagged by scientists at american non profit ocearch takes a charming tone for his 46 000 followers ocearch sees social media as a fun way to raise awareness about sharks as well as work to educate the public about them but great whites maintain their menace on aug 13 2021 taylor boudreau deveaux 21 went swimming with friends off a boat about a half mile west of margaree island off cape breton when she was bitten by a shark she was rushed to surgery in halifax with serious injuries to her legs and thighs family members have told reporters she is recovering but boudreau deveaux did not respond to interview requests i followed the story of taylor s attack very closely i even reached out to the investigating officer of the rcmp to try and get in touch with her harvey clark said the place where taylor and her friends were swimming was by a deep water site a drop off and there was a nearby island with seals on it sharks can be found in that kind of an area it was the first reported shark attack on a human in nova scotia since a woman was knocked overboard in 1891 advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content recommended from editorial husband leaps onto great white shark rains down punches saves wife during australian attack the killer whale has unseated the great white shark as the ocean s most feared predator study finds frederick whoriskey the executive director of the ocean tracking network at dalhousie university said shark attacks are rare he estimates there were three attacks in the u s the last 10 years under similar conditions to boudreau deveaux it s tended to be people that are swimming in the offshore areas isolated on their own around seals it s not like the sharks are actively developing the taste for and are attacking people preferentially if they were we wouldn t be talking about three attacks every 10 years there were conservation efforts to bring the great white shark back from the brink of extinction decades ago so most of the great whites we see now are in their sub adolescent phase where they are feeding on fish and around 10 feet long as they get bigger and more powerful they begin to move on to larger more energetic prey like seals as adolescents they have to figure out what makes good prey and what doesn t so they begin experimenting if one comes across a swimmer it looks like good prey to the adolescent shark so they will take a test bite as more of the population comes into this phase there is a chance that we will see more bites occurring whoriskey explained advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content if one comes across a swimmer it looks like good prey to the adolescent shark so they will take a test bite as well whoriskey said oceans are warming causing more people to go into the water and for later in the year and the anti sealing movement has shrunk the east coast seal hunt and led to historically high levels of grey seal and harbour seal populations i think the estimate is 20 000 or 30 000 grey seals although depending on who you talk to some say it is 200 000 seals either way it is far above what it was 33 years ago harvey clark said harvey clark agrees with whoriskey in that there will be an increase in shark interactions but with a different theory the whole reason they re coming north is food and their main food source is seals so as long as canada s got historically high seal populations specifically on the east coast and as long as we have white sharks being conserved and not actively fished i think we will see an increasing trend of spotting white sharks up here and probably sooner or later we may see an impact on seal populations as well he said christine murphy an owner of the tuna blue inn in hubbards n s hasn t changed her relationship with the water but her husband has and it s due to boudreau deveaux s attack advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content their inn overlooks the picturesque hubbards harbour near one of nova scotia s most popular swimming beaches hubbards beach i am a regular swimmer in the ocean my entire life i have been swimming and i never thought about sharks the attack in august shows us that they are around but it hasn t changed my routine i still jump off the boat and go swimming but my husband won t he will religiously check the tracking sites and he will go out on the boat with us but he is terrified to jump into the water murphy says photo by stock image although murphy has never seen a shark in her 55 years of swimming she says there is now an interest around town about sharks where there wasn t previously people go out on their boat and go fishing and they are always talking about how seeing a shark would be great but they never see one some tourists even come into the area in the hopes of seeing one there is more interest than fear i would say tagged sharks visit that stretch of nova scotia s south shore fairly often according to ocearch s shark trackers its website allows for visitors to see where in the world the tagged sharks are as well as where they have been in the past 24 hours including the distance they have travelled advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there are definitely people who don t go swimming in the ocean as much as they used to and won t go as far out or they will stick to the beaches where they didn t before murphy says whoriskey though said it is important to keep perspective we are talking about an average of about 60 attacks a year compare that to the 500 crocodile attacks every year across the globe and the 120 people killed by falling coconuts a year we are talking about an average of about 60 attacks a year compare that to the 500 crocodile attacks every year across the globe and the 120 people killed by falling coconuts a year some kind of perspective is needed to understand the nature of what this actually is he likens the ocean to a forest wilderness we are never alone in there we know that when we are walking into a national park quite often we know there are very large potentially dangerous animals in there like wolves and bears and coyotes and we don t not go into the national parks and go for a hike what we do is we begin to take the measures these animals are living by the rules that they live by and they re powerful and they re predators and you need to be careful so the education component of what we want to do now and to try to get those messages out to people to remember that this is stepping into the wilderness and there are predators in the ocean

the new year ushered in a new day in montana with the prohibition on recreational cannabis sales left behind in 2021 seventeen years after medical marijuana providers and patients started blazing the path recreational cannabis sales opened to the general public saturday some dispensaries in helena had lines of people packed inside to avoid cold temperatures while others saw a small but steady stream of foot traffic through noon heidi morris a budtender at the higher standard said about two thirds of saturday s customers at her location in helena weren t familiar with the finer points of cannabis yet but at the cannabis corner j d pepper petersen the owner and one of the front men for the legalization campaign in 2020 said the large majority of customers had done their research it s about time said frank harris 57 after leaving the treasure tree dispensary on one of helena s busier thoroughfares harris lives in white sulphur springs in meagher county which is a red county the regulatory structure passed by the legislature in 2021 banned recreational cannabis sales in the counties that voted against legalization in the 2020 election like meagher county possession and consumption of recreational cannabis has been legal statewide for a year now following the passage of initiative 190 in 2020 the governor s office of budget and program planning projected 130 million in recreational sales in 2022 climbing to 195 5 million in 2023 once the moratorium on new businesses ends about 58 of voters approved recreational cannabis use in montana but a few customers saturday said the stigma against cannabis is still prevalent a helena man named mark didn t want to give his name because of some family members who are not too cool with it although he hopes that fades in the coming years he like others who braved the frigid day said they feel cannabis is less destructive than alcohol but remains taboo despite a majority of montanans voting for it mark was never a medical marijuana cardholder but said he s been toking marijuana since the 1970s when he and his friends would get high by the beaverhead river it never should have been criminalized he said if they give it to cancer patients that tells you all you need to know another customer jeff radke 39 said the stigma against weed may last a few more decades but he s glad to see low level marijuana crimes taken off the books as for how radke thinks about the next generation he s been talking with his teenagers about cannabis the entire year leading up to recreational sales nothing makes it less attractive to your kids than you being involved radke said brisk business saturday was the moment of truth for many who have made marijuana their livelihood in missoula jj thomas owner of the higher standard said it s not been an easy venture i m thankful for everything thankful for my health to be able to do this because it s taken a toll on me and my family to build all these stores and get here but it was a dream i had he said i m hoping to create a legacy for my family petersen estimated 99 of customers through the cannabis corner by noon were buying recreational as opposed to medical product petersen headed up new approach montana the 2020 campaign to legalize recreational cannabis in the state he said he s excited for montanans who have held out on registering as a medical marijuana patient because they refused to be listed in a database we ve all been counting down to this he said an hour after opening its doors the parking lot at lionheart caregiving in yellowstone county still overflowed with vehicles customers sat in their cars bracing against temperatures that hovered just a few degrees above zero until stepping inside the dispensary to join the line because most of the medical marijuana cardholders had stocked up on their monthly allotment allowed by the state in preparation for a surge saturday many of those in line were stepping into lionheart for the first time among those waiting to show an employee his id was chris powell until saturday he d made monthly trips to colorado where recreational marijuana has been legal since 2012 for years the wyoming man has used cannabis to supplement the medications prescribed for his back after two surgeries he still suffers from pain and muscle cramps between pills or pot he said he absolutely prefers marijuana i m definitely happy it s finally available here in montana i feel like it s just like booze in that people should be able to enjoy it so long as it s in a safe and controlled way i m grateful for it and it s about time he said powell said the 1 ounce legally available to him will last him about a month and he ll be able to save time and money driving to montana rather than colorado litigation lingers several areas of the state have seen providers take to the courts in response to local ordinances officials put in place ahead of recreational sales rules meant to either foster new business or push it further out of view about half of the providers in bozeman sued the city in late november to reinstate a 20 storefront cap that the city commission voted to lift within city limits yellowstone public radio reported on thursday a district court judge sided with the city which can begin accepting new license applications in one of fastest growing places in the state in october yellowstone county began developing restrictions on marijuana sales and production in certain areas in the county effectively barring nearly a dozen providers from selling recreational cannabis saturday the green bee and its owner neil kiner sued the county planning division and the yellowstone county commission kiner argued he had hired additional staff expanded his hours of operation and invested in new equipment at a cost of nearly 100 000 that would all be squandered if the new restrictions went into place on thursday judge greg todd signed an order temporarily allowing the green bee to be open to the public for recreational sales without threat of violating the county s restrictions and setting a hearing on the case for jan 20 business has been wonderful today kiner said saturday a lot of our business has been rec customers so it s just really really great not to have to turn them away a few providers did not open saturday as a measure to mete out product wary that inventories won t last the wave of new customers the only providers allowed to sell recreational cannabis are those that were medical marijuana providers on or before nov 3 2020 that means in order to protect medical patients access to cannabis providers are telling patients to stock up while raising their prices on recreational sales lacee monique owner of kannatonic dispensary in butte said saturday afternoon that recreational business has been steady not too crazy all day this is totally a test run day she said i had no idea what to expect how many people how many buying cannabis as opposed to edibles monique said it felt totally surreal to be able to sell to people without medical cards monique has been in the medical marijuana business for 12 years and she s vertically integrated we grow in whitehall she said we re seed to sale she said the new business is great and she s happy recreational pot is legal but my medical customers are always going to get taken care of first she said if she s ever in a situation where her inventory is down i might not sell any recreational that day because i want to make sure i have product for my medical customers in the first four hours of the day monique said we ve had 28 recreational customers but not as many medical as usual a lot of them probably decided to stay away today because they didn t want to be in the big crush corey baker a medical customer took the opposite approach i was curious to see how it was going so i came down he said baker has been a customer as long as kannatonic has been open he has chronic arthritis and has had multiple ankle surgeries it means i don t have to be on opioids he said those don t always work and they re dangerous but the cannabis always works i ve never had a time since i got my card 12 years ago when it didn t help a former surgical tech monique said she got into the business because she understood the value of helping people with medical needs my mom didn t speak to me for four years she said my parents were so worried about me but now they re totally supportive they see it s a good legal business that helps people i give my mom salve for her knee and my grandma gets cookies to help her sleep even now to me it s more about the medicinal value i m not here to just get you f ed up unless of course that s what you want at starrbuds in missoula co owner jill broughton said marijuana flower concentrates and pre rolled joints were selling quickly while many customers had questions about other products a lot of customers were surprised to find cannabis is a cash only business oh yeah people are like whoa is this real and like some people were wanting this to happen 40 years ago so it s been a long time coming photos recreational cannabis sales open across montana
puppy mills are one of the more hideous things we do to our companion animals several states have outlawed them california being one pet stores are not allowed to sell pups from puppy mills does this stop puppy mills from proliferating in california hell no people run puppy mills out of their homes and sell the pups online usually on craigslist craigslist has a no animal sales rule do they enforce it again hell no people enter zero dollars in the price field and several thousand dollars in the description puppy mill moms spend their entire life living out a nightmare packed into cages touched only when they are forced to breed or be inseminated i have pictures and stories that would bring anyone with a soul to tears i will not post them the only people who need that crap in their heads are people who buy puppies online or in pet stores and i cannot figure out how to specifically target those people if i could i would we must end puppy mills the legal mills and the illegal mills if you cannot meet the mom walk away it is not about the puppy it is about the mom and sometimes the dad if you have amish in your state you have puppy mills barns full of dogs who live in cramped cages in the cold and dark the amish do not use electricity and they are not going to waste a generator on the comfort of breeding stock from stoponlinepuppymills org they live in often overcrowded stacked cages the cages legally only have to be six inches larger than the dogs the dogs spend their lives in these cages their only purpose is to produce puppies they are force bred at every heat cycle they receive little to no veterinarian care as vet care costs money and takes away from profit they are denied the basic physical and mental care needed to be a normal dog many shut down emotionally and are living and breeding with painful conditions this is why it is so important to see for yourself where your puppy was born i will post a picture of my tasha who spent nine years in a california cage as a breeder before they dumped her tash had a spectacular after most puppy mill moms do not she looks like a death camp survivor in her before picture thulani senior german shepherd rescue brought her to me these are some of the best people in the world they take the ones no one wants and they commit to them for life with veterinary care tasha climbed cautiously out of their van and gave me a look that broke my heart she was scared to hope she had lived through nine long years of unspeakable things something had changed people had been kind to her something was changing again her look said it all do i have to go back in a cage i took her head in my hands and told her you are home for good girl i will love you and protect you always she clearly understood the tone her eyes changed for three years that dog was focused on me one hundred percent of the time i have copd tasha alerted when my oxygen saturation dropped i took a shower the tip of her nose was in the shower curtain tasha knew that when my machine beeped i had to go plug in to the car we were having coffee with someone and my machine beeped i stood up and told him i ve got to go i have one minute of oxygen left he kept talking tasha barked at him and then pulled me out the door a group of scientists familiarized dogs with mri machines then did brain scans dogs have the same level of activity in the same regions of the brain as a five year old human child dogs can learn up to two hundred and fifty words anyone with a dog knows that you must spell certain words then the dog figures out the spelling they are sentient creatures they all matter every dog every cat not just the one sitting in your lap we have so divorced ourselves from the earth we live on there is a lakota phrase mitakuye oyasin meaning all my relations two legged four legged winged growing things water we cannot injure one part of the web and not expect it to destroy the integrity of the whole of the web we can not fill the ocean with chemicals and junk plastic and not expect it to come back on us at some point the earth will shake us off like fleas i predict that the next dominant species will be radioactive octopuses we have open radioactive sludge ponds in malaysia bigger than central park from mining for rare earth minerals for our gadgets there is no question that they will hit the ocean at some point during monsoon season if they have not already our first people know how connected we are it would not occur to a native american to see a creature in pain shrug and walk off we do it constantly we just close our eyes so we do not have to see it in the first place the united states is locked into a relentless cycle of breeding and killing our companion animals over one and one half million dogs and cats were euthanized last year in the u s each one a sentient creature that knows fear that knows loss that suffers alone in a cage before being put down by a stranger sacramento shelters are so overwhelmed with unwanted pets that they are refusing to take owner surrenders people who were eager to grab a puppy or a kitten are confronted with a dog or cat they did not want after all occasionally they do the right thing and rehome them responsibly most often they just want to be rid of the animal free to good home dogs are picked up by the sisters and girlfriends of dog fighters and used as bait dogs cats are turned out into fields someone called me a while back who picked up a dog she has seen pushed out of a car on the freeway at least the driver slowed down how did we get here where we are willing to turn our backs on millions of sentient creatures in misery we see those commercials with the shivering dogs the ones no one can stand to watch send 19 95 a month and close our eyes to the whole thing we need to address the relentless breeding to put a halt to the relentless misery every animal altered equals dozens to hundreds to thousands of animals that will not exist to be abandoned german shepherd dogs are another cash crop although not as lucrative people buy a german shepherd pup toss it in the backyard and decide they have a guard dog i have seen gsds who have lived in backyards for years largely ignored again dogs are every bit the pack animals that humans are they guard you because they love you a neglected dog will look at someone coming through the fence as a would be savior i know i have been the one coming through the fence i have turned myself in once i have gotten the dog emergency surgery or done whatever the spca and animal control would not do not once has someone wanted their property back not when there is a vet bill attached to it someone called once wanting their gsd cujo neutered cujo was eight years old i asked the gentleman why now i said yes i always say yes he had gotten a barking ticket and would have to pay less if cujo was neutered the man was outraged when i suggested bringing cujo in the house so he did not bark and howl all night he said it s a dog like he was describing something filthy he said he was keeping him in the garage alone i asked me veterinarian to give me a head s up on cujo s condition she texted me a picture of a dejected terrified dog severely malnourished i frantically looked for a home a good home for an older dog is gold people want puppies until they turn into dogs it is estimated that one out of every seven puppies will end up in a good forever home the rest everything from being passed from one person to another until they end up in a cage waiting to be euthanized to neglect and abuse to situations that do not bear thinking about if a breeder goes to extreme lengths to ensure the pups are placed in good homes that number would be seven out of seven do home checks have the new owner sign a contract saying the dog will come back if they ever must give that dog up rescues do this reputable rescues not puppy mills pretending to be rescues i found the golden home i then tried to figure out how to get this guy s guard dog in the end i called and asked him if i could have his dog he said sure i had asked my vet to send a bag of dog food home with the dog the guy tried to give it back to me unopened he simply did not care if his dog ate or not it was a dog my friend glenda went with me to pick up not cujo that name ended as soon as he got in the car the dog was frantic i would not have been able to take him to his new home if glenda had not wrapped him in her sweater and held him and talked to him not cujo was starved starved for love starved for food when we got to his new home he ran right past the food and threw his forelegs around his new dad s waist love me please love me it was the second most profound thing i have ever seen the first was when tasha realized she had reason to hope this is doug formerly cujo his mom could not love him more and you can see this dog feels that he is worlds away from the pitiful creature huddled at my vet s dogs know they know love they know loss they know when they spend their existence in a cramped dark cage they also know when they have the good fortune to be rescued only to be held as evidence at the animal shelter dogs are not evidence pictures and videotapes are evidence you will not see the dogs being held as evidence at the shelter they are locked away in small runs no contact no bed no toys neglected and abused by the very agencies that are charged with caring for them my burt was pulled by the police for severe neglect and abuse he spent the next few months locked in a back room at an animal shelter alone covered in garbage and water deprived burt is living the dream now but it took a year before he allowed anyone but me to touch him burt is my knight in furry armor people say do not hold a dog s eyes they consider it a threat my magic thulani dogs hold my eyes i lay in burt s dog bed with him for a bit when we migrate to the bedroom and we look into each other s eyes mark looks in and says you weirdo i say my therapist said i could call this a tool when you save a dog they save you back with everything they have in them i am working on a speculative fiction novel shimmer that will fix all of this animals will get what they deserve humans will get exactly what they ask for the earth will take itself back the black hills will swallow that hideous paperweight and spit out people who are not willing to live by the principles of mitakuye oyasin real life not so easy our children do not study true history the great shame of our nation is what we have done what we

graveyards as late as the 1970s beaten to death for speaking their own language dakota sioux must apply for permits and pay fees to pray on the sacred ground that we promised them and then took from them that is not right reservations have been regulated into poverty a native man named ishi was the last of his tribe in the early 1900s european settlers exterminated the rest of his tribe they were

that up do we really want to be the world leader on prison inmate production our foster care system is rarely anything but a mill that produces inmates drug addicts and homeless people we have hundreds of thousands of kids on the streets i used to take 12 step meetings into juvenile hall a kid s first crime was usually running from placement no one asks them why they ran we do not have enough social workers to respond to even emergency calls we need children s villages where kids can safely grow into people stop putting them back into homes where their caretakers are selling them for dime bags that would be a safety net though and we hate those those in power care deeply for life from conception until birth that care is suspended until a kid is old enough to arrest or join the

pictures that would convince you that i am a young mother with twelve starving children i am not if judges in your state are slapping dog fighter s wrists tell them you want heavy sentences keep telling them if your state allows puppy mills talk loudly about outlawing them keep talking spay and neuter massive studies out of the netherlands have proven eight weeks to be the optimal age the surgery is easier on them and the hormone factory has not turned on a couple of studies out of uc davis have set progress back decades they showed that altering early caused joint problems what most veterinarians did not notice in the fine print was that the dogs studied were breeders who were altered because joint trouble ran in their bloodline they were already prone to it some very large breed dogs can lose a bit of bone density if altered early i have never known a large breed dog to spontaneously break a bone chihuahuas are the ones who break bones trying to get down from whatever someone has set them on i have friends in rescue who foster puppies they stay in touch with many of the adopters the dogs who live the longest and have the best health were altered at eight weeks do you really need to breed your dog just once unless you spay and neuter the pups do homechecks and get contracts signed saying the dog will come back to you if they ever must give it up your dog will have descendants that sit terrified in a cage waiting to be put down by a stranger papers does not matter when someone wants to get rid of a dog they do not care that it has papers people who care about papers generally want a puppy living in a cage for nine years was not kind to tasha s joints she was near crippled when she came to me the dog park is rehab for all of us i realized how much better tash was moving when she sailed through the open window of the car at the dog park if you have an unneutered male you have a dog with a biological imperative telling him that it is more important to reproduce than survive i watched a small dog almost get his throat ripped out the other day because he would not quit mounting even after getting snapped at i stand between my dogs and anyone who tries to mount them at the dog park now i have backed off growling rotties i learned an extremely large dog mounted tasha at the dog park after she had healed and flattened her she was screaming i could not get him off her his owner and i finally dragged him off his owner screaming that it was a public park and she did not have to neuter her dog i could not protect my girl it still kills me that dog damaged her hip her hip finally completely gave out a year ago she screamed all the way to the vet because i could not protect my dog from a burmese mountain dog whose owner could not be bothered to neuter him for whatever reason my precious girl spent her last moments on this earth in agony i loved that dog more than life itself i would give anything to trade places to take that pain from her i feel her as a soft space inside of me in my fondest dream i will run with my pack when i go please help me protect these precious creatures alone i am a voice in the wind i swear shimmer will be funny it will not be as depressing as some of my blogs turn out

in recreational sales in 2022 climbing to 195 5 million in 2023 once the moratorium on new businesses ends about 58 of voters approved recreational cannabis use in montana but a few customers saturday said the stigma against cannabis is still prevalent a helena man named mark didn t want to give his name because of some family members who are not too cool with it although he hopes that fades in the coming years he like others who braved the frigid day said they feel cannabis is less destructive than alcohol but remains taboo despite a majority of montanans voting for it mark was never a medical marijuana cardholder but said he s been toking marijuana since the 1970s when he and his friends would get high by the beaverhead river it never should have been criminalized he said if they give it to cancer patients that tells you all you need to know another customer jeff radke 39 said the stigma against weed may last a few more decades but he s glad to see low level marijuana crimes taken off the books as for how radke thinks about the next generation he s been talking with his teenagers about cannabis the entire year leading up to recreational sales nothing makes it less attractive to your kids than you being involved radke said brisk business saturday was the moment of truth for many who have made marijuana their livelihood in missoula jj thomas owner of the higher standard said it s not been an easy venture i m thankful for everything thankful for my health to be able to do this because it s taken a toll on me and my family to build all these stores and get here but it was a dream i had he said i m hoping to create a legacy for my family petersen estimated 99 of customers through the cannabis corner by noon were buying recreational as opposed to medical product petersen headed up new approach montana the 2020 campaign to legalize recreational cannabis in the state he said he s excited for montanans who have held out on registering as a medical marijuana patient because they refused to be listed in a database we ve all been counting down to this he said an hour after opening its doors the parking lot at lionheart caregiving in yellowstone county still overflowed with vehicles customers sat in their cars bracing against temperatures that hovered just a few degrees above zero until stepping inside the dispensary to join the line because most of the medical marijuana cardholders had stocked up on their monthly allotment allowed by the state in preparation for a surge saturday many of those in line were stepping into lionheart for the first time among those waiting to show an employee his id was chris powell until saturday he d made monthly trips to colorado where recreational marijuana has been legal since 2012 for years the wyoming man has used cannabis to supplement the medications prescribed for his back after two surgeries he still suffers from pain and muscle cramps between pills or pot he said he absolutely prefers marijuana i m definitely happy it s finally available here in montana i feel like it s just like booze in that people should be able to enjoy it so long as it s in a safe and controlled way i m grateful for it and it s about time he said powell said the 1 ounce legally available to him will last him about a month and he ll be able to save time and money driving to montana rather than colorado litigation lingers several areas of the state have seen providers take to the courts in response to local ordinances officials put in place ahead of recreational sales rules meant to either foster new business or push it further out of view about half of the providers in bozeman sued the city in late november to reinstate a 20 storefront cap that the city commission voted to lift within city limits yellowstone public radio reported on thursday a district court judge sided with the city which can begin accepting new license applications in one of fastest growing places in the state in october yellowstone county began developing restrictions on marijuana sales and production in certain areas in the county effectively barring nearly a dozen providers from selling recreational cannabis saturday the green bee and its owner neil kiner sued the county planning division and the yellowstone county commission kiner argued he had hired additional staff expanded his hours of operation and invested in new equipment at a cost of nearly 100 000 that would all be squandered if the new restrictions went into place on thursday judge greg todd signed an order temporarily allowing the green bee to be open to the public for recreational sales without threat of violating the county s restrictions and setting a hearing on the case for jan 20 business has been wonderful today kiner said saturday a lot of our business has been rec customers so it s just really really great not to have to turn them away a few providers did not open saturday as a measure to mete out product wary that inventories won t last the wave of new customers the only providers allowed to sell recreational cannabis are those that were medical marijuana providers on or before nov 3 2020 that means in order to protect medical patients access to cannabis providers are telling patients to stock up while raising their prices on recreational sales lacee monique owner of kannatonic dispensary in butte said saturday afternoon that recreational business has been steady not too crazy all day this is totally a test run day she said i had no idea what to expect how many people how many buying cannabis as opposed to edibles monique said it felt totally surreal to be able to sell to people without medical cards monique has been in the medical marijuana business for 12 years and she s vertically integrated we grow in whitehall she said we re seed to sale she said the new business is great and she s happy recreational pot is legal but my medical customers are always going to get taken care of first she said if she s ever in a situation where her inventory is down i might not sell any recreational that day because i want to make sure i have product for my medical customers in the first four hours of the day monique said we ve had 28 recreational customers but not as many medical as usual a lot of them probably decided to stay away today because they didn t want to be in the big crush corey baker a medical customer took the opposite approach i was curious to see how it was going so i came down he said baker has been a customer as long as kannatonic has been open he has chronic arthritis and has had multiple ankle surgeries it means i don t have to be on opioids he said those don t always work and they re dangerous but the cannabis always works i ve never had a time since i got my card 12 years ago when it didn t help a former surgical tech monique said she got into the business because she understood the value of helping people with medical needs my mom didn t speak to me for four years she said my parents were so worried about me but now they re totally supportive they see it s a good legal business that helps people i give my mom salve for her knee and my grandma gets cookies to help her sleep even now to me it s more about the medicinal value i m not here to just get you f ed up unless of course that s what you want at starrbuds in missoula co owner jill broughton said marijuana flower concentrates and pre rolled joints were selling quickly while many customers had questions about other products a lot of customers were surprised to find cannabis is a cash only business oh yeah people are like whoa is this real and like some people were wanting this to happen 40 years ago so it s been a long time coming

ryan downie the motley fool dividend stocks are an important part of most retirement portfolios these stocks have a unique set of features that are important for investors in their golden years don t ignore these three benefits when you re setting up your retirement plan 1 income cash flow is the name of the game in retirement planning you ll stop working one day but you won t stop spending money that void needs to be filled with income from new sources social security is the most important source of income for most retirees the average monthly benefit will be 1 657 in 2022 so many households will require more to meet their needs one third of people who retire today have pensions and those generally add 10 000 to 20 000 to annual cash flow you ll usually have to rely on your own investments for any additional income investment income usually comes from interest and dividends bonds are useful financial tools that pay interest at regular intervals and they re also popular among retirees because bond prices don t fluctuate as much as stocks dividend stocks also generate regular income streams but they still experience market volatility some companies decide to take their profits and distribute those to shareholders these are usually mature stable companies with limited growth potential they don t have to invest aggressively in product development new hires or corporate infrastructure freeing up more cash flow to the business instead of doing nothing with that cash they cut checks periodically to their investors retirees can own dividend stocks in their retirement accounts or in a brokerage account they ll kick off income that you can use to meet your basic needs and lifestyle goals right now reliable dividend yields are around 2 to 3 the daily money get our latest personal finance stories in your inbox 2 tax treatment taxes are an important part of investment planning but they re overlooked too often that s especially true for retirees for many investors dividends receive preferential tax treatment if you happen to have a roth ira you can enjoy tax free dividend income investment returns in a roth are distributed tax free prior to age 59 and a half including dividends you ll have to set up a roth using earned income prior to full retirement and you probably won t be able to make contributions after you stop working dividends are also tax deferred within traditional iras and 401 k accounts however when you take distributions from those accounts they will eventually be taxed as ordinary income this gives you the ability to decide when the tax is incurred which is a strategic advantage however don t expect to bypass the irs like you can with a roth dividends can also get special treatment in normal investment accounts dividends are considered qualified if they meet certain criteria but it s really common for retirement accounts to produce qualified dividends this basically means that these distributions will be taxed at a capital gains rate rather than income tax rates which can be advantageous for many investors retirement 2 steps you can take right now to lower your taxes later 3 stable growth you can t just ignore investment growth once you ve retired it s still important volatility management is important if you need to take distributions from your retirement account but you also need to prepare for multiple decades of potential cash needs that s only possible with some asset growth dividend stocks are a great source of growth but they also offer more stability than the market in general the proshares s p 500 aristocrats etf nysemkt nobl holds dividend aristocrats on top of the dividends it s paid to shareholders the etf s price has increased nearly 80 over the past five years investors get periodic cash flow while their pool of assets also rises even though the etf only holds around 65 stocks it s less volatile than the market in general its beta is only 0 70 which indicates that it doesn t rise or fall as drastically as the s p 500 dividend stocks are rarely growth stocks because their sales and profits tend to grow slowly and steadily over the long term their cash flows are more predictable so these stocks usually have more modest valuations that are based on expected dividends that means that they don t have as much room to tumble during bear markets dividend stocks provide better long term growth potential than bonds at the same time they tend to be lower risk and lower reward than growth stocks those are both ideal features for investment portfolios in retirement retirement 5 ways

griffith the town is celebrating both new year s and its own independence day this weekend griffith officially moves from the jurisdiction of calumet township to north township we are free council president rick ryfa said he said the town will realize about 3 million a year benefit in how local property taxes are spent the money will move from supporting administration of calumet township s financial assistance to gary s poorest to supporting griffith s municipal school library and county government services ryfa said 16 000 residents will see little or no difference in their household property tax bills because they already receive as much relief as the state s tax cap laws permit however he said the town s financial specialists predict local businesses will likely reap a tax break which he said is good for everyone we ve been saying all along this will be good for future development and drawing new business into the town ryfa said the departure of griffith leaves calumet township with remaining jurisdiction over the city of gary and roughly five square miles of unincorporated real estate southwest of gary griffith now joins hammond east chicago munster highland and whiting within north township which ryfa said will provide town residents with services comparable to those they have received in the past from calumet township north township trustee adrian santos already has met with us and has welcomed residents with open arms ryfa said the town s rising property values assessed at more than 729 million last year would contribute new tax revenues annually to its new home township north township also offers a free curb to curb bus service for residents needing transportation to and from medical appointments shopping and other activities on the other side of this historic transfer calumet township trustee kimberly robinson said her office has been preparing for this day for two years it won t have any effect on the assistance we provide our customers she said there will be no new staff cuts at her office either she said the township began putting together a financial plan in 2020 with the help of consultants and gradually has already reduced staff to a more sustainable level indiana is divided into 1 008 townships roughly 36 square mile blocks of real estate in pioneer days that was all the local government the state provided until towns and cities were settled the townships are governed by an elected trustee and three member board overseeing emergency assistance to low income residents griffith had been a part of calumet township since its founding in 1891 but the high cost of administering calumet poor relief operations caused the town s estrangement from the township past calumet township trustees employed more than 130 deputies alone to hand out assistance griffith officials said that was wastefully extravagant burdening griffith a tax rate that was 12 times the state average for township poor relief robinson who was first elected township trustee in 2014 reduced staff from that high level she argued cajoled and unsuccessfully sued griffith to stay in calumet township ryfa said griffith s fight for secession started more than 14 years ago when he and 4 500 town residents signed a petition to the indiana general assembly to take the unusual step of letting griffith switch townships as a result of nonstop lobbying state legislators finally passed a law in 2013 permitting griffith to hold a referendum on the issue in 2016 some 97 2 of the town s voters 3 290 voted that year to leave calumet township only 70 voted to stay ryfa said i got the ball rolling but it was the public the voters who made this happen griffith initially tried to woo either st john or north township to accept the town into their jurisdiction but both sets of those township officials declined ryfa said that prompted him to lobby the indiana general assembly in 2020 to require north township to accept them starting jan 1 2022
for two years the stock market has been largely able to ignore the lived reality of americans during the pandemic the mounting coronavirus cases the loss of lives and livelihoods the lockdowns because of underlying policies that kept it buoyant investors can now say goodbye to all that come 2022 the federal reserve is expected to raise interest rates to fight inflation and government programs meant to stimulate the economy during the pandemic will have ended those policy changes will cause investors businesses and consumers to behave differently and their actions will eventually take some air out of the stock market according to analysts it s going to be the first time in almost two years that the fed s incremental decisions might force investors or consumers to become a little more wary said david schawel chief investment officer at family management corp a wealth management firm in new york at year s end the overarching view on wall street is that 2022 will be a bumpier ride if not quite a roller coaster in a recent note analysts at j p morgan said that they expected inflation currently at 6 8 to normalize in coming months and that the surge of the omicron variant of the coronavirus was unlikely to lower economic growth lpl financial a brokerage had a similar take saying interest rates will move modestly higher in 2022 the s p 500 stock index had a great run in 2021 rising more than 25 on top of its 16 gain during the first year of the pandemic the index hit 70 new closing highs in 2021 second only to 1995 when there were 77 said howard silverblatt an analyst at s p dow jones indices shares on friday fell slightly the market continued to rise through political social and economic tensions on jan 7 the day after a pro trump mob stormed the u s capitol the s p set another record millions of amateur investors stuck at home during the pandemic piled into the stock market too buying up shares of all kinds of companies even those that no one expects will earn money including video game retailer gamestop wall street also remained bullish on business prospects in china despite beijing s growing tension with the united states and tightening grip on chinese companies waves of coronavirus variants from delta to omicron and a global death toll that crossed 5 million did not deter the stock market s rise its recovery after each bout of panic was faster than the previous one 2021 was a terrific year for the equity markets anu gaggar global investment strategist for commonwealth financial network said in an email between federal stimulus keeping the economy going easy monetary policy from the fed keeping markets liquid and interest rates low and the ongoing medical improvement leading to surprising growth markets have been in the best of all possible worlds the past year also seemed promising at first for new stock offerings and nearly 400 private companies raised 142 5 billion in 2021 but investors had sold off many of the newly listed stocks on the new york stock exchange or nasdaq by the end of the year the renaissance ipo exchange traded fund which tracks initial public offerings is down about 9 for the year shares of oatly which makes an oat based alternative to dairy milk soared 30 when the company went public in may but are now trading 60 lower than their opening day closing price stock trading startup robinhood and dating app bumble two other big public debuts were down about 50 for 2021 the first sign that the stock market could end its recent bull run appeared in the second half of 2021 when prices of household goods gasoline and much more began to rise sparked by supply chain disruptions stemming from the pandemic prices for used cars skyrocketed amid a global computer chip shortage as covid 19 vaccination rates improved businesses trying to reopen had to raise wages to attract and retain employees consumer prices climbed 5 7 in november from a year earlier the fastest pace since 1982 but even when inflation had become a buzzword worthy of a headline in the onion the stock market appeared slow to react to price increases the market is on the side that inflation is transitory said harry mamaysky a professor at columbia business school if it s not and the fed needs to go in and raise interest rates to tame inflation then things could get a lot worse in terms of markets and economic growth and that is what the fed has signaled it will do in 2022 when interest rates go up borrowing becomes more expensive for both consumers and companies that can hurt profit margins for companies and make stocks less attractive to investors while sapping consumer demand because people have less money to spend if their mortgage and other loan payments go up over time that tends to deflate the stock market and reduce demand which brings inflation back under control i expect 2022 to be a bumpier ride because the returns are not going to come as easy as they did in 2021 or most of 2020 said greg mcbride an analyst at bankrate a personal finance company even if the economy continues to grow there will be concerns about valuations as the fed tightens policy and that will lead to some heightened volatility higher interest rates could also dampen investor enthusiasm for stocks because bonds would pay a higher return than they have in recent years in fact lpl financial forecast that the yield on the 10 year treasury note one of the most widely tracked government bonds will rise to between 1 75 to 2 by the end of 2022 mcbride said the values of many stocks were being supported by extremely low yields on treasury bonds especially the 10 year yield which has held to about 1 5 if that yield moves up investors are going to re evaluate how much they re willing to pay for per dollar of earnings for stocks he said even if corporate profits which were strong in 2021 continue to grow in 2022 he added they are unlikely to expand at a pace that continues to justify the current price of stocks still what ultimately happens to the stock market in 2022 depends on whether the fed s plans to cut inflation by gently tightening monetary policy work as intended in addition to an expected rate increase the fed is winding down a pandemic era program that was meant to provide a backstop to the market in the spring of 2020 the fed started buying bonds to inject extra cash into the financial system and help companies stay afloat during severe drop offs in their businesses the fed announced in december that it would quicken the pace of pulling back on that aid set to finish in march the nightmare scenario is the fed tightens and it doesn t help said aaron brown a former risk manager of aqr capital management who now manages his own money and teaches math at new york university s courant institute of mathematical sciences brown said that if the fed could not orchestrate a soft landing for the economy things could start to get ugly fast and then he said the fed may have to take very aggressive action like a rate hike to 15 or wage and price controls like we tried in the 70s by an equal measure the fed s moves even if they are moderate could also cause a sell off in stocks corporate bonds and other riskier assets if investors panic when they realize that the free money that drove their risk taking to ever greater extremes over the past several years is definitely going away sal arnuk a partner and co founder of themis trading said he expected 2022 to begin with something like a hiccup china and taiwan russia and ukraine if something happens there or if the fed surprises everyone with the speed of the taper there s going to be some selling arnuk said it could even start in bitcoin but then people are going to start selling their apple their

economist private sector heads predict slump for trinidad and tobago a range of kiss bread on sale at benefit the people supermarket in san juan bread prices will go up in early january photo by sureash cholai several heads of various sectors of the economy believe trinidad and tobago is in for significant declines in 2022 as the pandemic persists and uncertainty looms their comments came after the central bank on friday issued its final monetary policy announcement mpa for 2021 which said there would be further increases in food and core inflation food inflation surged to 7 6 per cent from 5 8 per cent in september and is likely to rise further given the situation in the global grain markets it said the central bank pointed out that headline inflation in october moved to 3 9 per cent year on year when compared to 2 4 per cent in september core inflation which excluded food doubled to 2 9 per cent and the index of building material prices rose by 12 6 per cent during the third quarter of 2021 economist dr vaalmikki arjoon told sunday newsday that the increase in wheat prices has started a chain reaction that would further exacerbate an already high cost of living despite some food processing importers and distributors sourcing suppliers in closer proximity for instance from latin america arjoon explained the supply chain problems persisted because of demand and supply parameters globally he said everyone including business owners and their households will be faced with this increased cost of living due to increased flour prices they will again transfer this higher cost onto consumers which will inflate prices even more not just for items for which flour is used to produce but also other consumables that are used daily supply chain problems will possibly prolong at least until the latter part of 2022 despite some increases in factory production from asia going forward local manufacturers especially food processors should consider using hedging strategies to lock in specific prices from suppliers of raw materials such as agricultural commodities used in the food processing industry etc thereby protecting themselves from having to pay higher prices in future if there are further price increases on the global market at the close of 2021 major flour suppliers national flour mills and nutrimix announced price increases effective early january which range from 10 22 per cent this had the trickle down effect of announcements from kiss baking company and linda s bakery ltd of impending increases in the prices of their bread products price increases arjoon pointed out will be compounded further by shortages caused by delays at major international ports severe freight charges from china higher black market forex fees for importers who cannot access adequate forex from authorised dealers higher energy prices and customs overtime and port rental charges he said the move by the us federal reserve to halt liquidity injections through bond purchases which would likely increase interest rates next year could also be harmful to tt this will mean that investments in the us will provide a higher return and encourage some capital flight from tt where several entities will invest in us securities and assets to benefit from these higher returns although the central bank is maintaining the repo rate at 3 5 per cent future rate hikes in the us may at some point cause the central bank to increase our repo rate to prevent some of this capital flight but this could also push up interest on future loans from commercial banks making it costlier to borrow president of the supermarket association satt rajiv diptee said the pandemic has left the government with an element of uncertainty when planning especially when charting expansive monetary policy coupled with economic recovery he said major territories such as the us and uk continued to experience deep inflation which has trickled down to smaller economies such as tt the mechanism being used is the rise in interest rates with the commonly held view that money available at higher rates mean less borrowing translating to less spending thereby curbing demand and reducing prices over time as businesses reopen and look to access the bag of budget goodies accessible and available from this year it s really up to banks to work with their clients especially as several don t check certain boxes when it comes to audited accounts etc diptee said food price inflation during a covid19 environment he said with the emergence of variants and vaccine hesitancy was not going to be temporary as major food producers not only incurred escalated costs of inventory and raw material parts and machinery but other factors beyond the price of inputs tt chamber ceo gabriel faria said covid19 economic impacts have crippled micro small and medium enterprises msme and the self employed and despite the thrust towards recovery a significant proportion continued to struggle it is clear the crisis is far from over larger businesses especially the financial sector with stronger balance sheets cash and assets have been able to sustain themselves other specific sectors mostly food beverage pharmaceutical distribution and retail have actually improved their performance as consumers have been spending much less and focused on discretionary purchases such as essential items and health he said faria pointed out that continued declines or softness in the economy were expected for the first six months of 2022 which would be influenced by vaccination levels and workplace vaccine mandates that would create some disruption in the supply of services especially in the public sector referring to an august 2021 inter american development bank quarterly bulletin he said continued fiscal balance deterioration places tt in worse position than before covid 19 and this was expected for another four years in the case of barbados and tt this deterioration was in excess of eight percentage points of gross domestic product and it could take years for a return to pre crisis levels for tt fiscal balances are projected to remain worse than prior to covid19 through 2026 this forecast may deteriorate further with the recent increases in cases and deaths i hope the government will take some action to provide some meaningful support to the vulnerable in our society both the citizens and small businesses this could include using funds from the heritage and stabilisation fund but there must be complete transparency on how this money is used ideally with an external body made up of civil society and government with the appropriate fiscal oversight on the use of these funds faria explained additionally he called for the mobilisation of excess liquidity through tax incentives for investment in the msme sector which will provide capital and mentorship on friday the finance ministry issued a release reminding of tax relief measures several of which are directed to technology and digitisation that took effect from january 1 they include for smes a five per cent reduction in tax rates for three years for companies whose core business is technology solutions and digitisation and a tax holiday for the first five year period to new smes listing on the stock exchange among the measures for larger enterprises are a five per cent reduction in the tax rate for significant exporters of goods for three years and a five per cent reduction in tax rate for the manufacturing sector for two years on qualifying projects
suzie flores of stonington kelp co photo by elizabeth ellenwood read the day magazine harvesting sugar kelp is akin to picking spinach that s how seaweed farmer suzie flores describes her work when her crop of sugar kelp is ready to be picked and delivered to customers on board her 24 foot privateer with a gaff hook in hand and a good knife at the ready she pulls the lines suspended a few feet below fishers island sound and carefully cuts blades of kelp about 6 inches from the stipe or stem so the yellowish brown algae rich in fiber vitamins and minerals will continue to grow flores and her husband jay douglas own stonington kelp co and have a lease from the state of connecticut to farm 10 acres in fishers island sound not far from latimer reef lighthouse sugar kelp is the only seaweed the state allows to be farmed in the sea for human consumption it s a winter crop started in november with 1 millimeter pieces of seaweed attached to kite string and hung from arrays a series of suspended lines hung between poles think of it like laundry says suzie flores it s just like a laundry line there s two poles a line and you hang sheets of seaweed over them about 4 feet below the surface the seaweed is in constant motion flores said flowing in all directions in concert with the wind current and tide there s a constant energy flowing over the farm and that s really great for the seaweed she said there are environmental as well as the health benefits seaweed helps to remove carbon nitrogen and phosphorus from the water a benefit for marine life said flores seaweed sucks up everything in the water she said like soil for plants it extracts organic and inorganic nitrogen if there is too much nitrogen in the water it suffocates all the other fish and wildlife seaweed allows the ocean to breathe it s a wonderful way to fight climate change her farm is still in its infancy when flores and douglas relocated from new jersey to pawcatuck she began searching for a new career formerly employed in market research her inclination to farm seaweed was helped by the fact that her husband had bought a marina on the pawcatuck river i always had a fascination with the water and conservation and this well it naturally fell into that the fact that i could go out and grow something that is food and put it out in november and harvest it in may well that alone is a personal sense of fulfillment farming something in the ocean is the most humbling thing ever she said in 2016 flores connected with greenwave a branford based nonprofit that trains and supports ocean farmers when she learned she could grow sugar kelp in fishers island sound she was hooked and has been at it ever since greenwave helped her to navigate the permitting process supplied her with her initial seed stock and growing information and she has been learning on the job ever since although she said she still has greenwave on speed dial there have been weather and other hardships and then there was covid which shut down restaurants her primary market but she s still at it and began another season in late november in early spring she will sell her sugar kelp at the stonington farmers market and to local chefs who have found innovative ways to use it renee touponce the executive chef at oyster club in mystic has used it for oils dried it for powders made butter and aioli and wrapped fish in it overnight to season the protein the kelp itself has natural sugars and salt i like to say it has an oceanic umami flavor said touponce it s fresh earthy salty briny but not real brusque i use it all kinds of ways i make a lot of stocks and sauces and i dry it and preserve it i blend it into a powder and i make oils i even use it raw for salad the team at oyster club is planning an event for april 2022 featuring five courses all including seaweed they will team up with flores and other area commercial ocean farmers with a goal of focusing on the unique flavor of the seaweed grown at each farm other chefs are also using the seaweed at shipwright s daughter in mystic flores said the chef has prepared seaweed wrapped scallops noodled sugar kelp in a fish dish and used it for a flan at home flores blanches and freezes some of what she collects to make kelp cubes that she uses in smoothies i combine it with whatever veggies and fruits my kids won t eat to improve the nutrition profile it s like eating fish and getting omega 3 and antioxidants she said she also pickles the stipes or stems of the sugar kelp and serves them with tartar sauce it s the best use for tartar sauce ever she said flores is a founding member of the sugar kelp cooperative organized to help the handful of southeastern connecticut and southern rhode island sugar kelp farmers with post harvest challenges kelp farming fights climate change supports working waterfronts and offers the community a native and healthy super food but it only works if the farmers are able to sell their crops reads a statement on the cooperative s website flores will farm over the winter visiting her beds weekly while few other boaters are out on fishers island sound if everything goes as planned she will begin to harvest her sugar kelp in late march finishing up around memorial day she will be out there in early spring with her gaff hook knife fish baskets and coolers collecting her bounty and bringing it to shore for customers there are challenges she said but we do it because it is good fun it really is it is a wonderful way to help the planet to help cure the ocean of all the crap we have done to it and it is a new economy that we bring to this area where there is a dwindling working waterfront with each growing season flores said she gains more expertise and knowledge you learn a lot about what you farm she said the more you know the more you can predict then you can grow more seaweed suzie flores and jay douglas of stonington kelp co photo by elizabeth ellenwood
joe zeidan stands outside z auto place his used car business in houston photo for the washington post by mark felix the u s economy this year was strong and scary and not at all normal growth surged then stalled then rebounded jobs were there for the taking but not everyone wanted to or was able to return to work the price of items such as lumber and used cars galloped higher at a pace most people had never experienced across the country americans battled through a historic pandemic trying to find their way back to more familiar terrain a car salesman in houston enjoyed a boom but wondered whether it would last a boston ballerina shed tears of joy as she returned to the stage and a wisconsin trucker was forced to park his 195 000 rig to wait for a simple aluminum part caught in a tangled supply chain theirs are tales of perseverance and adaptation resilience and triumph the u s economy this year is turning in its best performance since 1984 when ronald reagan proclaimed it morning again in america businesses are producing more goods and services than before the coronavirus pandemic but doing so with about 4 million fewer workers the economy is running so hot that the federal reserve this month took its first steps toward slowing things down even as many downtown office towers remain vacant we don t look at this as a classic recovery said paul gruenwald global chief economist for s p global ratings we re learning this as we go now the climate is shifting again in 2022 the economy will get less stimulus from government spending and the fed s easy money policies easing pressure on the supply bottlenecks that have clogged ports and rail yards that combination should eventually take inflation off the boil but no one knows how the pandemic will affect next year few people even know how it will affect next week there s a tendency to take 2021 and expect a carbon copy in 22 that s not going to be the case said gregory daco chief u s economist with oxford economics the drivers of economic activity will be very different to capture the national mood amid these crosscurrents the washington post spoke to people in every region we met a former waitress who had reinvented herself in miami as a cryptocurrency trader and developed a taste for cartier earrings saw how a nationwide reckoning with racial injustice was lifting the fortunes of an african american bookseller in oakland and witnessed outside of denver the bittersweet sacrifice of a grandmother who left a job she loved to solve her daughter s child care crisis these are their stories houston joe zeidan you see that 2018 nissan altima sitting out there asked joe zeidan who owns z auto place a used car business in west houston i sold that car two years ago for 15 000 last month the owner brought it back to trade it in on another car i had to pay him 17 500 for it now it s back on my lot and i m selling it for 18 500 that s how crazy the car business is zeidan 63 came to the united states from his native lebanon in 1977 to attend the university of houston he graduated with a degree in engineering and has been selling used cars ever since from inexpensive first cars for teenagers to range rovers and ford f 150s to luxury ferraris maseratis and lamborghinis he has never seen anything like the rabid search for used cars that exists in this wild woolly and unpredictable pandemic rebound economy for sure 2020 was a disaster year for us both financially and personally i lost a lot of money last year he said because of the virus everything shut down and people stopped buying cars people were working from home people who normally would have needed to buy a car could do without one last year one day one of my managers who also was a friend said he wasn t feeling well and got tested he had covid and died two weeks later i closed my business for two weeks after he passed away and closed another week later i closed to keep my staff safe a used car lot isn t a business where your employees can work from home this year customers are back and prices are up way up zeidan estimates his business is booming 50 over 2020 it s really out of control i can t find enough cars to sell he explained sitting at the desk in his small office i usually have about 120 cars on my lot now i have only 70 people aren t scared to go out anymore and they are buying cars again they want normal life to return and they need transportation for that to happen they need to get to work or go visit family or go shopping like they used to that s why i m not so unhappy that i had so many cars i couldn t sell last year now i m selling them at a higher price than i could have gotten last year how long does zeidan expect the car buying frenzy to continue i give it another six or seven months but you never know he said nobody knows anything about which way the world is turning ken hoffman boston lia cirio the snow queen hadn t danced before a live audience in 20 months as she waited backstage for the boston ballet s first performance of the nutcracker to begin lia cirio felt a swirl of emotions the theater was packed the anticipation palpable two hours and many leaps later she couldn t hold back i cried tears of joy for artists such as cirio a principal dancer and choreographer with the company the pandemic threatened not just livelihoods but their very reasons for being she remembers the date march 12 2020 the opening night of carmen she had the lead role i didn t understand what covid was i thought it d be a week or two then the rest of the season got canceled at first i did the barre in my kitchen thing cirio said but soon she realized how long it might be before the company took the stage again i let my body heal which it hadn t done in a long time she isolated with her dance partner and dove into creative projects including choreographing and recording new dances she posted the videos on instagram in september 2020 the boston ballet debuted its first virtual season in september 2020 the boston ballet debuted its first virtual season bb yourhome featured previous footage interviews and new masked recordings the effort drew viewers from more than 21 countries and helped keep everyone employed yet performing before the cameras was stressful a small slip up might not be noticed by a theater audience on video mistakes are memorialized forever you d do one take and then say i have to do it again cirio said the dancers finally resumed full rehearsals this fall after practicing for so long in small pods and via zoom she relishes being together i care about my colleagues even more because of that separation rehearsals are long and arduous dancers masks billow in and out when they pause breathing deeply it s kind of like training at elevation cirio said but between takes laughter often fills the space while she and the others exaggerate moves and spoof their own missteps as with so many ballerinas cirio s dream began with the nutcracker which she first saw when she was 3 she is now 35 and in her 18th year with the company she has played the snow queen more than once a recent review called her rapt and radiant she is thrilled that the audiences have returned in force and as she pirouettes in a fantasyland of gently falling snowflakes they watch her in spellbound silence being onstage again has been a really powerful feeling cirio said joelle renstrom miami kailey kernick kailey kernick knew she was in trouble when yet another luxury label boutique moved into miami s most chichi shopping area this month they just opened a chanel store a week ago she said and so that s going to be dangerous for me the 24 year old s admission came just outside of the louis vuitton store in the miami design district a downtown destination where she spends a lot of time and a lot of money around her men and women stepped out of bentleys and benzes to peruse windows with glittery displays of gold diamonds and silk no tinsel or faux baubles in sight dior is my favorite thing and i love chanel i have an insane shopping addiction kernick said it s an addiction she can afford thanks to the supercharged cryptocurrency trading that has transformed and empowered her world two years ago she was in her hometown near calgary working as a waitress and living paycheck to paycheck she said i barely had any savings the coronavirus hit and she lost her job and decided to head south after a brief stop in los angeles and another low wage position at a mortgage broker kernick arrived in miami in early 2021 and started trading cryptocurrency something she d been studying for a few years i ve been lucky to run with people that are just killing it in the industry and we have a community she said i know it s like gambling but it s smarter gambling depending on how you play it you ve got to be smart with this she and her friends have quadrupled their investments this year according to kernick they re all enjoying luxe lifestyles the kind that miami mayor francis suarez is promoting as he tries to turn the city into a cryptocurrency trading center though she realizes the pandemic is still upending many lives she expects to be ready to weather any future financial setbacks i feel like nobody fully understands what the economy will do just like with covid nobody expected that she said you ve just got to be prepared and i know that i ll find a way to make it even if the stock market crashes that s just an opportunity to buy for now she s trying to persuade her parents in canada to come visit they re frugal people they don t really quite understand what i m doing with crypto she said kernick isn t apologizing for the extravagance of her splurges like the 4 000 pair of earrings from cartier she recently bought i think life manifests itself in the way you live it i live the life i want to live and i m just going to keep inviting more luxury and abundance kernick said you attract what you give out to the world lori rozsa oakland blanche richardson blanche richardson still works seven days a week at the business her parents founded about six decades ago the business decorated on the outside by a 10 foot tall block long bookshelf mural the business visited over the years by luminaries such as rosa parks and muhammad ali the business that is the oldest african american owned bookstore in the country she s tired though there s no question of walking away marcus books named for black activist marcus garvey remains her mission it s essential that any culture any community has its own source of knowledge richardson said for the black community this is it the past two years have of course been challenging when the pandemic forced shutdowns in california the bookstore s supporters responded with fundraising efforts and waves of phone orders to help keep it afloat but when george floyd was killed under the knee of a minneapolis police officer triggering protests in cities across the country and painful introspection among many americans the bookshop became a key destination for people not just in its oakland neighborhood but throughout the bay area suddenly along with black customers seeking education and kinship there were a lot more white people and asian people coming in the store looking for answers and also wanting to be supportive richardson had never faced such demand the store s income easily quintupled she couldn t get new books fast enough the result bare shelves for the first time in memory about a third of the newcomers have kept returning both individuals and corporate customers in states as distant as virginia and new york rewarding as that is it means long long hours richardson won t give her age other than to say she s older than 65 rather than making retirement plans she continues juggling the demands of a small business in a volatile economy backed by a group of loyal volunteers she is gratified that the store hasn t had deliveries badly delayed by this fall s trucking and supply chain issues its shelves are full again with james baldwin s essays and audre lorde s poetry biographies of stacey abrams and nipsey hussle works of afrofuturism and more richardson curates the offerings about 3 000 titles for their relevance to people of color a majority are by black authors we find that people will now turn to us to order things they could very well get at another bookstore she said many tell her i didn t want to shop at amazon fame has come with a price a spate of nasty phone calls threatening letters and most recently smashed windows but richardson inspired by her parents legacy is undeterred we want to provide a place where you can get the truth about yourself alissa greenberg cedar rapids iowa mike nichols after pulling countless trailers of grain across the country during the pandemic mike nichols s truck was at last sitting still parked at the shop it needed a routine part a length of aluminum tubing just as the trucking industry was gripped by a parts shortage even the supply chain is affected by the supply chain said nichols 54 as he waited at his home in central wisconsin it s a week without revenue so that hurts but you need breaks too now and then when truck traffic dipped in 2020 he had kept rolling crisscrossing the country with 25 ton loads of grain corn from iowa rice from arkansas malted barley from minnesota yet now trucks are crowding the interstates heavy with the goods fueling a pandemic consumer binge nichols has logged about 2 5 million miles without an accident since he began driving in the 1980s more than ever though he feels the stress of crowded roads a big rig to the left of him to the right behind him at night they pack rest areas and truck stops their drivers urged off the road by their elds electronic logging devices for federally mandated rest breaks usually 10 hours the federal highway administration calls the truck parking shortage severe and has labeled it a national safety concern not until mid december was nichols s truck finally repaired and he able to head out he picked up a load of corn flour in iowa bound for north carolina hours later his break period approaching he steered onto an exit in oakwood ill three truck stops there have more than 200 spaces and he needed only one on the biggest lot he soon got stuck in a futile cul de sac of trucks he had to back out they were in there like cordwood he said the second lot was smaller and also crowded with more vehicles than spaces with his eld ticking toward a break violation he didn t bother to check the third lot you work all day putting in 14 hours and then you have to worry about where you are going to park your bed he said it s almost like being homeless his rig recently purchased for 195 000 is set up with a microwave fridge and bed its mud flaps read don t tread on me his late wife s name is painted across the back nichols drove to a truck terminal 10 miles away

at which they are purportedly located expressed surprise when contacted by propublica one entity categorized as a cattle ranch beefy king was registered in ppp records to the home address of joe mancini the mayor of long beach township there s no farming here we re a sandbar for christ s sake said mancini reached by telephone mancini said that he had no cows at his home just three dogs all of these loans to nonexistent businesses came through kabbage an online lending platform that processed nearly 300 000 ppp loans before the first round of funds ran out in august 2020 second only to bank of america in total propublica found 378 small loans totaling 7 million to fake business entities all of which were structured as single person operations and received close to the largest loan for which such micro businesses were eligible the overwhelming majority of them are categorized as farms even in the unlikeliest of locales from potato fields in palm beach to orange groves in minnesota the kabbage pattern is only one slice of a sprawling fraud problem that has suffused the paycheck protection program from its creation in march 2020 as an attempt to keep small businesses on life support while they were forced to shut down with speed as its strongest imperative the effort run by the federal small business administration initially lacked even the most basic safeguards to prevent opportunists from submitting fabricated documentation government watchdogs have said while that may have allowed millions of businesses to keep their doors open it has also required a massive cleanup operation on the backend the sba s inspector general estimated in january that the agency approved loans for 55 000 potentially ineligible businesses and that 43 000 obtained more money than their reported payrolls would justify the department of justice relying on special agents from across the government to investigate has brought charges against hundreds of individuals accused of gaming pandemic response programs drawn by generous fees for each loan processed kabbage was among a band of online lenders that joined enthusiastically in originating loans through their automated platforms that helped millions of borrowers who d been turned down by traditional banks but it also created more opportunities for cheating propublica examined sba loans processed by several of the most prolific online lenders and found that kabbage appears to have originated the most loans to businesses that don t appear to exist and the only concentration of loans to phantom farms in some cases these problems would ve been easy to spot with just a little more upfront diligence which the program s structure did not encourage pushing this through financial institutions created some pretty bad incentives said naftali harris the ceo of sentilink which helps lenders detect potential identity theft this is definitely a case where companies that decided they wanted to be more careful in terms of giving out loans were penalized for doing so presented with propublica s findings sba inspector general spokeswoman farrah saint surin said that her office had hundreds of investigations underway but that she did not have any information to share or available for public reporting at this time reuters reported that federal investigators were probing whether kabbage and other fintech lenders miscalculated ppp loan amounts and the doj declined to confirm or deny the existence of any investigation to propublica kabbage which was acquired by american express last fall did not have an explanation for propublica s specific findings but it said it adhered to required fraud protocols at any point in the loan process if fraudulent activity was suspected or confirmed it was reported to fincen the sba s office of the inspector general and other federal investigators with kabbage providing its full cooperation spokesman paul bernardini said in an emailed statement as soon as the pandemic swept across america kabbage was in trouble the online lending platform had launched in 2009 as part of a generation of financial technology companies known as non banks alternative lenders or simply fintechs that act as an intermediary between investors and small businesses that might not have relationships with traditional banks based in atlanta it had become a buzzy standout in the city s tech scene offering employees silicon valley perks like free catered lunches and beer on tap it advertised its mission as helping small businesses acquire funds they need for their big breaks as a recruiting video parody of michael jackson s thriller put it in 2016 the basic innovation behind the burgeoning fintech industry is automating underwriting and incorporating more data sources into risk evaluation using statistical models to determine whether an applicant will repay a loan that lower barrier to credit comes with a price kabbage would lend to borrowers with thin or checkered credit histories in exchange for steep fees the original partner for most of its loans celtic bank is based in utah which has no cap on interest rate allowing kabbage to charge more in states with stricter regulations with backing from the powerhouse venture capital firm softbank kabbage had been planning an ipo its model foundered however when kabbage s largest customer base small businesses like coffee shops hair salons and yoga studios was forced to shut down last march kabbage stopped writing loans even for businesses that weren t harmed by the pandemic days later it furloughed more than half of its nearly 600 person staff and faced an uncertain future the paycheck protection program which was signed into law as part of the cares act on march 27 2020 with an initial 349 billion in funding was a lifeline not just to small businesses but fintechs as well lenders would get a fee of 5 on loans worth less than 350 000 which would account for the vast majority of transactions the loans were government guaranteed and processors bore almost no liability as long as they made sure that applications were complete at first encouraged by the treasury department traditional banks prioritized their own customers an efficient way to process applications with little fraud risk since the borrowers information was already on file but that left millions of the smallest businesses including independent contractors out to dry they turned instead to a collection of online lenders that have sprung up offering short term loans to businesses kabbage lendio bluevine fundbox square capital and others would process applications automatically with little human review required for the platforms this was also easy money in the first funding round that ran out last august kabbage completed 297 587 loans totaling 7 billion it received 5 of each loan it made directly and an undisclosed cut of the proceeds for those it processed for banks its total revenue was likely in the hundreds of millions of dollars a lawsuit filed by a south carolina accounting firm alleges that kabbage was among several lenders that refused to pay fees to agents who helped put together applications even though the cares act had said they could charge up to 1 of the smaller loans a provision that was later reversed for kabbage that revenue kept the company alive while it sought a buyer for all of these guys it was like shooting fish in a barrel if you could do the minimum amount of due diligence required you could fill up the pipeline with these applications said a former kabbage executive one of four former employees interviewed by propublica they spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation at their current jobs or from industry giant american express to handle the volume kabbage brought back laid off workers starting at 15 an hour when that failed to attract enough people they increased the hourly rate to 35 and then 40 and awarded gift cards for reaching certain benchmarks according to a former employee with visibility into the loan processing at a certain point they were like yes get more applications out and you ll get this reward if you do the former employee said bernardini said the company did not offer incentive compensation in a report on its ppp participation through last august kabbage boasted that 75 of all approved applications were processed without human review for every 790 employees at major u s banks the report said kabbage had one that s in part because traditional banks which also take deposits are much more heavily regulated than fintech institutions that just process loans to participate in the ppp fintechs had to quickly set up systems that could comply with anti money laundering laws the human review that did happen according to two people involved in it was perfunctory they weren t saying is this legitimate they were just saying are all the fields filled out said another former employee as acquisition talks proceeded the employee noted kabbage managers who held the most company stock had a built in incentive to process as many loans as possible if there s anything suspicious you can pass it along to account review but account review was full of people who stood to make a lot of money from the acquisition one situation in which kabbage approved a suspicious loan became public in a florida lawsuit filed by a woman latoya clark who received more than 1 million in ppp loans to three businesses when the funds were deposited into accounts at jpmorgan chase the bank discovered that clark s businesses hadn t been incorporated before the ppp program s cutoff and froze the accounts clark sued chase and chase then filed a counterclaim against the borrower and kabbage which had originated the loan despite its questionable documentation in its response kabbage said it had not yet completed its investigation of the incident although the justice department rarely names lenders that processed fraudulent ppp applications kabbage has been named at least twice one case involved two loans worth 1 8 million to businesses that submitted forged information and the other involved a business that had inflated its payroll numbers and submitted a similar application to u s bank which flagged authorities kabbage had simply approved the 940 000 loan american express bernardini declined to comment further on pending litigation shortly after the application period for ppp s first round closed on aug 8 american express announced the kabbage purchase but the transaction included none of kabbage s loan portfolios either from the ppp or its pre pandemic conventional loans the ppp loans had either been sold to sba approved banks or bought by the federal reserve bernardini wouldn t say which banks now own the loans however and said that no potentially fraudulent loans had been pledged to the fed in april an ocean county new jersey resident contacted propublica after seeing his name attached to a kabbage loan for a nonexistent melon farm to see whether it was an isolated incident propublica took basic information the government released after a freedom of information act lawsuit by propublica and others and compared it with state business entity registries although registries don t pick up all sole proprietorships and independent contractors the absence of a name is an indication that the business might not exist as it turned out kabbage had made more than 60 loans in new jersey to unlisted businesses fake farms also showed up repeatedly in the sba s economic injury disaster loan program according to reports from local news outlets a common tie became apparent when the resident of the home to which one nonexistent business was registered said that he was a client of the certified public accountants at ciccone koseff company in march 2020 the firm notified its clients of what it called an ultimately unsuccessful ransomware attack that occurred the previous month according to information filed with maine s attorney general the attackers acquired social security numbers and financial information several other clients of the accounting firm including mancini the long beach mayor also had loans registered to their addresses reached by phone firm founder ray ciccone declined to comment but that cpa s data breach didn t account for all of the suspicious loans propublica found across the country searches for ppp applicants that didn t show up in state registration records yielded hundreds in 28 more states with dense clusters in florida nebraska and virginia other lenders had nonexistent businesses as well but fake farms only showed up in kabbage loans most followed a distinctive naming convention with part of the name of a resident or former resident of the home to which the business is registered plus a random agricultural term where kabbage made suspect loans ppp loan applications approved by kabbage an online lender to recipients who appear not to exist or say they did not apply by county source small business administration credit derek willis propublica some of the fake loans listed addresses of people who d also legitimately applied for their businesses hartington nebraska anesthesiologist bruce reifenrath received a ppp loan for his practice in nearby yankton south dakota that s why the idea of one being approved for a potato farm was so strange we did a ppp loan last spring and it s pretty extensive the documentation reifenrath said reifenrath was part of a cluster of dubious kabbage loans in hartington that also included the home of j scott schrempp the president of the bank of hartington who confirmed that he did not own a strawberry farm schrempp said he had noticed the fake loan and reported it to the sba the sba data only reflects approved applications received from lenders some of which are then caught and not funded the sba also periodically updates its dataset to remove loans canceled by lenders but none of the suspicious loans pulled by propublica show undisbursed funds and they all have remained in the dataset for more than eight months one possible mechanism for the invented businesses is a technique known as synthetic identity theft in which a criminal obtains pieces of personally identifiable information such as a home address a social security number and a birthdate and combines it with fake information to build a credit profile the associated bank account then routes to the fraudster not the owner of the original information none of the residents of the phony farms propublica contacted were getting notices that they needed to repay the loans they didn t apply for because they didn t get any money but that doesn t mean they re not at risk according to james lee chief operating officer at the identity theft resource center just having an address linked to your name on a fraudulent loan can impact your credit lee said it can also pose problems for pre employment background checks insurance applications or new identification documents like passports and driver s licenses meanwhile if not corrected the fabricated identities will stay in circulation and become better at fooling other financial institutions those records get built into the credit and authentication systems used by government and commercial entities lee said each next time they are used and authenticated the more real they become that s what makes synthetic identity fraud so insidious this however is largely not kabbage s problem anymore after its huge blitz of ppp loans last summer kabbage had hundreds of thousands of borrowers whose loans would need to be serviced until they were closed out the loans could either be forgiven if the borrower demonstrated that they spent most of the money on payroll or paid back with interest but american express didn t acquire the part of kabbage s business that owned those loans instead a separate entity called k servicing would handle loan forgiveness and take applications for a second ppp draw that congress funded in december the servicer is led by former kabbage employees and its website looks very similar to kabbage s but american express says it has no affiliation if kabbage was understaffed for the volume of ppp loans it took on before the acquisition the situation has apparently worsened since then reddit yelp consumer affairs trustpilot facebook and better business bureau threads are replete with complaints from customers whose applications were denied or who received no communication from the company when the sba changed the rules in february to make the program more generous to independent contractors k servicing couldn t incorporate the new forms into its processing system so it told all new applicants to apply through another company smartbiz which had operated as a mostly online processor of sba loans even before the pandemic k servicing is run by kabbage s former head of program management laquisha milner who also runs her own consulting firm due to extenuating circumstances beyond our control currently our processing function is delayed milner emailed in response to detailed questions from propublica we are relentlessly exploring all available options to ensure our existing customers are able to maximize their loan forgiveness jennifer dienst is a freelance travel and events writer who received her first draw loan from kabbage and wants to apply for forgiveness before her window for doing so closes in the fall but she has been stymied by k servicing s failure to make the forms available please be patient with us as we prepare for the new forms a message on the loan portal reads meanwhile dienst s account has started accruing interest which milner said will not be charged if the loan is forgiven but it s making dienst nervous it s always the same response from k servicing we re updating our forgiveness forms and

jardine says eo is just following its customers trying to establish business ties with them wherever they are located to do so it needs cash for a company our size a spac is a quicker route to market he says an initial public offering can take two years we are a technology company and being on the nasdaq is the right thing for our business the u s is an exciting place a country that wants to reduce its carbon footprint and electrify its transport sector electrification of the u s economy is critical for the country to reach its climate goals a 50 cut in co2 emissions by 2030 from 2005 levels if electricity can replace gasoline usage for cars trucks and buses that would go a long way specifically president biden wants half of all u s sold vehicles to run on electricity by 2030 general motors gm ford motor co f and stellantis have said that they would comply bmw honda hyundai nissan toyota volkswagen and volvo also applaud the endeavor they all say that the federal government needs to make significant investments in the charging infrastructure to succeed others emphasize that the most important incentives are financial giving tax breaks to buyers of evs a move that is working in norway where 75 of all new vehicles run on electricity signs point one way an eo charging port eo charging alixpartners a consulting firm said that electric vehicles could rise from 2 of the global car market to 24 by 2030 ev sales in the united states will hit 17 2 million in 2022 about 3 of the market bloomberg new energy finance predicts global sales of 30 million electric vehicles by 2030 with china making up half of those electric vehicles are more efficient than the internal combustion engine with a 30 efficiency rate that means they are cleaner nevertheless alixpartners says there are a myriad of challenges for example it still costs 8 000 to 11 000 more to build an electric vehicle than to make a traditional car that runs on an internal combustion engine and it says that economies of scale may not tip the balance until 2030 other concerns include supply driven price increases and material shortages fleet owners are motivated to use electricity fueled vans and trucks to enhance their images but eo is giving them the tools to reduce the cost of ownership by looking at eo s software applications those operators can determine the cheapest time to recharge they can then program those applications to fully charge their vehicles before their morning runs however those fleet operators could decide to forego the use of their vehicles and to use them instead to heat and cool their homes or they could make that battery power available to grid operators and get paid if 200 vans buses and trucks are plugged into the grid during peak hours that could also save the utility a lot of money and possibly avoid building new natural gas fired peaking plants the nice thing about ev energy is that it is cheap at midnight says jardine owners will examine the time those vehicles need to leave the next day the state of the battery when it plugs in and how many miles the vehicle must travel then they will know how much energy to send to those vehicles and ensure they are ready by morning at the lowest price our business model makes sense he adds we have public charging companies looking at fleets they are looking at us and trying to pivot but we are a pure play company that is focused on charging and servicing fleets our brand defines us we are the first mover in europe now we are headed to the united states it s a huge market and we want to get a piece of it the ev market is going straight up guided in considerable measure by the need to drastically reduce co2 releases and fleet owners are a driving force behind that trend but the speed at which they move is determined by public policies government incentives and a reliable charging infrastructure eo charging has earned its name by making the transition smoother a company that has gone through some rough patches but that will soon be publicly listed see also solar power ev charging stations arguments against evs are running on empty automakers ramp up charging stations truckers going electric even the oil producers see evs coming

the rowland hill reforms of the postal system in 1840 gave affordable mail to the majority of the population and while the one penny black is well recognised as the very first postage stamp the mulready letter sheet which was issued at the same time is not so well known the official term for these letters is postal stationery and rowland hill suggested an improvement to the postal service could include a pre paid envelope which did not need to have a gummed stamp applied to it read more why did cutting this banknote in half help prevent violent robberies hill believed incorrectly as it turned out that people would prefer these pre paid letter sheets and envelopes rather than buy separate stamps and use their own envelopes and paper he commissioned william mulready ra a famous irish artist living in london to design the stationery and so the envelope was named after him the mulready design depicted britannia in the centre of the world with a shield and lion at her feet her arms outstretched dispatching winged messengers to all corners of the empire figures at upper left and right suggest the continents of asia and north america in the lower corners idealised family members are engrossed in reading their mail mulready letter sheet posted from darlington addressed to edinburgh was dated november 5 1840 and received in edinburgh on the november 6 it was cancelled by a red maltese cross of darlington over the figure of britannia rowland hill expected the mulready stationery to be more popular than the postage stamps so with great anticipation the envelope and letter sheet with its elaborate design in values of one penny and two pence was issued on the 6 may 1840 however the design was immediately ridiculed by the general public the press and artistic communities alike as it was perceived to be pompous overly idealised and pretentious just a few days after the mulready envelopes and letter sheets had been issued postal reformer rowland hill wrote the public have shown their disregard and even distaste for beauty and as he feared the invention was already doomed such was the height of public feeling that a number of stationers in london published humorous and politically fuelled caricatures of the envelope caricature envelope published june 1 1840 by j w southgate no 1 in a series showing britannia with a patch over her eye scattering messengers afar with drunken men lying on the ground so plans began for a new postal stationery in february 1841 the mulready was replaced by the so called penny pink a pre paid envelope that followed the same premise as the mulready but replaced the elaborate sketch with a simple portrait of queen victoria within a circular frame along with the words postage one penny the mulready envelopes were not initially withdrawn but remained on sale at post offices up to november 1842 then the remaining stocks were eventually destroyed there is still a mystique regarding these items and they are still very popular with collectors today keep up to date with all the latest news on our website or follow us on facebook twitter and instagram you can also follow our dedicated darlington facebook page for all the latest in the area by clicking here for all the top news updates from right across the region straight to your inbox sign up to our newsletter here have you got a story for us contact our newsdesk on newsdesk nne co uk or contact 01325 505054

opec and its allies are expected to revive more oil supplies when they meet next week underscoring the group s optimism in the outlook for global demand the 23 nation alliance led by saudi arabia and russia is likely to proceed with another modest monthly hike of 400 000 barrels a day as it restores production halted during the pandemic according to a bloomberg survey several national delegates also said they expect the boost due to take effect in february will go ahead the organization of petroleum exporting countries and its partners see global demand continuing to recover this year taking only a mild hit from the omicron variant their confidence is being validated as busy traffic across key asian consuming countries and dwindling crude inventories in the u s buoy international prices near 80 a barrel the market can take the extra oil as long as omicron or a macro downturn don t crush demand again said bob mcnally president of consultant rapidan energy group and a former white house official fifteen of 16 analysts and traders surveyed by bloomberg predicted the output increase will be approved when the coalition gathers online on tuesday indicators on fuel consumption suggest the barrels can be absorbed with all but one major asian country registering a rise in mobility month on month according to data compiled by bloomberg using apple inc statistics to dec 27 adding supplies would also show that riyadh continues to be mindful of the inflationary risks afflicting their biggest customers having acquiesced last month to u s president joe biden s calls for extra production to cool runaway gasoline prices while that surprise move was initially read as bearish by traders saudi energy minister prince abdulaziz bin salman helped to shore up market sentiment by resolving that opec s meeting would remain technically in session allowing it to reverse the output increase at short notice if needed proceeding with the next monthly increase isn t without risks china asia s biggest oil user has shown signs of weakening fuel demand amid its relentless zero covid approach and tough line on pollution according to road congestion data from local providers like baidu inc in the u s airline cancellations are already piling up with 1 125 flights scrubbed as rising coronavirus cases hobble staffing opec estimates that the world oil market is returning to surplus which will only widen in the coming months as supply jumps from the group s rivals including the deployment of emergency reserves by the u s and other consumers with the excess projected to reach a hefty 2 6 million barrels a day in march the group may need to reconsider further increases opec is highly unlikely to drop the ball now and allow inventories to rise significantly said bjarne schieldrop chief commodities analyst at seb ab but for the time being the group isn t especially troubled by the prospect of a rebound in stockpiles a senior delegate said inventories are currently at low levels and typically replenish during the seasonal demand lull of the first quarter the delegate said stocks in developed nations are 170 million barrels below their average for the years 2015 2019 according to opec data i see no reason why the group won t continue to add barrels at the agreed pace not least considering the limited impact on global demand from surging omicron cases said ole hansen head of commodities research at saxo bank a s in copenhagen opec s output increase will in any case be tempered as many countries most notably angola and nigeria struggle to make the production hikes they re allowed because of constrained investment and operational disruptions as a result the actual boost in february will likely fall short of the official 400 000 barrels a day rapidan s mcnally said opec members have a separate meeting planned on monday to choose a new top official with delegates saying that haitham al ghais of kuwait the only candidate formally nominated so far enjoys widespread support for the position if approved al ghais would succeed current secretary general mohammad barkindo who will conclude six years in the post in july he s very smart and a good analyst said johannes benigni chairman of consultant jbc energy group in vienna

suzie flores of stonington kelp co photo by elizabeth ellenwood read the day magazine harvesting sugar kelp is akin to picking spinach that s how seaweed farmer suzie flores describes her work when her crop of sugar kelp is ready to be picked and delivered to customers on board her 24 foot privateer with a gaff hook in hand and a good knife at the ready she pulls the lines suspended a few feet below fishers island sound and carefully cuts blades of kelp about 6 inches from the stipe or stem so the yellowish brown algae rich in fiber vitamins and minerals will continue to grow flores and her husband jay douglas own stonington kelp co and have a lease from the state of connecticut to farm 10 acres in fishers island sound not far from latimer reef lighthouse sugar kelp is the only seaweed the state allows to be farmed in the sea for human consumption it s a winter crop started in november with 1 millimeter pieces of seaweed attached to kite string and hung from arrays a series of suspended lines hung between poles think of it like laundry says suzie flores it s just like a laundry line there s two poles a line and you hang sheets of seaweed over them about 4 feet below the surface the seaweed is in constant motion flores said flowing in all directions in concert with the wind current and tide there s a constant energy flowing over the farm and that s really great for the seaweed she said there are environmental as well as the health benefits seaweed helps to remove carbon nitrogen and phosphorus from the water a benefit for marine life said flores seaweed sucks up everything in the water she said like soil for plants it extracts organic and inorganic nitrogen if there is too much nitrogen in the water it suffocates all the other fish and wildlife seaweed allows the ocean to breathe it s a wonderful way to fight climate change her farm is still in its infancy when flores and douglas relocated from new jersey to pawcatuck she began searching for a new career formerly employed in market research her inclination to farm seaweed was helped by the fact that her husband had bought a marina on the pawcatuck river i always had a fascination with the water and conservation and this well it naturally fell into that the fact that i could go out and grow something that is food and put it out in november and harvest it in may well that alone is a personal sense of fulfillment farming something in the ocean is the most humbling thing ever she said in 2016 flores connected with greenwave a branford based nonprofit that trains and supports ocean farmers when she learned she could grow sugar kelp in fishers island sound she was hooked and has been at it ever since greenwave helped her to navigate the permitting process supplied her with her initial seed stock and growing information and she has been learning on the job ever since although she said she still has greenwave on speed dial there have been weather and other hardships and then there was covid which shut down restaurants her primary market but she s still at it and began another season in late november in early spring she will sell her sugar kelp at the stonington farmers market and to local chefs who have found innovative ways to use it renee touponce the executive chef at oyster club in mystic has used it for oils dried it for powders made butter and aioli and wrapped fish in it overnight to season the protein the kelp itself has natural sugars and salt i like to say it has an oceanic umami flavor said touponce it s fresh earthy salty briny but not real brusque i use it all kinds of ways i make a lot of stocks and sauces and i dry it and preserve it i blend it into a powder and i make oils i even use it raw for salad the team at oyster club is planning an event for april 2022 featuring five courses all including seaweed they will team up with flores and other area commercial ocean farmers with a goal of focusing on the unique flavor of the seaweed grown at each farm other chefs are also using the seaweed at shipwright s daughter in mystic flores said the chef has prepared seaweed wrapped scallops noodled sugar kelp in a fish dish and used it for a flan at home flores blanches and freezes some of what she collects to make kelp cubes that she uses in smoothies i combine it with whatever veggies and fruits my kids won t eat to improve the nutrition profile it s like eating fish and getting omega 3 and antioxidants she said she also pickles the stipes or stems of the sugar kelp and serves them with tartar sauce it s the best use for tartar sauce ever she said flores is a founding member of the sugar kelp cooperative organized to help the handful of southeastern connecticut and southern rhode island sugar kelp farmers with post harvest challenges kelp farming fights climate change supports working waterfronts and offers the community a native and healthy super food but it only works if the farmers are able to sell their crops reads a statement on the cooperative s website flores will farm over the winter visiting her beds weekly while few other boaters are out on fishers island sound if everything goes as planned she will begin to harvest her sugar kelp in late march finishing up around memorial day she will be out there in early spring with her gaff hook knife fish baskets and coolers collecting her bounty and bringing it to shore for customers there are challenges she said but we do it because it is good fun it really is it is a wonderful way to help the planet to help cure the ocean of all the crap we have done to it and it is a new economy that we bring to this area where there is a dwindling working waterfront with each growing season flores said she gains more expertise and knowledge you learn a lot about what you farm she said the more you know the more you can predict then you can grow more seaweed suzie flores and jay douglas of stonington kelp co photo by elizabeth ellenwood

how much the world achieved at the 2021 climate talks in glasgow and what happens now depends in large part on where you live in island nations that are losing their homes to sea level rise and in other highly vulnerable countries there were bitter pills to swallow after global commitments to cut emissions fell far short of the goal to keep global warming to 1 5 degrees celsius 2 7 f for large middle income countries like india and south africa there were signs of progress on investments needed for developing clean energy in the developed world countries still have to internalise politically that bills are coming due both at home and abroad after decades of delaying action on climate change the longer the delay the more difficult the transition will be there were also signs of hope as coalitions of companies governments and civil society and indigenous peoples groups forced progress on issues such as stopping deforestation cutting methane ending coal use and boosting zero emissions vehicles now those promises must be acted upon as a former senior un official i ve been involved in the climate negotiations for several years here are some key elements to watch this year as countries move forward on their promises going into the glasgow summit countries commitments had put the world on a trajectory of warming about 2 9 c this century well beyond the 1 5 c goal and into levels of warming that will bring dangerous climate impacts indian prime minister narendra modi s announcement in the first days much to the surprise of indian observers that india would reach net zero emissions by 2070 and generate 50 per cent of its energy from renewables by 2030 helped lower that trajectory to 2 4 c countries agreed to return for the next round of climate talks in november this year in sharm el sheikh egypt with stronger commitments to put the world on track for 1 5 c that turns the spotlight back on national action china reminded everyone while throwing shade at the us that goals must be backed with plans for implementation us cabinet members and congressional leaders had much to say in glasgow about being back after the previous administration withdrew from the paris climate agreement yet they had little to offer in terms of the us share of the finance and the world cast a worried eye over its continued partisan politics while all countries are important for reaching the world s climate goals some are more important than others countries that are high emitters and heavily dependent on coal will be a focus of international attention in the coming months not just to phase down coal but importantly to fund a just transition to green sources of energy and the necessary electricity infrastructure some countries are more important than others for reaching the world s climate goals rachel kyte the poster child for this approach is south africa where a presidential commission has worked for three years to develop a just transition plan and has been able to attract 8 5 billion from the uk eu us and others to help them execute on it that coupled with guarantees and other financial aid that could help draw further private investment could become a replicable model the key was national ownership in the year ahead look for plans to come together in indonesia and vietnam and other countries needing to fast forward away from coal many developing countries already have national platforms to deliver on their commitments but throughout glasgow s conference halls officials complained that finance wasn t flowing to help them succeed this isn t just a climate finance problem many countries are also facing economic disruption from the covid 19 pandemic and have chafed at the way international financial institutions fail to address issues of access to finance and trade advanced economies didn t come to glasgow ready to provide even the 100 billion a year in finance promised a decade ago which shrank the landing zone for agreement on all issues in the end governments agreed to reach the 100 billion annual climate finance target within the next two years and agreed that adaptation funding should double but with the un environment programme estimating that adaptation funds will need to quadruple by 2030 from today s 70 billion there s a long way to go in the first week of glasgow the titans of the financial industry heralded the glasgow financial alliance for net zero the commitment by financial institutions representing 130 trillion in assets to accelerate the transition to a net zero emissions economy the shifts within financial markets away from exposure to carbon emissions was palpable but without more detail the announcement attracted cries of greenwashing the un secretary general announced an expert group to propose clear standards for companies and others making net zero commitments partly in response to furore around greenwashing that group is expected to report back this year at the heart of glasgow was a new seriousness around transparency credibility integrity and accountability watch this unfold this coming year climate action is a three legged stool mitigation adaptation and loss and damage loss and damage was mentioned an unprecedented 12 times in the final glasgow texts but without commitments to funding or mechanisms to secure funding loss and damage or reparations can be understood this way you broke it or endangered it you pay for it but afraid of lawsuits in international courts which the us does not belong to or afraid of the costs developed countries have opposed progress on the issue in recent years developing countries left glasgow disappointed but there was no escaping the debate watch for a design of a mechanism to help pay for loss and damage and plans to start funding it with the next un climate conference in africa this will move centre stage there s a scottish proverb fools look to tomorrow wise men use tonight there were wise people in glasgow and fools too but there s not a night to lose in the year ahead rachel kyte is dean of the fletcher school tufts university massachusetts us this article is republished

to estimate the performance of microdeletion screening tests the times interviewed genetic counselors and experts on medical testing and prenatal care then searched for peer reviewed studies of screenings by us based labs that included follow up diagnostic testing six studies met these criteria three from diagnostic testing labs and three studies funded by one of the test makers natera an additional 2021 report by natera was added as it included results from a recent clinical trial of its microdeletion test an eighth study published in 2015 was excluded because experts identified multiple problems with its methodology reporters then combined the data from these studies and estimated the tests overall positive predictive value to be 15 two researchers reviewed the resulting analysis in addition to clinical data three of the four natera studies include projected performance numbers that are based on reanalysing the blood samples they collected with a modified version of the original test some experts cautioned that this technique known as post hoc analysis can inflate a test s performance others said it was a common practice that helped improve results over time at times the company could not replicate those projections in subsequent studies to be conservative the times used natera s higher projected numbers in its estimates using the clinical data instead would decrease the tests overall positive predictive value from 15 to 11
the prospect of a high end semiconductor industry being established in india is most encouraging pledges from large business houses are in unprecedented tens of thousands of crores apart from the government facilitations and incentives start ups and design studious india crossed 1 40 billion in population on christmas day 2021 at these levels population is a definite drag on progress putting pressure on resources natural and monetary any amount of growth is contending with a birth every second even if we don t like our babies trafficked by unscrupulous elements in our midst this is followed by a death in every three seconds we are slowing the rate of population growth but the juggernaut will still be unrelenting taking us to 1 70 billion for the best part of this century however to be the fastest growing economy in the world is both a saviour and no small thing but other rich countries have stable populations that haven t grown in decades they don t have or particularly need our economic growth rates to live a prosperous life in the main to grow faster we need economic reform and the good thing about economic reform is that it can rarely be reversed it provides benefits and opens vistas the country s response to the global desire to relocate here instead of china has already begun to prove economically beneficial it brings in new technology and expertise and provides fresh employment the prospect of a high end semiconductor industry being established in india is most encouraging pledges from large business houses are in unprecedented tens of thousands of crores apart from the government facilitations and incentives start ups and design studious various ipos supporting the new start ups and unicorns are new avenues for growth though a long way behind america and china india has become the third biggest unicorn generating country divestments of government owned enterprises are also growing our stock and debt markets northwards of 3 trillion likewise an aatmanirbhar and joint venturing defence manufacturing and space satellite missile making industry growing rapidly will transform our economic and strategic capabilities in fact in many of these new areas initial estimates of contribution and growth may well be overtaken this government s impressive efforts in modernising and creating new infrastructure electrical power mining and mineral production alternative energy 5g connectivity on the anvil all contribute in real terms to the ease of doing business they contribute to improved logistics and connectivity the same applies to modernised railway systems new city metros sea transport better airport infrastructure digitisation has grown at such a pace that it is unmatched by other countries in both size and scale improved agricultural infrastructure seeds fertilizers and practices at various states are not only resulting in better farmer incomes but fostering exports at a new level of growth the impact of dynamic diplomacy has improved our security and opened up joint venture cooperation with several countries india has become perhaps for the first time a truly favoured destination aided and abetted by the leading nations of this world in every region there are optimistic forecasts of gdp growth in fiscal 2022 ranging from the prime minister s advisory council s 7 5 to 9 1 goldman sachs and 8 5 imf this is most welcome after successive waves of the paralysing and expensive covid pandemic and its variations omicron is not yet done with different prescriptions are being offered to the government some say raise interest rates others advocate boosted capital expenditure is inflation from high fuel prices a persistent threat it is common sense to expect a surge from sectors such as real estate hospitality aviation all brought to a near standstill during successive lockdowns real estate fuelled in part by black money is also the second largest employer not much focused on is the advent of a series of assembly elections in five states in 2022 and then some more in 2023 before the general elections in 2024 these will all result in large expenditures and consumption led growth the imf is very bullish on india with its chief economist gita gopinath moving up to deputy managing director this year gopinath expects a rush of fdi investment for india s political stability fiscal responsibility including repayment of loans on time and massive demand projections of course india s successive union budgets and legislation must support the process and keep up the momentum the world bank is similarly positioned the fact is india should be experiencing double digit growth year on year for several going forward the reason this remains elusive is because of an ideological undertow in bureaucratic and political quarters that is suspicious of economic reform this government has consistently tried to balance its reformist and economic growth inducing moves with massive poverty alleviation schemes still we have put some of the over staffing inefficiency price controls subsidies non mechanisation losses shortages of essential goods and services the licence permit raj behind us but obtuse trade unionism is very much with us they are when financed by the left ranged against bank merger and privatisation psu divestment as in air india dilution of the government s stake in large state enterprises such as the lic these forces do not want loss making bsnl sold off they don t want labour or land reform the judiciary in dire need of reform itself supports most leftist and status quoist positions it tacitly supported the farmer protests that successfully blocked reform favouring the small and marginal farmers the judiciary has successfully blocked its own reform even as millions of cases await judgement china and pakistan do not want to let india make progress they are aided by anti national forces supported by foreign islamists church funds chinese leftist monies insurgents terrorists maoists separatists certain opposition political parties democracy itself and the indian constitution are being twisted to suit a bizarre break india narrative these forces combined want to see india under expensive military pressure on its borders they help by also creating broad based domestic unrest on an elevated basis it is as if the more the economic progress india makes the more these people intensify their efforts so even as all economic logic dictates that india is bound to march onwards and upwards it cannot do so smoothly without confronting and vanquishing the negative forces that besiege it this will need resolute administration and the continued electoral support of the majority of the indian people a key point of departure viewed both as a positive by many and a negative by those opposed is that this government is strongly and unabashedly hindu nationalist it is rapidly creating new political and cultural narratives the sizeable 200 million muslims of india are worried about their erstwhile position of privilege this even though their level of education is at an abysmal 2 of their number how can they hope to grasp at the benefits that flow from education beyond the madrasa other minorities such as the christians and now the khalistanis among sikhs too have taken a petulant stance they all fear hindu domination restrictions being placed on induced or forced conversion is also bothering them and yet internationally india is regarded admiringly as a wise and peaceful hindu country despite its secular pretensions there seems little chance of a threatened majority irked by aggressive minorityism backing down any time soon a new reality is being engineered all indians will have to find their own place in it this too is grist to the economic mill and the sooner people fall in line the better as for china and pakistan things are likely to come to a head in the near future and when they do should india prevail militarily as it is expected to by many strategic think tanks it will enter a new trajectory unfettered by the sword of damocles hanging over its head the writing on the wall is that the bulk of the international community despite shrill condemnation from certain fringes is more than willing to do business with india after the jolt that many have received from china based losses the sincerity of the indian offers is being appreciated the numbers projected in any economic assessment and forecast always speak of a potential but it is the determination of the government to see it through that counts both in the short and long term progress in a democracy as raucous as ours cannot be a cakewalk opposition has to be ground down over time however we have already received the transformative benefits of bold policies for three decades since 1991 there is a broad consensus in favour of modernisation infrastructure and economic reform that will take this country to the kind of maximum prosperity possible for a people so numerous

it followed from the special theory of relativity that mass and energy are both but different manifestations of the same thing a somewhat unfamiliar conception for the average mind albert einstein you ve heard and seen it plenty of times einstein s most famous equation e mc2 i ve taken you inside this equation before which lays out how much energy is stored in matter at rest and tells you how much energy you need to create matter in the first place image credit niels madsen alpha swansea cern that s right you can create matter directly from energy we do it all the time in fact in particle accelerators in stars like the sun around black holes and neutron stars and in cosmic catastrophes we re constantly creating new matter purely out of energy it s pretty simple take two protons with enough energy smash them together and you get out three protons and one antiproton this is the exact process that used to take place at the old fermilab accelerator image credit scott kirchner of university of alaska fairbanks this is how we ve made the vast majority of antimatter here on earth and if you add up all the kinetic energy of the four particles that come out you ll find that it s smaller than the kinetic energy of the two protons you started with by exactly the mass of a proton and an antiproton times the speed of light squared that s what e mc2 tells us that mass is just one form of energy and that mass can be created or destroyed very easily so long as you convert that mass into another form of energy there are other conservation rules that you may need to obey as well but you must always conserve the total amount of energy as far as our experiments can tell but there s a far more common and even mundane application of einstein s most famous equation every single nuclear and chemical reaction ever image credit woodbank communications ltd 2005 you ve heard of a nuclear reaction it s where we either take lower mass nuclei and combine them to make one or more higher mass nucleus that s fusion or we take heavy nuclei and split them apart into lower mass ones that s fission in both cases the amount of energy that comes out is huge even though the changes in mass are relatively tiny the most powerful nuclear explosion in history the tsar bomba which released nearly 60 megatons of energy converted less than 50 grams under 2 ounces of mass into energy image credit pearson education inc benjamin cummings but e mccomes into play in much less spectacular places than that the paltry chemical reactions that underlie all the biological and inorganic processes of everyday life are all based on how electrons are bound to atoms and molecules there are different energy levels and configurations that electrons transitions between bonds are formed broken and re formed and energy is either absorbed or emitted to balance each individual reaction out the crazy part when a plant absorbs a photon for photosynthesis it increases in mass in direct proportion to the energy of the photon it absorbed following the law of e mc2 when a human burns through his or her chemical fuel in order to maintain their body temperature they lose mass in direct proportion to the energy released from the breaking of those chemical bonds in fact if i did something as simple as weighed a free electron and a free proton on one end of a scale and weighed a neutral ground state hydrogen atom on the other end i d find that the free electron and proton weighed more by 13 6 ev c2 exactly the mass equivalent of the energy needed to ionize a neutral hydrogen atom when you combust hydrogen gas with oxygen gas to make water it gives off energy as made famous by the hindenburg disaster image credit ap photo philadelphia public ledger ho yet the water that s the product of the reaction actually is slightly lower in mass than the hydrogen and oxygen that came before how much lower in mass by the exact amount of energy that was released divided by the speed of light squared because if e mc2 then it s also true that e c2 m so every time you do something that releases energy you re losing mass in direct proportion to the amount of energy that s released and similarly every time you absorb energy you gain mass in direct proportion to the amount of energy that s absorbed so what this means is that mass is a form of energy and that these two quantities no matter what you do to a system are proportional to one another in terms of an equation e m but to turn that proportional symbol into an equal sign you need to get the conversion factor right the conversion factor is what tells you how energy is related to mass quantitatively image via david topper and dwight vincent of the university of winnipeg and that conversion factor is the speed of light squared figuring all of this out was just one of einstein s great contributions to our understanding of the universe and that was 108 years ago already believe it or not even though you probably never think about it e mc2 or e c2 m affects practically everything that occurs in our world each time you bat an eyelid flex a muscle breathe in or out think a thought or beat your heart you re converting mass into energy and each time you digest a meal you re converting energy back into mass everything that adds or subtracts energy from a system causes its mass to change and we can even figure out down to the tiniest amounts measurable by how much how through e mc2

john stossel columnist it s the season for giving i ll give this week i ll donate to the doe fund a charity that helps drug users and ex cons find purpose in life through work work works they say it sure does most doe fund workers find more joy in supporting themselves than they ever found in drugs i ll also donate to student sponsor partners a nonprofit that gives scholarships to at risk kids so they can escape bad public schools ssp sends them to catholic school i m not catholic but i support ssp because government run schools are often so bad that catholic schools do better at half the cost thousands of families have broken the cycle of poverty thanks to ssp when i was young i assumed government would lift people out of poverty it s inexcusable that there are so many poor people in this rich country my college professors taught government programs will raise skill levels improve parenting give a leg up to the poor that s when the war on poverty began at the time many americans were already lifting themselves out of poverty year by year the number of families below the poverty line defined as earning less than three times what they need to feed themselves had decreased then came the people from the government with their programs they spent almost 30 trillion on their war they made some progress for about seven years the poverty rate dropped but then progress mostly stopped that s because many people became dependent on government handouts learned helplessness it s called government poverty programs created an underclass generations of people who don t work because they lose benefits if they do this passivity was something new and bad that s why it s better when charities help people charity managers can make judgments about who really needs help and who needs a kick in the butt charities can discourage dependence best way to help is capitalism but there s an even better way to help people capitalism not that i ll convince most people when elon musk was named time magazine s person of the year sen elizabeth warren complained that musk should pay taxes and stop freeloading off everyone else freeloading i will pay more taxes than any american in history 11 billion this year musk responded don t spend it all at once oh wait you did already love that answer show him 6b will solve world hunger and he ll pay musk is skeptical about charity too the united nations world food programme asked billionaires to donate 6 6 billion musk replied if the wfb could describe exactly how 6b will solve world hunger i will sell tesla stock right now and do it the wfb already spends more than 6 billion and the group says 6b will not solve world hunger but will prevent geopolitical instability mass migration and save 42 million people on the brink of starvation musk didn t donate that may be wise given how much international food aid already gets wasted musk does give to charities but he s called a cheapskate for not giving more i m ok with musk not giving more it doesn t make him a bad guy some billionaires do nasty things mark zuckerberg censors truthful reporting zuckerberg and jeff bezos sneakily lobby for regulations like a minimum wage that hurt their competitors but i d still rather they spend their money than give it to some charities zuckerberg invents better ways to connect with people bezos makes shopping cheaper and easier musk makes satellite internet available to more people businesses do things like that because competition forces them to spend money well if they don t they disappear government never disappears even when it fails warren calls musk a freeloader because he doesn t pay more taxes but entrepreneurs like musk are national treasures capitalists are the people who do the most good for the world people hate them but it s capitalists who create the jobs lift people out of poverty and feed the world i m a reporter not an entrepreneur i m not likely to invent something new and useful so today i ll give money to charity it makes me happy but the world benefits more from people like elon musk if they just keep inventing things john stossel is creator of stossel tv and author of give me a break how i exposed hucksters cheats and scam artists and became the scourge of the liberal media
as rapidly warming oceans continue to drive maine lobster into more remote waters some in the state s fishing industry regard sea scallop farming as the prime candidate to help bring added stability to the industry and offset anticipated revenue losses but to fully capitalize on the species renowned for its delicate texture and taste the industry must solve a handful of nagging problems maine s scallop fishery has been notoriously unstable over the past few decades culminating in an outright crash in the mid 2000s from which the commercial fishery still hasn t fully recovered aside from concerns about overfishing which maine regulators have addressed through rotating fishery closures harvesters also must contend with testing for biotoxins found naturally in scallops which can add substantially to their cost but automation technology and farming techniques borrowed from more mature scallop fisheries as far away as japan are giving some maine seafood harvesters cause for optimism they believe the growth potential for sustainable farm raised scallops is nearly limitless in maine if they can just figure out the right approach and make it affordable a few maine aquaculturists are pioneering this new frontier but before it can appeal to the masses the enthusiasts must figure out how to lower the costs for gear make the technology more accessible and work out the testing requirements some say scallops represent maine s best chance to replace the revenue expected to be lost as the state s commercial lobster fishery faces continued threats from global warming competing marine uses and tougher environmental regulations advertisement one of the reasons we started farming scallops was because even though there s a hesitancy for most people to admit it there s an awful lot of storms on the horizon for the lobster industry said alex de koning of bar harbor based mussel and oyster farm acadia aqua farms it s a tough nut to crack but if you crack it your potential benefits are just tremendous acadia aqua farms has been open about its experimental approach to scallop farming and is eager to share that information with others a practice that de koning said is as much about building goodwill as it is about self preservation if something happens to the lobster industry maine will need another fishery poised to pick up the slack de koning said he believes scallops could fit the bill but figuring out how to make scallop farming viable and sustainable on a large scale in maine takes time and money we re pouring tens of thousands of dollars into trying to learn to farm scallops and we ve had three meals he said it s not something you do thinking you re going to make a quick buck but hopefully it will make it easier for the next group of people to come in jaw dropping opportunity valued at about 6 8 million scallops were maine s third most lucrative catch in 2020 well behind the 406 million lobster fishery and the 15 6 million softshell clam fishery advertisement the state s commercial scallop fishery has experienced several ups and downs in previous decades including a near collapse in 2005 when it landed just 33 000 pounds of scallop meat valued at about 272 000 according to state department of marine resources data at the maine scallop industry s peak in 1981 it had hauled in 3 8 million pounds of meat valued at 15 2 million following the 2005 collapse maine implemented new regulations to help rebuild the wild stocks and prevent overfishing including rotating areas where scallops can be fished each year the fishery has stabilized over the most recent decade bringing in a more moderate 506 000 to 796 000 pounds of meat each year since 2013 valued at between 4 6 million and 9 4 million in 2020 scallopers harvested about 659 000 pounds of scallop meat wild caught scallops need to be shucked immediately as the majority of a fully grown scallop can carry dangerous levels of biotoxins that can cause a slew of symptoms ranging from nausea and vomiting to seizures short term memory loss and loss of motor control in the arms and legs limited numbers of whole scallops are harvested in the united states but in maine fishermen are required to shuck their scallops while still at sea and toss everything overboard but the adductor muscle the meaty white cylinder typically recognized as a scallop the adductor which does not take up the same levels of toxins only accounts for about 15 percent of the total organism so figures are generally reported as meat pounds rather than the total weight advertisement maine scallop landings accounted for just over 1 percent of the u s scallop market in 2020 that year the united states landed almost 49 million pounds of sea scallop meat valued at about 486 million according to the national marine fisheries service s commercial landings database with the majority coming from massachusetts virginia and new jersey in 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic the fishery was valued at around 572 million u s interests imported an additional 195 million worth of scallops from other countries in 2020 in 2019 before the pandemic the country imported more than 208 million in scallops what if maine could pick up some or all of that business dana morse a fisheries and aquaculture specialist at the maine sea grant federal state partnership program at the university of maine believes maine is poised to capture a much larger share of the global scallop industry when you take a look at the magnitude of opportunity there it s pretty jaw dropping morse said advertisement compared with other states maine has a relatively shallow fishery meaning the animals are about as fresh as they can be giving maine a reputation for a pretty top notch scallop he said when the maine scallop is right morse said you just can t beat it charismatic bivalves all scallop aquaculture in maine relies on the wild population unlike with oysters there are no scallop hatcheries though scientists and aquaculturists are working to change that scallops are broadcast spawners meaning they shoot the sperm and eggs up into the water where hopefully they ll meet to fertilize said phoebe jekielek director of research at the hurricane island center for science and leadership once fertilized the larval scallops float in the water column for just over a month it s during this period that farmers will deploy mesh spat bags to collect the baby scallops advertisement they make their way into the bags attach with the silky byssal threads they have when young and grow there for a while until they re eventually too big to swim back out scallops the most charismatic of the bivalves according to jekielek are active constantly clapping swimming and squirting water because of this they require a great deal of space if packed too tightly scallops are prone to knifing one another wherein their shells get intertwined and cut the other s innards as they grow to a mature width of about 4 inches which can take over four years scallops frequently need to be thinned out and separated in u s aquaculture scallops are grown using two primary methods though other technologies are being explored lantern nets the more common of the two are large accordionlike nets with 10 levels that hang vertically in the water column on horizontal lines as they grow the scallops are re sorted into more lantern nets and given more space advertisement in the other technique called ear hanging once the scallops are large enough the farmer drills a small hole in the shell and attaches a plastic pin allowing scallops to hang in pairs from a line in the water with the pins the scallops are kept in place can t knife each other and don t need to be thinned out other methods and tools have been used such as the bottom cages typically seen on oyster farms as well as pearl nets and stackable trays it may sound simple but the work is labor intensive time consuming costly and requires significant space all deterrents for many who might otherwise be interested in entering the burgeoning market made in japan there are some technologies that can help though alex de koning the bar harbor mussel farmer said his family has been experimenting with scallops to determine whether farming the traditional 4 inch scallop for its adductor meat can be a profitable enterprise for the business advertisement the de konings recently used funds from an atlantic states marine fisheries commission grant to buy a new automatic ear hanging machine from tokyo based towa denki co ltd to streamline the ear hanging process the machine which the farm is sharing with others allows it to pin more than 6 000 scallops in a day more than three times the number it could do by hand according to a recent article in the new york times brunswick based community development group coastal enterprises inc or cei also has purchased a few of the japanese machines for growers to use in 2016 cei and friends of aomori a sister state group between maine and aomori prefecture in japan organized a trip to japan for shellfish growers and fishermen to see how a mature successful scallop industry operates cei and maine sea grant also purchased a high pressure scallop washer and a lantern net washer to help rid both gear and shellfish of the biofouling material that is prone to collect on them such technologies are expensive though and as a result aren t accessible to all maine farmers who might want to try their hand at scallops the pressure washer for example is priced such that it is being passed around among multiple farms jekielek said advertisement whole scallop experiment marsden brewer owner of penbay farmed scallops in stonington has been a commercial fisherman for most of his life when his son bob was in high school brewer worried about what the future would hold neither ground fishing nor lobstering seemed like a stable occupation given the fisheries ongoing problems and he didn t see a lot of opportunity for himself or his son eventually brewer decided the problem wasn t that there were too many fishermen it was that there weren t enough fish so he looked to aquaculture as a way to grow more and develop a sustainable fishery i got tired of worrying about limitations he said i wanted to do something where i could maybe realize my potential now brewer and his adult son operate the state s most successful scallop farm with 8 acres of lease site between them and another 3 acres pending approval from the department of marine resources advertisement unlike most scallop farmers the brewers grow petite and medium size scallops which don t take up the same level of toxins and can be sold whole the shorter growing period a year and a half to two years compared with four or more allows them to sell more scallops the bivalves are also less likely to knife each other when smaller thus requiring less space and using up less gear last year the brewers harvested about 90 000 scallops and they expect to harvest similar numbers again next year this year they collected roughly 350 000 juvenile scallops or spat which will be ready in another few years brewer expects about two thirds of those will make it to market as one of the first in maine to try such a thing brewer admitted it was pretty scary at the outset and said there are definite challenges frequent expensive testing for biotoxins being one of them but he s grown optimistic last year brewer and local author marnie reed crowell published a book recipe ideas for farmed sea scallops the whole story showcasing recipes from around the world that exemplify cooking with the whole scallop international markets especially in asian countries are chock full of whole scallop offerings in the united states it s more limited with chefs currently being the main buyers said morse the umaine aquaculture specialist it allows chefs to play with new ideas try new things he said as they experiment more it really opens the door to more than just the scallop meat market it s essentially a whole new market within the united states advertisement like the brewers ken sparta of spartan sea farms in freeport is hoping to carve out his own path one virtually untrodden in maine and grow a live whole scallop market sparta who grows scallops quahogs oysters and kelp believes scallop aquaculture could one day eclipse oysters one of the biggest farmed ocean species in the state certainly the audience is much bigger he said about scallops sparta estimated he has about 8 000 scallops that will be ready for the meat market next year and another 35 000 ready for the half shell market almost immediately as soon as he gets approval from the department of marine resources with oysters he said you eat the whole animal and it s just one texture with scallops there are three textures and three flavors there s the adductor muscle that everyone knows and loves he said comparing it to a perfect piece of steak then there s the roe the reproductive glands which are more akin to that of an oyster in texture and the mantle which is almost crunchy like minced cucumbers according to jekielek the hurricane island center research director the market presents a unique opportunity to get a fresh scallop product all year round advertisement if we can develop the testing how to safely and successfully implement a whole scallop market that s pretty amazing she said it s a really unique way to tap into a whole new area we can t access with wild caught right now there are currently 37 leases approved to farm sea scallops most of which are designated for multiple species and are not actively farming scallops or are not focused on scallops the testing problem it s the testing challenge that remains one of the biggest hurdles for developing a fully realized market for whole scallops because of the high levels of biotoxins in scallops in order to sell them safely and legally samples need to be tested frequently in the summer months brewer will drive scallop samples to the laboratory once per week roughly six hours round trip for up to 150 for a round of tests advertisement that drops down to every few weeks in the fringe seasons but it s still costly in both time and money it s nuts brewer said it won t kill the industry but it s been holding it back for now maine sea grant is able to help cover the cost of testing morse said but ordinarily that cost falls to the producer it is unclear whether the department of marine resources might consider covering those costs in the future some maine scientists are working to develop a lower cost comprehensive testing technique which morse said will need federal approval climate change also presents a set of challenges morse said but the direct impacts are still largely unknown for example water temperature salinity and other factors could impact the currents and therefore the distribution of scallop larvae the timing of spawning larval development and settlement pests and potential pathogens such as bacteria warming waters also may have an effect on scallop growth and survival the sweet spot for scallop growth is between 50 and 63 degrees the gear is also expensive and requires significant capital in order to produce enough scallops to be profitable there s no spat hatchery so the industry is still reliant on wild scallop reproduction which as mentioned may be vulnerable to climate change despite these challenges brewer is confident that within a few years the scallop segment of maine s aquaculture industry will have grown substantially right now there s a lot of sitting back and waiting he said fishermen are opportunists once they ve seen someone has been really successful with it

the axe and tax it is no longer farming as usual not in any part of the north it is a measure of how bandits have not only laid waste the general routine of life in the north it tells a graphically sad tale of the tragedy of bread and butter in the country bandits now stop farmers from going to their places of work if they do not stop them they decide on what terms they can perform their workaday obligations they either seek ransom or force them to pay taxes the farms in the north take quite long journeys for the rustic folks they walk long hours because of vast often dry and scraggy landscapes it takes long hours of sweat and exhaustion the journey basically on foot on their way they meet the bad men defiant without hoods and barking orders they detain and order to pay taxes some analysts say it is even a happy experience that the encounters do not result in deaths rather they live to be taxed another day in borno state earlier in 2021 some farmers dropped to saga of slaughter on their way to their farms the president s special adviser on media garba shehu said rather glibly that they did not take permission before going out to the farm that day it was one of the major absurdities of the year they were according to him supposed to inform the military who should have escorted them to their place of work that in itself typifies the precarious life of the farmer it also explains the official helplessness to save the farm not only for the farmer but also for the nation and its food with the hoodlums in control of the farms they have become the lords of agriculture but they are not lords to bring food on the table but to suffocate it the average farmer is a poor man they do not run large estates but big enough for their average needs that is subsistence and afterwards for trade it is a combination of the farms that make up the large trucks of produce and crops that feed vast populations in the north and south of the country the hefty cargoes of tomatoes onions millets yams pepper as well as livestock are at stake they have been at stake since the bandits saw the farmers as cash cow rather than celebrate them as suppliers of cash crops as well produce that feed the average citizen they have been doing so since they gained dreary traction in our land it is also an irony that the federal government s cornerstone economic programme of the buhari administration is agriculture with great emphasis on the local farmer the central bank of nigeria in its activist role has been rolling out packages of assistance to farmers across the country for loans and other forms of support the bandits stand not only in the way of the farmer s ability to make good their promise to translate support into productivity but it frustrates the government s drive to engender prosperity through policy the north has had a culture of contented farming they produced and fed the people but we have not developed our system to support the farmer in a secure way in the west especially in the united states the agricultural sector is coddled so much so that the farmer is subsidised heavily they want it that way because the system prizes food on the table as the first step to prosperity that is why even the farmer is pampered to the extent that they are paid not to farm their silos are full and to produce more will be a waste that waste contrasts to nigeria where we have had farms that produced more than we store the food went often to waste and even still do that shows how we have not organised our agriculture to withstand cultural perversions we did not have enough silos we still don t for our potential now we cannot even make enough because bandits want to take from the little they allow to grow and harvest this has had implications for food security in various parts of the country complaints over rise in food prices complicate the narrative of agriculture in the country livestock including live hens and cocks as well as turkeys were not readily available during the end of year festivities they were too expensive indeed they made the allure of imported ones stronger such that nigerians made their bodies susceptible to the chemicalised poisons of the imported stock with their auguries for malignancies this makes the question of security essential it is the dinner table consequence of banditry people cannot feed well because criminals are hungry for slaughter in this environment it takes courage to be a farmer it takes courage to feed the nigerian today it is because of cowards who must rely on hardworking people to make a living hoodlums cannot be allowed to continue to hold sway in this new year we need to tackle the bandits it shows that peace cannot be divorced from our ability to feed ourselves in an age where agriculture is following different chains we are not going beyond the basic level of feeding our families

tantalizing us with hope only to pummel us again i m pretty confident that we ll remember this as an exasperating year of stops and starts yet despite the bullying of the past 12 months maine restaurants bars and food businesses have persisted thumbing their noses at the emotional roller coaster and delivering guests joy in often literal bite sized portions when i look back on the past 52

king cake ever sipped bracingly cold loire valley white wine in a north haven barn and reminisced about the local dining scene with four of my dine out predecessors not bad at all whatever else i

was seriously considering selecting chris wilcox s compact knightville bistro for this category i also expressed a little concern that judy gibson might not be quite new enough to qualify after all it did open in march of 2020 two short weeks before well you know honestly i think time has lost all meaning my friend said especially when you re talking about a place that has had to close and reopen several times i couldn t agree more against all odds 2021 has allowed wilcox s moderately priced new american restaurant to experience its first mostly complete year in business that s enough runway for the menu to evolve from tasty yet temporary stopgaps like fried chicken and wedge salads into the more imaginative technically demanding dishes that wilcox has been serving since may and with this recent blossoming of judy gibson s menu diners have been rewarded for their patience indoor and outdoor parties alike have been treated to plates like hearty tuna crudo with barely cooked chickpeas and meaty palm shaped fronds of maitake mushroom or a blushing sweet savory duck breast seared chicory and a nutty risotto style farro pilaf and don t get me started on the delicate potato and semolina gnocchi a menu staple wilcox might not be a strictly italian chef but his gnocchi are world class advertisement but more than the consistently excellent cooking it s wilcox s vision that impresses most it would have been easy for him to retread the greatest hits from his four star turn at the helm of the velveteen habit a short lived farm to table successor to arrows in ogunquit

with cash yields near zero and safe bonds paying little more many u s investors say they have no choice but to take more risk if they want to grow their money while that may be true investors also appear to be chasing the same investments in their quest for higher returns stretching valuations and ratcheting up risk notably junk bonds real estate and u s large capitalization growth stocks are overrun with investors yields on junk bonds and real estate investment trusts are the lowest on record yields and prices move in opposite directions the u s stock market which is dominated by large cap growth stocks is by most valuation measures more expensive than at any time except the peak of the dot com bubble in 1999 and by some measures it s even more expensive the danger is that record high valuations have a habit of tumbling from their perch there s not much investors can do about junk bonds and reits other than limit their exposure but when it comes to stocks there are many alternatives to large growth companies in the u s including small companies value stocks and foreign markets they ve been horrible performers in recent years leaving them cheap and unloved which is precisely why they merit another look

what an awful year this was i sincerely hope the coming year is better here are a few loose ends that need clearing up as that dreadful year drops off into memory the first priority is to hold public health authorities responsible for the mess they made professor glenn reynolds has my vote for holding them accountable they lied to us manipulated us for political purposes and completely betrayed our trust he summarizes their acts and argues it s time for a rigorous investigation perhaps a truth and reconciliation commission with subpoena power to get to the bottom of how our public health authorities have mismanaged this pandemic there s certainly no chance that the existing establishment will do so sheryl attkisson offers a more complete 57 count indictment of our public health officials conduct concluding that they depended completely on vaccination which has proven a total failure as a record number of people were vaccinated a record number have gotten covid here s her damning list in its entirety because i need to remind you of how substantially they abused our trust 1 funded dangerous gain of function research with our adversary china using us taxpayer money in order to create vaccines and other medicine 2 denied such funding had occurred 3 claimed the lab theory was debunked when it hadn t been investigated 4 allowed china not to cooperate with the pandemic investigation never imposed serious sanctions or repercussions for the non cooperation 5 failed to disclose their own role in gain of function research while publicly debunking u s involvement in it 6 conspired to have public officials make statements and publish papers claiming the lab theory had been debunked when it hadn t been 7 encouraged the censorship of factual information on the news and the internet 8 claimed would take years for a the first covid 19 vaccine to be released 9 conspired to controversialize scientists researchers and journalists who tell the truth about various aspects of covid and the vaccines 10 falsely claimed certain gatherings such as the sturgis motorcycle rally were super spreader events when they were not 11 distorted and exaggerated statistics to make it appear as though people were infected at events when they were not 12 sent covid infected elderly from hospitals to nursing homes where they mass infected other vulnerable residents 13 said masks don t work 14 said masks do work 15 required wearing of masks 16 recommended wearing of more than one mask 17 failed to wear masks themselves when required 18 said kids don t need masks 19 said kids must mask 20 said kids don t need to get vaccinated because their risk is so small 21 said kids must be vaccinated because their risk is so great 22 told people to isolate at home even though that s how most covid cases are spread 23 closed parks beaches and outdoor venues even though covid is rarely if ever transmitted outside 24 arrested people for being outside unmasked even though they were among the safest population 25 falsely claimed that early vaccine studies showed that those with natural immunity from prior infection benefit from vaccination 26 covered up estimate of number of naturally immune for many months 27 closed schools against the advice of many scientists distorting education for a generation of students 28 conspired to censor scientists reporters and others who report factually on covid therapeutics vaccine issues 29 overcounted covid cases and deaths by counting people with covid but who were not sick from covid 30 shut down and destroyed the economy without improving covid situation 31 caused the firing of people who cannot get or choose not to get vaccinated even though they may have natural immunity or medical conditions that prevent them from taking vaccine risks 32 blanket recommended vaccination for people who are at high risk of adverse events such as heart inflammation and blood clots 33 falsely claimed vaccines prevent covid infection 34 falsely claimed vaccines prevent covid spread 35 falsely claimed vaccinated do not get sick with covid 36 falsely claimed vaccinated do not get hospitalized or die of covid 37 claimed that the vaccinated who get ill with covid would be sicker if not vaccinated when there is no evidence that is the case with any individual 38 failed to provide informed consent and warn of covid 19 vaccine side effects prior to administration 39 claimed vaccines are highly effective 40 claimed vaccines worked well against variants 41 recommended up to 4 shots in one year because of vaccine ineffectiveness while claiming vaccines are highly effective 42 ignored the power of natural immunity and the hundreds of studies supporting it 43 punished medical doctors who prescribe therapeutics 44 punished scientists who researched therapeutics 45 use the power and size of the federal government to bully and threaten companies into requiring vaccination despite their ineffectiveness in preventing covid infection or spread 46 failed to promote effective therapeutics which can save lives 47 withheld and prevented treatment and resources based on political calculations 48 downplayed vaccine adverse events 49 ignored pleas from vaccine injured to investigate and publicize their cases to prevent other injuries 50 exaggerated serious risks from covid 19 51 impacted military readiness by firing those who cannot or choose not to get covid 19 vaccine even if naturally immune 52 impacted health care system capacity by firing those who cannot or choose not to get covid 19 vaccine even if naturally immune 53 impacted first responder industry by firing those who cannot or choose not to get covid 19 vaccine even if naturally immune 54 impacted education system by firing educators who cannot or choose not to get covid 19 vaccine even if naturally immune 55 recommended vaccination for healthy children and others at near zero risk of serious impact from covid 19 illness 56 failed to discuss potential role of vitamins sunshine exercise weight control and healthy diet 57 mislabeled covid 19 a pandemic of the unvaccinated in a failed propaganda campaign i need to remind you because every day in every way including all the advice columns their readers rely on these failures are ignored and families told things like it s a good idea to ban the unvaccinated from family gatherings and that people who refuse them are selfish and putting their children s lives at risk i cannot recall this country ever falling under such fact free mass hysteria and if you still harbor any doubt after the cdc okayed the george floyd demonstrations that its proscriptions were political new evidence was unearthed this week showing that the white house department of health and human services and the centers for disease control were guided less by science than politics on school reopening guidelines the rules were dictated not by science but on a political decision to follow the teachers unions desires speaking of losing the public trust the jeffrey epstein case and his death while in custody engendered a lot of deserved skepticism this week s conviction of his gal pal ghislaine maxwell still leaves a lot of unanswered questions apart from the big ones how did he really die and how on earth did he amass so much money with so little experience professor alan dershowitz asks why did maxwell s chief accuser virginia giuffre avoid being charged with the same grooming charge maxwell was when the government s own witness accused her under oath of such conduct why in fact was she never even called as a witness in the maxwell trial there are some substantial reasons to believe that she is not credible and her accusations against prominent people are false something her lawyers concede he concluded the truth will come out and it may surprise you you may recall that the two jail guards on duty the night epstein died were charged with sleeping on the job dereliction of duty and falsifying records something that if epstein did commit suicide would result only in loss of jobs and maybe a fine says jazz shaw instead they faced criminal charges which the prosecution dropped on december 13 an act that did not appear on the court s docket until last week one day after maxwell was convicted maybe they fully cooperated and the prosecution held the news until after the conviction because they felt it was safer to do so on the other hand if maxwell doubts epstein killed himself and at least one of the guards must have known about it you might conclude the dropping of the cases against them is a good reason for her not to spill any beans something post conviction she might be inclined to do in exchange for a lesser sentence finally there s the administration s practice of using private agencies to command unconstitutional acts they could not get away with doing on their own and there s a growing counteraction against these overreaching mandates nasdaq urged all companies on its exchange to have at least two diversity hires on their board of directors one who self identifies as female and one who self identifies as an underrepresented minority or lgbtq and if they do not comply the companies must explain why they deviated from this standard the government approved this diversity rule in august as a stockholder or employee of a nasdaq corporation would attest their welfare and returns depend on the most qualified persons serving on the board as a civil libertarian i contend all quotas of this nature violate the constitution several gop governors agree and filed a legal brief supporting a case in the fifth circuit which contends the rule violates both the constitution and exceeds the sec and nasdaq statutory authority stay on your toes this year as it s increasingly likely the democrats are in deep doodoo in the coming midterm elections every trick in the book will be utilized to get through their blinkered policies and programs any way possible before the deluge
these pot stocks will have investors seeing green in the new year for many investors the new year brings new opportunities to find attractive stocks in high growth industries among all the industries to choose from there may not be a better blend of growth and value at the moment than cannabis stocks specifically those in the united states according to estimates from cannabis analytics company bdsa worldwide weed sales are expected to double from 31 billion in 2021 to 62 1 billion by 2026 the bulk of this nominal growth will originate in the united states although marijuana stocks were a buzzkill last year after federal cannabis reform measures once again failed to gain traction in congress they re now about as inexpensive as they ve ever been with that being said these are the five best marijuana stocks to buy in 2022 trulieve cannabis the easiest way to see green in the cannabis space is to buy the most nominally profitable pot stock trulieve cannabis tcnnf 5 97 trulieve like many of the stocks on this list is a vertically integrated multi state operator mso that controls most aspects of the seed to sale process but its path to profitability was a lot different than that of most pot stocks instead of setting up shop in as many legalized states as possible trulieve focused most of its attention on florida s medical marijuana market as of dec 30 trulieve had 160 operating dispensaries nationwide 112 of which were in the sunshine state saturating florida has allowed trulieve to gobble up half of the state s dried cannabis flower and oils market all while keeping its marketing budget relatively low the result three consecutive years of profitability in an industry where only a handful of companies are currently profitable the excitement for 2022 revolves around trulieve s acquisition of mso harvest health recreation which was completed during the fourth quarter harvest health s home market is arizona which voted to legalize recreational weed in november 2020 and began retailing adult use cannabis in january 2021 trulieve has 17 dispensaries in the state and a clear pathway to leading market share with sales growth expected to top 50 in 2022 trulieve looks like a bargain at roughly 26 times estimated earnings per share growgeneration ancillary cannabis plays haven t fared nearly as well as i or other pundits would have expected but one that looks ripe for the picking in 2022 is growgeneration grwg 8 11 growgen as the company is better known operates retail hydroponic and organic gardening centers in 13 states though the hydroponic i e growing plants in a nutrient rich water solvent soil nutrient and lighting solutions offered by the company are helpful for consumers and enterprises of all industries it s of particular use to increasing crop yields for cannabis growers thus growgen is often viewed as a marijuana stock the company s key to success has long been its aggressive acquisition strategy don t get me wrong growgen s same store sales have consistently risen by a double digit percentage however the company s bread and butter is acquiring locations in new and existing markets to quickly grow its brand in addition to acquisitions management is focused on building up the company s online presence as well as promoting a number of proprietary and private label brands that should provide a margin lift the third quarter saw private label and proprietary merchandise account for nearly 9 of total sales which compares to more like 2 in the year ago quarter after getting pummeled last year shares of growgeneration can be scooped up for well under two times estimated sales for 2022 planet 13 holdings the best marijuana stocks to buy in 2022 are those that provide a competitive advantage and differentiation small cap mso planet 13 holdings plnh f 8 91 fits that description well what makes planet 13 unique is that the company is focused just as much on providing a memorable experience for cannabis enthusiasts as it is on making sales the key differentiator here is the sheer size and functionality of its dispensaries planet 13 has two operating dispensaries at the moment the las vegas superstore spans 112 000 square feet and features a cafe consumer facing processing center and events center to go along with the biggest selection of pot products you ll find in any u s dispensary there s also the orange county superstore in santa ana california which spans 55 000 square feet including 16 500 square feet of selling space having visited the las vegas superstore i was impressed by the incorporation of technology self pay kiosks a store layout that funnels customers to higher margin derivative products and the provision of individual budtenders to meet customer needs the next tourist heavy locations for planet 13 dispensaries will be chicago orlando florida and miami with the company on the verge of recurring profitability and gobbling up a significant portion of nevada s weed sales with just a single location it has the look of a no brainer buy jushi holdings another small cap pot stock with serious potential in 2022 is mso jushi holdings jushf 12 13 to keep with the theme here jushi has a unique two pronged strategy for growth first it s targeting a number of limited license markets like pennsylvania illinois massachusetts and virginia a limited license state limits how many dispensary licenses are issued in total and or to a single business for big companies with deep pockets limited license markets can be a nuisance but for jushi which has just 28 operating dispensaries nationwide these limitations provide some degree of protection allowing it to build up its brands and garner a loyal following jushi s other key catalyst has been prudently deploying cash for acquisitions for example the company acquired two dispensaries in southern california last year though california has plenty of pot stores it s the leading market for marijuana sales in the world as a jushi shareholder i ll also add that execs and other insiders were responsible for contributing 45 million of the first 250 million in capital raised by the company when the financial interest of insiders align with that of shareholders good things happen more often than not cresco labs the fifth and final best marijuana stock to buy in 2022 is mso cresco labs crlbf 6 98 similar to jushi holdings cresco labs has a penchant for focusing most of its attention on limited license states at least with regard to its retail operations the company has 45 operating dispensaries with a presence in limited license markets like illinois ohio and massachusetts mixing in competitive high dollar markets such as florida with limited license markets gives cresco a path to sustainable double digit retail growth but what really allows cresco labs to stand out is the company s industry leading wholesale operations wall street isn t a big fan of wholesale cannabis because the margins aren t anything to speak of next to retail cannabis but cresco labs can make up what it loses in margin with insane volume that s because it holds one of only a small handful of cannabis distribution licenses in california this license allows it to place its proprietary pot products into more than 575 dispensaries throughout the golden state cresco labs has all the tools and momentum necessary to reach recurring profitability in 2022 with the company now valued at well under two times estimated sales per wall street this year it looks like a budding bargain
each of these companies has a strong competitive position and a big market opportunity day trading is often portrayed in a glamorous light but the reality is much less appealing according to a recent study just 3 of day traders are profitable during an average year and a mere 1 1 make more than minimum wage so if you want to build life changing wealth the first thing you ll need is a long term mindset a buy and hold strategy blunts the impact of transient market volatility and it also means you pay less in taxes because short term capital gains are taxed more aggressively of course you will also need a diversified portfolio of high quality stocks and that s the tricky part there s no magic formula to identify smart investments but i typically start by looking for companies with three qualities a competitive advantage strong revenue growth and a whopping market opportunity for instance airbnb abnb 3 66 and intuit intu 1 05 check all three boxes and both look like the building blocks of a market beating portfolio 1 airbnb airbnb is disrupting travel and tourism an industry that represented 10 of the global economy prior to the pandemic airbnb connects 4 million hosts with potential guests helping travelers find unique lodgings in 100 000 global cities likewise its platform also links travelers with experiences in over 1 000 cities everything from hidden jazz clubs in london to maple syrup tasting in vermont last year social distancing brought travel to a standstill and the industry is still in the early stages of recovery but the pandemic is likely to have a lasting impact and airbnb is well positioned to capitalize remote work has made people more flexible meaning they can travel anytime to address demand airbnb introduced flexible search parameters allowing users to search within a range of dates prices and destinations airbnb also made it easier for hosts to join the platform offering artificial intelligence ai powered tools to improve photo arrangement and text descriptions those moves highlight another key advantage onboarding a new host is much easier and cheaper than building a new hotel that makes airbnb s business model more dynamic and resilient which has translated into strong sales growth over the past year metric q3 2020 q3 2021 change revenue ttm 3 6 billion 5 3 billion 47 the future looks even brighter for this disruptive tech company management puts its market opportunity at 3 4 trillion which includes short term stays long term stays and experiences during a recent earnings call ceo brian chesky said we expect a travel rebound unlike anything we have seen before that s why this unstoppable stock looks like a smart buy right now 2 intuit it s almost tax season for many consumers that means it s nearly time to fire up intuit s turbotax a product that commands a 73 market share making it the most popular tax preparation software by a wide margin while turbotax is the company s best known product it s just a small part of intuit s portfolio quickbooks has become the gold standard in accounting software helping self employed individuals and small and medium sized businesses smbs track expenses accept payments and manage employee payroll here again intuit has established itself as the industry leader as it currently holds a 77 market share in the u s last year intuit paid 8 1 billion in cash and stock to bring another well known brand under its umbrella credit karma that platform leans on artificial intelligence to pair consumers with financial products like credit cards loans and insurance moreover the acquisition creates synergies with turbotax as consumers can have their tax refunds deposited directly in high yield savings accounts through credit karma intuit s lineup of industry leading brands has made it a financial powerhouse and the company has delivered strong revenue growth over the past year metric q3 2020 q3 2021 change revenue ttm 7 8 billion 10 3 billion 32 intuit also recently acquired mailchimp a platform that helps smb owners build digital storefronts launch targeted marketing campaigns and manage customer relationships the acquisition had a hefty 12 billion price tag paid in cash and stock but it looks like a brilliant move mailchimp s portfolio complements the quickbook s platform enhancing intuit s value proposition to smbs and adding 30 billion to its addressable market as a whole management puts its market opportunity at 260 billion a figure that includes turbotax quickbooks mailchimp and credit karma in both domestic and international markets i e u s uk canada and australia in short intuit has plenty of room to grow and given its ironclad competitive position i think this tech stock looks unstoppable in years ahead

the amazon of china is still a lot smaller than its american counterpart alibaba baba 4 76 is often called the amazon amzn 1 54 of china because it s the country s largest e commerce and cloud company however alibaba is still a lot smaller than its american counterpart analysts expect amazon to generate more than three times as much revenue as alibaba this year and its market cap of 1 7 trillion dwarfs alibaba s market cap of approximately 333 billion but could alibaba catch up to amazon by the end of the decade let s take a fresh look at these two tech giants and their plans for the future to find out the differences between alibaba and amazon alibaba and amazon are superficially similar but their business models are very different alibaba generates most of its revenue and all of its profits from its commerce business which houses its online marketplaces brick and mortar stores and logistics business the profits from the commerce segment support the ongoing expansion of its unprofitable cloud digital media and innovation initiatives businesses amazon generates most of its revenue from its retail business which also operates online marketplaces and brick and mortar stores however amazon generates most of its profits from its cloud infrastructure platform amazon web services aws aws profits enable amazon to expand its e commerce and digital media ecosystems with low margin and loss leading strategies simply put alibaba s long term growth is still pegged to its commerce business while amazon s future expansion relies more heavily on aws another key difference is the regulatory environment china s antitrust regulators probed and fined alibaba in 2021 before imposing new restrictions on its exclusive deals with merchants and promotional pricing strategies amazon has also been targeted by antitrust regulators but those challenges are milder less concentrated and scattered all across the world which company has been growing faster alibaba is smaller than amazon but it s only growing a slightly faster rate alibaba s revenue rose 41 in fiscal 2021 which ended in march or just 32 after excluding its takeover of the hypermarket operator sun art alibaba expects its revenue to rise 20 to 23 in fiscal 2022 it expects the growth of its e commerce business which faces tougher competitive macroeconomic and regulatory headwinds this year to decelerate amazon s revenue rose 38 in fiscal 2020 which aligns with the calendar year and it anticipates 20 22 revenue growth in fiscal 2021 amazon s e commerce business also faces tough post pandemic comparisons but it faces fewer competitive and regulatory headwinds than alibaba both companies could continue to grow at similar rates analysts expect alibaba s revenue to rise 22 this year 19 next year and 18 in fiscal 2024 they expect amazon s revenue to grow 22 this year 18 next year and 17 in fiscal 2023 we should take those long term estimates with a grain of salt but they strongly suggest alibaba won t catch up to amazon anytime soon what the next eight years could look like the global e commerce market could grow at a compound annual growth rate cagr of 29 from 2021 to 2025 according to reportlinker however most of that growth will likely come from emerging markets like latin america and southeast asia where mercadolibre and sea limited s shopee have already planted their flags as entrenched market leaders amazon and alibaba both generate most of their revenue from mature markets amazon s top markets were the u s germany the u k and japan last year alibaba still generates most of its revenue in china where it faces intense competition from jd com and pinduoduo therefore it s likely that amazon and alibaba s e commerce businesses will underperform the broader e commerce market over the next few years in response they ll both likely increase their dependence on lower margin retail initiatives such as brick and mortar stores to keep growing they ll also expand their digital ecosystems to lock in more shoppers and ramp up their overseas investments amazon will likely expand in india to challenge walmart s flipkart while alibaba will pour more money into lazada the former e commerce leader in southeast asia to strike back at shopee those costly efforts will inevitably squeeze their margins from 2025 to 2030 the global e commerce market might grow at an even slower clip as those platforms mature that slowdown could reduce both companies revenue growth rates to the low teens by the late 2020s alibaba won t be worth more than amazon alibaba s valuations have been depressed by china s tech crackdown and the delisting threats in the u s over the past year as a result alibaba trades at just 13 times forward earnings and two times next year s sales amazon has a forward price to earnings ratio of 54 and trades at three times next year s sales some of alibaba s investors might believe that if the regulatory headwinds wane investors will flock back to the stock and rerate the stock at a valuation comparable to amazon s but even if we quadruple alibaba s stock price right now it would still sport a much lower market cap than amazon therefore i don t see any possible way for alibaba to become more valuable than amazon by 2030
viewpoint one non scientific signal from covid is that 2022 will outshine 2021 but that s not saying much when i pulled up at the airport on christmas eve i spotted my older son standing on the curb will slung his backpack over his shoulder and began walking toward my car i pointed to the mask i was wearing he scowled and then he pulled out a mask and put it on i expected to catch some flak when he and his brother now also masked climbed into the car i pointed to a pair of covid 19 antigen tests i d brought along i d like you to take these i said advertisement advertisement my sons ages 20 and 22 had just returned from a short vacation in miami florida where they d shared a hotel room for several days with the omicron variant driving a big surge in cases i figured we should go ahead and test especially before hosting a holiday gathering the next day i left them at their mother s unoccupied house where they wanted to get some things together before coming over for the holiday weekend as i cooked and my girlfriend wrapped presents mary s phone rang um theo s test shows two lines will said womp womp i guess it wasn t as if i should have been surprised i d asked my sons to test for a reason seven day averages for new infections had doubled in the previous month we d also seen a bump in cases and exposures among staff members at the oklahoma medical research foundation advertisement advertisement yet it hadn t really dawned on me that one or both kids would be positive i d just figured infections were something that happened to other people s families you know the ones who weren t vaccinated and boosted we packed up dinners and brought them over to my sons theo sat at the top of the stairs we all wore masks he felt pretty much fine he said just a minor sore throat some congestion and muscle aches that until a few minutes before he d attributed to working out for the first time in a couple of weeks mary and i returned to my quiet house the two of us ate dinner at a table set for four last year we d watched a christmas movie with my sons this year we felt too deflated for miracle on 34th street or the like we cleaned up the dishes finished wrapping and went to bed christmas morning brought unseasonably warm temperatures and with them a new plan an outdoor holiday that afternoon my sons their mom her boyfriend mary and i opened presents on my porch advertisement advertisement theo sat removed from everyone else a fan spun overhead people took different and not always logical approaches to masking at one point i found myself donning a kn95 to enter my empty house happily neither will who isolated with but carefully circumnavigated around his brother for the better part of a week nor any other porch christmas attendee subsequently tested positive or showed symptoms everyone enjoyed themselves and when we re taking stock of holidays years from now this one won t blur with others in the week that followed theo s condition never worsened i had the flu when i was little and i remember crying all day he told us one morning when we delivered a bagel and coffee to his quarantine quarters this doesn t compare once his cold like symptoms disappeared he got a pcr test it was negative and he s headed back to college today so what might this mean for omicron and our future with covid 19 advertisement advertisement i hope it represents one tiny decidedly non scientific signal that 2022 will outshine 2021 i m not sure that s saying much though because this past year hasn t exactly been a walk in the park as dave barry wrote in his year in review we can say that 2021 was marginally better than 2020 however he quipped this is not high praise it s like saying that somebody is marginally nicer than hitler adam cohen is senior vice president general counsel and interim president of the oklahoma medical research foundation he can be reached at contact omrf org as 2021 turns to 2022 what does the future hold in regard to covid 19 this article originally appeared on oklahoman cohen will covid 19 conditions decrease in 2022
new year s day often prompts newspaper editors to switch from recording the past to predicting the future the chicago tribune s issue of jan 1 1922 was a mix of both reflecting a post world war i america that was also grappling with prohibition and a younger generation s rejection of victorian mores splashed across the front page 100 years ago was a headline suggesting that americans were being weaned off of booze new years minus hic hooray celebrations orderly under raiders eyes state street ordinarily a caldron of howling hospitalers of new year s eve was a dignified stolid thoroughfare the tribune reported out in evanston chief charles w leggutt issued orders to his force to arrest any person seen drinking in any place he said the town was drier than the sahara on page 2 was news of another kind of hangover a dispatch from washington announced uncle sam over rough part of normalcy road normalcy was the awkward but winning buzzword of the 1920 presidential election the first since world war i left americans fearful their country had gone astray america s present need is not heroics but healing not nostrums but normalcy proclaimed warren g harding the republican who won the white house but what came next was more change at the speed of a drummer beating on high hat cymbals the 1920s were aptly dubbed the jazz age paradoxically prohibition gave drinking an urbane cachet hemlines rose temptingly and women bobbed their hair men s formalwear went from stuffy to sporty the tribune reported that in florida s high society knickers once restricted to golf courses were now more accurately described as a knickerbockers suit some more serious issues foreshadowed the great depression that would be triggered by the stock market crash of 1929 the fort dearborn bank incident is not a pleasant event with which to begin the new year the tribune noted on jan 2 the la salle street bank had gone under having made loans its officers should have known were too risky but the depression was a decade away and the tribune urged the fort dearborn bank affair should not be allowed to cloud the steadily brightening skies it was similarly reassuring about a looming farmers crisis the price of farm products was falling which threatened dramatic repercussions in chicago the financial center of the agricultural midwest but the tribune reported the secretary of agriculture as saying there does seem to be the promise of better times both for the farmer and those whose business is largely dependent upon him looking back on the 20s frederick lewis allen was struck by how financial wizards and flappers alike missed obvious signs that the boom times couldn t last forever one of the most distinguished bankers in the united states in closing a deal in the early autumn of 1929 said privately that he saw not a cloud in the sky allen noted two years later in only yesterday an informal history of the 1920s until the stock market crashed it seemed that fortunes were still to be made in chicago there would always be a sufficient supply of millionaires and showgirls for them to fall for on jan 1 1922 the tribune reported on one such case did miss mary largo beautiful former follies girl poison herself because she thought gordon c thorne stock broker and man about town had fled from her love better times seemed on the horizon thanks to the potential payoff of technological innovations the tribune reported that with the post office instituting airmail service aviation now has a foothold on the world of commerce in january 1922 the tribune began publishing the schedule of kyw chicago s first radio station commercial radio was destined to be an entertainment medium although popular entertainment meant something different then from what it does now on jan 30 its broadcast selections from operas included verdi s il trovatore yet classical music wasn t for everyone as evidenced by the cultural fissures that were opening the world split in two in 1922 or thereabouts said willa cather who published one of ours a pulitzer prize winning novel that year a writer of straightforward prose she evidently sensed being eclipsed by more adventurous writers like ernest hemingway and ezra pound in the new year s day tribune those cultural gaps were there for all to see it reported that the pastor of the kenwood evangelical church preached a fire and brimstone sermon decrying an opera by richard strauss that was drawing music lovers to the auditorium theatre if the opera salome were given at a sink hole theater in south water street the audience and the performers would be pinched said the rev albert j mccartney the exhibition is a reflection on the intelligence of chicago people and a discredit to the police the tribune noted that the author oscar wilde was gay using a pejorative term and that his opera was a riff on the biblical story of salome who danced lasciviously with the head of john the baptist pleased that salome was banned after two chicago performances the tribune noted that it would be performed in new york in february there may be a protest or two over salome s revival even in new york the tribune reported hinting at middle america s moral superiority better suited to the holiday season the tribune editors decided was his little life essentially a morality play about an usher who greeted chicago theater patrons for 40 years newspapers then ran short stories the author of this tale was henry b fuller an early master of realistic fiction spread over a page and a half it told the story of how the usher welcomed every regular patron by name though they knew nothing of his life beyond the theater s foyer but when he died his funeral was standing room only in the story a mourner who had gone from rags to riches had a failed marriage and various mistresses compared his life to the usher s and concluded that the usher lived the better life rgrossman chicagotribune com

for much of 2021 the suburban new york real estate markets continued to be dominated by bidding wars long lines at open houses and rising prices as the housing inventory in many communities fell short of demand fueling the frenetic activity which started in mid 2020 was the allure of still low mortgage rates along with an influx of pandemic weary city dwellers and new millennial buyers at the same time homeowners were holding onto their properties longer many unable to afford to upgrade it was the same story across all the suburbs said jonathan j miller a manhattan based real estate appraiser who also monitors suburban markets
chicago s vaccine mandate arrives monday as covid 19 cases skyrocket yet again near and far with a rapidly shifting virus it s hard to say whether requiring proof of vaccination at bars and restaurants plus gyms stadiums and other entertainment and recreation venues where food and drinks are served will make a meaningful difference in curtailing the spread of the omicron variant which sent new cases soaring to record highs in a matter of weeks do most restaurant owners prefer a vaccine mandate to another industrywide shutdown or reduced capacities undoubtedly indoor closures were super painful said dan raskin fourth generation owner of manny s cafeteria delicatessen it wasn t good for anybody our economy needs people to be going out and doing life dan raskin center owner of manny s cafeteria delicatessen talks with brothers ron left and david harris on dec 30 2021 in chicago the harris brothers have been coming to the deli since 1955 but a degree of dread over carrying out the mandate is clearly on the minds of several restaurateurs who spoke with the tribune in the days leading up to its enforcement raskin said he understands why city officials are instituting the mandate but he s not comfortable with his staff asking customers for what he considers to be private health information he s worried checking vaccine cards will slow down business leading to frustrated customers and he said the mechanics will be tricky to navigate including the cost of extra labor as he s already struggling to hire enough workers raskin also said though that he will not hesitate to implement the policy along with the thousands of other bars and restaurants doing the same throughout the city and cook county suburbs i ve had customers say why don t you defy them and do what you want to do raskin said well that s not what i do i m a law abiding business owner how will restaurants and bars navigate the mandate what can customers expect and what lessons can be gleaned from other places with similar mandates here s what you need to know what will be required those looking to dine or drink inside restaurants and bars must provide proof of vaccination for anyone 5 years or older plus and this is key photo identification for anyone 16 and older with a name matching the name on the proof of vaccination restaurant workers are able to show a negative test result in lieu of proof of vaccination but customers can do so only with an exemption such as medical or religious proof of vaccination is not required to pick up takeout orders or to sit outside the city has pledged to monitor compliance and restaurants flouting the rule will be subject to fines and closure of one day or potentially longer for egregious situations miguel campos supervisor of business compliance investigations for the department of business affairs and consumer protection has said as to what constitutes proof the original card will do of course so will a photocopy of the card a clear photo of it on your phone or the digital smart health card a full list along with other details is on the city s website when defining vaccination the city and county are following the lead of the centers for disease control and prevention two weeks past a second shot of the pfizer or moderna vaccines or two weeks past a single shot of the johnson johnson vaccine proof of a booster shot is not necessary though some restaurant owners have said they are considering adding such a requirement on their own without a booster requirement is this an imperfect mandate probably but with new cases surging on thursday the illinois department of public health reported 128 246 new cases of covid 19 during the previous week and the city s positivity rate leaping from 4 to more than 17 during the past month it will help officials say it s well established that one or two vaccine shots offer decreased protection over time and do a lesser job protecting against the omicron variant than with a booster yet the cdc continues to define being vaccinated as having two shots of pfizer or moderna or one of johnson johnson so that s how the city is defining it for this mandate however the new york times reported wednesday that private companies are increasingly mandating boosters and that federal officials are beginning to reconsider their definition too albeit cautiously what should diners expect how the mandate is carried out will vary by restaurant and procedures will almost certainly evolve but it will boil down to someone asking to see your id and proof of vaccination much like being carded at a bar the lou malnati s pizzeria chain which has more than 20 locations subject to vaccine mandates was still working on getting our processes in place during the middle of last week spokesperson mindy kaplan said i m sure even after we get the processes in place we will need to adjust based on real life experiences as they come up kaplan said like covid 19 issues throughout the past 21 months we implement adjust and adapt as needed many if not all lou s locations will have a leg up with hosts stationed ahead of the dining room which provides a ready way to check vaccination cards but a place such as manny s will have a harder time adapting to the mandate raskin said bhannia martinez and carl schulte eat at manny s cafeteria delicatessen for the first time on dec 30 2021 in chicago at the legendary south loop delicatessen customers grab trays just inside the front door pick up their food in line and pay at the register before seating themselves raskin said he plans to check for vaccination proof at the end of the line while customers are paying so anyone without proof can take their food to go he also wants to avoid people waiting outside as cards are being checked and not to have to hire someone to monitor the door then again he said the person checking cards could ultimately be positioned elsewhere if it means things move more efficiently be prepared for anything and be ready for it to change can businesses legally deny seating unvaccinated people yes private businesses can deny service to unvaccinated customers and are required not to allow them to dine indoors by the city s mandate in chicago the vaccine mandate has been issued via an order by the city s health commissioner dr allison arwady who is empowered by city law to enact emergency orders that can be enforced by city departments including the police critics of vaccination and mask mandates have suggested laws such as the civil rights act and the fourth amendment should allow unvaccinated people entry to businesses but the civil rights act does not offer protections for medical conditions and the fourth amendment pertains to unreasonable search and seizure by government bodies not private businesses lawsuits challenging earlier mask or vaccine mandates across the u s have largely either been dismissed or are still in progress how will restaurants and bars be affected in one sense the mandate puts all bars and restaurants in an unenviable position thrusting them once again to the forefront of a public health crisis that has turned politically charged countless restaurant workers have stories of dealing with hostile customers during the last two years frequently over mask mandates this will be yet another mandate they are required to uphold but in another sense things will vary greatly some places are simply better situated for the mandate than others those with outdoor spaces strong to go business and a customer base on board with vaccinations and the mandate will have a leg up michael roper owner of andersonville s hopleaf bar and restaurant said he was planning to issue his own vaccine mandate starting jan 1 because he thinks his customers are ready for it and because the industry must learn to live with covid 19 we can t destroy our way of life to protect those who refuse to be vaccinated he said once it becomes mandated people will carry their cards but roper said he wishes there was a stronger technological underpinning to chicago s vaccine mandate such as the green pass used in israel and several european countries which employs a qr code for verification having just returned from europe i see how well it works he said it is a lot harder to fake than our cards anyone with card stock and a printer can make a fake cdc vaccination card and with no qr code we have no way to verify it while illinois recently added the smart health card which features a qr code that can be downloaded or shown via a smartphone app to its vax verify system its use is not widespread or required as part of the vaccine mandate depending on business model audience and location some restaurants are likely to see traffic grow others could see a decline customers eat lunch at manny s cafeteria delicatessen on dec 30 2021 in chicago like roper raskin is hopeful customers will feel more comfortable dining out i m optimistic he said that s what i want is for more people to come in here but it s wait and see everyone is at the same disadvantage everyone s got to do it how has a vaccine mandate gone in other cities returns have been mixed in new york city which instituted a vaccination mandate in september said andrew rigie executive director of the nyc hospitality alliance which represents thousands of bars restaurants and clubs some restaurants have reported upticks in business due to customers feeling more comfortable going out rigie said others especially in neighborhoods with lower rates of vaccination have struggled some have tweaked their approach closing for indoor dining to focus on delivery and to go business it s really been all over the map and that s been the challenge rigie said some restaurants it hasn t impacted business and on some days it was even good for business others say they ve lost a significant amount of business but the bottom line he said is that all have adapted restaurants whether they like it or not have put systems into place to manage the mandate rigie said for some restaurants it has certainly taken more resources but it hasn t posed as many challenges compared to prior mandates like shutdowns or not being able to stand in a bar what s the key to making the vaccine mandate painless as possible you yes you are the gravest fear of many restaurant owners and workers my staff is mostly worried about how they ll be treated by customers raskin said their job is to be nice and friendly and serve the customer not checking ids and following government protocols and it s become very political with people voicing their opinions it adds a whole other dimension of people getting upset about things they just use it as fuel to fight with you so be kind be patient have your id and vaccination card ready when walking in to avoid operations needlessly slowing down make peace with the fact that no matter how you feel about the mandate bars and restaurants are simply following rules that hopefully limit the spread of covid 19 and failing to follow the rules could lead to fines or closure if you want to express your opinion about the vaccine mandate direct it toward the government officials implementing the policy not the restaurant workers upholding it jbnoel chicagotribune com big screen or home stream takeout or dine in tribune writers are here to steer you toward your next

technological advances have democratized outer space transforming the cosmos from a domain once dominated by government entities and creating new opportunities for the private sector the private
