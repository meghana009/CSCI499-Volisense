a week into the united nations high profile climate conference in glasgow executives and financial analysts said they are optimistic the talks will lead to changes needed for business to play a bigger role in tackling climate change the business observers pointed to several steps by world leaders they said could boost sustainable business and investing efforts to mobilize the vast sums of money needed to wean the world off fossil fuels these include a pledge by financial firms with a combined 130 trillion in assets to focus on climate change the creation of a global standards body to scrutinize corporate climate claims and pledges to cut methane emissions and to save forests jefferies managing director aniket shah said although many of the steps lacked specific promises they showed a global consensus forming to tackle climate change that will make it easier to for private investors and governments to put in money and effort there s a certain power of signaling of intentions that can t be dismissed here shah said he pointed to the goal set by india s prime minister narenda modi on nov 1 for his country to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2070 although two decades later than what scientists say is needed to avert catastrophic climate impacts the pledge was still more than india had offered in the past and could be accelerated with financial help from developed nations shah said peter lacy accenture s global sustainability services lead said that for investors and companies the most significant step at the conference was the creation on nov 3 of the international sustainability standards board meant to create a baseline for companies to describe their climate impact lacy called it a seismic moment for business and in line with the hopes of ceos accenture surveyed ahead of the conference the new board lacy said will give investors and stakeholders a much better understanding of related risks and opportunities and help guide the allocation of the huge amount of capital needed as the world transitions to net zero he said via email lack of detail critics say many of the conference s key announcements lack specifics and give companies wiggle room for instance banks insurers and investors pledged to work to cut emissions to net zero by 2050 but each entity has made its own net zero commitments with potential overlap across initiatives institutions and assets according to the group s press statement leslie samuelrich media of green century capital management in boston which does not invest in fossil fuel stocks said she worries bigger investment firms signed on so quickly to carbon reduction pledges advertised at glasgow because their terms might be too easy to meet the speed with which some have adopted this makes me cautious samuelrich said but other finance executives say it is inevitable businesses will move to cut emissions under pressure from customers and to chase profits mark haefele chief investment officer for ubs global wealth management said promising areas include renewable energy transport and batteries diplomats now must hash out rules on areas like constructing markets to help businesses price carbon and how much developed nations will help poorer ones on a call with journalists on friday david waskow a director of the nonprofit world resources institute said he was more optimistic than a week ago that the attendees would strike meaningful agreements i think the beginning of the week actually did lay good groundwork not to say everything is all rosy he said source reuters reporting by ross kerber in boston and by simon jessop in glasgow editing by gerry doyle

past few weeks the market action has been super strong we ve seen good price action strong volume technicals are moving in favor of the bulls here so that has to be a little bit concerned a little bit worried as a contrarian investor trader i don t like to see um everybody tilted on one side of the boat because what ends up happening is that boat is going to tip over so i m a little bit cautious right here chris we ve been pretty far extended away from the moving averages the ones that i look at are the 10 and the 20 day moving average specifically the 20 which is about a month s worth of action we re about 3 5 away from that 20 day moving average now as we speak today um as the markets are rallying up again towards new highs um we ll see a little bit of a pullback that of course that 20 day moving average is moving up steep at a really high pace right now we ll see some pullback here 23 it ll feel pretty bad but still i think that uptrend is still intact and even as we pull back we re gonna seasonally strong period right now we could we could really rally nicely into the end of the year well i think you re right bob you know typically when we see such pronounced moves in the market you know some say it gets a little overextended some will say we need a pause to refresh and you know september quarter earnings came in significantly better than people who are fearing i think like 90 of the s and p 500 constituents have reported and the vast majority of them have reported better than expected revenue and e p s we ve also had some other positive developments you know where it sounds like president biden is discussing tapping the strategic petroleum reserve to help out with oil prices were hearing the energy crunch in china might be abating and the worst of the supply chain might possibly be behind us advertisement the race to 3 trillion big tech keeps getting bigger share copy link copy related video above why this technical analyst expects a market pullbackthe trillion dollar market cap club is starting to get crowded microsoft is now worth a smidge more than apple making the satya nadella led cloud software giant the world s most valuable company both companies are worth about 2 5 trillion google owner alphabet is worth just a touch less than 2 trillion while amazon is valued at 1 7 trillion and don t forget as if we could tesla elon musk s electric car giant recently passed the 1 trillion mark and has since surged to a market cap of about 1 25 trillion these five companies are now collectively worth almost 10 trillion that s nearly a quarter of the combined 41 8 trillion market cap of the entire s p 500 it s possible that the s p 500 could have six companies worth at least 1 trillion at the same time if meta platforms the social media giant formerly known as facebook continues to rebound meta now has a market valuation of about 930 billion but given the continued strength in tech it s altogether possible that all six of these companies could soon each be worth at least 2 trillion if not more after all microsoft and apple are knocking on the door of 3 trillion and other techs such as chip leader nvidia and china s tencent are moving closer to the trillion dollar market valuation mark it seems almost unfathomable that so many companies could be worth this much but earnings growth for many of the top techs continues to be strong and that is pushing prices higher still the insatiable investor appetite for trillion dollar techs reminds some market analysts of the nasdaq froth of the 1990s and early 2000 it could be a warning sign tesla s rally is reminiscent of cisco s move in 2000 a move that marked the bubble top in 2000 said mike o rourke chief market strategist with jonestrading in a report this month o rourke pointed out that cisco shares soared about 50 in the first three months of 2000 and analysts at credit suisse predicted that cisco would be the world s first trillion dollar company it didn t happen cisco which was worth about 550 billion at the height of tech stock mania two decades ago is now valued at about 240 billion intel another tech stock leader of the late 90s has struggled in the past few years and is nowhere close to its 2000 peak valuation it s proof that becoming a market leader may be easier than staying a market leader there is no guarantee that the likes of microsoft apple amazon alphabet and even tesla will stay at the top newer companies and technologies may come along that could make the list of the world s most valuable firms look a lot different in the early 2040s than it did in 2021 all eyes still on inflationconsumer prices in the united states have soared largely because of supply chain constraints and higher wages overall prices surged 5 4 from a year ago in september nearly a 30 year high price increases at the grocery store and gas pumps were the main culprits but even the so called core consumer price index which excludes volatile food and energy costs was up 4 in the past 12 months more data about inflation comes out wednesday when the federal government issues its consumer price index report for october economists are forecasting a slight increase from september levels with inflation here to stay at least for now federal reserve chair jerome powell seemed to suggest that the central bank needs to find a word other than transitory to describe higher prices transitory is a word that people have had different understandings of he said in a press conference after the fed announced its bond tapering plans powell noted that some think it means short lived but the fed uses the term to describe something it believes won t be permanent or persistent it s become a word that has attracted a lot of attention that has maybe become distracting powell added powell also acknowledged that rising prices could be a drag on future economic growth it also hits people living from paycheck to paycheck the hardest we accept accountability and responsibility for inflation in the medium term he said the level of inflation we have right now is not at all consistent with price stability the market will be looking closely at the cpi numbers to try and get a sense of whether higher prices impact consumer spending just before the holidays and also for clues about what the latest inflation data might mean for the pace of fed tapering and eventual rate hikes in 2022
opinion rep brandon potter and john donegan guest columnists rep brandon potter d cranston represents district 16 john donegan is a cranston city councilman the proposed retail development on the former site of the narragansett brewery in cranston recently brought many city officials out to tour the location the plan includes an autozone a fast food restaurant a retail shopping center and a bank but as our city considers its potential impact on the area we can not ignore the urgent need for affordable housing and our obligation to it an empty lot might otherwise not be such a reminder of our state s housing crisis but right next to this piece of land many people sleep underneath a highway overpass we d be hard pressed to find a more vivid depiction of the disconnect between our priorities and the needs of the most vulnerable among us sadly our housing crisis is something all too many people are familiar with this year the general assembly created a permanent funding stream for affordable housing ended source of income discrimination and is likely to prioritize a substantial amount of american rescue plan act money toward housing but regardless of the money allocated meeting our affordable housing needs will take all 39 cities and towns playing their role under rhode island state law every municipality is required to allocate 10 of its housing stock to low and moderate income housing unfortunately according to the housingworks ri 2021 fact book very few are meeting that requirement although some cities and towns are close to reaching 10 many are far behind cranston falls short by over 1 500 units and only meets 5 1 of the requirement if every city and town simply met this mark it would account for more than an additional 12 500 units across our state and be a huge step in solving our state s housing crisis developing new units designated for low and moderate income housing will not only help us address homelessness with compassion it will help alleviate the strains which exist within our housing market unfortunately the stigma attached to low and moderate income housing often fuels much of the resistance to housing development projects but taking that into consideration if a location like this a parcel of land abutting an old railroad track on one side a highway and railroad track on the other across from a police station and on the city s border with providence is not a location we identify as a site for affordable housing then where is it s incumbent on the leadership of every city and town to task their planning departments with developing comprehensive strategies to meet their legal housing obligations cranston is in the process of renewing our comprehensive plan and we must prioritize housing development in the years to come and if cities and towns don t quickly demonstrate they have a serious approach to building affordable housing it may be time for the general assembly to consider legislation that requires them to proposed developments are a good sign to see as we rebuild our economy but while as many as 500 people sleep on the streets of rhode island every night are banks gas stations and fast food restaurants what we need more of on a side note census tract 141 where this project is proposed has residents with higher levels of heart disease diabetes and obesity than we see in the rest of the city we should prioritize increasing access to healthier foods not more fast food chains and at a time when so many have been devastated by the impact of covid 19 we need to prioritize getting people back on their feet by building bridges not turning our eyes away from the people who are sleeping under them
philip morris international met with the fda on friday afternoon to present its argument for why the tobacco giant and altria should be allowed to import and sell iqos devices cnbc has learned it s the latest development in a patent dispute with r j reynolds the biden administration is conducting an administrative review to decide if altria and philip morris can continue to sell and import the cigarette alternative philip morris international met with the food and drug administration on friday afternoon to present its argument for why the tobacco giant and altria should be allowed to import and sell iqos devices in the u s cnbc has learned a person familiar with the company s meeting said philip morris told the fda that iqos is unique both in its design and ability to convert smokers additionally the company is arguing that the u s international trade commission overstepped its bounds given that the fda is in charge of regulating which tobacco products and alternatives can be sold this person said the meeting with regulators is the latest development in a patent dispute with rival r j reynolds a subsidiary of british american tobacco in late september the itc ruled that the iqos device infringed on two of reynolds patents the biden administration is conducting a 60 day administrative review until nov 29 to decide if the sale and import of the cigarette alternative will be banned get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters altria launched the iqos device in the united states two years ago but it began development of the product more than a decade ago before philip morris international was spun off from the company the device heats tobacco without burning it which is meant to give users the same rush of nicotine without as many toxins as smoking a cigarette philip morris sells the device in dozens of international markets and has granted altria a license to sell it in the u s while iqos don t represent a large portion of altria s u s business it s part of the company s shift away from traditional tobacco products which have seen falling demand the u s trade representative will make a recommendation to president joe biden after listening to input from a number of agencies including the fda which regulates tobacco products the presidential review process can disapprove of the itc s final determination on a few counts and we believe there is a pretty strong case for that said deepak mishra head of philip morris international s americas region in an interview with cnbc thursday the company s argument to keep selling iqos includes the public health benefit of the device altria said it counts 20 000 u s consumers as users of the device and say they could revert back to cigarettes if iqos disappears from shelves we are pretty convinced that the vast majority will go back to smoking cigarettes mishra said it actually comes close to the taste and ritual of a cigarette which is why we have a very strong conversion of smokers that switch to iqos mishra said this was an argument the company planned to make as it urges the biden administration to overturn the itc ruling the next step in the administrative review is a trade policy staff committee meeting which will likely happen this week the person familiar with the meeting said the group includes a number of federal agencies including the fda u s department of agriculture and the department of commerce if the administration sides with r j reynolds in the dispute iqos could be off of u s shelves for months as it waits for a decision on a separate claim from reynolds with the u s patent and trademark office according to mishra that process is expected to take another six to 12 months but mishra said the company is more optimistic about the outcome given its success in similar cases outside the united states british american tobacco has already pursued similar legal action against philip morris in the united kingdom poland czech republic bulgaria romania and greece and through the european patent office in the worst case scenario for altria and philip morris the two companies would have to go back to the drawing board moving production to the u s or changing up the design enough to avoid patent infringement claims there is no reason to overturn policy and legal arguments rejected three times in the earlier legal proceedings as the itc s exclusion order was properly issued and consistent with the public interest reynolds american spokesperson kaelan hollon said in a statement to cnbc similar to companies across multiple other industries including producers of medicines medical equipment and other technologies we must enforce our ip rights robustly to ensure we can continue to innovate shares of philip morris have climbed 12 this year giving it a market value of 145 billion altria s stock is up 9 in the same time raising its market value to 83 1 billion

when martin njoku saw opioid addiction devastate his west virginia community he felt compelled to help this was the place he d called home for three decades where he d raised his two girls and turned his dream of owning a pharmacy into reality in 2016 after flooding displaced people in nearby counties njoku began dispensing buprenorphine to them and to local customers at his oak hill hometown pharmacy in fayette county buprenorphine a controlled substance sold under the brand names subutex and suboxone is a medication to treat opioid use disorder research shows it halves the risk of overdose and doubles people s chances of entering long term recovery i thought i was doing what was righteous for people who have illness njoku said but a few years later the drug enforcement administration raided njoku s pharmacy and accused the facility of contributing to the opioid epidemic rather than curbing it the agency revoked the pharmacy s registration to dispense controlled substances claiming it posed an imminent danger to public health and safety although two judges separately ruled in njoku s favor the dea s actions effectively shuttered his business i lost everything that i worked for njoku said lawyers pharmacists harm reduction advocates and a former dea employee say njoku s case is emblematic of the dea s aggressive stance on buprenorphine an opioid itself the medication can be misused so the dea works to limit its diversion to the streets but many say the agency s policies are exacerbating the opioid epidemic by scaring pharmacies away from dispensing this medication when it s desperately needed drug overdose deaths hit record highs last year and despite medical experts considering medications like buprenorphine the gold standard less than 20 of people with opioid use disorder typically receive them the federal government has taken steps to increase the number of clinicians who prescribe buprenorphine but many patients struggle to get those prescriptions filled a recent study found that 1 in 5 u s pharmacies do not provide buprenorphine pharmacies are terrified they re going to lose their dea registration and go out of business said charles buck selby a former inspector and chief compliance officer for the west virginia board of pharmacy who retired in 2018 ainsley bryce khn khn many pharmacists fear ordering too much buprenorphine will trigger a dea investigation research in kentucky and north carolina has found that creates a prescribing cliff says bayla ostrach who researches substance use disorder treatment and health policy doctors might prescribe more but if pharmacies won t fill the prescription patients can t get their medication the ramifications can be particularly acute in rural areas where a dearth of addiction treatment providers lack of transportation and stigma against these medications already create barriers if pharmacies decline to provide buprenorphine too patients will have few options left selby said the dea did not respond to requests for comment like many other prescription drugs buprenorphine can be found illegally on the street there are unscrupulous doctors who hand out prescriptions and pharmacists who fill them subutex which consists of buprenorphine alone is easier to misuse and typically has higher street value than suboxone a combination of buprenorphine and the overdose reversal drug naloxone in the case against njoku s pharmacy an assistant u s attorney explained that the dea got slapped hard for being asleep at the switch as the opioid crisis ramped up they re trying to make sure that subutex doesn t become the next problem according to court transcripts but research suggests that buprenorphine misuse has decreased in recent years even as prescribing has increased and that most people who use diverted buprenorphine do so to avoid withdrawal symptoms and because they can t get a prescription buprenorphine is less likely to cause overdoses than other opioids because its effects taper off at higher doses said dr aaron wohl medical director of the florida based coalition project opioid in njoku s case the dea said in court documents that several red flags had suggested the pharmacy s actions were irresponsible first many of the prescriptions it filled were for subutex instead of suboxone patients also traveled sometimes out of state to get prescriptions drove long distances within west virginia to reach njoku s pharmacy and often paid in cash in traditional prescription drug cases these are all markers of trouble but as njoku s lawyers argued and two judges later agreed they can also reflect the difficulty of getting addiction treatment which is sometimes more challenging than obtaining illicit drugs the practical reality and context of west virginia turn these additional flags from red to yellow u s district judge joseph goodwin wrote in his opinion patients may go out of their way for the drug because there aren t enough nearby doctors who prescribe it or pharmacies that stock it he wrote they might pay cash because they re uninsured or medicaid won t cover prescriptions written by an out of network doctor and they might prefer subutex because it s often cheaper than suboxone courtney ingram khn khn dr nathan mullins addiction medicine fellowship director at mountain area health education center in north carolina says switching the medications of patients recovering from opioid use disorder can cause needless anxiety by 2020 goodwin and an administrative law judge at the dea had both ruled in njoku s favor but several insurers and drug suppliers had already stopped doing business with him njoku closed the pharmacy in april 2021 across the country when a pharmacy stops providing buprenorphine the ripple effects can be far reaching trish mashburn works at two independent pharmacies in western north carolina when a nearby pharmacy stopped dispensing buprenorphine she began getting five calls a day from prospective customers trying to get their prescriptions filled she said although both her employers stock buprenorphine they order only a set amount so mashburn often must turn patients away research in north carolina and kentucky has found that many pharmacists worry that ordering more buprenorphine will trigger a dea investigation the dea does not specify thresholds for controlled substances but it requires wholesalers to flag suspicious orders in turn wholesalers limit how much a pharmacy can buy or create algorithms to detect orders that exceed projected need they base these limits in part on the dea s enforcement actions said larry cote a former dea attorney who now advises wholesalers pharmacies and other clients on regulatory compliance since pharmacies are not typically privy to how these limits are set many simply order small batches of buprenorphine out of caution that creates a prescribing cliff said bayla ostrach lead author of a paper studying this issue in north carolina doctors may prescribe buprenorphine to more patients but pharmacies order enough for only a certain number of customers since many people stay on buprenorphine for years once the pharmacy hits its self established quota it may rarely have openings for new patients a lee county fla man thought he was one of the lucky ones james 34 had been filling his subutex prescription at the supermarket chain publix for seven years in that time he held steady jobs and cared for his wife and children james asked khn to withhold his last name so future employers wouldn t judge him on his addiction history then last year james said he went to get his prescription refilled and was told publix no longer stocks subutex the medication the dea considered a red flag in njoku s case publix did not respond to requests for comment a decade ago when james began the medication he chose subutex because it was cheaper than suboxone today most insurance plans cover suboxone and the price difference has narrowed somewhat james was not eager to change to a potentially pricier medication and he worried a different drug might disrupt his recovery a common sentiment among patients in long term recovery said dr nathan mullins director of addiction medicine fellowship at mountain area health education center in north carolina changing their medication is unnecessary and can cause needless anxiety mullins said luckily james found an independent pharmacy that provides subutex it s more expensive since the new place doesn t accept his insurance he said he pays about 40 a week compared with 40 a month previously but james said it s worth it i ve been in 10 rehabs and a million detoxes and the only thing that has worked for me was one sublingual tablet james said along with therapy this saved my life khn kaiser health news is an editorially independent program of kff kaiser family foundation copyright 2023 kaiser health news to

menafn asia times the battle between amazon and future group over the latter s move to sell most of its assets to reliance group has once again heated up the fight s latest round began with independent directors of future retail on sunday writing to the competition commission of india seeking revocation of its earlier approval granted to amazon to buy a stake in future coupons the directors alleged that the american e commerce giant had violated foreign direct investment norms when it picked up a 49 stake in future coupons and concealed facts while applying for the competition watchdog s approval the directors said the watchdog should act to stop amazon from perpetuating its evil non desirable designs against the indian company it said the approval given by the commission does not hold good due to the concealment and misrepresentation and false representations made by amazon the seven page letter was addressed to the competition watchdog s chairman ashok kumar gupta and a copy was marked to the stock market watchdog securities and exchange board of india chairman the finance minister and the prime minister meanwhile as a counter move amazon has written to the stock market watchdog and corporate affairs ministry seeking to withdraw any permission and consents granted to future retail regarding the 3 4 billion merger deal with reliance retail a unit of reliance group the amazon letter has also been sent to other top officials at stock exchanges such as bombay stock exchange limited and the national stock exchange of india limited the letter claimed that future retail and its promoters have been able to induce many regulators to give permissions to the indian retailer in relation to its arrangement with the reliance group it alleged this is done on the basis of various misrepresentations made by future retail and its promoters amazon had earlier challenged future retail s merger with reliance retail alleging that the transaction breached an agreement it had reached with the india retailer amazon had cited its non compete agreement with future group and the requirement that any disputes would be arbitrated under the singapore international arbitration centre rules last month the arbitrator had rejected future retail s plea to lift the interim stay on its deal with reliance retail it had also held that future retail is a party to the ongoing arbitration between amazon and future group in the dispute over the sale of its assets to reliance retail future had earlier contended before the arbitrator that it should be excluded from arbitration proceedings because it is not a party to the dispute between its promoter future coupons pvt ltd and amazon in august last year reliance retail ventures ltd had announced its decision to acquire the retail and wholesale business and the logistics and warehousing business of future group it included the sale of future group s supermarket chain big bazaar premium food supply unit foodhall and fashion and clothes supermart brand factory s retail and wholesale units amazon had then approached the singapore based arbitrator questioning the deal in october last year the arbitrator had passed an interim award in favor of the us e commerce major and barred future retail from taking any steps to dispose of its assets

recently passed u s legislation and renewed support for nuclear power abroad lifted the industry s top names on monday but the bullishness isn t new what happened shares of uranium mining companies centrus energy leu 1 94 ur energy urg 3 51 and uranium energy uec 3 09 all jumped monday in the wake of governments renewing their support for the nuclear power industry specifically centrus rallied by 19 4 ur energy stock gained 10 5 and uranium energy shares rose by 10 9 after the u s house of representatives passed an infrastructure bill that supports new investments in nuclear power simultaneously the industry is being buoyed by last week s cop26 global climate which highlighted nuclear power as part of the solution to the world s growing climate change crisis so what don t look for any commentary about either new tailwind from any of these three uranium suppliers you won t find it this surge is strictly the result of traders coming to their own conclusions regarding nuclear energy s place in a future that can t yet be fully powered by green renewable sources like solar or wind of course those conclusions certainly hold plenty of water late friday the u s house of representatives passed a 1 trillion infrastructure bill that calls for among many other things fresh research into advanced reactors that could modernize america s nuclear power production steady streams of baseload electricity that greener alternatives are not yet ready to produce the bill has been delivered to president joe biden who is expected to sign it this week the legislation calls for 6 billion worth of nuclear power support although it s not a stretch to suggest that the biden white house and the democratic majority in the house of representatives will continue to support greater use of any energy source that isn t a greenhouse gas emitting fossil fuel separately but almost simultaneously last week s climate change conference cop26 conference of the parties held in glasgow scotland also reintroduced nuclear power as a legitimate contributor of power production that will help the world wean itself off fossil fuels as u s energy secretary jennifer granholm commented at an event facilitated by the international atomic energy agency held in conjunction with cop 26 the united states is all in on nuclear as part of its plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions now what the knee jerk buying of centrus ur energy and uranium energy makes sense in light of the developments that have just taken shape over the course of the past few days but none of this should be much of a surprise to investors who have been following this story uranium energy shares were already up 125 from august s lows before monday s surge while ur energy had rallied by more than 80 over the same time frame centrus energy stock had nearly tripled in value since august while prices for uranium itself were up more than 50 the buyers got it right so to speak but their anticipation of this convergence of events may also be an as good as it gets moment the sort of scenario that gave rise to the adage buy the rumor sell the news this may not be such a moment to be clear but there s enough doubt that any further bullish catalysts lie in the immediate future that the smart money move right now would be to steer clear for a few days rather than jump on the proverbial bandwagon most of these recent price run ups are driven by speculation which can deflate just as quickly and easily as it inflates

photo illustration by kevin van aelst c ovid 19 has destabilized university finances something particularly stressful for faculty members who often find themselves left out when budgets are rationalized professors seek explanations about the administration s response and sometimes those administrative explanations lack transparency spreading mistrust and misconceptions administrative responses to lost income during a financial crisis follow a fairly standard protocol the first response is to slash discretionary expenditures stop unnecessary travel defer routine maintenance freeze hiring etc this modest short term step slows cash outflow but for severe crises such as the one we now face it seldom solves the problem large nondiscretionary expenditures continue unabated salaries pension fund contributions health insurance loan repayments building leases and so forth this first response simply buys time inevitably rumors about large centrally controlled pools of money will circulate in fact the rumors may be true many governing boards mandate the creation of a discretionary rainy day reserve account containing several months of normal operating expenses certainly these rainy day funds can be used to offset reduced income due to the pandemic but not all of it some money must be retained in reserve for other possible emergencies such as a broken water main or hvac system the amount retained will depend on each university s exposure to risks like aging campus buildings tornadoes floods and earthquakes universities have more money in restricted reserve accounts they must maintain sufficient funds in reserve to cover required debt payments interest and principal pension fund liabilities health care plans and other nondiscretionary expenses some bond covenants even require a reserve fund to cover repairs and maintenance of campus facilities financed by the bonds stated simply this restricted reserve money is unavailable for routine operations advertisement endowments are a highly visible pool of money faculty members inevitably wonder why can t the university use its endowment to compensate for lost income during this crisis the university can indeed increase income from its endowment in a fiscal emergency and many will but only reluctantly and only for a limited period of time this can occur in three ways first the university may withdraw any unrestricted funds that it has deposited into the endowment providing a one time source of cash for example to mitigate covid 19 related revenue losses stanford university approved plans to withdraw up to 150 million from its unrestricted endowment second a university can adjust its payout rate from the typical 5 percent target rate to as high as 7 percent without incurring suspicions of imprudent fiscal management in addition to its withdrawal stanford increased its payout from endowment funds that support student financial aid by approximately 3 percent however extended payout rates exceeding the target rate jeopardize the sustainability of the endowment s long term benefits especially during periods of investment market volatility third and least desirably a university can dip into its restricted endowment principal during a demonstrably dire emergency because this violates trust agreements with donors some states require court approval or an attorney general s review as a rule of thumb dipping into the restricted principal manifests desperation for example to mitigate its grave financial situation harvard university just announced plans to take 3 percent of all restricted funds in the endowment and make them available for immediate use including room and board rebates financial aid and protective supplies needed to reopen the campus extraordinary steps like this will provide one time relief but they cannot provide a recurrent source of revenue without jeopardizing the endowment s mission ultimately universities must find long term solutions for restoring financial stability two options typically fit this bill generating new sources of revenue and reducing core expenditures generating new revenue sounds good in principle but is rarely viable in practice obviously the first option generating new revenue is preferable it is also unrealistic in a moment like this with sudden losses of revenue a primary source might be new academic offerings designed to tap into a particular market niche new degree programs certificates online outreach et cetera the university of massachusetts system recently announced it was moving forward with a partner in an online education initiative aiming to derive 300 million over five years however these initiatives generally materialize slowly requiring one time consuming review after another regardless of the urgency the umass program was announced over a year ago and is just now moving forward advertisement plus revenue generation often requires resources that may exceed potential gains at least in the short term a hypothetical example a university hires an expensive research team that fails to generate grant revenue needed for an expected positive return on the institution s investment or as in the case of concordia university investments designed to attract students fail to generate the anticipated positive return on investment due to declining enrollment another source might be more sponsored research with its indirect cost reimbursement however this scenario actually costs the university money on average universities recover only about 70 percent of the indirect costs incurred by sponsored research that is universities lose money on every grant in short this first option generating new revenue sounds good in principle but is rarely viable in practice t herefore to stabilize their finances universities tend to favor the second option reducing core expenditures these reductions follow a fairly standard sequence after the initial cuts in discretionary expenditures operational cuts come next smaller expenditures such as contributions to employee retirement accounts may be suspended as they were this summer at the johns hopkins university the largest expenditures personnel salaries are reduced through lay offs furloughs and decreased appointment levels from 100 percent to 75 percent for example in situations not involving tenure contracts are not renewed in a chilling example ohio university first notified 140 union employees and then two weeks later 149 administrators that their positions would be eliminated and 53 instructional faculty members that their contracts would not be renewed beyond the 2020 21 school year fifty five administrators would be rehired in new positions the remaining employees would be furloughed without pay for as long as 18 days depending on their base salary senior administrators would take a 10 to 15 percent salary reduction all of this was followed by an announcement that 200 additional employees would be cut later this year as a last resort universities declare financial exigency signaling that they no longer have the funds to meet salary obligations to tenured faculty members in one example attributed to local government mandated stay at home orders to inhibit covid 19 spread central washington university proclaimed a state of financial exigency in another example linked to covid 19 s exacerbation of a long term downward trend in enrollment lincoln university in missouri also declared financial exigency this does not equate to bankruptcy which is settled in the courts and debt obligations are not renegotiated nor does it presage weakened concepts of tenure or academic freedom those fundamental tenets remain intact idealistically financial exigency announces that the university will solve its structural financial crisis with careful deliberation and full due process in practice it implies the potential termination of tenured faculty and academic programs in this context it is worth noting that the american association of university professors recognizes this eventuality a tenured appointment is an indefinite appointment that can be terminated only for cause or under extraordinary circumstances such as financial exigency and program discontinuation this last resort is always the most contentious unions faculty senates alumni groups government officials recalcitrant presidents and governing boards all become involved in questioning the need for such a draconian step tactically they draw out the process for as long as possible hoping that the financial crisis will resolve itself before terminations occur that approach is not always successful for example missouri western state university did not address years of deficit spending rendering it particularly vulnerable to the economic impact of covid 19 as a result it is now laying off roughly 70 staff and administrative employees and 50 faculty members 20 with tenure over the next two years and phasing out nearly 50 academic majors advertisement with faculty terminations now beginning and more on the horizon one core question inevitably comes up why doesn t the university reduce the number of administrators instead the conventional answer is that universities must retain a team of administrators to ensure compliance with an ever growing array of regulations imposed by federal agencies failure to comply can result in hefty penalties sometimes in the multimillion dollar range another conventional answer is that universities must retain a group of administrators to raise money enrollment managers to recruit and retain students development officers to generate donations counselors to advise students and so forth irate faculty members often find these answers unconvincing frankly many senior academic administrators who come from academic backgrounds presidents provosts deans share that viewpoint they would prefer to invest resources in more faculty members however their duty of loyalty their fiduciary responsibility requires them to ensure the university s financial well being and that necessitates adequate administrative personnel to minimize the risk of noncompliance or of insufficient income fortunately the overall economic meltdown due to the pandemic confers two potential financial benefits for most universities first enrollments generally increase as economic conditions decrease stabilizing tuition revenue this rule of thumb may not hold true for all academic units within a university such as a business school but it has held true over the years for higher education in general and second the cost of borrowing money decreases along with interest rates as such the pandemic offers universities an opportunity to refinance as much of their outstanding debt as they can and indeed institutions of all sizes and missions are taking advantage of the historically low rates in the volatile bond market the mt san antonio community college district refinanced about 91 million in bonds earlier this year saving taxpayers nearly 14 million in future debt payments iowa state university recently refinanced nearly 18 million in debt saving 2 4 million in fiscal year 2021 after the pandemic has passed all will not immediately return to normal universities must restart suspended operations reinstate furloughed employees and restore on campus instruction in a changed reality they must also realign budgets with post pandemic strategic priorities ironically this may provide opportunities for profound change as well as for new priorities business models and operational strategies until those strategies bear fruit if they do higher ed will continue to feel the financial pain
menafn asia times the battle between amazon and future group over the latter s move to sell most of its assets to reliance group has once again heated up the fight s latest round began with independent directors of future retail on sunday writing to the competition commission of india seeking revocation of its earlier approval granted to amazon to buy a stake in future coupons the directors alleged that the american e commerce giant had violated foreign direct investment norms when it picked up a 49 stake in future coupons and concealed facts while applying for the competition watchdog s approval the directors said the watchdog should act to stop amazon from perpetuating its evil non desirable designs against the indian company it said the approval given by the commission does not hold good due to the concealment and misrepresentation and false representations made by amazon the seven page letter was addressed to the competition watchdog s chairman ashok kumar gupta and a copy was marked to the stock market watchdog securities and exchange board of india chairman the finance minister and the prime minister meanwhile as a counter move amazon has written to the stock market watchdog and corporate affairs ministry seeking to withdraw any permission and consents granted to future retail regarding the 3 4 billion merger deal with reliance retail a unit of reliance group the amazon letter has also been sent to other top officials at stock exchanges such as bombay stock exchange limited and the national stock exchange of india limited the letter claimed that future retail and its promoters have been able to induce many regulators to give permissions to the indian retailer in relation to its arrangement with the reliance group it alleged this is done on the basis of various misrepresentations made by future retail and its promoters amazon had earlier challenged future retail s merger with reliance retail alleging that the transaction breached an agreement it had reached with the india retailer amazon had cited its non compete agreement with future group and the requirement that any disputes would be arbitrated under the singapore international arbitration centre rules last month the arbitrator had rejected future retail s plea to lift the interim stay on its deal with reliance retail it had also held that future retail is a party to the ongoing arbitration between amazon and future group in the dispute over the sale of its assets to reliance retail future had earlier contended before the arbitrator that it should be excluded from arbitration proceedings because it is not a party to the dispute between its promoter future coupons pvt ltd and amazon in august last year reliance retail ventures ltd had announced its decision to acquire the retail and wholesale business and the logistics and warehousing business of future group it included the sale of future group s supermarket chain big bazaar premium food supply unit foodhall and fashion and clothes supermart brand factory s retail and wholesale units amazon had then approached the singapore based arbitrator questioning the deal in october last year the arbitrator had passed an interim award in favor of the us e commerce major and barred future retail from taking any steps to dispose of its assets
by chris isidore cnn business if and when elon musk sells a large chunk of his tesla shares it ll probably have relatively little to do with a twitter poll among his loyal followers and everything to do with a looming multi billion dollar tax bill musk published a twitter poll over the weekend noting that because he doesn t receive a cash salary he pays income tax only when he sells shares and because much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance he asked the twitterverse if he should sell 10 of his shares some 58 of respondents said yes the tweet got attention as many of musk s social media antics do but the move is not really about a populist vote the real reason is because musk is just months out from a deadline to exercise the stock options he received years ago if he doesn t use them he loses them and if he does exercise his shares he s going to face a monster tax bill between nearly 11 billion to as much as 16 billion at current share prices continued increases in the value of tesla stock could push his tax bill even higher shares of the ev maker which rose 743 last year are up another 68 so far this year though they did drop 3 monday following his weekend poll musk received the 22 9 million stock options in question as part of his 2012 compensation package those options are due to expire august 13 2022 making them worthless unless musk exercises them before the deadline once he exercises however those shares would be treated as regular income subject to income tax said mark luscombe principal federal tax analyst for wolters kluwer tax accounting in most cases options like these which are based on hitting performance numbers are taxable not as income but instead at the lower capital gains rate but musk would face the income tax rate because of a special rule he owns more than 10 of tesla s total shares the taxable income is calculated based on the market value of the stock on the exercise date minus the price paid to exercise the options at monday s level that taxable amount would be about 27 billion and the top federal income tax rate is 37 with another 3 8 net investment tax on top of that so exercising would cost musk nearly 11 billion today musk owns 170 5 million shares of tesla stock outright and he has options to buy another 73 5 million as of today including the ones expiring next year he ll get even more if tesla continues to grow and hits very achievable financial targets the value of those shares and options comes to nearly 300 billion making him the richest person in the world but an analysis by propublica in june found musk paid no federal income taxes in 2018 and in 2017 he paid only 65 000 note i do not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere i only have stock thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock musk tweeted on saturday in june he tweeted a response to a tweet about his tax bill saying that the only time i sell tesla stock is when my stock options are expiring i have no choice state taxes could add to his tax bill musk may also face state taxes on top of the federal bill he did move his residence from california to texas which has no state income tax compared to california s top rate of 13 3 he has announced plans to also move tesla s california headquarters to texas but he could be hit with at least some california state income tax given that tesla still has a major factory and offices in california and musk still spends time working there musk acknowledged that in the june tweet btw i will continue to pay income taxes in california proportionate to my time in state which is will be significant it s not clear what the final state tax bill would come to as california may or may not try to tax all of musk s proceeds from these expiring options since almost all of tesla s operations were in the state when the original grant was made an additional 13 3 state income tax would come to 3 6 billion it s also possible musk will receive additional options to buy 2 6 million more shares from that 2012 grant those options could be worth another 3 billion if he gets them by the august 2022 expiration date a major stakeholder announcing plans to sell shares is rarely a good thing for a stock but many analysts are still bullish on tesla predicting further price increases in the year ahead investors were already pricing in some stock sales by musk due to the expected tax bill said daniel ives senior equity research analyst at wedbush securities with a tax bill that we calculate at north of 10 billion selling stock over the coming months is not a surprise ives wrote in a note to clients monday although holding a twitter poll to sell 10 of his stock is another bizarre soap opera that can only happen to one company and one ceo in the world cnn business ramishah maruf contributed to this report the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

china is likely not preparing for any imminent military action against taiwan despite recent revelations that the country built replica u s warships for ballistic missile testing experts tell fox news the u s naval institute usni news obtained photos of the replica vessels including an aircraft carrier in the taklamakan desert the mock ups which were substantially complete by early october 2021 appear to signal china s intent to develop technology and methods to counter these u s assets the revelation has stirred up increased concern among u s officials in congress and the pentagon about chinese aggression we re witnessing one of the largest shifts in global geostrategic power the world has witnessed joint chiefs of staff chairman gen mark milley said last week they are clearly challenging us regionally and their aspiration is to challenge the united states globally milley called the test very concerning and very close to being a sputnik moment referring to the soviet union s 1957 launch of the world s first space satellite china punishes mockery questions about historical figures this is self wounding in china the government suggested citizens stock up on necessities for an emergency causing scattered concern that beijing might order action against taiwan however some experts say that any hot conflict between the two nations is not imminent i do not believe there is an imminent threat of an amphibious invasion of taiwan by the prc president of the institute of world politics and former deputy under secretary of defense for policy james anderson told fox news these developments do point to the prc s seriousness about developing a wide range of capabilities that could be used in a taiwan scenario or other scenarios china would signal its intent to take action against taiwan by first deploying a number of unconventional pressures and menacing activities including cyberattacks troop build ups and ship realignment in the region not to mention a ramp up of diplomatic posturing anderson explained there would be a fair number of indicators he said not just a bolt from the blue however the size of the chinese navy and its growing sophistication is cause for concern just not cause for immediate action by the u s military the military does need to adjust it tactics and weapons developments to account for the revelations from china but those are long term actions pentagon congress increasingly worried about the rise of chinese military the u s already maintains a presence in the region including a recently revealed group of special forces operators who have been training the taiwanese military while a hot conflict is not likely to happen imminently china s activity makes it an increasing certainty that action will happen how the u s responds to china s eventual attack will depend on the president at the time according to isaac stone fish ceo and founder of strategy risks as well as the author of a monthly column on china risk for barron s the bigger question on whether the u s and china go to war over taiwan is less about what beijing does and more about whether biden or his successors want to deploy military means to counter the invasion when it happens stone fish told fox news biden and secretary of state antony blinken over the past two weeks reiterated that the u s will support and defend taiwan against any chinese military action saying there is no change to our policy china s wealthy seek new ways to move money avoid xi jinping s redistribution policy the biggest unknown stone fish argues is the elite power politics in china without knowing the stresses president xi jinping faces within his own party the u s cannot know whether he may feel the need to act sooner or later china s military remains largely untested which means all conflict remains theoretical at best and china may still eventually convince taiwan to accept a diplomatic situation and avoid any conflict with the u s however the u s can instead prepare for an eventual conflict by laying the groundwork now by preparing american citizens for that reality click here to get the fox news app the u s government needs to do a better job selling this to american people and the question of how do we communicate to the american people that china and the ccp may be or is the enemy we need to be fighting while protecting chinese people and chinese americans stone fish said that way if we do go to war with china over taiwan we avoid the atrocities we faced domestically in world war ii with the japanese population

when martin njoku saw opioid addiction devastate his west virginia community he felt compelled to help this was the place he d called home for three decades where he d raised his two girls and turned his dream of owning a pharmacy into reality in 2016 after flooding displaced people in nearby counties njoku began dispensing buprenorphine to them and to local customers at his oak hill hometown pharmacy in fayette county buprenorphine a controlled substance sold under the brand names subutex and suboxone is a medication to treat opioid use disorder research shows it halves the risk of overdose and doubles people s chances of entering long term recovery i thought i was doing what was righteous for people who have illness njoku said but a few years later the drug enforcement administration raided njoku s pharmacy and accused the facility of contributing to the opioid epidemic rather than curbing it the agency revoked the pharmacy s registration to dispense controlled substances claiming it posed an imminent danger to public health and safety although two judges separately ruled in njoku s favor the dea s actions effectively shuttered his business i lost everything that i worked for njoku said lawyers pharmacists harm reduction advocates and a former dea employee say njoku s case is emblematic of the dea s aggressive stance on buprenorphine an opioid itself the medication can be misused so the dea works to limit its diversion to the streets but many say the agency s policies are exacerbating the opioid epidemic by scaring pharmacies away from dispensing this medication when it s desperately needed drug overdose deaths hit record highs last year and despite medical experts considering medications like buprenorphine the gold standard less than 20 of people with opioid use disorder typically receive them the federal government has taken steps to increase the number of clinicians who prescribe buprenorphine but many patients struggle to get those prescriptions filled a recent study found that 1 in 5 u s pharmacies do not provide buprenorphine pharmacies are terrified they re going to lose their dea registration and go out of business said charles buck selby a former inspector and chief compliance officer for the west virginia board of pharmacy who retired in 2018 ainsley bryce khn khn many pharmacists fear ordering too much buprenorphine will trigger a dea investigation research in kentucky and north carolina has found that creates a prescribing cliff says bayla ostrach who researches substance use disorder treatment and health policy doctors might prescribe more but if pharmacies won t fill the prescription patients can t get their medication the ramifications can be particularly acute in rural areas where a dearth of addiction treatment providers lack of transportation and stigma against these medications already create barriers if pharmacies decline to provide buprenorphine too patients will have few options left selby said the dea did not respond to requests for comment like many other prescription drugs buprenorphine can be found illegally on the street there are unscrupulous doctors who hand out prescriptions and pharmacists who fill them subutex which consists of buprenorphine alone is easier to misuse and typically has higher street value than suboxone a combination of buprenorphine and the overdose reversal drug naloxone in the case against njoku s pharmacy an assistant u s attorney explained that the dea got slapped hard for being asleep at the switch as the opioid crisis ramped up they re trying to make sure that subutex doesn t become the next problem according to court transcripts but research suggests that buprenorphine misuse has decreased in recent years even as prescribing has increased and that most people who use diverted buprenorphine do so to avoid withdrawal symptoms and because they can t get a prescription buprenorphine is less likely to cause overdoses than other opioids because its effects taper off at higher doses said dr aaron wohl medical director of the florida based coalition project opioid in njoku s case the dea said in court documents that several red flags had suggested the pharmacy s actions were irresponsible first many of the prescriptions it filled were for subutex instead of suboxone patients also traveled sometimes out of state to get prescriptions drove long distances within west virginia to reach njoku s pharmacy and often paid in cash in traditional prescription drug cases these are all markers of trouble but as njoku s lawyers argued and two judges later agreed they can also reflect the difficulty of getting addiction treatment which is sometimes more challenging than obtaining illicit drugs the practical reality and context of west virginia turn these additional flags from red to yellow u s district judge joseph goodwin wrote in his opinion patients may go out of their way for the drug because there aren t enough nearby doctors who prescribe it or pharmacies that stock it he wrote they might pay cash because they re uninsured or medicaid won t cover prescriptions written by an out of network doctor and they might prefer subutex because it s often cheaper than suboxone courtney ingram khn khn dr nathan mullins addiction medicine fellowship director at mountain area health education center in north carolina says switching the medications of patients recovering from opioid use disorder can cause needless anxiety by 2020 goodwin and an administrative law judge at the dea had both ruled in njoku s favor but several insurers and drug suppliers had already stopped doing business with him njoku closed the pharmacy in april 2021 across the country when a pharmacy stops providing buprenorphine the ripple effects can be far reaching trish mashburn works at two independent pharmacies in western north carolina when a nearby pharmacy stopped dispensing buprenorphine she began getting five calls a day from prospective customers trying to get their prescriptions filled she said although both her employers stock buprenorphine they order only a set amount so mashburn often must turn patients away research in north carolina and kentucky has found that many pharmacists worry that ordering more buprenorphine will trigger a dea investigation the dea does not specify thresholds for controlled substances but it requires wholesalers to flag suspicious orders in turn wholesalers limit how much a pharmacy can buy or create algorithms to detect orders that exceed projected need they base these limits in part on the dea s enforcement actions said larry cote a former dea attorney who now advises wholesalers pharmacies and other clients on regulatory compliance since pharmacies are not typically privy to how these limits are set many simply order small batches of buprenorphine out of caution that creates a prescribing cliff said bayla ostrach lead author of a paper studying this issue in north carolina doctors may prescribe buprenorphine to more patients but pharmacies order enough for only a certain number of customers since many people stay on buprenorphine for years once the pharmacy hits its self established quota it may rarely have openings for new patients a lee county fla man thought he was one of the lucky ones james 34 had been filling his subutex prescription at the supermarket chain publix for seven years in that time he held steady jobs and cared for his wife and children james asked khn to withhold his last name so future employers wouldn t judge him on his addiction history then last year james said he went to get his prescription refilled and was told publix no longer stocks subutex the medication the dea considered a red flag in njoku s case publix did not respond to requests for comment a decade ago when james began the medication he chose subutex because it was cheaper than suboxone today most insurance plans cover suboxone and the price difference has narrowed somewhat james was not eager to change to a potentially pricier medication and he worried a different drug might disrupt his recovery a common sentiment among patients in long term recovery said dr nathan mullins director of addiction medicine fellowship at mountain area health education center in north carolina changing their medication is unnecessary and can cause needless anxiety mullins said luckily james found an independent pharmacy that provides subutex it s more expensive since the new place doesn t accept his insurance he said he pays about 40 a week compared with 40 a month previously but james said it s worth it i ve been in 10 rehabs and a million detoxes and the only thing that has worked for me was one sublingual tablet james said along with therapy this saved my life khn kaiser health news is an editorially independent program of kff kaiser family foundation copyright 2023 kaiser health news to

listen to this article listen to this article editor s note business content from the new york times will now be included with your subscription to finance commerce not a subscriber start your subscription here elon musk may have already been compelled to sell a sizable portion of his tesla shares even if he had not issued an unusual twitter pledge over the weekend musk on saturday polled twitter users on whether he should sell 10 of his stake in his company the poll appeared to be a response to a democratic proposal to tax the unrealized gains of billionaires much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance so i propose selling 10 of my tesla stock he tweeted musk said he was raising the question because he does not take a cash salary as tesla s ceo and therefore would not have any way to pay a large tax bill without selling some of his tesla shares which make up the vast majority of his wealth musk wrote in a follow up tweet that he would abide by the results of this poll whichever way it goes tesla s shares were down a little more than 3 on the news monday he closed the poll sunday after nearly 3 5 million votes had been cast with 58 voting for him to sell musk has not confirmed what he will do but after closing the poll he tweeted i was prepared to accept either outcome either way musk may soon have needed to sell a big chunk of his shares he holds nearly 23 million stock options that were awarded in 2012 those options have since vested and will expire in august 2022 most stock grants allow executives to avoid paying taxes for years and perhaps forever as long as they do not sell the shares they get from converting the option but brian foley an executive compensation consultant says that because of the size of musk s grant and the way it was structured it is likely that much of his 2012 options do not qualify for the preferential tax treatment that means musk would owe income taxes when he exercises the grant which at current prices would be worth just under 30 billion musk s tax bill could top 10 billion depending on what percentage of the options do not qualify for the preferential treatment they are a ticking tax time bomb foley said of musk s stock options offhand i can t think of any way for him to get around paying the tax what s more musk may need to sell even more shares than what it would take to pay his tax bill he owns 17 of tesla s shares which at its current stock price would be worth about 200 billion that means his weekend tweets are a pledge to sell roughly 20 billion worth of tesla s shares the potential sale could roil tesla s stock at a time when many analysts say it is already overvalued the company s market value recently crossed 1 trillion making it only one of five u s publicly traded companies to be worth that much nonetheless james cox a professor at duke university law school and an expert in securities laws said it might be hard for musk to go back on his twitter pledge it s a no win situation cox said in the securities law the problem is this could be seen as a misrepresentation that was meant to mislead if another shareholder sold on musk s tweet but cox said it would be a hard lawsuit to win because ceos are allowed to make statements and change their minds as long as they meant what they said when they said it it would not be the first time that musk has gotten into trouble over his tweets in late 2018 he and tesla settled a lawsuit by the securities and exchange commission without admitting guilt for tweeting about a potential sale of tesla that never happened musk was also sued for defamation in 2018 after calling a diver who had helped rescue children stuck in a cave in thailand a pedo guy on twitter musk won the suit daniel ives a stock analyst at wedbush securities who follows tesla called musk s latest twitter pledge bizarre but said he thought that given tesla s prospects and the investor enthusiasm for the company the stock which is up more than 60 this year would keep climbing even with musk cashing out a portion of his holdings musk was likely to sell some of his tesla stock before year end but no one ever imagined there would be a twitter poll translating into a 10 sale of his ownership ives said this weekend s twitter poll was a strange one even for elon this article originally appeared in the new york times

what a tweet tesla slumps after musk asks twitter if he should sell some of his stake and most who voted said go ahead elon musk is known for his bizarre posts on social media and has often fallen foul of financial regulators with his controversial tweets but the tesla chief executive made possibly his most unusual move yet over the weekend the world s richest man with a total net worth of 251billion asked his twitter followers to decide whether he should sell a massive 10 per cent chunk of his holding in the electric car company around 3 5m users of the social media site cast their vote in the poll and 57 9 per cent said yes if musk honours their decision as he has promised he will have to sell around 17m shares which are worth 15billion at today s price with that many shares coming onto the market tesla stock slumped nearly 7 per cent before recovering to a 3 per cent drop it was the latest example of musk 50 causing shockwaves with his tweets over the years his comments on social media have caused wild swings in tesla s share price shaken up the value of crypto currencies such as bitcoin and dogecoin and provoked us regulators to launch lawsuits against him the eccentric entrepreneur and father of six who has run tesla since 2008 said at the weekend that much was being made of the fact that most of his wealth is stored in shares meaning he pays little in tax musk tweeted i do not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere i only have stock thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock running a poll on twitter he added much is made lately of unrealised gains being a means of tax avoidance so i propose selling 10 per cent of my tesla stock do you agree it seemed that twitter users did as the vote closed on sunday night and asked whether it had gone the way he wanted it to musk said i was prepared to accept either outcome the bizarre vote came weeks after he slammed president biden s plan to launch a tax on billionaires in the united states which would leave musk with a mammoth bill under the proposals the us president will levy a tax held on the assets of the country s very richest even if they do not take a cash income referring to the reform musk tweeted last month eventually they run out of other people s money and then they come for you earlier this year it was revealed that musk and his rival amazon founder jeff bezos have in recent years paid nothing in federal income tax ron wyden an oregon democrat and chairman of the senate finance committee who has led the plans for the tax reform dismissed musk s poll as a stunt he said whether or not the world s wealthiest man pays any taxes at all shouldn t depend on the results of a twitter poll it s time for the billionaires income tax musk responded with a crude tweet referring to wyden s genitals he also changed his twitter name to lord edge an apparent reference to the term edgelord which according to oxford languages is used to describe a person who affects a provocative or extreme persona especially online the twitter poll was the latest example of musk who recently split from pop star girlfriend grimes using the social media platform in a way which has raised eyebrows in 2018 he baselessly branded a british cave explorer who had been trying to rescue a group of boys stuck in a thai cave pedo guy musk won a lawsuit when the explorer tried to accuse him of defamation the billionaire s lawyers claimed in court that the phrase pedo guy was clearly meant as an insult which is considered protected speech and that musk had never actually meant to imply the rescuer was a paedophile musk has also become known as a vocal backer of various crypto currencies he tweeted in support of bitcoin several times pushing up the price of the digital asset he even said tesla would start accepting bitcoin payments for its cars but later rolled back stating the crypto currency was too energy intensive which saw its value tumble musk now seems to be throwing his weight behind dogecoin a crypto currency based on a dog which was initially launched as a joke since he tweeted about the coin in early march its value has rocketed by 460 per cent car trouble tesla s valuation has already been destabilised by musk s twitter activity this is still a way off the peaks it hit in may on the back of musk s support meaning any traders who had bought dogecoin at its heights may now be smarting but it wouldn t be the first time musk has angered investors an april fool s joke in 2018 backfired when he tweeted that tesla had gone completely and totally bankrupt while many shareholders recognised the post as a joke others were fumed when tesla shares slumped 7 per cent as the stock market opened the following day that same year musk locked horns with us financial regulator the securities and exchange commission sec after tweeting that he planned to take tesla private and had the funding to do so a move which sent the shares soaring a deal never materialised after a lengthy lawsuit which was eventually settled for 15million each from musk and tesla the sec ordered that all of musk s tweets must be approved by his company in future but the slap on the wrist failed to deter musk and the sec wrote to tesla in 2019 and 2020 about more tweets which supposedly violated the settlement and on twitter just last month musk said he would sell tesla stock and donate it to the un s world food program if leaders at the organisation could describe exactly how the money would solve world hunger it was unclear whether he actually planned to give away any of the money he will raise from his proposed share sale after the twitter poll aj bell s investment director russ mould added some investors might be taking musk s comments with a pinch of salt he has often made comments on twitter implying one thing and then doing the opposite soon after but his actions could irritate shareholders whose interests he is supposed to protect mould warned because the incident has already destabilised the company s valuation
news analysis the menace of inflation is back those who lived through the disastrous inflationary 1970s don t want to relive them yet that s what some now fear they worry the combination of federal reserve bank s cheap money low interest rates combined with unprecedented government spending will trigger 1970s inflation the great inflation was one of the most turbulent economic periods of the twentieth century researchers at the richmond fed wrote in 2016 inflation and economic output were highly volatile throughout the 1970s annual growth in real gross domestic product gdp climbed as high as 6 9 percent in 1972 and 1978 and fell as low as 1 9 percent in 1974 while inflation dipped to less than 3 percent in 1972 and spiked to more than 10 percent in 1974 and 1979 researchers thomas lubik christian matthes and tim soblik wrote in an economic brief the burns disinflation of 1974 in the worst of the great inflation interest rates were historically high over 20 percent still the economy today is not as bad as those numbers but critics say inflation is creeping up the federal reserve board open market committee recently raised its annual inflation forecast from 3 4 percent to 4 2 percent for 2021 the committee said the rate would run a little above two percent through at least 2024 fed officials have said they will avoid a 1970s rehash a historian remembers those times he says inflation has hardly been a factor for decades but now it s different today they re put on the gas jets with government spending they are printing money that they don t have they are borrowing more and more says david pietrusza the author of numerous historical works including 1920 the year of six presidents the 1970s was a difficult decade most fed watchers agree monetary and fiscal policies everything from paying for the war in vietnam and the great society triggered inflation president nixon running for re election in 1972 accepted some inflation in exchange for low unemployment numbers writes economist j bradford delong in his national bureau of economic research nber paper america s peacetime inflation the 1970s nixon who in running big deficits re defined himself as a keynesian was paying for the war in vietnam and expanded social programs this government must spend big argument was recently made by the biden administration it has proposed record new welfare and infrastructure spending as a way of helping the nation recover from the effects of covid lockdowns president joe biden in a june 29 speech in la crosse wisconsin said his infrastructure package will help tens of millions of americans this deal biden recently said isn t just the sum of its parts it s a signal to ourselves and to the world that american democracy can come through and deliver for all its people both in the 1970s and today large government deficits require increased money creation rates so president nixon decided in 1969 that he needed another central banker the new federal reserve chairman arthur burns a nixon ally going back to the eisenhower administration was committed or pressured to keep interest rates low nixon had refused to re appoint the previous fed chairman william mcchesney martin that s because nixon believed he lost the 1960 presidential election owing to mcchesney s tight money policies just before the 1960 election burns warned candidate nixon interest rates were too high burns wrote that everything possible be done to avert this development by loosening up on credit and increasing spending for national security according to nixon memoir six crises a decade later nixon believed burns would provide cheap money a policy that eventually meant high inflation indeed inflation became a big problem for all three 1970s presidents they all tried various ineffective strategies to contain it in march 1974 cost of living council director john dunlop said we just don t know how to control inflation the problem of anticipating inflation an economist wrote was unprecedented the 1970s are america s only peacetime outburst of inflation the 1970s was the only era in which business enterprise and financing transactions were also speculating on the future of monetary policy economist j bradford delong wrote in a nber study the sustained elevation of inflation for a decade has no parallel in the past century and concern about inflation was an important factor in nearly all business decisions delong added nixon according to several historical accounts forced burns to keep down interest rates the nixon team often seemed oblivious of the board s independence the wall street journal wrote on jan 14 1970 this is a standing vote of approval in advance for lower interest rates and more money said nixon at burns swearing in i have very strong views and i expect to present them to mr burns i respect his independence but i hope he will independently conclude that my views are the right ones nixon said as quoted in the kansas city star of feb 1 1970 the stock market initially was not hurt by the spending and monetary policies of nixon and burns in 1971 and 1972 nixon easily won a second term still eventually the economy and the market crashed in an 18 month period of 1973 1974 the stock market went down some 40 percent joel griffith a heritage foundation researcher sees similarities he says the stock market up some 30 percent since the covid crisis began in 2020 has been pumped up by historically high deficits and low interest rates these stock market values obviously haven t been reflected in the economy which has not grown by 30 percent over the past year griffith argues what has been happening griffith adds is huge government spending and easy money policies are distorting values this distortion will eventually be felt in the stock market and the economy he says and it is very possible we could see more 1970s problems the fed failed between 1969 and 1980 that s when the inflation index varied it was 5 4 percent at the beginning and 13 5 percent in 1980 according to a study by edward nelson of the federal reserve bank of st louis titled the great inflation of the 1970s what really happened burns in his memoirs conceded mistakes but blamed them more on fiscal than monetary policy we are a nation in a hurry for more and more of what we consider the good things in life wrote arthur burns in a speech titled the menace of inflation i do not question that yearning properly directed it can be a powerful force for human betterment difficulties arise however when people in general try to reach their goals by means of shortcuts and that is what has happened federal reserve board chairman jerome powell addressed the 1970s fears last week we understand the difficulties that high inflation poses for individuals and families particularly those with limited means to absorb higher prices for essentials such as food and transportation powell said still while saying the inflationary spike is transitory at a recent central bankers forum powell added it is frustrating to see the bottlenecks and supply chain problems not getting better in fact at the margin apparently getting a little bit worse and we see that continuing into next year probably and holding inflation up longer than we thought
when martin njoku saw opioid addiction devastate his west virginia community he felt compelled to help this was the place he d called home for three decades where he d raised his two girls and turned his dream of owning a pharmacy into reality in 2016 after flooding displaced people in nearby counties njoku began dispensing buprenorphine to them and to local customers at his oak hill hometown pharmacy in fayette county buprenorphine a controlled substance sold under the brand names subutex and suboxone is a medication to treat opioid use disorder research shows it halves the risk of overdose and doubles people s chances of entering long term recovery i thought i was doing what was righteous for people who have illness njoku said but a few years later the drug enforcement administration raided njoku s pharmacy and accused the facility of contributing to the opioid epidemic rather than curbing it the agency revoked the pharmacy s registration to dispense controlled substances claiming it posed an imminent danger to public health and safety although two judges separately ruled in njoku s favor the dea s actions effectively shuttered his business i lost everything that i worked for njoku said lawyers pharmacists harm reduction advocates and a former dea employee say njoku s case is emblematic of the dea s aggressive stance on buprenorphine an opioid itself the medication can be misused so the dea works to limit its diversion to the streets but many say the agency s policies are exacerbating the opioid epidemic by scaring pharmacies away from dispensing this medication when it s desperately needed drug overdose deaths hit record highs last year and despite medical experts considering medications like buprenorphine the gold standard less than 20 of people with opioid use disorder typically receive them the federal government has taken steps to increase the number of clinicians who prescribe buprenorphine but many patients struggle to get those prescriptions filled a recent study found that 1 in 5 u s pharmacies do not provide buprenorphine pharmacies are terrified they re going to lose their dea registration and go out of business said charles buck selby a former inspector and chief compliance officer for the west virginia board of pharmacy who retired in 2018 ainsley bryce khn khn many pharmacists fear ordering too much buprenorphine will trigger a dea investigation research in kentucky and north carolina has found that creates a prescribing cliff says bayla ostrach who researches substance use disorder treatment and health policy doctors might prescribe more but if pharmacies won t fill the prescription patients can t get their medication the ramifications can be particularly acute in rural areas where a dearth of addiction treatment providers lack of transportation and stigma against these medications already create barriers if pharmacies decline to provide buprenorphine too patients will have few options left selby said the dea did not respond to requests for comment like many other prescription drugs buprenorphine can be found illegally on the street there are unscrupulous doctors who hand out prescriptions and pharmacists who fill them subutex which consists of buprenorphine alone is easier to misuse and typically has higher street value than suboxone a combination of buprenorphine and the overdose reversal drug naloxone in the case against njoku s pharmacy an assistant u s attorney explained that the dea got slapped hard for being asleep at the switch as the opioid crisis ramped up they re trying to make sure that subutex doesn t become the next problem according to court transcripts but research suggests that buprenorphine misuse has decreased in recent years even as prescribing has increased and that most people who use diverted buprenorphine do so to avoid withdrawal symptoms and because they can t get a prescription buprenorphine is less likely to cause overdoses than other opioids because its effects taper off at higher doses said dr aaron wohl medical director of the florida based coalition project opioid in njoku s case the dea said in court documents that several red flags had suggested the pharmacy s actions were irresponsible first many of the prescriptions it filled were for subutex instead of suboxone patients also traveled sometimes out of state to get prescriptions drove long distances within west virginia to reach njoku s pharmacy and often paid in cash in traditional prescription drug cases these are all markers of trouble but as njoku s lawyers argued and two judges later agreed they can also reflect the difficulty of getting addiction treatment which is sometimes more challenging than obtaining illicit drugs the practical reality and context of west virginia turn these additional flags from red to yellow u s district judge joseph goodwin wrote in his opinion patients may go out of their way for the drug because there aren t enough nearby doctors who prescribe it or pharmacies that stock it he wrote they might pay cash because they re uninsured or medicaid won t cover prescriptions written by an out of network doctor and they might prefer subutex because it s often cheaper than suboxone courtney ingram khn khn dr nathan mullins addiction medicine fellowship director at mountain area health education center in north carolina says switching the medications of patients recovering from opioid use disorder can cause needless anxiety by 2020 goodwin and an administrative law judge at the dea had both ruled in njoku s favor but several insurers and drug suppliers had already stopped doing business with him njoku closed the pharmacy in april 2021 across the country when a pharmacy stops providing buprenorphine the ripple effects can be far reaching trish mashburn works at two independent pharmacies in western north carolina when a nearby pharmacy stopped dispensing buprenorphine she began getting five calls a day from prospective customers trying to get their prescriptions filled she said although both her employers stock buprenorphine they order only a set amount so mashburn often must turn patients away research in north carolina and kentucky has found that many pharmacists worry that ordering more buprenorphine will trigger a dea investigation the dea does not specify thresholds for controlled substances but it requires wholesalers to flag suspicious orders in turn wholesalers limit how much a pharmacy can buy or create algorithms to detect orders that exceed projected need they base these limits in part on the dea s enforcement actions said larry cote a former dea attorney who now advises wholesalers pharmacies and other clients on regulatory compliance since pharmacies are not typically privy to how these limits are set many simply order small batches of buprenorphine out of caution that creates a prescribing cliff said bayla ostrach lead author of a paper studying this issue in north carolina doctors may prescribe buprenorphine to more patients but pharmacies order enough for only a certain number of customers since many people stay on buprenorphine for years once the pharmacy hits its self established quota it may rarely have openings for new patients a lee county fla man thought he was one of the lucky ones james 34 had been filling his subutex prescription at the supermarket chain publix for seven years in that time he held steady jobs and cared for his wife and children james asked khn to withhold his last name so future employers wouldn t judge him on his addiction history then last year james said he went to get his prescription refilled and was told publix no longer stocks subutex the medication the dea considered a red flag in njoku s case publix did not respond to requests for comment a decade ago when james began the medication he chose subutex because it was cheaper than suboxone today most insurance plans cover suboxone and the price difference has narrowed somewhat james was not eager to change to a potentially pricier medication and he worried a different drug might disrupt his recovery a common sentiment among patients in long term recovery said dr nathan mullins director of addiction medicine fellowship at mountain area health education center in north carolina changing their medication is unnecessary and can cause needless anxiety mullins said luckily james found an independent pharmacy that provides subutex it s more expensive since the new place doesn t accept his insurance he said he pays about 40 a week compared with 40 a month previously but james said it s worth it i ve been in 10 rehabs and a million detoxes and the only thing that has worked for me was one sublingual tablet james said along with therapy this saved my life khn kaiser health news is an editorially independent program of kff kaiser family foundation copyright 2023 kaiser health news to

no doubt about it rapper travis scott could see major legal blowback over the deaths that occurred over the weekend during his performance at the astroworld music festival at the houston texas performance eight people died in what authorities are calling a mass casualty incident which saw more injured after a crowd surge while scott was on stage scott has been forward about his intention to pay for funeral costs for those who died but questions remain about what other financial liabilities he could face as well as event promoter live nation the venue could absolutely be on the hook for the most money if what is shown is negligence in securing and managing the venue without other willful or major contributing factors rachel fiset managing partner of zweiback fiset coleman who is not involved in the case told fox business a lot will depend on the police investigation and what facts come out regarding any type of intentional acts by scott or anyone else travis scott will cover the cost of funeral expenses therapy for astroworld victims live updates she added that if it s found that scott was acting intentionally to prompt the surge or if he s found to have committed a felony relating to security breaches and encouraging the crowd he would likely be the most responsible party under texas law this analysis is highly fact dependent and it is not yet known where the most fault will lie she explained furthermore each party involved may not be off the hook if they don t directly face lawsuits during the early rounds of litigation i think the parties are all vulnerable to suits from each other to seek contribution fiset said for instance if a plaintiff sues scott and live nation and those parties are found liable for damages scott or live nation may turn around and sue the venue for damages to recover a portion of what they had pay live nation s stock sinks after astroworld tragedy a texas statute could make a defendant responsible for everything if it is found that he is over 50 responsible for an injury which leaves open the possibility for cross suits for a portion of that liability she said neama rahmani a former federal prosecutor and president of west coast trial lawyers who is also not involved in the case echoed similar sentiments in cases like this the injured and the family of the deceased sue everyone the artist promoter and venue he stated in texas liability and the responsibility to pay damages are generally apportioned according fault so the plaintiffs file against everyone to ensure they are made whole rahmani added the defendants may have contractual agreements to defend and indemnify one another if there are any injury claims in that case one defendant may assume responsibility for the entire defense if not the defendants will cross complain and point the finger at one another rahmani said that criminal prosecution is unlikely in this case as it requires actual intent the reckless regard of human life though scott and the other defendants conduct is negligent under a civil standard criminal law has a much higher bar and we don t have enough evidence to substantiate a criminal prosecution said the attorney at least not yet ireland baldwin defends travis scott compares astroworld deaths to father alec s rust shooting backlash however scott could certainly be held liable for the deaths and injuries in a civil case rahmani claimed he reportedly encouraged violence at his events and he continued to perform for approximately 40 minutes after the first injuries were reported likely causing additional casualties rahmani speculated most ticketed events include a waiver of liability but there are exclusions under the law for gross negligence or any intentional conduct so these are strong civil claims notwithstanding any waiver stocks in this article lyv 102 74 1 30 in 2019 when several astroworld attendees were injured in a stampede at the festival scott shared a video of the incident on social media adding the caption da youth dem control the frequency everyone have fun ragers set tone when i come out tonight be safe rage hard ahhhhhhhhhhh law enforcement said during a press conference on saturday that the size of the event and the age of its attendees had an effect on the 40 minute delay between the first injuries and the halting of the performance fiset pointed out that scott born jacques bermon webster ii his promoter a concert venue and its security teams are currently being sued for reckless wanton and willful conduct by a former concertgoer who was allegedly paralyzed at a prior show which could set precedent for the upcoming case or cases in 2018 a federal court determined that livenation would not be liable for a concertgoer s injury at a gwen stefani concert telling the plaintiff to instead look to the artist for liability she explained the investigation leading up to this event and the facts relayed will determine who is at fault and it may be shown that all parties contributed to this incident such that they all pay some amount in damages famed attorney benjamin brafman who like fiset and rahmani is uninvolved with the case said there will be enormous civil liability for the people who were responsible for staging the concert click here to read more on fox business these concerts have strict security concerns that are often ignored because they want to swell the crowd they want the crowd to appear to be very excited and a lot will depend on whether the audience was beyond the limit of what that venue was designed to hold he added the rule in you know civil lawsuits is you sue everybody you can and then it shakes itself out but i would be surprised if mr scott does not face substantial initial civil liability that that may ultimately stand up brafman added that scott s security companies will likely be looking into whether the standards they set for the event were adhered to fox business stephanie pagones contributed to this report
maybe you have a natural affinity for making and managing money or maybe you re just trying not to make a hash of it either way someone at some point in your life likely dropped a pearl of wisdom in your lap that has made your financial life better than it would have been otherwise we asked readers to share the best financial advice they ever got don t just pocket your raise invest half of it into your 401 k every time some advice is so good you can take it to the bank that is exactly what stevan vigneaux did in the mid 1980s he was in his early 30s and working as an engineering manager at a local television station in hartford connecticut the station s vice president of engineering pushed him to save in the company s 401 k which was offering a generous matching contribution when vigneaux said he couldn t afford to he and his wife a schoolteacher had just had their first child and had bought a money pit for a house his boss pushed harder he said yes you can and you must when you get your next raise save half you ll never miss it vigneaux recounted the boss went further telling vigneaux to invest half of every raise he gets from then on until he maxes out his contributions you ll be glad you did the boss said noting that he would be crazy to pass up the free money from the company match it s 35 years later and he was right on all counts we never missed the portion of the raise we directed to savings stevan vigneaux it s 35 years later and he was right on all counts vigneaux said we never missed the portion of the raise we directed to savings vigneaux has since given the same advice to friends and family and today mostly retired he says he and his wife aren t rich but live comfortably without financial stress if you can t pay in full for what you re buying don t charge it brian schmidt pictured with his wife lesley said he plans to pass along the sound credit card advice his dad gave him when his own son goes off to college courtesy brian schmidt credit cards should be used as a financial convenience not a crutch that was the underlying message of what brian schmidt s father told him when he went to college my father told me it s okay to use a credit card but never carry a balance i ve followed that to this day i use my credit card for most purchases but pay it off every month never carry a balance on a credit card due to the high interest rate said schmidt the lesson influenced how he thought about other debt too i was always thinking if i couldn t afford to pay for it then i d wait unless it was good debt like taking out a mortgage on an appreciating asset today at 46 schmidt said he and his wife are debt free having paid off their mortgage in 16 years their plan now is to put their 16 year old son through college giving him just one credit card and his grandfather s wisdom it s never too late to invest michael blount still plans to work until he s 70 but he is better situated for retirement than he expected to be thanks to an investing maxim he heard in his 50s courtesy michael blount a decade ago at 55 michael blount made his first real foray into investing nearing retirement from a 23 year career in the military he decided to invest a small amount of money with a broker since he wasn t working with hundreds of thousands of dollars blount said i was worried the broker might laugh it off but he didn t the broker instead suggested putting the money into index funds not long after blount said he listened to a series of online personal finance lectures it was in one of those lectures that he heard what he characterizes as some of the best financial advice he s gotten the best day to invest was yesterday the next best is today he decided to take gains that accrued in his index funds and invest them in some top technology stocks including apple amazon and microsoft he said he thought to himself i m gonna take a chance his bet and his timing has paid off quite well he said he was fortunate to buy amazon at 800 a share for instance and today it s trading at roughly 3 500 after retiring from the service in 2015 blount became a federal contractor he s 65 today and plans to work until he s 70 since his military pension isn t large he will rely on his stock portfolio to augment his retirement income along with some prior savings he put away in the federal government s thrift savings plan he knows he s lucky to have entered the stock market when it was going sideways coming out of the great recession and he s grateful his portfolio has done well it certainly takes the pressure off he said budget for all your needs including fun trying to stick to a diet that is so rigid you can never eat what you really love is a waste of time because you re going to blow it the same is true of a hyper strict budget three years ago when she was 22 sarah williams had her first job out of college but she made so little that she bartended at night for extra cash even then she couldn t make ends meet between her living expenses credit card debt and student loan debt based on her general idea of what she had coming in every month williams would try budgeting but usually fell short because she didn

yourself then the budget doesn t feel restrictive it feels productive williams said it has made a huge impact on my life she used to tell me budget realistically things you do for fun then the budget doesn t feel restrictive it feels productive sarah williams for her that meant acknowledging that she is regularly going to blow a lot on amazon so she set a dollar limit on amazon purchases and earmarked money for the occasional weekend trips she takes with her boyfriend as well as a 50 monthly gym membership she also set up a schedule to work down her debt starting with the smallest credit card balances first and throughout the pandemic she continued making her student loan payments even though she was allowed to defer them today at 25 williams is working as an it director at a financial advisory firm getting a graduate degree and said she has whittled her 7 000 in credit card debt down to less than 1 000 retirement is easy to solve if you start saving in your 20s now in his 50s gary anderson is so thankful his father nagged him to start saving for retirement in his salad days courtesy gary anderson gary anderson credits his dad with teaching him the importance of saving for retirement early on he started nagging me from the moment i got my first job out of college anderson said i wasn t great with money in my early 20s and i can t say that i immediately took his advice but i did hear it and as i got a little more comfortable financially i started upping my 401 k contributions with every pay raise until i was maxed out he then encouraged his future wife to do the same now in their early 50s and hoping to retire sooner rather than later they re glad they did anderson said when he flew to visit his father soon after his dad had been diagnosed with alzheimer s his father assumed anderson s mother had paid for the trip it pained me to realize that my dad didn t understand that thanks in part to his advice i had long since achieved a level of financial comfort that i could afford to come see him on my own anderson said never spend money behind your spouse s back thanks to a key piece of advice from his own dad wayne nelson said he and his wife susie have never had one argument over money in 50 years of marriage kira baron wayne nelson s father a swedish immigrant who worked as an electrician at steel mills shared many financial tips with his three kids for instance nelson said the first check you write is to give to others every month then to yourself in the form of savings and investments at dinner we talked about how the nelson stocks did today he said next on the list never have more than one mortgage and car payment at a time and carry no other debt but nelson a former teacher who is now a real estate broker at age 78 speaks most fondly of the next item on his dad s list before you get married make an agreement with your spouse to be that you will never spend money behind each other s backs spending behind your spouse s back is to defy the marriage contract and will land you in divorce court nelson said in his own marriage now going on 50 years nelson said he and his wife susie who was also a teacher have never bought anything without first checking with the other whether it was a shirt from macy s or a toy for their daughter they took it one step further we both agreed if there s a major financial purchase and one says no the other can t hold bad feelings nelson said they have had arguments over the years especially when he was struggling with ptsd after vietnam but we have never had one money argument not one family is always more important than money elliot pepper with his wife shira said her parents have shown by their example how to use money well to benefit family and not just indulge in creature comforts courtesy elliot pepper people make a lot of jokes about how annoying or difficult in laws can be but elliot pepper can t say enough good things about his in laws whom he credits with convincing him to go to college and then offering him encouragement as he explored different professional opportunities they had a profound impact on my life pepper said without them i would have been a hot mess now a financial planner who also teaches a high school course in financial literacy pepper acknowledges that his in laws almost certainly had an alternative motive for encouraging him to find his way in life what with his marrying their daughter shira when he was just 21 but to him the most important financial wisdom they ever imparted had less to do with how to make money than it did with how to use it well they always made sure their children could get the education they wanted pepper said his in laws would pay for far flung relatives to travel to family gatherings and most impressive was how well they supported their own aging parents said pepper the money had was not just for them to be comfortable

in september 2020 nonprofit generation180 released its third edition of a study on solar in u s schools titled brighter future which assesses solar trends nationwide and describes how solar schools are saving millions in energy bills key findings include that more than 7 300 or 5 5 percent of k 12 public and private schools use solar a number that has increased by 81 percent since 2014 and those schools enroll more than 5 3 million students the report provides several case studies so readers can witness the increased resilience and savings achieved by solar powered school districts for example an arkansas school district used its annual energy savings of nearly 100 000 to increase its teachers salaries and fill budget gaps the report also specifies that third party ownership has made financing possible for 79 percent of schools with solar meaning a majority of those schools haven t had to make a massive upfront investment to start reaping the rewards of solar energy according to online solar marketplace energysage schools have a unique opportunity to implement solar because they often have the kind of spacious level locations that are ideal for hosting solar arrays and the benefits go beyond cutting utility costs the interstate renewable energy council which tracks the number of k 12 schools with solar installations and helps schools go solar says on its website that schools with solar setups have an opportunity to educate students about clean energy and to demonstrate a commitment to investing in their students and the planet s health and future schools in the united states are huge consumers of energy according to energy star k 12 schools spend more than 6 billion annually on energy far surpassing the amount spent on other resources and at least 30 percent of this energy is used inefficiently or needlessly so schools can start to save energy in several ways from low cost adjustments such as turning off lights in unused rooms to large scale projects such as adding insulation and as solar becomes a more financially viable option for powering buildings more schools are making the move toward renewables and installing panels on their rooftops or property the yurok people have lived along the klamath river which flows from the cascades in oregon southwest through northern california for thousands of years stewarding the region and river from which they and others draw sustenance but as development and pollution continue to diminish the number of fish in the river and reduce the quantity and quality of its waters the yurok tribe is codifying the tribe s longstanding care by granting the rights of personhood to the klamath the first river in north america to have such rights declared the yurok tribal council s may 2019 resolution means the river has the same legal rights as a human under tribal law this ordinance allows people to bring lawsuits on behalf of the river when an entity is inflicting harm in violation of its rights according to the resolution the tribe s intention is to provide a legal basis for safeguarding the river and its ecosystem especially in the face of water diversion industrial contaminants and climate change impacts among other threats in a testimony delivered to the u s house of representatives in october 2019 yurok tribe vice chairman frankie myers said this legal framework could forge a path toward a more holistic view of the rights of nature in other communities and courts and that any money awarded by the yurok courts will fund cleanup and restoration projects to remedy the litigated harms the yurok tribe s resolution draws on the united nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples and echoes the efforts of other indigenous tribes including the white earth band of ojibwe which adopted the rights of manoomin or wild rice in december 2018 protesters defend old growth forests a grassroots group called the rainforest flying squad claims only 2 7 percent of british columbia s original productive old growth forests are still standing and since late 2020 the group has been taking nonviolent direct action to protect what remains from logging driven to civil disobedience by the climate and biodiversity crisis the activists have blockaded roads on vancouver island near the fairy creek watershed to prevent access to the unprotected ancient forest that s home to rare species and towering trees some of which are thousands of years old the forests around fairy creek are in the territories of several first nations who partnered with forestry company teal jones group to log portions of the forest including the pacheedaht and pacheedaht first nation chiefs have been critical of the protesters unsolicited presence however the protesters have remained citing pacheedaht elder bill jones invitation to stay on his traditional territory and to remember that there are many voices within our communities there are many different priorities and many different paths to take teal jones was granted an injunction against the protesters interference in april 2021 which was enforced by the royal canadian mounted police who arrested approximately 1 000 people over the course of several months then in late september 2021 the supreme court of british columbia denied teal jones an extension of this injunction citing serious and substantial infringement of civil liberties by police at the time of this writing the protesters have maintained their blockades while teal jones has appealed the court s decision and has been granted an interim injunction by the b c court of appeal while the supreme court appeal is pending doubly green fuel untapped biowaste from food scraps and manure could be transformed into 10 billion worth of renewable energy for vehicles annually according to researcher fateme rezaei at the missouri university of science and technology in a news article released earlier this year missouri s t says the energy generating process the researchers are proposing would involve capturing renewable natural gas rng from biowaste and renewable hydrogen rh2 from the extra electricity produced by solar or wind energy this technique has been dubbed doubly green because it would rely on byproducts from already green technologies but because of the prohibitive cost of processing biogas into viable vehicle fuel this renewable resource remains mostly idle and some areas lack the infrastructure to transport it to overcome these obstacles without requiring the buildout of brand new pipelines rezaei an associate professor of chemical and biochemical engineering is testing technology that would enable low pressure storage and separation of the gases in a fuel tank the tank would also filter and sequester carbon so it could be returned to the fueling station with this tank drivers could choose to run a natural gas engine on a blend of gases generated by biowaste an option that might benefit folks in places where biowaste is abundant farmers market safety course pennstate extension offers a range of educational opportunities from articles and guides to webinars and workshops and included on this

when martin njoku saw opioid addiction devastate his west virginia community he felt compelled to help this was the place he d called home for three decades where he d raised his two girls and turned his dream of owning a pharmacy into reality in 2016 after flooding displaced people in nearby counties njoku began dispensing buprenorphine to them and to local customers at his oak hill hometown pharmacy in fayette county buprenorphine a controlled substance sold under the brand names subutex and suboxone is a medication to treat opioid use disorder research shows it halves the risk of overdose and doubles people s chances of entering long term recovery i thought i was doing what was righteous for people who have illness njoku said but a few years later the drug enforcement administration raided njoku s pharmacy and accused the facility of contributing to the opioid epidemic rather than curbing it the agency revoked the pharmacy s registration to dispense controlled substances claiming it posed an imminent danger to public health and safety although two judges separately ruled in njoku s favor the dea s actions effectively shuttered his business i lost everything that i worked for njoku said lawyers pharmacists harm reduction advocates and a former dea employee say njoku s case is emblematic of the dea s aggressive stance on buprenorphine an opioid itself the medication can be misused so the dea works to limit its diversion to the streets but many say the agency s policies are exacerbating the opioid epidemic by scaring pharmacies away from dispensing this medication when it s desperately needed drug overdose deaths hit record highs last year and despite medical experts considering medications like buprenorphine the gold standard less than 20 of people with opioid use disorder typically receive them the federal government has taken steps to increase the number of clinicians who prescribe buprenorphine but many patients struggle to get those prescriptions filled a recent study found that 1 in 5 u s pharmacies do not provide buprenorphine pharmacies are terrified they re going to lose their dea registration and go out of business said charles buck selby a former inspector and chief compliance officer for the west virginia board of pharmacy who retired in 2018 ainsley bryce khn khn many pharmacists fear ordering too much buprenorphine will trigger a dea investigation research in kentucky and north carolina has found that creates a prescribing cliff says bayla ostrach who researches substance use disorder treatment and health policy doctors might prescribe more but if pharmacies won t fill the prescription patients can t get their medication the ramifications can be particularly acute in rural areas where a dearth of addiction treatment providers lack of transportation and stigma against these medications already create barriers if pharmacies decline to provide buprenorphine too patients will have few options left selby said the dea did not respond to requests for comment like many other prescription drugs buprenorphine can be found illegally on the street there are unscrupulous doctors who hand out prescriptions and pharmacists who fill them subutex which consists of buprenorphine alone is easier to misuse and typically has higher street value than suboxone a combination of buprenorphine and the overdose reversal drug naloxone in the case against njoku s pharmacy an assistant u s attorney explained that the dea got slapped hard for being asleep at the switch as the opioid crisis ramped up they re trying to make sure that subutex doesn t become the next problem according to court transcripts but research suggests that buprenorphine misuse has decreased in recent years even as prescribing has increased and that most people who use diverted buprenorphine do so to avoid withdrawal symptoms and because they can t get a prescription buprenorphine is less likely to cause overdoses than other opioids because its effects taper off at higher doses said dr aaron wohl medical director of the florida based coalition project opioid in njoku s case the dea said in court documents that several red flags had suggested the pharmacy s actions were irresponsible first many of the prescriptions it filled were for subutex instead of suboxone patients also traveled sometimes out of state to get prescriptions drove long distances within west virginia to reach njoku s pharmacy and often paid in cash in traditional prescription drug cases these are all markers of trouble but as njoku s lawyers argued and two judges later agreed they can also reflect the difficulty of getting addiction treatment which is sometimes more challenging than obtaining illicit drugs the practical reality and context of west virginia turn these additional flags from red to yellow u s district judge joseph goodwin wrote in his opinion patients may go out of their way for the drug because there aren t enough nearby doctors who prescribe it or pharmacies that stock it he wrote they might pay cash because they re uninsured or medicaid won t cover prescriptions written by an out of network doctor and they might prefer subutex because it s often cheaper than suboxone courtney ingram khn khn dr nathan mullins addiction medicine fellowship director at mountain area health education center in north carolina says switching the medications of patients recovering from opioid use disorder can cause needless anxiety by 2020 goodwin and an administrative law judge at the dea had both ruled in njoku s favor but several insurers and drug suppliers had already stopped doing business with him njoku closed the pharmacy in april 2021 across the country when a pharmacy stops providing buprenorphine the ripple effects can be far reaching trish mashburn works at two independent pharmacies in western north carolina when a nearby pharmacy stopped dispensing buprenorphine she began getting five calls a day from prospective customers trying to get their prescriptions filled she said although both her employers stock buprenorphine they order only a set amount so mashburn often must turn patients away research in north carolina and kentucky has found that many pharmacists worry that ordering more buprenorphine will trigger a dea investigation the dea does not specify thresholds for controlled substances but it requires wholesalers to flag suspicious orders in turn wholesalers limit how much a pharmacy can buy or create algorithms to detect orders that exceed projected need they base these limits in part on the dea s enforcement actions said larry cote a former dea attorney who now advises wholesalers pharmacies and other clients on regulatory compliance since pharmacies are not typically privy to how these limits are set many simply order small batches of buprenorphine out of caution that creates a prescribing cliff said bayla ostrach lead author of a paper studying this issue in north carolina doctors may prescribe buprenorphine to more patients but pharmacies order enough for only a certain number of customers since many people stay on buprenorphine for years once the pharmacy hits its self established quota it may rarely have openings for new patients a lee county fla man thought he was one of the lucky ones james 34 had been filling his subutex prescription at the supermarket chain publix for seven years in that time he held steady jobs and cared for his wife and children james asked khn to withhold his last name so future employers wouldn t judge him on his addiction history then last year james said he went to get his prescription refilled and was told publix no longer stocks subutex the medication the dea considered a red flag in njoku s case publix did not respond to requests for comment a decade ago when james began the medication he chose subutex because it was cheaper than suboxone today most insurance plans cover suboxone and the price difference has narrowed somewhat james was not eager to change to a potentially pricier medication and he worried a different drug might disrupt his recovery a common sentiment among patients in long term recovery said dr nathan mullins director of addiction medicine fellowship at mountain area health education center in north carolina changing their medication is unnecessary and can cause needless anxiety mullins said luckily james found an independent pharmacy that provides subutex it s more expensive since the new place doesn t accept his insurance he said he pays about 40 a week compared with 40 a month previously but james said it s worth it i ve been in 10 rehabs and a million detoxes and the only thing that has worked for me was one sublingual tablet james said along with therapy this saved my life khn kaiser health news is an editorially independent program of kff kaiser family foundation copyright 2023 kaiser health news to

pursuit of truth austin texas has been chosen as the site for a new private liberal arts university to be known as the university of austin the university will open with a summer school in 2022 and founders hope to offer undergraduate programs by 2024 fees have not yet been disclosed pano kanelos who left st john s college in annapolis on june 30 is founding the university and has gathered a 31 person board of advisors his founding faculty fellows are philosopher peter boghossian writer ayaan hirsi ali and gender researcher kathleen stock kanelos is yet to find a site in austin for the university or win approval from academic regulators a who s who of canceled academics journalists and entrepreneurs are teaming up to change the oppressive wokeness on college campuses by launching their own right minded university in the progressive texas capital of austin the newly envisioned university of austin will be led by panos kanelos who stepped down as president of st john s college in annapolis maryland in june and include controversial figures such as playwright david mamet fired harvard president larry summers booted new york times op ed columnist bari weiss historian niall ferguson and journalist andrew sullivan on its 31 person board of advisors i left my post as president to build a university in austin dedicated to the fearless pursuit of truth kanelos wrote on bari weiss s substack on monday in making the announcement a website for the new venture lists an address near the university of texas but kanelos said the school is in the process of securing land in the austin area for a physical campus it is also seeking millions in donations for scholarships and to help establish its programs as it seeks to get accredited panos kanelos who resigned from st john s college and left in june announced on monday that he was founding a new university journalist bari weiss is among those appointed to the board of the new academic institution the university of austin will launch in 2022 with a summer school for students at other institutions entitled the forbidden courses the school does not plan to offer undergraduate courses until 2024 but will begin in the summer of 2022 with a program entitled the forbidden courses our summer program invites top students from other universities to join us for a spirited discussion about the most provocative questions that often lead to censorship or self censorship in many universities they state on the website students will become proficient and comfortable with productive disagreement instructors will range from top professors to accomplished business leaders journalists and artists ferguson who wrote an op ed in bloomberg on monday announcing the university s founding described the course as offering the kind of content and instruction no longer available at most established campuses addressing the kind of provocative questions that often lead to cancelation or self censorship niall ferguson the historian and a fellow at the hoover institution at stanford university is also on the board he was previously a professor of history at harvard new york university and oxford ayaan hirsi ali is a founding faculty member the somali born american activist and writer is known for her criticism of islam he wrote with a growing number of republicans calling for bans on critical race theory i fear the illiberalism is metastasizing trigger warnings safe spaces preferred pronouns checked privileges microaggressions antiracism all these terms are routinely deployed on campuses throughout the english speaking world as part of a sustained campaign to impose ideological conformity in the name of diversity as a result it often feels as if there is less free speech and free thought in the american university today than in almost any other institution in the u s both ferguson and kanelos cited statistics showing how repressive the overwhelmingly liberal us academic institutions have become in their monolithic thinking nearly a quarter of american academics in the social sciences or humanities endorse ousting a colleague for having a wrong opinion about hot button issues such as immigration or gender differences kanelos wrote over a third of conservative academics and phd students say they had been threatened with disciplinary action for their views american phd students are willing to discriminate against right leaning scholars according to a report by the center for the study of partisanship and ideology dorian abbot a geophysicist with the university of chicago was disinvited from giving a speech at mit because he has disagreed with affirmative action kathleen scott left the university of sussex after she was hounded and sent death threats for her work on gender and sex playwrite david mamet seen in december 2014 attending the blithe spirit opening night in los angeles is another board member larry summers treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 is another part of kanelos team ferguson cited heterodox academy s 2020 campus expression survey in which 62 percent of sampled college students agreed that the climate on their campus prevented them from saying things they believed and 41 percent said they were reluctant to discuss politics in a classroom peter boghossian who resigned from portland state university over allegations of censorship is another faculty member some 60 percent of students said they were reluctant to speak up in class the survey found because they were concerned other students would criticize their views as being offensive kanelos said that academics were being treated like thought criminals referencing dorian abbot a university of chicago scientist who has objected to aspects of affirmative action peter boghossian a philosophy professor at portland state university and kathleen stock a professor at university of sussex who resigned amid accusations of being transphobic for her work on sex and gender all are members of the board of his new institution fees for his courses have not been published at some future point historians will study how we arrived at this tragic pass kanelos wrote and perhaps by then

by jeanne sahadi cnn business maybe you have a natural affinity for making and managing money or maybe you re just trying not to make a hash of it either way someone at some point in your life likely dropped a pearl of wisdom in your lap that has made your financial life better than it would have been otherwise we asked readers to share the best financial advice they ever got don t just pocket your raise invest half of it into your 401 k every time some advice is so good you can take it to the bank that is exactly what stevan vigneaux did in the mid 1980s he was in his early 30s and working as an engineering manager at a local television station in hartford connecticut the station s vice president of engineering pushed him to save in the company s 401 k which was offering a generous matching contribution when vigneaux said he couldn t afford to he and his wife a schoolteacher had just had their first child and had bought a money pit for a house his boss pushed harder he said yes you can and you must when you get your next raise save half you ll never miss it vigneaux recounted the boss went further telling vigneaux to invest half of every raise he gets from then on until he maxes out his contributions you ll be glad you did the boss said noting that he would be crazy to pass up the free money from the company match it s 35 years later and he was right on all counts vigneaux said we never missed the portion of the raise we directed to savings vigneaux has since given the same advice to friends and family and today mostly retired he says he and his wife aren t rich but live comfortably without financial stress if you can t pay in full for what you re buying don t charge it credit cards should be used as a financial convenience not a crutch that was the underlying message of what brian schmidt s father told him when he went to college my father told me it s okay to use a credit card but never carry a balance i ve followed that to this day i use my credit card for most purchases but pay it off every month never carry a balance on a credit card due to the high interest rate said schmidt the lesson influenced how he thought about other debt too i was always thinking if i couldn t afford to pay for it then i d wait unless it was good debt like taking out a mortgage on an appreciating asset today at 46 schmidt said he and his wife are debt free having paid off their mortgage in 16 years their plan now is to put their 16 year old son through college giving him just one credit card and his grandfather s wisdom it s never too late to invest a decade ago at 55 michael blount made his first real foray into investing nearing retirement from a 23 year career in the military he decided to invest a small amount of money with a broker since he wasn t working with hundreds of thousands of dollars blount said i was worried the broker might laugh it off but he didn t the broker instead suggested putting the money into index funds not long after blount said he listened to a series of online personal finance lectures it was in one of those lectures that he heard what he characterizes as some of the best financial advice he s gotten the best day to invest was yesterday the next best is today he decided to take gains that accrued in his index funds and invest them in some top technology stocks including apple amazon and microsoft he said he thought to himself i m gonna take a chance his bet and his timing has paid off quite well he said he was fortunate to buy amazon at 800 a share for instance and today it s trading at roughly 3 500 after retiring from the service in 2015 blount became a federal contractor he s 65 today and plans to work until he s 70 since his military pension isn t large he will rely on his stock portfolio to augment his retirement income along with some prior savings he put away in the federal government s thrift savings plan he knows he s lucky to have entered the stock market when it was going sideways coming out of the great recession and he s grateful his portfolio has done well it certainly takes the pressure off he said budget for all your needs including fun trying to stick to a diet that is so rigid you can never eat what you really love is a waste of time because you re going to blow it the same is true of a hyper strict budget three years ago when she was 22 sarah williams had her first job out of college but she made so little that she bartended at night for extra cash even then she couldn t make ends meet between her living expenses credit card debt and student loan debt based on her general idea of what she had coming in every month williams would try budgeting but usually fell short because she didn t have a realistic sense of her spending a work colleague then gave her some advice she used to tell me budget realistically and make sure to include the things you like to do for fun or to treat yourself then the budget doesn t feel restrictive it feels productive williams said it has made a huge impact on my life for her that meant acknowledging that she is regularly going to blow a lot on amazon so she set a dollar limit on amazon purchases and earmarked money for the occasional weekend trips she takes with her boyfriend as well as a 50 monthly gym membership she also set up a schedule to work down her debt starting with the smallest credit card balances first and throughout the pandemic she continued making her student loan payments even though she was allowed to defer them today at 25 williams is working as an it director at a financial advisory firm getting a graduate degree and said she has whittled her 7 000 in credit card debt down to less than 1 000 retirement is easy to solve if you start saving in your 20s gary anderson credits his dad with teaching him the importance of saving for retirement early on he started nagging me from the moment i got my first job out of college anderson said i wasn t great with money in my early 20s and i can t say that i immediately took his advice but i did hear it and as i got a little more comfortable financially i started upping my 401 k contributions with every pay raise until i was maxed out he then encouraged his future wife to do the same now in their early 50s and hoping to retire sooner rather than later they re glad they did anderson said when he flew to visit his father soon after his dad had been diagnosed with alzheimer s his father assumed anderson s mother had paid for the trip it pained me to realize that my dad didn t understand that thanks in part to his advice i had long since achieved a level of financial comfort that i could afford to come see him on my own anderson said never spend money behind your spouse s back wayne nelson s father a swedish immigrant who worked as an electrician at steel mills shared many financial tips with his three kids for instance nelson said the first check you write is to give to others every month then to yourself in the form of savings and investments at dinner we talked about how the nelson stocks did today he said next on the list never have more than one mortgage and car payment at a time and carry no other debt but nelson a former teacher who is now a real estate broker at age 78 speaks most fondly of the next item on his dad s list before you get married make an agreement with your spouse to be that you will never spend money behind each other s backs spending behind your spouse s back is to defy the marriage contract and will land you in divorce court nelson said in his own marriage now going on 50 years nelson said he and his wife susie who was also a teacher have never bought anything without first checking with the other whether it was a shirt from macy s or a toy for their daughter they took it one step further we both agreed if there s a major financial purchase and one says no the other can t hold bad feelings nelson said they have had arguments over the years especially when he was struggling with ptsd after vietnam but we have never had one money argument not one family is always more important than money people make a lot of jokes about how annoying or difficult in laws can be but elliot pepper can t say enough good things about his in laws whom he credits with convincing him to go to college and then offering him encouragement as he explored different professional opportunities they had a profound impact on my life pepper said without them i would have been a hot mess now a financial planner who also teaches a high school course in financial literacy pepper acknowledges that his in laws almost certainly had an alternative motive for encouraging him to find his way in life what with his marrying their daughter shira when he was just 21 but to him the most important financial wisdom they ever imparted had less to do with how to make money than it did with how to use it well they always made sure their children could get the education they wanted pepper said his in laws would pay for far flung relatives to travel to family gatherings and most impressive was how well they supported their own aging parents said pepper the money had was not just for them to be comfortable the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

park housing stock has been in short supply in woodland park which has just over 8 100 residents guest speakers noted as students have had to find somewhere to live while attending two and three year training programs in christian ministry charis has 837 full time students on site this semester officials project enrollment to top 1 000 in january but the housing market was tight before charis came to town said debbie miller president of the greater woodland park chamber of commerce charis intent to build dorms is going to be an asset she said in a video the organization produced and showed at the event apartment style dorms for 40 students to have separate bedrooms and two people sharing each bathroom will be built on the south and north sides of the land the buildings will be concealed by evergreen trees and designed to blend in with the natural environment wommack said charis intends to unveil the complete plan in late january he said each 40 unit complex will cost 5 5 million plus infrastructure expenses wommack said in an interview wommack wants to complete four units for 160 students by the fall of 2023 another three or four buildings would be erected after that depending on cash flow he said the buildings on wommack s campus which include a 3 165 seat auditorium have cost 99 million to date all except one have been created debt free wommack borrowed 22 million of the 28 million cost of a five story 1 022 space parking garage i m not going to go in debt ever again he said it was a mistake the nonprofit organization will pay off the loan in december a 28 month payback he said using contributions from supporters andrew wommack ministries which ships 550 teaching materials for free to people around the world fields 650 000 calls in its prayer center each year and operates gospel truth tv has been subsidizing 1 25 million to 1 5 million monthly to pay down the parking garage debt wommack said that money will start being applied to the student housing project

epperhart while charis and the flagship andrew wommack ministries which was founded in 1978 have become large scale global operations the hometown community hasn t been as receptive to its efforts over the years residents have complained that as a nonprofit 501c3 religious organization wommack s enterprise doesn t pay property taxes on a large chunk of land in city limits wommack 72 drew criticism this year for something he said to followers during an april event at charis hosted by the truth liberty coalition a 501c4 political organization he co founded in 2017 the coalition encourages those who subscribe to conservative christian views to run for political office at local state and national levels man as many people as we have in this school here we ought to take over woodland park wommack had said in april as he urged followers to take back colorado from the socialists and democrats who have turned the state from conservative to liberal political leadership this county ought to be totally dominated by believers he said we have enough people here in this school we could elect anybody we want we could take over this place wommack brought up the topic saturday telling community attendees that he s not as well spoken as some of his staff it was a slip of lip on my part wommack said all i was saying is we ve got so many staff and students here we can make an impact we can take over i m talking about we can make a difference our society is under attack wommack said in an interview after the event that he was absolutely surprised by the public backlash following a gazette article about what he had said the people who criticize him for such remarks want to take over he said i think it s hypocritical for them to criticize that wommack said the people who differ from me they want to have people who they vote for in charge to those who believe politics and religion shouldn t be intertwined wommack says he thinks they re wrong politics is getting involved in your community and christians should be involved in their communities he said in school boards people are supporting critical race theory and ungodly books being in the school system they re pushing their agendas i m saying we ought to push morality and the biblical view wommack supporters such as mark weaver a commercial real estate broker decried any rebuke there is a narrative in the community that you guys are trying to take over and i say bull that s not what s going on he said in the video i just don t see it from the people i know from charis they re interested and want to be involved in the community and for a community that s what you want guest speakers said charis students and staff volunteer at organizations and during city events sponsor community fundraisers eat at restaurants and patronize stores and rent apartments and purchase houses they re bringing in a tremendous amount of revenue through sales taxes and their homes said mark rabaut who opened microtel inn and suites by wyndham in woodland park last year wommack released a new independent economic impact study of his organizations which projects the bible college and ministry will employ 1 453

a sampling of the nation s most intolerable contrarian columnists right wing pundits and other stuffed shirts is launching their own university in a bid to challenge the supposedly woke academic status quo courtesy of funding from an obscure libertarian nonprofit linked to palantir co founder joe lonsdale the university of austin or uatx which is absolutely not to be confused with the university of texas at austin a real school aims to offer forbidden courses that will spark students to ask provocative questions that often lead to censorship or self censorship in many universities it boasts a bevy of headache inducing personalities on its board of advisors which consists largely of the type of people who have branded themselves as the last defenders of liberalism against the tide of woke liberals those personalities include bari weiss a former new york times opinion editor who has spent most of her professional energy yelping about left wing twitter mobs conservative british historian niall ferguson who left stanford after leaked emails showed him encouraging campus republicans to do opposition research on a left wing student former treasury secretary larry summers who has somehow tried to make the wokeness of central bankers a culture war issue amateur race scientist and self declared ethnic penis size expert andrew sullivan scorched earth culture warrior sohrab ahmari and cognitive psychologist steven pinker an identity politics alarmist who is popular with the neoliberal crowd one of its founding faculty fellows is ayaan hirsi ali a hoover institution scholar who believes islam is inherently violent and has more recently begun parroting the line that wokeism is just like white supremacy the effort will be headed up by inaugural president pano kanelos the former president of st john s college annapolis who is also another culture war obsessive who believes academic freedom is being derailed by leftists alongside them will be fellow traveller and venture capitalist lonsdale one of the tech billionaires known for complaining about the supposedly stifling political culture of silicon valley uatx which as of right now is not accredited in anything but giving people aneurysms says on its website it is fiscally sponsored by cicero research which is affiliated with lonsdale s libertarian cicero institute lonsdale is best known for partnering with right wing venture capitalist peter thiel to found palantir the big data analysis firm infamous for courting contracts with federal immigration agencies and the military disclosure thiel bankrolled a lawsuit that bankrupted gizmodo s former parent company gawker media lonsdale and his firm 8vc moved to austin from san francisco last year citing the location as conveniently closer to companies he backs across the country and a way to escape california tax rates texas has no income tax according to the daily beast public filings show lonsdale listed as a member of cicero research beyond potentially being uatx s financial benefactor and a member of its board of advisers it s not clear how big a role lonsdale will play in the project a spokesperson for the school told the beast only that we re very proud to have joe lonsdale both on our board and as one of our financial supporters the beast noted that uatx says it already has seed funding and is looking for us250 337 million more in investment uatx does not yet offer degrees but is seeking accreditation from the texas higher education board and initial accreditation through the higher learning commission to offer master s degrees in fall 2022 and undergraduate degrees in 2024 in an faq it explains the choice of location in austin with if it s good enough for elon musk and joe rogan it s good enough for us adding that the city is experiencing a historic boom in talent and capital for a taste of lonsdale s political leanings refer to a recent tweet in which he responded to a tweet about transportation secretary pete buttigieg by claiming that men who take half a year of paternity leave are losers failing to take the correct masculine response of the old days that remark didn t go down particularly well with initialized capital founders alexis ohanian and garry tan who shot back that their company offers four months of paid paternity leave buttigieg s spouse chasten buttigieg subsequently stated that their baby had serious health issues and spent three weeks in the hospital including a terrifying week on a ventilator lonsdale also totally denies accusations of rape from a female stanford student he mentored as new york mag argued the concept behind uatx isn t exactly new conservatives have tried to build their own academic safe spaces free from dissenting voices for decades like jerry falwell s evangelical liberty university republican candidate factory patrick henry college and maga friendly hillsdale college the magazine also noted that many of the individuals associated with uatx aren t exactly known for their embrace of the spirit of open debate like bari weiss who as a student at columbia university developed a reputation for targeting arab professors as israel haters or the anti trans scholar kathleen stock who quit the university of sussex after students protested her transphobic views if history is any example uatx will be more of a cancel culture obsessed hivemind than a beacon of debate uatx didn t immediately respond to gizmodo s request for comment on this story but we ll update if we hear back

by jeanne sahadi cnn business maybe you have a natural affinity for making and managing money or maybe you re just trying not to make a hash of it either way someone at some point in your life likely dropped a pearl of wisdom in your lap that has made your financial life better than it would have been otherwise we asked readers to share the best financial advice they ever got don t just pocket your raise invest half of it into your 401 k every time some advice is so good you can take it to the bank that is exactly what stevan vigneaux did in the mid 1980s he was in his early 30s and working as an engineering manager at a local television station in hartford connecticut the station s vice president of engineering pushed him to save in the company s 401 k which was offering a generous matching contribution when vigneaux said he couldn t afford to he and his wife a schoolteacher had just had their first child and had bought a money pit for a house his boss pushed harder he said yes you can and you must when you get your next raise save half you ll never miss it vigneaux recounted the boss went further telling vigneaux to invest half of every raise he gets from then on until he maxes out his contributions you ll be glad you did the boss said noting that he would be crazy to pass up the free money from the company match it s 35 years later and he was right on all counts vigneaux said we never missed the portion of the raise we directed to savings vigneaux has since given the same advice to friends and family and today mostly retired he says he and his wife aren t rich but live comfortably without financial stress if you can t pay in full for what you re buying don t charge it credit cards should be used as a financial convenience not a crutch that was the underlying message of what brian schmidt s father told him when he went to college my father told me it s okay to use a credit card but never carry a balance i ve followed that to this day i use my credit card for most purchases but pay it off every month never carry a balance on a credit card due to the high interest rate said schmidt the lesson influenced how he thought about other debt too i was always thinking if i couldn t afford to pay for it then i d wait unless it was good debt like taking out a mortgage on an appreciating asset today at 46 schmidt said he and his wife are debt free having paid off their mortgage in 16 years their plan now is to put their 16 year old son through college giving him just one credit card and his grandfather s wisdom it s never too late to invest a decade ago at 55 michael blount made his first real foray into investing nearing retirement from a 23 year career in the military he decided to invest a small amount of money with a broker since he wasn t working with hundreds of thousands of dollars blount said i was worried the broker might laugh it off but he didn t the broker instead suggested putting the money into index funds not long after blount said he listened to a series of online personal finance lectures it was in one of those lectures that he heard what he characterizes as some of the best financial advice he s gotten the best day to invest was yesterday the next best is today he decided to take gains that accrued in his index funds and invest them in some top technology stocks including apple amazon and microsoft he said he thought to himself i m gonna take a chance his bet and his timing has paid off quite well he said he was fortunate to buy amazon at 800 a share for instance and today it s trading at roughly 3 500 after retiring from the service in 2015 blount became a federal contractor he s 65 today and plans to work until he s 70 since his military pension isn t large he will rely on his stock portfolio to augment his retirement income along with some prior savings he put away in the federal government s thrift savings plan he knows he s lucky to have entered the stock market when it was going sideways coming out of the great recession and he s grateful his portfolio has done well it certainly takes the pressure off he said budget for all your needs including fun trying to stick to a diet that is so rigid you can never eat what you really love is a waste of time because you re going to blow it the same is true of a hyper strict budget three years ago when she was 22 sarah williams had her first job out of college but she made so little that she bartended at night for extra cash even then she couldn t make ends meet between her living expenses credit card debt and student loan debt based on her general idea of what she had coming in every month williams would try budgeting but usually fell short because she didn t have a realistic sense of her spending a work colleague then gave her some advice she used to tell me budget realistically and make sure to include the things you like to do for fun or to treat yourself then the budget doesn t feel restrictive it feels productive williams said it has made a huge impact on my life for her that meant acknowledging that she is regularly going to blow a lot on amazon so she set a dollar limit on amazon purchases and earmarked money for the occasional weekend trips she takes with her boyfriend as well as a 50 monthly gym membership she also set up a schedule to work down her debt starting with the smallest credit card balances first and throughout the pandemic she continued making her student loan payments even though she was allowed to defer them today at 25 williams is working as an it director at a financial advisory firm getting a graduate degree and said she has whittled her 7 000 in credit card debt down to less than 1 000 retirement is easy to solve if you start saving in your 20s gary anderson credits his dad with teaching him the importance of saving for retirement early on he started nagging me from the moment i got my first job out of college anderson said i wasn t great with money in my early 20s and i can t say that i immediately took his advice but i did hear it and as i got a little more comfortable financially i started upping my 401 k contributions with every pay raise until i was maxed out he then encouraged his future wife to do the same now in their early 50s and hoping to retire sooner rather than later they re glad they did anderson said when he flew to visit his father soon after his dad had been diagnosed with alzheimer s his father assumed anderson s mother had paid for the trip it pained me to realize that my dad didn t understand that thanks in part to his advice i had long since achieved a level of financial comfort that i could afford to come see him on my own anderson said never spend money behind your spouse s back wayne nelson s father a swedish immigrant who worked as an electrician at steel mills shared many financial tips with his three kids for instance nelson said the first check you write is to give to others every month then to yourself in the form of savings and investments at dinner we talked about how the nelson stocks did today he said next on the list never have more than one mortgage and car payment at a time and carry no other debt but nelson a former teacher who is now a real estate broker at age 78 speaks most fondly of the next item on his dad s list before you get married make an agreement with your spouse to be that you will never spend money behind each other s backs spending behind your spouse s back is to defy the marriage contract and will land you in divorce court nelson said in his own marriage now going on 50 years nelson said he and his wife susie who was also a teacher have never bought anything without first checking with the other whether it was a shirt from macy s or a toy for their daughter they took it one step further we both agreed if there s a major financial purchase and one says no the other can t hold bad feelings nelson said they have had arguments over the years especially when he was struggling with ptsd after vietnam but we have never had one money argument not one family is always more important than money people make a lot of jokes about how annoying or difficult in laws can be but elliot pepper can t say enough good things about his in laws whom he credits with convincing him to go to college and then offering him encouragement as he explored different professional opportunities they had a profound impact on my life pepper said without them i would have been a hot mess now a financial planner who also teaches a high school course in financial literacy pepper acknowledges that his in laws almost certainly had an alternative motive for encouraging him to find his way in life what with his marrying their daughter shira when he was just 21 but to him the most important financial wisdom they ever imparted had less to do with how to make money than it did with how to use it well they always made sure their children could get the education they wanted pepper said his in laws would pay for far flung relatives to travel to family gatherings and most impressive was how well they supported their own aging parents said pepper the money had was not just for them to be comfortable the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved
elon musk is known for his bizarre posts on social media and has often fallen foul of financial regulators with his controversial tweets but the tesla chief executive made possibly his most unusual move yet over the weekend the world s richest man with a total net worth of 251billion asked his twitter followers to decide whether he should sell a massive 10 per cent chunk of his holding in the electric car company tesla chief exec elon musk pictured asked his twitter followers to decide whether he should sell a massive 10 chunk of his holding in the electric car company around 3 5m users of the social media site cast their vote in the poll and 57 9 per cent said yes if musk honours their decision as he has promised he will have to sell around 17m shares which are worth 15billion at today s price with that many shares coming onto the market tesla stock slumped nearly 7 per cent before recovering to a 3 per cent drop it was the latest example of musk 50 causing shockwaves with his tweets over the years his comments on social media have caused wild swings in tesla s share price shaken up the value of crypto currencies such as bitcoin and dogecoin and provoked us regulators to launch lawsuits against him the eccentric entrepreneur and father of six who has run tesla since 2008 said at the weekend that much was being made of the fact that most of his wealth is stored in shares meaning he pays little in tax musk tweeted i do not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere i only have stock thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock running a poll on twitter he added much is made lately of unrealised gains being a means of tax avoidance so i propose selling 10 per cent of my tesla stock do you agree it seemed that twitter users did as the vote closed on sunday night and asked whether it had gone the way he wanted it to musk said i was prepared to accept either outcome the bizarre vote came weeks after he slammed president biden s plan to launch a tax on billionaires in the united states which would leave musk with a mammoth bill under the proposals the us president will levy a tax held on the assets of the country s very richest even if they do not take a cash income referring to the reform musk tweeted last month eventually they run out of other people s money and then they come for you earlier this year it was revealed that musk and his rival amazon founder jeff bezos have in recent years paid nothing in federal income tax ron wyden an oregon democrat and chairman of the senate finance committee who has led the plans for the tax reform dismissed musk s poll as a stunt he said whether or not the world s wealthiest man pays any taxes at all shouldn t depend on the results of a twitter poll it s time for the billionaires income tax musk responded with a crude tweet referring to wyden s genitals he also changed his twitter name to lord edge an apparent reference to the term edgelord which according to oxford languages is used to describe a person who affects a provocative or extreme persona especially online the twitter poll was the latest example of musk who recently split from pop star girlfriend grimes using the social media platform in a way which has raised eyebrows in 2018 he baselessly branded a british cave explorer who had been trying to rescue a group of boys stuck in a thai cave pedo guy musk won a lawsuit when the explorer tried to accuse him of defamation the billionaire s lawyers claimed in court that the phrase pedo guy was clearly meant as an insult which is considered protected speech and that musk had never actually meant to imply the rescuer was a paedophile musk has also become known as a vocal backer of various crypto currencies he tweeted in support of bitcoin several times pushing up the price of the digital asset he even said tesla would start accepting bitcoin payments for its cars but later rolled back stating the crypto currency was too energy intensive which saw its value tumble musk now seems to be throwing his weight behind dogecoin a crypto currency based on a dog which was initially launched as a joke since he tweeted about the coin in early march its value has rocketed by 460 per cent car trouble tesla s valuation has already been destabilised by musk s twitter activity this is still a way off the peaks it hit in may on the back of musk s support meaning any traders who had bought dogecoin at its heights may now be smarting but it wouldn t be the first time musk has angered investors an april fool s joke in 2018 backfired when he tweeted that tesla had gone completely and totally bankrupt while many shareholders recognised the post as a joke others were fumed when tesla shares slumped 7 per cent as the stock market opened the following day that same year musk locked horns with us financial regulator the securities and exchange commission sec after tweeting that he planned to take tesla private and had the funding to do so a move which sent the shares soaring a deal never materialised after a lengthy lawsuit which was eventually settled for 15million each from musk and tesla the sec ordered that all of musk s tweets must be approved by his company in future but the slap on the wrist failed to deter musk and the sec wrote to tesla in 2019 and 2020 about more tweets which supposedly violated the settlement and on twitter just last month musk said he would sell tesla stock and donate it to the un s world food program if leaders at the organisation could describe exactly how the money would solve world hunger it was unclear whether he actually planned to give away any of the money he will raise from his proposed share sale after the twitter poll aj bell s investment director russ mould added some investors might be taking musk s comments with a pinch of salt he has often made comments on twitter implying one thing and then doing the opposite soon after but his actions could irritate shareholders whose interests he is supposed to protect mould warned because the incident has already destabilised the company s valuation

when is a protective refund claim available taxpayers often face uncertain outcomes in litigation or business transactions giving rise to contingent tax refund claims for example if a pending lawsuit ends in a favorable result it may create new law that gives the taxpayer a more favorable tax position in an earlier year creating a right to a tax refund a taxpayer may even be waiting for a hoped for change in the tax laws that will result in a retroactive right to a refund but what if the taxpayer s right to a refund claim will not become clear until after the statute of limitations expires on their ability to file a claim for refund with the irs a protective refund claim may be the solution what is a protective refund claim protective refund claims preserve a taxpayer s right to claim a tax refund when the taxpayer s right to the refund is contingent on future events that may not occur until after the statute of limitations expires the protective claim concept is not contained in the code or treasury regulations but is instead established by case law a protective refund claim is an informal claim formal claim or amended return for credit or refund typically based on expected changes in the code regulations legislation or current litigation claims identifying a pending court case or decision as a contingency are generally considered protective claims in order to be effective and recognized by the irs a protective refund claim should comply with the rules established by applicable case law and administrative practice for example the claim must have a written component and must properly identify and describe the contingencies affecting the claim the claim must also be sufficiently clear and definite to alert the service to the essential nature of the claim and must identify a specific year or years for which a refund is sought a protective refund claim may be ineffective if it does not comply with all of the requirements established by case law protective refund claims a thumb nail history the supreme court first considered an informal protective refund claim in united states v kales there the court embraced the concept of a protective refund claim a claim for a tax refund contingent upon future events the fact that respondent had originally stated her claim in the future tense saying that in the event of departmental revision of the valuation of the stock she will insist on a higher valuation and will claim the right to a refund does not in the circumstances of this case lend even grammatical support to the government s contention such a use of the future tense in stating a claim may with due regard to the circumstances of making it rightly be taken as an assertion of a present right see georgia florida alabama ry co v blish milling co 241 u s 190 197 198 36 s ct 541 544 60 l ed 948 cf george moore ice cream co v rose supra 289 u s at page 384 53 s ct at page 624 77 l ed 1265 reversing 5 cir 61 f 2d 605 here the claim is alternative and contingent upon future events the statement that upon the happening of the contingency the claim will be prosecuted is not inconsistent with the present assertion of it it is indeed an appropriate if not the necessary phraseology for the present assertion of an alternative claim with respect to which a taxpayer in his presentation of an informal tax refund claim should be in no less favorable position than the plaintiff in a suit at law who is permitted to plead his cause of action in the alternative united states v kales 314 u s 186 195 96 1941 in kales the taxpayer filed a written protest of a jeopardy assessment that was later refunded after litigation the issue concerned the tax basis of stock that was later sold the taxpayer s claim stated that if a previous determination of the value of the stock should be set aside or reopened the taxpayer would insist that the value so determined was too low and that she should recover the taxes paid based on the incorrect value the letter also advised that the taxpayer will insist that the stock was greatly undervalued and the taxpayer will claim the right to a refund following the litigation which resulted in a judgment in favor of the taxpayer she filed a formal claim for refund the supreme court held that the letter constituted a valid informal claim for refund when respondent filed her letter the time within which a claim for refund could be filed was about to expire and the occurrence of the contingencies on which a recovery could be had by respondent remained uncertain but the commissioner could have been left in no doubt that she was setting forth her right to a refund in the event of a departmental revision of its 1919 valuation of her stock her letter was present notice that if the department insisted upon changing its original decision as to the 1913 value she asserted that the stock had been undervalued and in consequence of the undervaluation she had a right to a refund of said tax to the extent of such excess id at 195 the court of claims discussed the requirements of an informal claim in american radiator standard sanitary corp v united states 318 f 2d 915 162 ct cl 106 1963 an informal claim must have a written component and should adequately apprise the internal revenue service that a refund is sought and for certain years id at 920 citations omitted further discussing these requirements the court stated it is not enough that the service have in its possession information from which it might deduce that a taxpayer is entitled to or might desire a refund nor is it sufficient that a claim involving the same ground has been filed for another year or by a different taxpayer on the other hand the writing should not be given a crabbed or literal reading ignoring all the surrounding circumstances which give it body and content the focus is on the claim as a whole not merely the written component id citations omitted the supreme court again addressed protective claims in kellogg citizens nat bank of green bay wis v united states stating that protective claims are not unknown to federal tax practice and uccessive claims may be filed defective claims cured and informal claims turned into formal ones kellogg citizens nat l bank v united states 330 f 2d 635 639 ct cl 1964 holding that taxpayers are expected to make every reasonable effort possible including the filing of a protective claim to hold open the statute of limitations and maintain their right to a potential claim for refund see also swietlik v united states 779 f 2d 1306 1307 7th cir 1985 finding that when a refund claim is uncertain as to its mere existence or to its amount filing a protective claim is an appropriate course of action to this day protective refund claims play an important role in protecting taxpayers right to a future refund claim protective refund claims relevant statutory provisions there are a number of statutory provisions that are relevant to refund claims in order to understand the role and context of a protective refund claim it is helpful to have a basic understanding of those provisions we have set out below several of the most relevant statutory and regulatory provisions section 6402 a of the code provides that in the case of any overpayment the irs within the applicable period of limitations may credit the amount of the overpayment including any interest allowed on it against any liability in respect of an internal revenue tax on the part of the person who made the overpayment and shall subject to subsections c d and e refund any balance to such person section 6511 a of the code provides that a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment of any tax in respect of which the taxpayer is required to file a return shall be filed within three years from the time the return was filed or two years from the time the tax was paid whichever of such periods expires later or if no return is filed by the taxpayer within two years from the time the tax was paid section 6511 b 1 of the code provides that no credit or refund shall be allowed or made after the expiration of the period of limitation prescribed in section 6511 a unless a claim for credit or refund is filed by the taxpayer within such period section 7422 a of the code provides that no suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the secretary according to the provisions of law in that regard and the regulations of the secretary established in pursuance thereof section 301 6402 2 b 1 of the regulations provides that no refund or credit will be allowed after the expiration of the statutory period of limitation applicable to the filing of a claim therefor except upon one or more of the grounds set forth in a claim before the expiration of such period the claim must set forth in detail each ground upon which a credit or refund is claimed and facts sufficient to apprise the commissioner of the exact basis thereof the statement of the grounds and facts must be verified by a written declaration that it is made under penalties of perjury a claim that does not comply with this requirement according to such regulations will not be considered for any purposes as a claim for refund or credit section 301 6402 3 a 5 provides that a properly executed individual fiduciary or corporation original income tax return or an amended return on 1040x or 1120x if applicable constitutes a claim for refund or credit within the meaning of section 6402 and section 6511 for the amount of the overpayment disclosed by the return or amended return a return or amended return shall constitute a claim for refund or credit if it contains a statement setting forth the amount determined as an overpayment and advising whether such amount shall be refunded to the taxpayer or shall be applied as a credit against the taxpayer s estimated tax for the taxable year immediately succeeding the taxable year for which such return or amended return is filed

famine in china the blame china s 1959 famine most of the world is generally familiar with the fact that china experienced a great famine in 1959 1961 the death tolls published in the west tend to be greatly exaggerated some reaching 80 million lives or more but from everything i can learn from the original sources the actual total appears to be about 20 million lives or perhaps a bit more in discussing the cause the western media columnists authors and book publishers casually mention the series of natural disasters the multiple large typhoons persistent excessive rainstorms plant diseases that simultaneously inflicted china but tend unanimously to focus on and allocate the blame to mao zedong the official western narrative is that mao so terrified all his lieutenants that they reported totally fictitious grain harvest volumes so as to avoid possible repercussions which resulted in mao misallocating most of the food distribution and therefore now shoulders almost all the blame for those deaths it s a good story but as with most history emanating from the west it s not true famine or food shortage the natural disasters the floods typhoons insects didn t create a famine they merely created a food shortage similarly mao s supposed mismanagement may or may not have exacerbated the food shortage but that didn t create a famine either both were inconvenient but irrelevant if you go to your kitchen and find your cupboards bare you don t starve to death you go to the supermarket and buy food so when mao discovered a food shortage in his kitchen why didn t he go to the supermarket the answer is that he did go to the supermarket but it was closed and the reason it was closed is that the european jewish bankers with their influence over the newly founded un and their control of the us government engineered a total worldwide food embargo against china using the us military as their bully boy to ensure military retaliation for non compliance 1 2 3 therefore the western world canada australia the us and europe all with enormous surplus food stocks sat and watched for three years while 20 million chinese slowly starved to death refusing to donate food to china and refusing to sell food to china at any price it is true that canada did sell some grains to china but that was at the end when the embargo was already ending and the amount was too small to be of much assistance the food embargo against china actually began earlier in 1950 and continued until 1972 the first stage initiated in retaliation for china s involvement in the korean war proposed by the americans but resulting in extreme pressure through the un for worldwide compliance 4 it has been openly admitted that the objective of this humanitarian warfare was aimed at causing china s disintegration and hopefully a partitioning as was done with india it was neither natural disaster nor mismanagement that caused china s famine the entire cause was the jewish engineered food embargo against china which was almost certainly an act of retaliation this is the background western history is corrupted western history is so badly corrupted through control of the book publishers and the media that most of the world still believes china s 150 year opium tragedy was executed by the british that was never true it was the same jewish bankers the rothschilds sassoons kadoories montefioris hardoons and more who were responsible for the entire episode of opium in china including the destruction of the yuanmingyuan and the hanlin academy and the slaughter during the so called taiping rebellion even the jewish encyclopedias admit flatly that opium in china was entirely a jewish business and that sassoon wouldn t permit any non jews to participate certainly the british played their part with queen victoria giving david sassoon the exclusive rights to opium marketing in china as well as taking hong kong to give him a distribution base but the only active part played by the british was as the jews enforcer using the violence of the british military to force compliance by the end of this criminal misadventure these jews owned much of china and virtually all of shanghai from this one of mao s first acts after the war was to expel all the jews from china and confiscate all their criminally gotten opium assets that included all of shanghai and all branches of the hsbc bank which is entirely a jewish bank not chinese in any sense 5 6 the jewish encyclopedias and various websites merely state that the jews left in a hurry after the war but fail to mention why they left as a side note and more information expunged from western history is that most of the jews transported to shanghai before the war were there not to escape germany but because they had been expelled earlier from japan the english internet appears to have been scrubbed clean of any hint of the jews expulsion from china and almost 100 scrubbed of their expulsion from japan this is an aside but the expulsions from japan began with the city of nagasaki expelling all the jews in 1926 and is very possibly the reason that city was selected as the second target for the atomic bomb all of the above mentioned should have been arrested and executed for their enormous crimes against china and the chinese people i cannot understand why they were not it is often difficult and sometimes almost impossible to fully document the responsibility for the atrocities the jews have inflicted on nations over the years primarily due to their control of the media and to their practice of using what is called a gentile front for their travesties they typically encourage or coerce another nation usually the uk or the us to front for them to make the actual proposals or to launch the actual military aggressions then history is amended to exclude the power behind the throne and the world blames the executioner instead of the king who ordered the beheading this is precisely the case with china s famine china s opium the boer wars the ukrainian famine and so many other crimes against humanity it is of much importance in this context to understand and appreciate the power contained in the jewish control of the western media these media as well as jewish so called historians have repeatedly played up china s 1959 famine as a way to denigrate the chinese and paint mao as an inhuman monster through their control of the media they dismissed or deleted the multiple natural disasters that struck china simultaneously and forced the entire focus onto mao s supposed mismanagement converting an inconvenient food shortage caused by nature into an act of brutal inhumanity caused by one man they also deleted from the media reports and from all the history books and from public consciousness the fact of the worldwide food embargo launched against china by the same people the media the process is simply to coordinate the few media owners to read from the same script to force all attention and discussion into the desired channel in this case chairman mao s supposed incompetence and inhumanity no newspaper radio or tv station magazine or book publisher will permit the distribution of information outside this channel within the channel nothing is circumscribed or censored all observations being permitted but no articles reader comments newscasts letters to the editor will be permitted to contain information that contradicts this focus this is such an effective propaganda measure that today even within china those researching china s famine will concentrate on mao s activities oblivious to the elephant in the room which is the jewish food embargo on china that was the actual cause of the famine and the death by starvation of 20 million chinese to add to the hateful anti china propaganda the same media historians and columnists slowly turned the story from 20 million chinese dying of starvation to 20 million chinese dying under mao s leadership to 20 million chinese being killed by mao that number then growing in increments from 20 million to 30 to 40 and 50 and today much of western society actually believes mao killed 80 million of his own people and thus most everything that westerners know about china is a lie fabrications created and dictated by the jewish opium bankers of europe and disseminated by their loyal lieutenants who own or control virtually the entire media landscape in the west moreover this was by no means the first time jews have caused massive famines in the world there was the bengal famine in india in 1770 where about one third of the population died and this was entirely man made with the jewish rothschilds and their british east india company forcing the farmers to grow opium to sell in china and so had no food more than ten millions starved to death in this one event about one third of the entire population perishing at other times rothschild in india deliberately confiscated most of a harvest to sell in the uk while untold millions of indians died of starvation similarly it was the jewish bolsheviks who engineered the 1932 33 ukrainian famine which starved to death at least 8 million people today the jewish media and many jewish organisations are desperately attempting to destroy this truth claiming it to be a hoax engineered by anti semitic russians but it is true it really did happen as the ukrainians claim in fact many of the photos we have been shown of huge piles of emaciated dead bodies are not of jews killed by the germans as we have been told but of ukrainians starved to death by the jews there are other examples of famines being engineered by these same people i would add one other item to this narrative that of the simultaneous infestations of various plant diseases and insect outbreaks that hit northeastern china to coincide with the typhoons and other events we can blame on mother nature i haven t had occasion to thoroughly research this element but some aspects of these biological events strike me as being curious in their timing and distribution i cannot at this stage accuse the us of giving nature a helping hand in creating china s large food shortage but it wouldn t be the first time and certainly hasn t been the last there is now voluminous evidence that the us took much advantage of the knowledge gained from shiro ishii s unit 731 and his weaponisation of insects and plant diseases during the korean war where huge volumes of these pathogens were distributed over wide areas of northeast china if it worked once it should work again and of course we have the more recent biological invasions of china beginning with sars and culminating in seven separate serious biological outbreaks in china during the past two or so years alone culminating with covid 19 and a seriously pathogenic bird flu in 2019 the only nation in the world to have suffered such a string of attacks and each with its own set of extremely suspicious circumstances again it isn t possible to openly blame the us for these attacks but when assembling all the known facts and considering these events as connected parts of an agenda it is impossible to avoid a powerful suspicion of an american black hand this article will be updated with more detail and many more reference links it forms part of a series there is much more to the story of the jews in china mr romanoff s

whole woke thing those for a squishy touchy feely bond those against bubbles on and will here too when it s released next week because that s what films in this franchise do they divide daniel craig left with ana de armas in the alexandra dress by sydney designer michael lo sordo credit ap since sean connery s caddish snappy dresser appeared in dr no the first filmed version of ian fleming s agent 007 in 1962 the 27 film bond franchise has plugged at intervals into the most sacred of social constructs what it is to be a man and not just any man the ideal man and not just any ideal man but a man cracking on doing ideal manly things with his ideal woman enter bond s equally divisive sideline in social constructs what it is to be a woman imagine you had to dress him and her picking trousers and tuxes and frocks and bikinis that succinctly express just so all those rusted on levels of meaning while keeping all demographics engaged and thrilled to the gills in a darkened cinema the grumblers the woke young blokes lapping it all up the wanna be bond girls the feminists appalled even a thread of the old bonds the womanising bounders might have nostalgic traction in this day and age this is the magic of suttirat anne larlarb head of the costume crew on no time to die a bond fan since she was tiny and a reverent defender and interpreter of the franchise s complex cultural legacy advertisement a bond film is never not defined by what it looks like on every level she says earnestly via zoom from los angeles it s a huge responsibility to be pushing it forward making it relevant also laying the gauntlet down for other films other leading male characters other leading female characters as a kind of apex of design larlarb s apexes have already been dissected down to their sartorial semiotics and published as how to guides by detective fashion editors from esquire gq and vogue to bondonabudget com before no time to die s premiere red carpet had barely unrolled headlines started popping and stuff started selling dress like bond everybody s crazy for ana de armas dress be bond no time to die style it s the pop cultural process and larlarb works intuitively to fuel it with a bond film you do have this charge thrown at you which is to make everybody look you know kind of amazing as possible and as aspirational as possible so you wish you looked like that aspirational lea seydoux as dr madeleine swann in no time to die credit nicola dove 2021 danjaq llc and mgm she also lovingly explains there is another process behind that process that feeds into the whole woke thing the director daniel craig all of the other actors and myself all kind of cherish and value the idea of grounding the story and the characters enough so their emotional journey their story journeys their psychological journeys all those things will resonate with the viewer so that it isn t just empty flash one particularly lovely example of anything but empty flash a simple silk suspension frock discovered by larlarb in a collection by sydney designer michael lo sordo in no time to die the alexandra becomes a miracle of silky plunges hip slits and spaghetti straps worn without so much as a flash of knicker or nipple by cuban actress ana de armas as she rolls slithers and shoots her way out of a spot of bother as the glamorous gorgeous albeit believably real and relatable trainee agent paloma net a porter has one alexandra left if you re quick advertisement in fact editorials of the how to dress like a bond girl ilk are relatively rare scallywags helpfully suggest how to undress like a bond girl could be a tad more practical the pall of misogyny has clung to the franchise since way back to dr no when actress ursula andress as honey ryder rose spectacularly from the sea a dripping wet goddess to side bends and jazzercise in a belted knife holstered white bikini phwoar kwoar and an icon was born not that the bond girls wardrobes from then on were all skimpy bikinis micro sarongs peskily slippery silk pyjama tops and drop dead curve clinging gowns but their otherwise sporty and chic business like wardrobe options did pale in comparison or were paled by 1995 goldeneye theoretically capitulated to the rising waves of feminist revulsion judi dench s character m even called bond a sexist misogynist dinosaur and even later daniel craig s arrival appeared to recalibrate the machismo even more hence the wokeness objectors lashana lynch s look in no time to die is a far cry from the bond girl bikinis of old credit nicola dove 2021 danjaq llc and mgm the eye candy assumptions nonetheless stubbornly stick in some craws all four of our bond women are incredibly self possessed independent enterprising the complete package larlarb firmly assures none of them are accessories to bond it would feel weird if they just became decoration or eye candy whatever project i m on unless there s a specific thing in the script which says please make this person unimportant a side dish she laughs at the preposterousness lashana lynch and lea seydoux are two of the self possessed bond women in no time to die photo greg williams danjaq llc

branded wardrobe are not in the least fraught larlarb envisioned every jigsaw component in a series of collaborative huddles with director cary joji fukunaga and daniel craig himself he s that kind of actor she says he infuses and their replicas as per pop cultural process are also selling fast or sold out sorry australia bond s tanner brand combat style boots for example long gone his waxed canvas utility jacket by la brand rogue territory his grey melange t shirt by orlebar brown you re just constantly thinking iconic even if it s just a t shirt larlarb says his camel corduroy suit and trench coat by massimo alba and exquisite apex of bond esque tuxedo tradition his satin lapelled jacket and slim cut trousers by tom ford all out of stock advertisement another miraculous standout a mere ribbed sweater by london brand n peal is somehow perfectly pitched between elegance and machismo how can this be with patches on the elbows and shoulders and a manly whiff of the royal navy and bond s origins about it at the time of writing it was still in stock but i suspect not for long either a costume sketch captures daniel craig s high brow low flash nonchalantly cool look in no time to die credit universal films even the relatively daggy drake style loafers by crosby that larlarb scuffed and aged for craig s opening scene in jamaica are selling like proverbial hot cakes so too his modified combat trousers made as one offs for the film by larlarb but then replicated for ordinary human consumption by n peal his barton perreira and vuarnet sunglasses and naturally his omega seamaster diver 300m watch get in quick if you fancy a bit of bond james bond esqueness in your life bond s style oscillates from ridiculously on trend to low brow norm core to sleek hyper masculine tailoring but most seductive for those who plug into larlarb s deeply nuanced fashion language by replicating bits of his wardrobe it is utterly effortless i wanted to make sure everything felt like it wasn t a tortured over decision says larlarb like he didn t toil he didn t wake up that morning open his closet doors and think which shirt am i going to wear today everything had to feel as incisively instinctual as bond always is with even his action sequences you know everything is an instinct everything is a big bet a big risk and it always pays off buy a bit of bond or dress like his

foreign exchange movements the u s dollar was 13 weaker against the zar during q1 2021 which impacted our reported results results of operations by segment and liquidity processing segment revenue excluding ipg was 21 4 million in q1 2022 down 13 compared with q1 2021 but up 4 compared with q4 2021 on a constant currency basis excluding ipg segment revenue decreased primarily due to fewer prepaid airtime sales and a reduction in volume driven transaction fees including as a result of the south african banking industry s decision to waive fees charged to customers for utilizing other banks atms in august and september 2021 excluding ipg processing s operating loss has been impacted by the lower revenue our operating loss margin calculated as operating loss income divided by

million in q1 2022 up 12 compared with q1 2021 and marginally higher compared to q4 2021 on a constant currency basis segment revenue increased due to higher account fee revenue following an increase in the number of epe accounts an increase in lending revenue as a result of improved lending activity and an increase in insurance revenues from an increase in business written the increase in

tibet wants to bottle up much more of the region s water resources despite shrinking glaciers and the impact that exploitation of precious resources would have on neighboring countries this week the tibet autonomous region s government released a 10 year plan to encourage the massive expansion of the bottled water industry in the ecologically fragile region the target is to build 5 million cubic meters of bottled water production capacity by 2020 since tibet produced 153 000 cubic meters of water in 2014 according to xinhua this is indeed a huge jump water in tibet is abundant and much cheaper than in other parts of china water bottled upstream among snow capped peaks is also perceived as pure commanding a premium this has led to a huge influx of companies hoping to cash in on the region s water resources though it only makes up a very small proportion of china s annual bottled water production such premium water is seen as the new point of growth for the country s booming bottled water industry but tapping glaciers will come at a huge cost to tibet s fragile environment warned china water risk s recent report bottled water in china boom or bust the qinghai tibet plateau known as asia s water tower is the source of the continent s major rivers that provide a lifeline for china and other parts of asia reports bottled water in china boom or bust hongqiao liu china water risk it has only taken china two decades to become the world s largest bottled water consumer and a major producer but given china s much publicized water woes from pollution to scarcity and droughts can china s bottled water market continue to boom in the last two decades china has become the world s largest bottled water consumer and a major producer however with per capita consumption 19 percent lower than the global average the market is expected to continue to boom even if china reaches the consumption level of hong kong the market scale would be four times larger than today s in 2012 china produced 55 6 million cubic meters of packaged water in the light of president xi jinping s desire to build an ecological civilization china has also strengthened policies to conserve forests and natural protection zones china s strong commitment to dealing with climate change also includes actions to protect its glaciers but how does the growth of the bottled water industry in the region fit into such policies what does it mean for china and downstream countries if bottling production capacity soars the glaciers in the qinghai tibet plateau have already shrunk 15 percent over the last three decades with the stakes so high the government and investors should rethink their strategy asia s water tower bottled water hotspot while concerns over water pollution have driven the demand for bottled water it s no surprise that companies have flooded upstream to regions like the qinghai tibet plateau in search of cleaner sources of water the region is home to china s largest national parks and the source of major transboundary rivers it is also known as the third pole because it holds the largest stores of fresh water outside the north and south poles the qinghai tibet plateau is already a hotspot for the bottled water industry by 2014 the government had approved licenses for 28 companies to produce bottled water in the tibeta autonomous region tar bottled water activities are also growing rapidly in neighboring xinjiang qinghai and yunnan provinces with companies even bottling water straight from glacier tongues gelaixue glacier water is one such company according to its official website all its water comes from the glacier tongue of the no 1 glacier which sits 4 480 meters high in the tianshan mountains xinjiang province the company and its partner the tianshan glaciological station of the chinese academy of sciences have not disclosed any details about the exploitation process or the environmental impact of its activities what is clear is that the glacier is melting rapidly at a rate of 4 to 8 meters every year companies are also tapping glaciers in the everest qomolangma mountain range qomolangma glacier water bottles water from the qomolangma national nature reserve 80 kilometers from everest base camp pamirs ancient glacier water bottles spring water from the foot of the ata peaks of the pamir range near tajikistan preferential treatment this is just the start of the rush to exploit the region s water resources cash rich companies including pharmaceutical confectionery petroleum and biotechnology all want a finger in the pie in november 2014 as part of a government advocacy event called good water in tibet should be shared with the world the tar government signed 16 agreements with various investors totaling 2 6 billion yuan u s 409 million among them were state owned oil producer sinopec bright food group china national gold group and the three gorges group which owns the world s largest hydroelectric power station in hubei province last year the provincial government set up a special office and a 250 million yuan development fund u s 39 million to promote the industry companies investing in bottled water now enjoy preferential tax rates income tax exemptions and low interest loans with the support of local and central government companies have moved fast since early 2015 sinopec group has sold glacier water bottled from tibet in its 23 000 petrol stations and convenience stores across china official data shows the overall design capacity in tar had reached 3 million cubic meters by the end of 2014 already half way to the 5 million target sales doubled in 2014 compared to 2013 reaching 830 million yuan according to the tar government environmental risks although the development plan highlights the three bottom lines social stability environment and safety the industry is still growing against the tide of many of china s environmental policies the environmental and regulatory risks of the bottled water industry are high if china is determined to protect its water sources and ban all exploitative activities in protected areas around river sources the qinghai tibet plateau is not only an important source of water for china but also southeast and south asia the region is the source of ten of asia s major rivers these include the yangtze and yellow rivers china s two major watersheds and economic belts and also the transboundary lancang upper mekong river the nu salween and the yarlung zangbo brahmaputra river this upper watershed should be protected for long term prosperity rather than exploited for short term development china s leadership recognizes the tough choices needed to balance climate water and energy security with the need to protect watersheds yet local policies appear to be misaligned the region is among the places most vulnerable to climate change according to the chinese academy of sciences glaciers in the qinghai tibetan plateau have already shrunk 15 percent over the past three decades in the short term melting glaciers means higher bottling potential but in the long term rivers will dry up with disastrous consequences downstream reports towards a water energy secure china debra tan feng hu hubert thieriot dawn mcgregor china water risk china s waterscape is changing water risks in china be they physical economic or regulatory have great social economic impacts and are well recognized especially those in china s water energy nexus today 93 percent of power generation in since china sits at the headwaters of these rivers and glaciers any development within china could have a big impact on the region s water security aggressive plans to build an extra 124 gigawatts of hydropower on transboundary rivers in the region has already raised many concerns as highlighted in china water risk s report towards a water energy secure china tough choice ahead in power expansion with limited water resources china is facing tough choices in expanding its generating capacity coal fired power could exacerbate glacial melt and water scarcity while greener hydropower on transboundary rivers could raise geopolitical tensions if the bottled water industry runs wild this could lead to a new set of environmental problems although the tar only contributed 0 2 percent of china s overall 56 million cubic meters of packaged water production in 2012 according to the state statistics bureau of china there is no information about the potential environmental impact of the industry there are no environment impact assessments and the majority of the companies haven t released reports on water source protection pollution control water efficiency or benefits for local people companies that do disclose information such as the hong kong listed tibet 5100 claim that the amount of water withdrawn from springs or glaciers is not enough to dry them up however is it ethical to withdraw any water from protected areas where glaciers are already shrinking and where the central government has invested billions of yuan in conserving the region for climate adaptation and mitigation also the cost of bottling mineral water at the foot of high altitude glaciers is much higher with the extra technologies and transportation needed to bring the product from source to market the carbon emissions of the latter should also not be ignored the local government in tibet has also said it will promote the export of bottled water is this the right way forward to secure china s water security the government of jilin province in northeast china is also encouraging drinking water for export here the bottling capacity of changbaishan ever white mountain is expected to grow to 50 million cubic meters with 10 percent production exported by 2020 waning demand while many companies are flooding in to exploit the blue gold of tibet there are signs some are struggling to survive on july 28 2015 shares of tibet 5100 one of china s top high end bottled water brands fell 12 7 percent in the hong kong stock exchange after the china railway corporation stopped providing free mineral water to its passengers tibet 5100 sources its water from glaciers at an altitude of 5 100 meters in tibet and was one of the first companies to market glacier water in china from 2011 to june 2015 the company sold 200 million liters of bottled mineral water to the china railway corporation china railway failed to renew the contract in june 2015 there was speculation this is in line with china s crackdown on corruption in the railway system but it may also signal a shift in demand most high speed railway stations and trains are now equipped with drinking water facilities instead of giving out free bottled mineral water a spokesperson for shanghai railway told the media although tibet 5100 has argued that china railway cooperation only made up 13 percent of its total revenue in 2013 the end of the contract has inflicted heavy losses on the company china railway corporation has been the company s single largest client nine out of 10 bottles of tibet 5100 were sold to china railway corporation between 2008 and 2010 reports china s long march to safe drinking water hongqiao liu china water risk china s central government set ambitious goals to safeguard water quality in 2011 at the outset of the 12th five year plan 2011 2015 those goals targeted improvements from source to tap earmarking a budget of nearly rmb 700 billion u s 112 for more brands and bottlers in the third pole region this could be a warning demand for bottled water may fall as consumers go back to tap and once public drinking facilities are mandatory in public sphere as the joint report china s long march to safe drinking water published by china water risk and chinadialogue in march 2015 pointed out china invested up to 7 billion yuan to secure public water supply in rural and urban areas during the 12th five year plan period 2011 2015 the investment will continue to grow in the coming years since the state council has reiterated the government commitment on securing public water quality in the water pollution prevention and control action plan by the time the quality of the public drinking water system is fully secured will bottled water remain an alternative for drinking water given the high costs of bottling and shipping glacier water to households and public facilities as well as the high environmental costs involved investors should start to rethink their strategies in asia s

when martin njoku saw opioid addiction devastate his west virginia community he felt compelled to help this was the place he d called home for three decades where he d raised his two girls and turned his dream of owning a pharmacy into reality in 2016 after flooding displaced people in nearby counties njoku began dispensing buprenorphine to them and to local customers at his oak hill hometown pharmacy in fayette county buprenorphine a controlled substance sold under the brand names subutex and suboxone is a medication to treat opioid use disorder research shows it halves the risk of overdose and doubles people s chances of entering long term recovery i thought i was doing what was righteous for people who have illness njoku said but a few years later the drug enforcement administration raided njoku s pharmacy and accused the facility of contributing to the opioid epidemic rather than curbing it the agency revoked the pharmacy s registration to dispense controlled substances claiming it posed an imminent danger to public health and safety although two judges separately ruled in njoku s favor the dea s actions effectively shuttered his business i lost everything that i worked for njoku said lawyers pharmacists harm reduction advocates and a former dea employee say njoku s case is emblematic of the dea s aggressive stance on buprenorphine an opioid itself the medication can be misused so the dea works to limit its diversion to the streets but many say the agency s policies are exacerbating the opioid epidemic by scaring pharmacies away from dispensing this medication when it s desperately needed drug overdose deaths hit record highs last year and despite medical experts considering medications like buprenorphine the gold standard less than 20 of people with opioid use disorder typically receive them the federal government has taken steps to increase the number of clinicians who prescribe buprenorphine but many patients struggle to get those prescriptions filled a recent study found that 1 in 5 u s pharmacies do not provide buprenorphine pharmacies are terrified they re going to lose their dea registration and go out of business said charles buck selby a former inspector and chief compliance officer for the west virginia board of pharmacy who retired in 2018 ainsley bryce khn khn many pharmacists fear ordering too much buprenorphine will trigger a dea investigation research in kentucky and north carolina has found that creates a prescribing cliff says bayla ostrach who researches substance use disorder treatment and health policy doctors might prescribe more but if pharmacies won t fill the prescription patients can t get their medication the ramifications can be particularly acute in rural areas where a dearth of addiction treatment providers lack of transportation and stigma against these medications already create barriers if pharmacies decline to provide buprenorphine too patients will have few options left selby said the dea did not respond to requests for comment like many other prescription drugs buprenorphine can be found illegally on the street there are unscrupulous doctors who hand out prescriptions and pharmacists who fill them subutex which consists of buprenorphine alone is easier to misuse and typically has higher street value than suboxone a combination of buprenorphine and the overdose reversal drug naloxone in the case against njoku s pharmacy an assistant u s attorney explained that the dea got slapped hard for being asleep at the switch as the opioid crisis ramped up they re trying to make sure that subutex doesn t become the next problem according to court transcripts but research suggests that buprenorphine misuse has decreased in recent years even as prescribing has increased and that most people who use diverted buprenorphine do so to avoid withdrawal symptoms and because they can t get a prescription buprenorphine is less likely to cause overdoses than other opioids because its effects taper off at higher doses said dr aaron wohl medical director of the florida based coalition project opioid in njoku s case the dea said in court documents that several red flags had suggested the pharmacy s actions were irresponsible first many of the prescriptions it filled were for subutex instead of suboxone patients also traveled sometimes out of state to get prescriptions drove long distances within west virginia to reach njoku s pharmacy and often paid in cash in traditional prescription drug cases these are all markers of trouble but as njoku s lawyers argued and two judges later agreed they can also reflect the difficulty of getting addiction treatment which is sometimes more challenging than obtaining illicit drugs the practical reality and context of west virginia turn these additional flags from red to yellow u s district judge joseph goodwin wrote in his opinion patients may go out of their way for the drug because there aren t enough nearby doctors who prescribe it or pharmacies that stock it he wrote they might pay cash because they re uninsured or medicaid won t cover prescriptions written by an out of network doctor and they might prefer subutex because it s often cheaper than suboxone courtney ingram khn khn dr nathan mullins addiction medicine fellowship director at mountain area health education center in north carolina says switching the medications of patients recovering from opioid use disorder can cause needless anxiety by 2020 goodwin and an administrative law judge at the dea had both ruled in njoku s favor but several insurers and drug suppliers had already stopped doing business with him njoku closed the pharmacy in april 2021 across the country when a pharmacy stops providing buprenorphine the ripple effects can be far reaching trish mashburn works at two independent pharmacies in western north carolina when a nearby pharmacy stopped dispensing buprenorphine she began getting five calls a day from prospective customers trying to get their prescriptions filled she said although both her employers stock buprenorphine they order only a set amount so mashburn often must turn patients away research in north carolina and kentucky has found that many pharmacists worry that ordering more buprenorphine will trigger a dea investigation the dea does not specify thresholds for controlled substances but it requires wholesalers to flag suspicious orders in turn wholesalers limit how much a pharmacy can buy or create algorithms to detect orders that exceed projected need they base these limits in part on the dea s enforcement actions said larry cote a former dea attorney who now advises wholesalers pharmacies and other clients on regulatory compliance since pharmacies are not typically privy to how these limits are set many simply order small batches of buprenorphine out of caution that creates a prescribing cliff said bayla ostrach lead author of a paper studying this issue in north carolina doctors may prescribe buprenorphine to more patients but pharmacies order enough for only a certain number of customers since many people stay on buprenorphine for years once the pharmacy hits its self established quota it may rarely have openings for new patients a lee county fla man thought he was one of the lucky ones james 34 had been filling his subutex prescription at the supermarket chain publix for seven years in that time he held steady jobs and cared for his wife and children james asked khn to withhold his last name so future employers wouldn t judge him on his addiction history then last year james said he went to get his prescription refilled and was told publix no longer stocks subutex the medication the dea considered a red flag in njoku s case publix did not respond to requests for comment a decade ago when james began the medication he chose subutex because it was cheaper than suboxone today most insurance plans cover suboxone and the price difference has narrowed somewhat james was not eager to change to a potentially pricier medication and he worried a different drug might disrupt his recovery a common sentiment among patients in long term recovery said dr nathan mullins director of addiction medicine fellowship at mountain area health education center in north carolina changing their medication is unnecessary and can cause needless anxiety mullins said luckily james found an independent pharmacy that provides subutex it s more expensive since the new place doesn t accept his insurance he said he pays about 40 a week compared with 40 a month previously but james said it s worth it i ve been in 10 rehabs and a million detoxes and the only thing that has worked for me was one sublingual tablet james said along with therapy this saved my life khn kaiser health news is an editorially independent program of kff kaiser family foundation copyright 2023 kaiser health news to

a massive surge in inflation is threatening brazil s post pandemic economic recovery latin america s largest economy was savaged by the coronavirus with brazil suffering the third most covid 19 cases and second highest deaths globally as a result brazil s 2020 gross domestic product shrank by just over 4 since the economy began recovering inflation has surged to over 10 on an annualized basis causing the fiscal outlook for latin america s largest economy to deteriorate this forced brazil s central bank to hike the benchmark selic rate by 1 5 to 7 75 the sixth increase this year brazil s soaring inflation can be blamed on the surge in oil prices since the start of 2021 which has caused domestic fuel prices to spiral upwards this is threatening brazil s crucial economic upswing and creating considerable hardship for brazilians sparking significant political pressure for embattled populist right wing president jair bolsonaro in response to the inflationary crisis bolsonaro floated the idea of privatizing brazil s national oil company petrobras as of september 2021 the national government in brasilia through a series of entities owns a controlling 36 75 interest in petrobras the remaining 63 25 of the company is owned by retail and institutional investors with 19 77 being comprised of new york stock exchange american depositary receipts bolsonaro s latest statements are in stark contrast to earlier statements during his administration where he opposed privatizing petrobras because of its strategic value to brazil and importance in driving the country s epic offshore oil boom the president also took a heavy handed interventionist approach to managing petrobras earlier this year when he dismissed the company s experienced president roberto castello branco in a spat over higher fuel prices bolsonaro replaced branco with army general and former defense minister joaquim silva e luna who ironically has refused to artificially control fuel prices despite being a bolsonaro appointee lawmakers in bolsonaro s administration have indicated that the privatization of petrobras could occur through a share sale although such a move is not as simple as brasilia has portrayed related first large u s shale driller to pledge flat output in 2022 there are considerable impediments to any sale of the government s share of petrobras such a move would be political suicide for any lawmakers backing the energy company s privatization petrobras is regarded as a key symbol of brazil s economic success and is an important public asset that generates considerable fiscal revenue for brasilia oil industry unions are opposed to such a move with the federation of oil workers union fup portuguese initials threatening strike action portuguese if bolsonaro s government proceeds with privatizing petrobras there is potentially the need for bolsonaro s administration to present a constitutional amendment because of petrobras strategic importance to the state which would require the support of two thirds of congress if the company is to be successfully privatized privatizing petrobras will do nothing to alleviate the political fallout sparked by higher fuel prices which are fueling brazil s soaring inflation rate the integrated energy major is being forced to hike gasoline and diesel prices because of the crude oil price rally which saw the international brent benchmark soar by around 65 since the start of 2021 it will also do nothing to alleviate the inflationary pressures faced by latin america s largest economy other than reducing the political pressure on bolsonaro s administration triggered by its failure to keep fuel prices low such a move however will free petrobras from the yoke of government intervention which has seen successive administrations over the last decade destroy hundreds of billions of dollars of shareholder value it is petrobras that has become the key driver of brazil s stunning decade long offshore oil boom which has catapulted latin america s largest economy into the realms of the world s top 10 oil producers data from brazil s petroleum regulator shows that for september 2021 the country s hydrocarbon output reached an average of 3 8 million barrels per day of which 78 or three million barrels was crude oil this was unchanged from a month earlier and 4 greater than for the same period during 2020 while crude oil production was 3 3 higher petrobras was responsible for 92 6 or nearly 3 6 million barrels per day of brazil s total september 2021 hydrocarbon output and 93 3 or 2 8 million barrels of its crude oil production the rapid growth in petrobras operations saw industry consultancy rystad energy predict in late 2019 that petrobras would become the world s largest publicly listed oil producing company by 2030 it is the 210 000 acre buzios oilfield the world s largest ultra deep water field which is the key growth driver for petrobras and brazil s epic offshore hydrocarbon boom the oilfield is situated in the prolific offshore santos basin which contains the tupi field previously known as lula brazil s largest and most important producing oilfield petrobras is the operator of tupi and owns a 65 interest with 25 held by shell and the remaining 10 by galp production from tupi which during september 2021 averaged 948 000 barrels daily from nine fpsos is believed to have peaked highlighting the importance of developing the buzios field if petrobras and brazil are to expand petroleum production at the desired rate petrobras which owns a 90 interest in buzios and is the operator with the remaining 10 split equally between china national offshore oil company and china national petroleum corp during september 2021 the oilfield pumped an average of 566 196 barrels of crude oil per day from four fpsos which amounted to 19 of brazil s total monthly output of three million barrels per day petrobras plans to aggressively expand buzios budgeting 17 billion for developing the field between 2021 and 2025 that includes adding eight more fpsos which will lift crude oil production to over two million barrels per day the growing popularity of brazil s medium sweet crude oil grades among asian refiners notably in china after the introduction of imo 2020 during january last year is an important motor of the latin american country s oil boom while brazil s september 2021 petroleum exports to china slumped to a near four year low seeing latin america s largest oil producer s imports ranked eighth behind malaysia and ahead of colombia demand for buzios from the world s largest refiner is growing the medium crude oil which has an api gravity of 28 degrees is especially sweet with a 0 3 sulfur content and low in metals as well as other contaminants making it ideal for blending with lower quality crude oil feedstock to produce low emission maritime fuels demand for crude oil grades with buzios qualities will keep expanding in asia because it is a global shipping hub with singapore the world s largest bunkering port having its position challenged by china buzios latest surge in popularity sees the brazilian crude oil grade selling at a higher price than the international brent benchmark in asia according to s p global platts buzios which trades at a slight discount to brazil s tupi grade which possesses similar characteristics was selling at a 3 per barrel premium to brent that is a powerful incentive for petrobras to focus on investing in the development of the buzios ultra deep water oilfield privatizing petrobras may reduce the political fallout for the bolsonaro administration caused by rising fuel and other energy prices but it appears unachievable at this time this makes the latest events a worrying distraction for an integrated energy company that is responsible for driving brazil s massive offshore oil boom and has the potential to become the largest oil producer among publicly listed petroleum companies and lift brazil to the world s fifth largest petroleum exporter by 2030 advertisement by matthew smith for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com
bedford mass business wire ocular therapeutix inc nasdaq ocul a biopharmaceutical company focused on the formulation development and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2021 and provided updates on its ophthalmology pipeline the previous four months have been an exceptionally busy time at ocular said antony mattessich president and chief executive officer we had a couple of positive outcomes that we believe will set the course for the future of dextenza the first was the approval of the snda for itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis that opens a large new and discrete opportunity for dextenza in the office setting the second was medicare s final rule that determined that dextenza will be paid separately in the hospital outpatient and asc settings in 2022 and is eligible under the current criteria for separate payment in the asc as a non opioid pain management drug beyond 2022 positioning our vibrant business in the surgical setting to grow into the foreseeable future we also continued to advance our pipeline while we were disappointed with the outcome of our phase 2 dry eye clinical trial with otx csi we expect to announce the phase 2 clinical trial topline results for otx ded our clinical trial in episodic dry eye disease in the first quarter of 2022 further our u s based clinical trial of otx tki in wet amd is enrolling well and we expect to initiate a phase 2 clinical trial for otx tic in glaucoma by the end of the year overall we are pleased with our continued progress as we enter a period of significant data and news flow that will shape our leadership position within ophthalmology recent business updates fda approved supplemental new drug application snda for dextenza dexamethasone ophthalmic insert 0 4 mg for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis the approval represents the second label expansion for dextenza and makes it the first fda approved physician administered intracanalicular insert capable of delivering a preservative free drug for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis with a single administration for up to 30 days allergic conjunctivitis represents the company s first indication that will primarily be prescribed by physicians within the office setting and begins to lay the commercial foundation for additional potential pipeline product candidates to be used to treat patients in that setting received final rules for the outpatient prospective payment system opps and medicare physician fee schedule mpfs from the centers for medicare and medicaid cms the opps final rule confirms that dextenza will continue to be separately paid by medicare in the ambulatory surgical center asc and hospital outpatient department hopd settings for 2022 cms further indicated that dextenza is eligible to receive separate payment in the asc setting because it meets the criteria set forth in the non opioid as a surgical supply provision which is favorable for 2023 and beyond the mpfs final rule establishes payment for category i current procedural terminology cpt code 68841 which replaces category iii cpt code 0356t effective january 1 2022 the physician payment for the insertion of dextenza in the physician office is 37 29 and in the asc or the hopd is 31 58 the company believes achieving category i status for the new cpt code represents an important milestone because although the procedure payments are reduced in some locations category i codes standardize payment and are more widely accepted by the payer community resulting in broader coverage the u s commercial uptake of dextenza net product revenue of dextenza for the quarter was 11 9 million a 120 increase over the third quarter of 2020 and a 7 sequential improvement over the second quarter of 2021 the company believes that dextenza recorded a solid third quarter performance in light of lower than anticipated elective surgery volumes due to covid 19 while it is early in the fourth quarter monthly growth in asc volumes appears to be coming back on track as the company estimates sales of in market sales of over 9 600 billable units in october its second largest month ever in market sales of billable units were 6 924 9 321 and 8 737 for the months of july august and september respectively announced results from phase 2 clinical trial evaluating otx csi cyclosporine intracanalicular insert for the treatment of dry eye disease the phase 2 clinical trial of otx csi was designed to evaluate the safety tolerability durability and efficacy of two different formulations of otx csi by measuring signs and symptoms of dry eye disease in 140 subjects treated in both eyes over approximately 16 weeks a 12 week study period with an additional 4 week safety follow up the phase 2 study did not show separation between the otx csi treated subjects both formulations and the vehicle treated subjects both formulations for the primary endpoint of increased tear production at 12 weeks as measured by the schirmer s test all formulations of otx csi were observed to have a generally favorable safety profile and were well tolerated the company is continuing to analyze the data including retention data showing lower than anticipated insert retention rates in the active drug groups expanded board of directors and leadership team in september 2021 the company added merilee raines to its board of directors and karen leigh edwards as senior vice

by year end 2021 in the united states the clinical trial will enroll approximately 105 subjects to evaluate two different formulations of otx tic versus a control arm receiving durysta otx csi cyclosporine intracanalicular insert for the chronic treatment of dry eye disease the company reported top line data in late october from the u s based phase 2 randomized double masked multi center clinical trial to evaluate the safety efficacy durability and tolerability of two different formulations of otx csi versus hydrogel vehicle insert while the phase 2 clinical trial did not show separation between the otx csi treated subjects both formulations and the vehicle treated subjects both formulations for the primary endpoint of increased tear production at 12 weeks as measured by
