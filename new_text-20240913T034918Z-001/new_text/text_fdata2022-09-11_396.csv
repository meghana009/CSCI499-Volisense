the reputation of brazilian agriculture is at an all time low as destruction of the amazon and cerrado mounts can anything be done to put things right it was the late 1970s when dudy and luiz fernando paiva left são paulo for a farm in the brazilian state of mato grosso back then the region was at the heart of the country s agricultural revolution one that would transform it from a net importer of food in the early 1970s to the agricultural powerhouse it is today the couple opened fazenda santana a 1 500 hectare beef and dairy farm on the border of the amazon rainforest and the cerrado tropical savannah two of the most important ecological habitats in south america the paivas set out to produce food sustainably making a quick decision to expand into an integrated farming system combining cattle and crops with zero tillage to protect the soil today its fields are filled with soy and corn for much of the year though through the dry season the land is parched often not seeing rain for several months herds of cattle graze on the scrub left behind the different systems work together to help the environment says their son juliano ribeiro graça paiva we are fixing carbon into the soil today agriculture looms large over the entire region fields of crops stretch out uninterrupted towards the horizon the nearby highway rumbles day and night with lorries loaded with grains seeds and sugar for the local processing plants of cargill bunge and cofco billboards line the road pushing the latest machinery and apparatus to local farmers but sustainable farms like the paivas are not uncommon in brazil the country has developed a terrible reputation for its environmental record in recent years but much of brazil s agricultural output is deforestation free a 2020 study published in science titled the rotten apples of brazil s agribusiness found 2 of properties in the amazon and cerrado were responsible for 62 of all potential illegal deforestation it s a sector that s very powerful very conservative it s also arrogant and hates interference it is a message many in brazil are desperate to communicate one thing that makes me sad is the generalisation says marcos fava neves an expert in brazilian agri business pointing out that brazil is twice the area of the eu it s like blaming portugal for something that s going on in poland yes they re both in the eu but why are you mixing us with other things that are going on over there the amazon attracted most attention from european policymakers and business leaders in recent years british supermarkets were among those to sign up to the soy moratorium in 2006 a voluntary commitment that banned soy from deforested areas in the amazon biome the interventions had much success a 2020 study in nature calling it one of the great conservation successes of the 21st century after the rate of brazilian amazon deforestation fell 84 between 2004 and 2012 but while deforestation fell in the amazon the detrimental impacts leaked into other biomes and today the neighbouring cerrado biome is a deforestation hotspot concluded a paper in nature last year in the year to july 2021 deforestation hit a six year high in the cerrado with 8 531 sq km cleared an area more than five times the size of greater london alarming expansion the extent of the agricultural expansion is alarming ecologists the cerrado is one of the most biodiverse savannahs in the world home to thousands of plants and animals species yet its transformation into a soy producing powerhouse means that since 1985 nearly half of its native vegetation has disappeared according to the mapbiomas monitoring project the conversion is also contributing to the climate crisis as the cerrado s deep rooted plants are at the heart of a huge carbon dioxide sink in the region as they are removed the gas is released into the atmosphere the situation is becoming critical with a paper last year concluding the cerrado is becoming hotter and drier and now threatens an entire ecosystems collapse the destruction is of high importance to the british food industry given brazil supplies almost two thirds of all soy in the uk used for animal feed according to research by the london school of economics in 2019 tesco pledged 10m to try and incentivise farmers to grow soy on existing agricultural land rather than burning virgin forest and this summer sainsbury s and waitrose joined it by investing a combined 11m 9 1m into a new system of financial incentives for brazilian farmers to conserve native vegetation it s very clear that we do not need to cut a single tree in the amazon rainforest to convert into agriculture there have also been efforts to pressure soy traders such as cargill to screen out farmers non compliant with deforestation laws but according to one brazilian environmentalist these fell flat the traders could not screen them out the farmers won there was a tremendous outcry from the soy associations like aprosoja and abiove who said this is infringing on our national sovereignty we ll do what we want and if you don t want us we re going to sell it to china it s very powerful very conservative it s also arrogant and hates inference while traders such as cargill adm and bunge are still widely criticised by campaigners for their links to deforestation the source suggests these companies are stuck between a rock and hard place when it comes to tackling the problem on the one hand they re trying to source more sustainably to meet demand in markets like europe and us while simultaneously trying to convince farmers inflamed by the anti environmental speech of mr bolsonaro president jair bolsonaro is widely seen as one of the primary factors behind brazil s declining environmental record since coming to power in 2019 backed by brazil s wealthy agribusiness groups he has slashed the environment agency s budget to its lowest level in 21 years placed it inside the business orientated agriculture ministry and openly bragged about the lack of enforcement on environmental laws do have to exist yes he said in january but we talked and we reduced the fines in agriculture by more than 80 this tacit allowance of illegal activity has incentivised many farmers to clear land in the cerrado last year 98 of land conversions contained some kind of irregularity such as no licensing or exceeding the legal limit a mapbiomas study found meanwhile in the amazon deforestation in the first half of 2022 was up 80 compared with the same period in 2018 the year before bolsonaro took office analysis by the amazon environmental research institute shows it poses a serious conundrum to british food companies linked with brazil what can they do to stem the damage land clearance is visibly no longer necessary for agricultural development with sufficient land already in production across brazil there is now 72 million hectares of cropland plus an additional 90 million hectares of degraded pasture a total area larger than mongolia we have problems with wildfires we have problems with illegal deforestation says celso moretti president of embrapa brazil s agricultural research association but it s very clear that we do not need to cut a single tree in the amazon rainforest to convert into agriculture financial incentives to tackle deforestation many therefore agree there must be greater financial incentivisation for landowners to preserve what is still there it s important to see how to include these people in economic activities because when they perceive that the forest has more value standing up than destroyed i think what we see today will improve says fava neves one option is to expand the availability of carbon markets to brazilian farmers he says allowing them to monetise preserved land by selling credits to other polluters trying to offset their emissions this will be a real revolution says fava neves it ll show that leaving it alone makes more money than producing meat the global demand for carbon credits is expected to grow 15 fold by 2030 to a total value of 50bn according to the taskforce on scaling voluntary carbon markets and brazil is now taking steps to join the party in may president bolsonaro signed a decree to create a national carbon market but there are doubts among investors as to its viability in a legitimate carbon market verification is crucial yet bolsonaro has given no reassurances this will take place if the high profile issue of deforestation is not tackled effectively it s going to be difficult for brazil to attract investment to the carbon market graham stock a strategist for bluebay asset management told the associated press in january tesco sainsbury s and waitrose are also trying to incentivise soy farmers by providing low cost finance in return for stemming legal deforestation on their land the 11m put up by the three supermarkets will be used to provide annual loans for farmers to buy seeds fertilisers and other agricultural inputs at a rate around 25 lower than their current interest rate as this is their primary cost farmers could boost their profits by up to 25 says pedro moura costa ceo of sustainable investment management the financial firm running the incentive the scheme initially focuses on 36 farms but with the pot expanding to 100m next year as other food and drink companies sign up its reach is expected to grow says moura costa european and uk policymakers are also looking to incite change the eu is looking to implement laws by 2025 that will make it illegal to import goods from illegally deforested land and the uk may not be far behind while there are still questions about if and how this can be successfully enforced some in brazil claim they are already preparing for the change we will need to provide 100 transparency on the ships going to europe says andre nassar executive president of abiove but of course we need other technologies we need to improve the traceability system so that s what we are doing here in brazil developing the systems for all companies buying soybeans because all companies have to provide the origin nassar warns however that the changes will inevitably raise prices as efficiencies in the current soybean supply chain will be compromised you have to change the logistics and then prices will increase because we will lose efficiency ultimately much will depend on brazil s upcoming elections in october brazilian law already specifies that farmers must protect a certain amount of native vegetation depending on the biome ranging from 80 in the amazon to up to 35 in the cerrado but a lack of enforcement is undermining its potential the brazilian forest code in my view is one of the laws that has the most tremendous conservation transformation potential says moura costa the problem is that the government never put the resources to verify if the information is right or wrong it s self declaratory so no one is currently saying you don t have enough legal reserve so you have to do something about that many environmentalists hope that lula da silva the current frontrunner in the polls and former president from 2003 to 2010 can win in october and replicate his efforts during his first term in office while by no means a perfect record he oversaw record falls in amazonian deforestation and has pledged to seek net zero deforestation in the country if elected one thing that makes me sad is the generalisation it s like blaming portugal for something that s going on in poland there will never be a silver bullet however with carrots and sticks necessary to ensure the existing pockets of sustainable brazilian agriculture become the norm some of this may be an international premium some may be low cost finance from european food companies there will also soon be requirements for all supply chains into europe to be deforestation free the outcome of october s election will trump everything

hector bolitho s biography jinnah creator of pakistan doesn t get the attention it deserves even though it was the quaid e azam s first biography in english by an internationally recognised author american writer stanley wolpert mentions him only briefly in his classic jinnah of pakistan while the young pakistani writer yasser latif hamdani in his jinnah a life totally ignores him maybe on a humble personal level the bolitho book has had a lasting impression on me because i read it in my intellectually formative years at college like all biographies the bolitho book covers every phase of jinnah s life from childhood through his navigation of the muslim cause and up to his death but what adds to the book s readability for the layperson is his emphasis on some of the traits in jinnah s character and the contrast with mahatma gandhi both were great men of the kind history produces in centuries both had respect for each other despite acute political differences and both negotiated face to face and through correspondence at a level that truly revealed the inherent greatness in their character on some of jinnah s obsessions like that with personal cleanliness bolitho dwells at considerable length and quotes eyewitnesses that to my knowledge other books missed they included doctors friends and two personalities that fascinated jinnah liaquat ali khan and his charismatic wife ra ana both were great men of the kind history produces in centuries as for the differences between jinnah and gandhi a most interesting account has been given by a doctor who treated them both not named by bolitho the doctor said of jinnah as a politician he kept his distance gandhi was unclothed before his disciples jinnah was clothed before his disciples that was the difference between them gandhi was an instrument of power jinnah was power he was a cold rationalist in politics a man with a one track mind but with great force behind it that was the fundamental difference between them in terms of their cleanliness habits he said gandhi used to say cleanliness is not next to godliness it is godliness he was scrupulously clean in all his physical habits yet he would perform dirty work and spoil his hands in doing some kindness for the poor jinnah was not like that his cleanliness was a personal mania he would wash his hands several times a day but he did not wish to touch people it was as if he wished to be immaculate and alone bitterness never cropped up between them and they behaved in a manner that was sometimes astonishing once the quaid had some problem with one of his feet and couldn t go to the gate to receive gandhi when he came to his bombay home for one of their lengthy talk sessions gandhi sat down on the floor removed jinnah s shoe and sock examined his affected foot and promised to send him a home remedy the medicine arrived next day and even though jinnah didn t use it he thanked gandhi for his gesture yet neither of the two great men in whose hands was the destiny of a subcontinent gave up their views on partition gandhi made several proposals which seemingly accepted partition but with clauses that jinnah didn t find acceptable arguing against jinnah s two nation theory gandhi wrote to him i find no parallel in history of a body of converts and descendants claiming to be a nation apart from the parent stock if india was one nation before the advent of islam it must remain one in spite of the change of faith of a large body of her children you do not claim to be a separate nation by right of conquest but by reason of acceptance of islam will the two nations become one if the whole of india accepted islam jinnah s reply was historic and like all his utterances and writings consisted of words that turned the reply into textbook stuff for future students of pakistan s history he wrote back we maintain that muslims and hindus are two major nations by any definition or test as a nation we are a nation of a hundred million and what is more we are a nation with our own distinctive culture and civilisation language and literature art and architecture names and nomenclature sense of values and proportion legal laws and moral codes customs and calendar history and traditions aptitudes and ambitions in short we have our own distinctive outlook on life and of life by all the canons of international law we are a nation gandhi s assassination on jan 30 1948 by a hindu fanatic shocked the quaid who called him one of the greatest men produced by the hindu community bolitho s book begins with a single quote on the page after the flyleaf failure is a word unknown to me jinnah the writer is dawn s external ombudsman and an author published in dawn september 11th 2022
how fidelity special values made 11 5 a year over a decade contrarian manager alex wright has delivered a 198 return for investors investment manager alex wright has just notched up ten years at the helm of investment trust fidelity special values and despite some major challenges along the way especially in the early months of lockdown when the trust s share price plunged sharply he s done a rather good job for shareholders over the past ten years he s delivered an overall return for investors of 198 per cent 11 5 per cent per annum this compares favourably against the 89 per cent return recorded by the ftse all share index although wright believes that the uk economy will soon slide into recession he does not think that this will necessarily drag down the uk stock market with it indeed he argues that when uncertainty is rife there are plenty of opportunities for fund managers and investors to pick up bargain stocks that could prove solid long term investments and his view is that the uk stock market where the trust is heavily invested remains undervalued both historically and against other markets with inflation in double digits it s unlikely that investors will enjoy the same real returns they enjoyed over the last decade he admits and the growth stocks which previously drove markets forward especially in the united states will not be the stars of the next decade but for a fund like special values where the emphasis is on identifying good undervalued companies which have the resilience to withstand any recession there is a chance for us to continue to make money for shareholders he says it is too early to say what impact a conservative government led by liz truss will have on the economy and the uk stock market geopolitical issues and their influence on energy prices he believes are bigger considerations while he hasn t quite battened down the hatches the 815million trust listed on the london stock exchange is in defensive mode it has little borrowing and the portfolio is spread across more than 100 holdings and most sectors of the market no individual holding currently represents more than five per cent of the trust s assets although wright is normally happy to let a position grow to six per cent before trimming it back diversification he says is the order of the day with exposure to large uk companies such as insurers aviva and legal general as well as small to medium sized companies we ve got lots of investment ideas in the trust he says given the uncertainty out there we don t quite know how things will play out the biggest holdings are in outsourcer serco and tobacco giant imperial brands wright says serco is as acyclical a stock as investors can find given its steady stream of contracts from the government and its success in winning business overseas imperial brands he adds is a super investment on income grounds alone delivering an attractive yield of seven per cent plus its earnings aren t impacted by the economy he explains and it s got a lot of debt off its balance sheet while primarily invested in the uk the trust does have international holdings mainly in european healthcare stocks such as sanofi and roche stakes in us stocks the likes of hewlett packard and citigroup were disposed of five years ago the trust s stock market identification code is bwxc7y9 and its ticker fsv annual charges total 0 69 per cent shares in the trust currently trade at a discount of nine per cent which some investors might find attractive
concrete is the second most widely used substance on earth beaten only by water on the global stage more than 30billion tons of concrete are poured each year a substantial proportion of which goes into flooring individual homes and blocks of flats factories warehouses and offices schools hospitals and government buildings they all rely on concrete flooring and those floors need to be flat somero enterprises specialises in high tech machines that help builders flatten concrete smoothly so flooring work is up to scratch and there are no awkward lumps or uneven surfaces hard work somero enterprises specialises in high tech machines that help builders flatten concrete smoothly so flooring work is up to scratch based in florida somero is a recognised leader in its field shipping machinery to more than 100 countries worldwide and offering round the clock technical support in 65 languages midas recommended somero in 2016 when the shares were 1 36 the shares closed at 4 12 last week after chief executive jack cooney unveiled record half year sales strong profits and an 11 per cent increase in the dividend cooney also expressed confidence about the future suggesting that demand for somero s products remains high despite slowing economic growth in many parts of the world cooney and his team are highly focused on rewarding shareholders too paying out substantial sums each year through ordinary and special dividends this year a payout of 43 3 cents 37 75p is forecast rising to 48 7 cents in 2023 the company declares its results in dollars as it is based in the us and makes most of its sales there however uk shareholders receive dividends in sterling an advantage when the us currency is strong as it is now somero has thousands of customers contractors who specialise in the commercial market where specifications about flooring can be particularly rigorous the group makes a range of machines from smaller less advanced equipment costing around 50 000 to highly complex kit changing hands for up to 500 000 some machines are more suitable for compact spaces others for huge warehouses or industrial plants cooney is constantly updating the range making existing kit more technically advanced and introducing new variations such as machines that can be used for multi storey buildings or even products designed for cowsheds and chicken barns this constant expansion gives somero access to new customers while existing firms tend to come back for the latest models expanding their fleet or trading in old for new cooney is making a determined push into new markets too the company has tried to expand into china and other parts of asia but flooring specifications are less exacting in many of these countries so cooney is now focusing more on developed regions particularly europe and australia as well as north america the company should also benefit from the persistent shortage of labourers in the construction sector as its kit dramatically reduces the need for manual workers and delivers more precise results midas verdict at 4 12 somero is yielding more than 9 per cent offering a real income cushion as inflation bites shareholders have been well rewarded from this us business over the past six years but they should retain their stock new investors might also consider digging into these shares analysts believe they are worth more than 8 traded on aim ticker som contact somero com or 001 239 210 6519
should you invest in diamonds are they rock solid investments or a high risk gamble in a world where it s easy to be led astray a rock solid investment is hard to come by during these uncertain times but a diamond is a sparkling option that you might consider over the past 12 months the average price for this precious stone has risen by 6 4 per cent while over five years it is up 6 per cent according to the industry s diamond prices index but some of the highest quality diamonds have seen prices rise by more than a third in a year and are up almost 60 per cent in five years such returns put most stocks and shares to shame over 12 months the ftse all share index is down by about 2 per cent while over five years it has risen by 1 per cent always seek out professional guidance diamond trader tobias kormind co founder of online jewellery trader 77 diamonds warns that although exciting the diamond market is unregulated and fraught with dangers so expert guidance is essential he says few of us have any idea of the true value of a gem at first sight whether it is either a worthless trinket or a priceless heirloom he adds while it is key to seek advice when buying and selling you must still be careful as consumers get exploited overcharged or paid too little for a precious stone in their possession kormind believes anyone interested in trading gems needs to speak to a member of the national association of jewellers which has a code of conduct based on honesty integrity and professionalism yet he warns that high street shops might try to sell diamonds at retail rather than wholesale prices eating into the potential for future profits he adds as an individual you should be aware there is vat to pay on diamond buying which you will not recoup when selling unless you are vat registered this means stones will have to rise in value by at least 20 per cent for you to make a profit on them there is also a minimum 10 per cent capital gains tax to pay on any profits made on stones worth more than 6 000 sold above a 12 300 annual exemption limit study the four cs to gauge quality gem values are based on the four cs carat colour cut and clarity carat is the measure of a gemstone s weight with one carat being 200 milligrams the bigger the stone the more valuable it usually is but a one carat diamond can be worth anything between 1 000 and 20 000 or more depending on its colour cut and clarity for a diamond the more sparkling white it is the higher the price it will command yellow tinges tends to cheapen it if you opt for a rock with a slight pink hue you may pay far more than for a white diamond because their prices have been soaring in recent years as they have become fashionable kormind says the argyle diamond mine in australia is renowned for pink diamonds but closed a couple of years ago causing a fall in supply in the past five years some pink diamonds have more than tripled in value he adds of course this does not mean prices will continue to rocket but it shows how values can rise unexpectedly the cut is how a craftsman has chipped away at the stone to make it sparkle so is another vital consideration the clarity looks for imperfections and unless you are an expert looking through a loupe magnifying glass a minor blemish is likely to be missed consider how the stone could be a liquid asset gems should be viewed as a long term investment typically held for five years or more you are usually better off buying a smaller top quality diamond such as a one carat stone worth more than 5 000 these are termed a liquid asset in the gemstone world because they tend to be more tradeable than a larger rock of three carats or more commission on sales through a trader work out at about 5 per cent of the price demand a certificate of authenticity valuing gems with an untrained eye is extremely hard but you can get proof of quality through a professional certificate the most respected is the international gemological institute of america gia certificate this is effectively a report card on the quality of a diamond and lets you compare it with other stones thomas schrock is founder of online trader the natural gem he says if a stone has a certificate it should mean it has been analysed by a trusted laboratory there are other certificates including the ceylon gem lab cgl certificate issued in sri lanka the gemmological laboratory austria gla certificate and the swiss schweizerische stiftung fur edelstein forschung ssef don t forget other coloured gemstones although diamonds are the most valuable gems other precious stones such as emeralds rubies and sapphires have also seen prices rise in recent years the natural gem s schrock says where a gem comes from can impact on its value he says a ruby from mozambique might be just as high a quality as one from burma but the asian stone is worth a third more because of its heritage burma has a great reputation for precious gems he adds the value of a gem is a combination of its intrinsic worth what it looks like and its history including origin buyers should be wary of buying blind from street traders when abroad in colombia emeralds can be oiled to enhance their colour while sapphires from the indian region of kashmir and rubies from sri lanka may have imperfections filled in to mask their true value certificates help avoid such tricks get your gems valued and keep them safe diamonds should be kept safe and secure as well as insured find a local member of the institute of registered valuers for a professional valuation for which you might pay from 50 per item take photographs and keep all documentation including purchase receipts and certificates of authenticity separate from the jewellery insurers typically ask people to itemise gems or jewellery worth 1 000 or more individual cover might cost 1 per cent of its value so something worth 10 000 might cost 100 a year to insure but as part of that deal insurers might also want you to keep valuables in a safe you must ensure you get a professionally rated safe fit for your valuables try investment funds with exposure to mining exposure to diamonds and precious stones is also possible through investment funds examples include jpm natural resources which has about a fifth of its portfolio in mining companies that dig for diamonds as well as precious metals you can also invest in stock market listed multinational mining giants such as anglo american but this does not come without risks in the last year its share price is down 8 per cent

what are the odds that the same man on sept 11 would narrowly miss being in the south tower of the world trade center and flight 93 the plane that went down in shanksville pennsylvania and what are the odds the man writing about the life lessons of 9 11 would have grown up next door to a woman who was also writing about the life lessons of 9 11 fate destiny karma such words come naturally in the context of an existential crisis like 9 11 what does it all mean why do some people live and others die how do we face death and how do we make the most of life those are questions that barbara becker author of heartwood the art of living with the end in mind flatiron books macmillan and ed zier author of undaunted leadership amid growth adversity koehler books believe we should be thinking about good times or bad more thanks to donor 9 11 ferry captain has years to live both of our books are about what we did in this experience of 9 11 said becker now a manhattan resident who grew up next door to zier in franklin lakes the two had been good friends since the 1970s in fact she met her husband david through zier s family neither had any idea until after the fact each was writing a book about a similar subject coincidence maybe there s something more to life than meets the eye said zier who now lives in naples florida both books part memoir and part meditation are about the ways 9 11 impacted the authors and changed the trajectory of their lives the repercussions in both cases were enormous ministers and volunteers becker became an interfaith minister and a disaster chaplain who ministers to people in extreme situations she is also a hospice volunteer who has worked extensively with families of the dying she has been she estimates at the deathbeds of close to 1 000 people zier who began gamely building back his company on sept 12 2001 the day after 166 of his colleagues barely made it out of the doomed south tower and four lost their lives eventually walked away from the corporate world and began a private consulting practice less money but he discovered that perhaps money wasn t so important after all he also began volunteering to teach english to esl students i could see my daughter in plays if i had to he said i could go on field trips with her that wouldn t have been possible in the corporate world i do credit 9 11 for giving me that point of view both authors like many of us have vivid memories of that day in 2001 becker a lower east side resident in new york city was taking her 1 year old son evan to day care in a stroller at 8 46 a m when the first plane hit the north tower they were three blocks away we were close enough to see people jumping she said in that first moment of confusion some people were actually underreacting accident small plane don t panic but becker was then working for the center for reproductive rights on wall street she knew about terrorism and she knew that abortion clinic bombings often happen in twos they ll place a bomb it goes off then they wait until the first responders are in sight to launch a second attack she didn t wait to see what would happen next i turned the stroller around and ran back to my neighborhood she said she remembers vividly her son pointing at the sky and saying fire he would end up repeating that over and over for the next three months she said dodging a bullet at precisely the same moment zier s colleagues were on floors 77 and 78 of the south tower their software company baseline financial services founded in 1981 had just moved into the towers two years before under ordinary circumstances zier would have been there too but it happened that a meeting he was expected to attend on the west coast had been suddenly rescheduled for sept 12 he now had to get to san francisco by sept 11 the usual 500 ticket would because of the last minute booking cost him 2 000 too pricey he felt so he declined thus he may have narrowly missed being booked on united 93 one of three flights leaving newark for san francisco that morning odds were one in three he would have been booked on it it was an instant oh my goodness when i heard he said more montclair artist s sculptures at world trade center are among first since 9 11 more watch deputy fire chief in shanksville talks about responding on 9 11 but he barely had time to process his own close call i was already overwhelmed at 3 p m he said i didn t know who was alive then phone service was so poor i had to find a way to tell thousands of customers we potentially didn t exist anymore i had to start figuring out what funerals i would be attending obviously it was the most surreal moment of my life and it changed me greatly i had already been through hugging my wife going to school to tell my daughters i was alive my parents came to my house to hug me as tight as anyone ever hugged me in my life the search for answers that day was a turning point for zier as it was for becker for her 9 11 was the beginning of a spiritual quest she had barely begun to process that trauma when in 2010 her close friend marisa palladino died of cancer i loved this woman so much she said when i was told she had a year left to live i went into an existential crisis i began reading everything i could about death i discovered thinkers and sages from thoreau to marcus aurelius to the dalai lama all implored us to live with the end ever present in our lives she studied with zen monks she attended ceremonies with lakota elders in south dakota she talked with a young girl whose father and three brothers were killed before her eyes during the rwandan genocide she dealt with the death of her own parents in 2017 she became a minister her book is an account of her journey and the lessons she learned from it i decided to take on death as a teacher rather than run away from this conversation we re afraid to have in this culture about ourselves our own deaths and the deaths of loved ones she said her key takeaway confronting death honestly and having it present in our lives makes us stronger people that s the meaning of her title heartwood heartwood is the inner pillar of trees she said it is prized by woodworkers for being the strongest most stable part of the tree but what s surprising is that heartwood is no longer living it s inert trees grow around it they need the strength of the heartwood to expand with those we ve loved and lost they re a lot like the trees they form our heartwood our enduring strength all for one for his part zier was learning another valuable lesson from 9 11 about solidarity teamwork the people that survived that day were incredibly undaunted and unwavering in getting out of the building he said the second plane hit the south tower at 9 03 a m the crash destroyed floors 84 down to 78 which is to say the topmost of the two floors where baseline financial services was located the four blessed souls on 78 were killed instantly zier said luckily by that time most of the folks on floor 77 were already on their way downstairs they had disobeyed instructions they d been told to sit tight it would be more dangerous to go down to a street crowded with first responders but even before the second plane hit the staff had reached their own conclusions we had a young man from northern ireland who was used to bomb threats zier said he said to his colleagues i ve had experience with this i m getting out of here and so they all did and so incredibly did the 12 people who were still left on the 77th floor after the second plane hit they banded together somehow it was one for all and all for one zier said they examined the staircases they all looked bad so they rolled the dice and chose the one that was the least smoky and all of our individuals rallied around a colleague who was pregnant they moved at her pace which is absolutely amazing smelling the flowers credit the much maligned corporate culture of america which has its upside in an emergency i tie the corporate culture that was very family and team oriented with their determining to go together zier said it was that same team spirit that caused a skeleton crew of 15 staffers to meet in a philadelphia satellite office the next day a day when america was still in shock and determine that come hell or high water baseline would be ready when the stock market opened the following monday they were we rebuilt the business he said it grew 22 by the end of 2001 but paradoxically with this demonstration of the strength of corporate culture also came a conviction that life was about more than shareholder meetings i changed because of the events of 9 11 he said i stopped being not instantly a type a personality my view and barbara s view is that there is more to life than pushing a pencil across a spreadsheet it s really about people ourselves our friends and our families

bragar eagel squire p c a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against medtronic plc medtronic or the company nyse mdt in the united states district court for the district of minnesota on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired medtronic securities between june 8 2019 and may 25 2022 both dates inclusive the class period investors have until november 7 2022 to apply to the court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit click here to participate in the action medtronic is a medical device company among its products is the minimed insulin pump system for the treatment of diabetes the systems include the minimed 600 series models and the minimed 780g model medtronic is currently seeking regulatory approval for the minimed 780g model which uses an advanced hybrid closed loop system during the class period medtronic repeatedly assured investors that the minimed 780g model was on track for approval by the u s food and drug administration fda and would provide medtronic with the edge it needed to close a growing gap with its competitors in the diabetes market medtronic made these representations despite known issues with the minimed 600 series models indeed in november 2019 the company issued a warning that certain minimed 600 series insulin pumps might have damaged pump retainer rings which could cause the system to release too much insulin and instructed customers with damaged rings to contact the company for replacements on february 7 2020 the fda classified medtronic s november 2019 notification as a class i recall the most serious type of recall problems with the minimed 600 series mushroomed in october 2021 when the company expanded its recall to all minimed model 630g and 670g insulin pump systems whether or not any retainer ring damage was actually visible despite these serious issues with the 600 series medtronic assured investors that they expected the minimed 780g to drive growth consistent with these optimistic statements medtronic again assured investors that fda approval of the minimed 780g was imminent investors began to learn the truth about the company s minimed operations on december 15 2021 when medtronic revealed that it had received a warning letter from the fda regarding its northridge california facility the warning letter the warning letter followed an fda inspection relating to the company s minimed 600 series recall and focused on the inadequacy of specific medical device quality system requirements in the areas of risk assessment corrective and preventive action complaint handling device recalls and reporting of adverse events as a result of the warning letter including the resulting uncertainty about fda approval of the minimed 780g and other products in medtronic s diabetes operating unit the diabetes group medtronic lowered its guidance for its diabetes group now projecting that diabetes group product revenues would decline in the mid single digit range for fiscal year 2022 on this news the price of medtronic common stock declined 6 75 per share or approximately 6 from a close of 111 69 per share on december 14 2021 to close at 104 94 per share on december 15 2021 the financial fallout from the fda s findings continued to surface on may 26 2022 when medtronic reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022 and provided guidance for fiscal year 2023 notably medtronic disclosed that as a result of the company s need to improve its quality control system and its expectation that the minimed 780g model which defendants had repeatedly identified as crucial to future growth would not be approved in 2023 the company expected revenues from its diabetes group to decline between 6 and 7 in fiscal year 2023 on this news the price of medtronic common stock fell 6 10 per share or nearly 6 from a close of 105 54 per share on may 25 2022 to close at 99 44 per share on may 26 2022 throughout the class period defendants made materially false and or misleading statements as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the company s business and operations by failing to disclose that 1 medtronic s product quality control systems were inadequate 2 medtronic had failed to comply with numerous regulations regarding risk assessment corrective and preventive action complaint handling device recalls and reporting of adverse events 3 these failures increased the risk of regulatory investigation and action 4 as a result of the company s misconduct the fda would delay the approval of additional medtronic minimed devices including the minimed 780g 5 these delays in product approvals as well as the company s need to improve its quality control systems would negatively affect medtronic s financial performance and cause it to fall further behind its competitors and 6 as a result of the foregoing defendants statements about the company s business operations and prospects lacked a reasonable basis if you purchased or otherwise acquired medtronic shares and suffered a loss are a long term stockholder have information would

menafn jordan times newark delaware the late nobel laureate chemist richard smalley was once asked to rank global challenges in order of urgency while citing the usual concerns about poverty hunger conflict and resource access he put energy security at the top of his list smalley argued that all other challenges have the potential to be resolved if we can ensure reliable energy supplies today with even g 7 countries experiencing the cascading effects of energy insecurity on their economies and democratic institutions the world is learning the hard way that smalley was right we have limited means of international governance or science based decision making regarding energy security let us hope therefore that the rude awakening provided by the current global economic crisis and the war in ukraine will lead to more constructive international action and sensible domestic energy policies one indication that it will came on july 6 when the european parliament voted to continue classifying nuclear energy and natural gas as environmentally sustainable economic activities under the european union s taxonomy regulations the measure passed by a narrow margin of 328 votes to 278 with 33 abstentions but the fact that such a vote was even called and better still that common sense prevailed represents a tectonic shift for europe s environmental agenda the eu s energy policy exemplifies what geographers call the social amplification of risk perhaps most notably germany s decision to phase out domestic nuclear power following the 2011 fukushima accident in japan ran contrary to the findings of a united nations expert panel which has not detected any causal cancer clusters linked to the incident even after ten years of detailed data recording japan itself has acted more sensibly keeping nuclear power online for baseload power generation both within the g 7 and elsewhere misapplication of the precautionary principle by forces at both ends of the political spectrum too often trumps the sensible use of science in decision making even right wing european politicians are gravitating toward environmental populism as serbia s cancellation earlier this year of a lithium mining project demonstrated the serbian government s decision will adversely affect the prospects for renewable energy because lithium ion batteries are essential for battery storage in smart grids and related green infrastructure in the united states meanwhile despite the litany of executive orders on critical minerals many projects remain beset by environmental conflicts even the recently passed inflation reduction act will face barriers to implementation as environmental groups are already geared up to oppose its mining provisions much of the current battle over climate change reflects a fundamental clash in people s understanding of the relationship between nature and social and political order while scientists have rightly lamented the fossil fuel industry s merchants of doubt a utopian view of linear solutions in energy delivery also has contributed to our current impasse well intentioned activists like greta thunberg have done a great job raising environmental awareness but less so when it comes to promoting environmental literacy consider the need for baseload power for energy delivery many critics of fossil fuel subsidies pay scant attention to the fact that only nuclear energy and fossil fuels have the capacity to provide significant power in the absence of massive battery farms for solar and wind or pumped hydropower storage infrastructure environmentalists will need to make concessions to permit the extraction of critical metals for this infrastructure recycling itself entails energy demand and shifting to a circular economy requires us initially to have a large enough stock of material to recycle this in turn implies the challenge of making products that are more easily recycled we need to calculate the trade off between durability recyclability and innovation for new technologies to figure out the optimal timing for what economists call planned obsolescence given the wide range of technical issues and the persistent tensions with china and russia g 7 countries will need to emphasize coordination of energy policy the g 7 should first establish a science panel focused on energy security to guide investment in a diversified range of sources the panel s output should be predicated solely on scientific and engineering constraints rather than on domestic political considerations national legislation including eminent domain regulations also may be needed to implement the panel s recommendations the 2023 g 7 summit in japan a country that has shown remarkable pragmatism in securing and diversifying its energy is less than a year away a working group to develop such a panel should get down to business right away solutions regarding both climate change mitigation and energy security should now be framed by long term contingency planning for a diversified energy mix that is congruent with fundamental laws of nature not political expedience the no free lunch cliché is abundantly true when it comes to meeting energy demand existing mechanisms such as the energy charter treaty the international energy agency or the international renewable energy agency lack the requisite mandate and have many members that benefit from the status quo the g 7 by contrast has the potential to set standards that not only ensure energy security for the world s major advanced economies but also create a feasible science based model

sharing news on social media makes us think we know more than we do sharing news on social media makes us think we know more than we do sharing news on social media makes us think we know more than we do 11 september 2022 08 30 am islamabad online sharing is not a new concept humans live in social groups and thrive on social interaction this forms part of human nature yet ocial media have transformed the way we understand the world around us by changing the way we access share understand and misunderstand information dr adrian ward assistant professor of marketing at the university of texas told medical news today an estimated 70 of north americans use social media to connect with each other and share information in the age of social media with constant access to more information from a wider range and variety of sources why do people share and how does it affect them our relationship with social media according to a study conducted by a customer insight group for the new york times sharing online helps people feel more involved in the world the study of 2 500 users showed that 49 of participants aimed to change the opinions of others or encourage action with 68 aiming to give people a better sense of who they are and what they care about how does people s sharing impact what they know or what they think they know this has been the focus of recent research by prof susan m broniarczyk professor of marketing and dr adrian ward both at mccombs school of business university of texas our research shows that this new information sharing environment may also be transforming the way we understand ourselves when we share information on social media we aren t just sharing news we are also sharing an image of who we are and what we know our research shows that the signals our behavior sends to others can influence the way we see ourselves we begin to see ourselves as we believe we are seen by others dr adrian ward the new research which appears in the journal of consumer psychologytrusted source found that simply sharing information gives people confidence making them feel more knowledgeable about the information shared even if they have only read the headline the impact of sharing without reading in a number of studies scientists investigated the impact of sharing without reading and its effect on subjective knowledge meaning what people think they know and objective knowledge what people actually know in early studies participants listed articles they had shared on facebook and how much of each article they had read before sharing only 28 of participants described reading the full article before sharing and 25 admitted to only having read a couple of lines or none at all another early study by the same researchers found that people associated social media sharing with knowledge and felt that sharing made them look more knowledgeable to understand how sharing affects a person s subjective and objective knowledge the researchers gave a group of students the opportunity to read and share a range of news articles the students then had to rate their subjective knowledge of each article before completing three multiple choice questions that assessed their objective knowledge finally the researchers asked the participants if they had read the article or not the researchers found that sharing was linked to a higher level of subjective knowledge even if students had not read the article how subjective knowledge affects decision making in a final study 300 participants were asked to read an article about investing for beginners before being assigned to either share it on their personal facebook profile or not next the researchers gave them a retirement planning exercise where after receiving personal investment portfolio recommendations they were asked to allocate 10 000 into stocks and or bonds people who shared opted for investments associated with greater risk suggesting that sharing not only affects what people think they know but also how they may act speaking to mnt dr dam hee kim assistant professor of communication at the university of arizona who was not involved in the study commented that the increased desire to take risks in the financial exercise is concerning considering that they think they are knowledgeable after news sharing but actually are not knowledgeable in the end riskier investments may do more harm to the sharers said dr kim sharing with friends also showed an increase in subjective knowledge when compared to sharing with strangers and interestingly where participants were forced to share there was no increase in subjective knowledge mental health and sharing on social media social media is a powerful tool for making people feel more knowledgeable and may have benefits for people s mental health eeling smart can improve self esteem commented dr ward indeed studies have shown that news sharing can lead to social learning and political engagement encouraging people to take more active roles in their communities dr kim agreed that sharing may be beneficial explaining that sharers can feel empowered as aware and involved members of a community or even opinion leaders in a way news sharers are learning to become good active members of a community she noted however dr ward cautioned that there may also be negative consequences eople s inflated sense of personal knowledge could lead to interpersonal conflict if people on both sides of controversial issues are highly confident in their views but lack deep understanding of the issues it may be even more difficult to find common ground he pointed out sharing and fake news in the community the findings may raise concern sharing articles that have not been read may encourage the spread of fake news and misinformation given that news sharers gain subjective not necessarily objective knowledge and these people are likely to further share news it is possible that they contribute to the spread of false or misleading information said dr kim dr ward echoed these thoughts explaining f people do not read what they share they may be more likely to share fake news without even realizing it eople feel more knowledgeable about what they share sharing news on social media may cause people to become more entrenched in their views even if these views are primarily supported by fake news or misinformation when we feel like we already know about a topic we are less likely to try to learn or read more about the topic so people who share fake news may be less likely to encounter new information that challenges their existing beliefs prof broniarczyk agrees if people feel more knowledgeable on a topic they also feel they maybe don t need to read or learn additional information on that topic

sweet salty bitter sour we ve likely tasted thousands of unique dishes and ingredients so is it really true that our tongue perceives just these four distinct tastes click start to play today s spell it and find the flavour or what americans call flavor you love best don t forget to visit gulf news food section for everything to do with your tastebuds find recipes guides features and more western scientists today are discovering that the concept of a four taste representation of our tongue is severely oversimplified and omits some truly important flavour sensations for instance savoury perception or what the japanese first coined as umami is now widely recognised as the fifth basic taste and there may be as many as 10 or 20 others competing to be part of this exclusive list one taste that could be accepted soon is fattiness according to a december 2011 study by the germany based institute for quality and efficiency in health care there s still a lot of debate about this flavour sensation though as researchers are having trouble pinning down whether we can truly taste fat or merely sense its unique texture according to the study our tongue is so sensitive to its presence that the levels of fat in our blood increase even if we spit out any fat we put in our mouth and don t swallow it another top contender is piquancy which fans of spicy food know well some asian cultures even consider this to be a basic taste although food scientists have not classified it as such just yet the reason they re hesitant to do so is because certain piquant compounds like capsaicin which you can find in peppers directly activate our tongue s touch receptors rather than tastebuds a third distinct taste that you ve probably experienced has to do with calcium this element is vital for our bodies in muscle contraction cellular communication and bone growth researchers have already found that mice have two taste receptors for calcium and one of them has been found on the human tongue there s still much to learn about this potential taste although it s clear that it does have a unique chalky bitter sort of presence it s probably why calcium rich spinach is not very popular the calcium in milk and other dairy products on the other hand binds to the fat so we don t taste the mineral flavour all that much

what are the odds that the same man on sept 11 would narrowly miss being in the south tower of the world trade center and flight 93 the plane that went down in shanksville pennsylvania and what are the odds the man writing about the life lessons of 9 11 would have grown up next door to a woman who was also writing about the life lessons of 9 11 fate destiny karma such words come naturally in the context of an existential crisis like 9 11 what does it all mean why do some people live and others die how do we face death and how do we make the most of life those are questions that barbara becker author of heartwood the art of living with the end in mind flatiron books macmillan and ed zier author of undaunted leadership amid growth adversity koehler books believe we should be thinking about good times or bad more thanks to donor 9 11 ferry captain has years to live both of our books are about what we did in this experience of 9 11 said becker now a manhattan resident who grew up next door to zier in franklin lakes the two had been good friends since the 1970s in fact she met her husband david through zier s family neither had any idea until after the fact each was writing a book about a similar subject coincidence maybe there s something more to life than meets the eye said zier who now lives in naples florida both books part memoir and part meditation are about the ways 9 11 impacted the authors and changed the trajectory of their lives the repercussions in both cases were enormous ministers and volunteers becker became an interfaith minister and a disaster chaplain who ministers to people in extreme situations she is also a hospice volunteer who has worked extensively with families of the dying she has been she estimates at the deathbeds of close to 1 000 people zier who began gamely building back his company on sept 12 2001 the day after 166 of his colleagues barely made it out of the doomed south tower and four lost their lives eventually walked away from the corporate world and began a private consulting practice less money but he discovered that perhaps money wasn t so important after all he also began volunteering to teach english to esl students i could see my daughter in plays if i had to he said i could go on field trips with her that wouldn t have been possible in the corporate world i do credit 9 11 for giving me that point of view both authors like many of us have vivid memories of that day in 2001 becker a lower east side resident in new york city was taking her 1 year old son evan to day care in a stroller at 8 46 a m when the first plane hit the north tower they were three blocks away we were close enough to see people jumping she said in that first moment of confusion some people were actually underreacting accident small plane don t panic but becker was then working for the center for reproductive rights on wall street she knew about terrorism and she knew that abortion clinic bombings often happen in twos they ll place a bomb it goes off then they wait until the first responders are in sight to launch a second attack she didn t wait to see what would happen next i turned the stroller around and ran back to my neighborhood she said she remembers vividly her son pointing at the sky and saying fire he would end up repeating that over and over for the next three months she said dodging a bullet at precisely the same moment zier s colleagues were on floors 77 and 78 of the south tower their software company baseline financial services founded in 1981 had just moved into the towers two years before under ordinary circumstances zier would have been there too but it happened that a meeting he was expected to attend on the west coast had been suddenly rescheduled for sept 12 he now had to get to san francisco by sept 11 the usual 500 ticket would because of the last minute booking cost him 2 000 too pricey he felt so he declined thus he may have narrowly missed being booked on united 93 one of three flights leaving newark for san francisco that morning odds were one in three he would have been booked on it it was an instant oh my goodness when i heard he said more montclair artist s sculptures at world trade center are among first since 9 11 more watch deputy fire chief in shanksville talks about responding on 9 11 but he barely had time to process his own close call i was already overwhelmed at 3 p m he said i didn t know who was alive then phone service was so poor i had to find a way to tell thousands of customers we potentially didn t exist anymore i had to start figuring out what funerals i would be attending obviously it was the most surreal moment of my life and it changed me greatly i had already been through hugging my wife going to school to tell my daughters i was alive my parents came to my house to hug me as tight as anyone ever hugged me in my life the search for answers that day was a turning point for zier as it was for becker for her 9 11 was the beginning of a spiritual quest she had barely begun to process that trauma when in 2010 her close friend marisa palladino died of cancer i loved this woman so much she said when i was told she had a year left to live i went into an existential crisis i began reading everything i could about death i discovered thinkers and sages from thoreau to marcus aurelius to the dalai lama all implored us to live with the end ever present in our lives she studied with zen monks she attended ceremonies with lakota elders in south dakota she talked with a young girl whose father and three brothers were killed before her eyes during the rwandan genocide she dealt with the death of her own parents in 2017 she became a minister her book is an account of her journey and the lessons she learned from it i decided to take on death as a teacher rather than run away from this conversation we re afraid to have in this culture about ourselves our own deaths and the deaths of loved ones she said her key takeaway confronting death honestly and having it present in our lives makes us stronger people that s the meaning of her title heartwood heartwood is the inner pillar of trees she said it is prized by woodworkers for being the strongest most stable part of the tree but what s surprising is that heartwood is no longer living it s inert trees grow around it they need the strength of the heartwood to expand with those we ve loved and lost they re a lot like the trees they form our heartwood our enduring strength all for one for his part zier was learning another valuable lesson from 9 11 about solidarity teamwork the people that survived that day were incredibly undaunted and unwavering in getting out of the building he said the second plane hit the south tower at 9 03 a m the crash destroyed floors 84 down to 78 which is to say the topmost of the two floors where baseline financial services was located the four blessed souls on 78 were killed instantly zier said luckily by that time most of the folks on floor 77 were already on their way downstairs they had disobeyed instructions they d been told to sit tight it would be more dangerous to go down to a street crowded with first responders but even before the second plane hit the staff had reached their own conclusions we had a young man from northern ireland who was used to bomb threats zier said he said to his colleagues i ve had experience with this i m getting out of here and so they all did and so incredibly did the 12 people who were still left on the 77th floor after the second plane hit they banded together somehow it was one for all and all for one zier said they examined the staircases they all looked bad so they rolled the dice and chose the one that was the least smoky and all of our individuals rallied around a colleague who was pregnant they moved at her pace which is absolutely amazing smelling the flowers credit the much maligned corporate culture of america which has its upside in an emergency i tie the corporate culture that was very family and team oriented with their determining to go together zier said it was that same team spirit that caused a skeleton crew of 15 staffers to meet in a philadelphia satellite office the next day a day when america was still in shock and determine that come hell or high water baseline would be ready when the stock market opened the following monday they were we rebuilt the business he said it grew 22 by the end of 2001 but paradoxically with this demonstration of the strength of corporate culture also came a conviction that life was about more than shareholder meetings i changed because of the events of 9 11 he said i stopped being not instantly a type a personality my view and barbara s view is that there is more to life than pushing a pencil across a spreadsheet it s really about people ourselves our friends and our families

introduction the 2020 election was put off till october because of covid it is likely jacinda will serve a full term just to avoid the opposition and zb fuelling a sense of panic by framing it as an early election so after some of the most unprecedented events in our collective history we have 13 months till the 2023 election and tdb gives the election battlefield the full 360 degree analysis remember if you see the importance of our blogging journalism please note we don t get any money from nz on air and your donations are welcome below nz on air can shit gold bullion down the throats of the spinoff stuff and rnz because they are woke middle class approved media it s identity politics conclave sanctioned performance art masquerading as journalism like being stuck at a dinner party between toby manhire morgan godfery and alison mau arguing over who hates heteronormative white cis males most if you want professional managerial class virtue signals the spinoff rnz and stuff await your visit don t let the blog hit you in the arse on your way out while you re here though how good has ben morgan s analysis of the ukrainian war been on tdb fucking amazing right tdb recommends newzengine com i mean apart from the cutting and brilliant political commentary alongside the number 1 political podcast in the country and some of the best class left pundits this nation has to offer put that and the fact we aren t the dreary standard or craven chinese apologists like the quisling socialist equality group aside how good has our coverage of the ukrainian war been i predicted putin would invade the ukraine and we ve followed that insight up with ben morgan s extraordinary coverage that has been 24 hours ahead of the cia and mi6 tdbs coverage has even been ahead of the blog no one reads crabby old gordon campbell the blog where lyndon hood was last funny in 2019 i say extraordinary coverage of the ukrainian conflict while acknowledging that the a view from afar podcast by comrades selwyn manning and dr paul buchanan that plays here on tdb thursdays are the masters of nz international commentary all power to their arm why the fuck isn t nz on air sponsoring that amazing show rather than another batch for duncan grieve over at the spinoff put our coverage of the ukrainian war up against the domestic coverage by nz herald stuff nzme or newshub and we have been fucking light years ahead of them oh by the way the working group on monday will have in studio meta economist bernard hickey and jack tame yes that jack tame yes the one from q a how did we get him as a panelist on the working group because we are the coolest weekly political podcast in the country that s how here s the political analysis for the 2023 election warning if this introduction has triggered you in anyway you ll probably need your emotional support peacock for the rest of it political parties labour labour have failed utterly to be transformative in any true sense of the word the total focus of this government has been in trying to save the country from a once in a century pandemic their extraordinary management of covid saved 5000 lives in a country as small as nz 5000 extra deaths over the 2000 we ve already lost would have caused a shockwave throughout our communities a tidal wave of grief we d struggle to overcome emotionally and economically from sure pumping billions into the banks for property speculators to make money from our collective suffering is disgusting and represented the largest transfer of wealth to the richest ever seen in nz but labour saved our lives and deserve another gratitude vote yes there were fuck ups in the covid management and trevor mallard managed to radicalise 5000 stormtroopers for qanon yes there are more kids living in cars than when labour first won in 2017 sure there are now 27 000 on emergency wait lists and a million dollars a day spent on kettling beneficiaries into dangerous motels sure to all those things but labour tribalism is such that any of those criticisms are ignored to get an idea of how off the fucking plant labourites are now check out facebook journalist and labour apologist gerard otto whose torturous allegations against the mainstream media conspiracy to frame jacinda while polls are being conducted is so far from reality it may as well be qanon rantings yet he is utterly believed by the labour faithful labour are now dominated by the professional managerial class and public service wokeness but they are good for 35 on election day so the same nothingness and meaningless trite bullshit passed off as social policy won t be challenged in any sense which is why the collective dynamic of the greens and māori party will be forced to negotiate a far more progressive policy platform than cautious jacinda and grant will attempt the latest umr internal polling released to the caucus over the weekend has national on 37 labour on 35 greens and act about 10 each and the māori party being the queenmaker the only hope for transformative change from labour will be what the greens and māori party are able to hardball them into labour are good for 30 35 on election day national the last two polls should worry national roy morgan had tham at 35 5 while taxpayer s union curia poll had them at 34 these are both down from the highs luxon s honeymoon had projected the into of 40 and 39 it follows after luxon s te puke via hawaii blunder and his constant u turns where he gets caught out on detail that underpins his justifications for change his desire to punish teenage beneficiaries misread the middle and his flakiness under the high ball always underwhelms luxon believes in evangelical prosperity theory meaning his 7 properties are proof positive jesus loves him this false certainty of knowing he is blessed is what national are selling a frightened electorate his self certainty not the numerous counter productive policy positions national keeps taking because luxon is only interested in the first class customers those who can t fly are bottom feeders he s too intellectually vain to bother with policy and prefers management and in christopher s world the little people do the policy stuff this is dangerous because david seymour desperately wants a life beyond politics so will pass radical policy so he can hand on hart tell free market satan he did all he could to mutilate the state before leaving act i think jacinda will smash luxon during the campaign despite some of the worst media and press they ve received since coming to power alongside extreme economic problems looming labour are still solid mid 30s that s extraordinary i think national s ceiling is 35 their challenge is to stop act being in double figures while trying to win the middle something they are finding very difficult to achieve worst case scenario for national is an act at 15 that leaves national in the very low 30s i think david seymour will be dazzling on the campaign trail despite his race war inducing conflict politics the rapid polarisation of nz politics means there isn t much middle left for national to hollow out with empty words and false promises a truth labour are finding out right now national and act won t be able to get to 51 on their own they will need nz first getting over 5 or the top leader winning ilam and bringing in a few mps off the coat tailing remember luxon was elected not because he was the best candidate but because judith collins hate club pack voted against simon bridges that is becoming clearly apparent now luxon will be removed as leader if national doesn t win the next election national are good for 30 35 on election day act as the daily blog has been pointing out since the election the extreme hard right policy of act is simply not appreciated by the majority of kiwis but it s there oh sweet jesus is it there that s just the start cut and freeze the minimum wage interest back on all student loans no kiwsaver subsidy cancel winter energy payment dump all climate crisis legislation no more best start payments for families with new borns cut welfare payments no tax credits for research and development cuts to working for families 7b a year cut in public services abolish maori seats oh and ankle bracelets on children don t forget that this is romper stomper hard right insanity that makes qanon look reasonable and because there is no way national can win without act every vote to national empowers act david seymour is a very funny very clever very talented politician who desperately wants what the humans call l o v e he doesn t want to be in parliament for one second longer than he has to he wants to get out of politics and get paid enormous money in the corporate world and maybe find in laws he can disappoint in short david feels honour bound to mutilate the state so that it s too wounded to ever grow back it s called the milton friedman prune david is a man in a hurry to try and get a life before politics robs him of one so when he puts out these blistering policy directions that would cause enormous damage and carnage to the social infrastructure that so many people desperately require every day to survive you best fucking believe he would do it in the blink of a sociopath s eye act are good for 10 15 on plus 1 electorate on election day greens as the weeping wound of social policy failure the rotorua golden mile tragedy represents continues to unfold there will be cabinet voices asking the bleeding obvious when do we throw minister marama davidson under the bus labour s capitulation to professional managerial class corporate cheerleader neale jones has meant nothing meaningful has occurred on housing and this was always the danger of marama taking the vacant baubles of office there was never a meaningful plan to change and all the failure can be dumped on her as the minister for homelessness with more people living in cars than in 2017 with more people on emergency housing wait lists and a million paid a day to a motel industry monetising misery while state housing builds remain anaemic all marama has to show is some virtue signalling of chocolate wrappers in māori if labour won t throw marama under the bus national and act will certainly push her in front of one the juxtaposition of marama virtue signalling while people in poverty go backwards distills all the elitist middle class pandering into an easy to generate meme that fuels resentment meanwhile james shaw was re elected co leader of the greens with no fanfare whatsoever which begs the question if james wins the co leadership and no one notices did it really ever truly happen james shaw re elected green co leader six weeks after ouster he says blah blah blah blah blah blah something something gonna try real hard to get more green mps around the cabinet table but we don t have no power blah blah blah so he s complaining about being tricked by the labour party that s his actual argument he is explaining why they are getting nothing done because labour didn t really need them which was always the reason they shouldn t have agreed in the first place if you are dumb enough to get tricked by the labour party aren t you too stupid for politics so what the hell was that phantom coup all about then you just can t trust a bunch of fucking greenies to ever carry off a political coup successfully they always get squeamish about the blood as we enter election year the greens are about to be blamed for all of labour s failures to be transformative on housing inequality and the environment this is why the greens shouldn t have accepted the deal labour offered it set them up for failure the greens can t preach of better times ahead next year if their time at the helm saw things get worse for people there is a total disconnect between what the greens are celebrating in homelessness and what the minister spends her time promoting on social media and the total social policy failure that is happening on rotorua s golden mile the greens are great at alienating voters canceling people for crimes against woke dogma and a love for bikes that borders on sexual fetish not good for much else unfortunately i think the greens will be lucky to get 7 on election night which would be fortunate for them because their record in office deserves less greens are worth 7 10 on election day plus 1 electorate māori party with adrian rurawhe under pressure to accept the speaker s expectation to stand down from their electorate te tai hauāuru opens as a real possible gain for the maori party this on top of their incredible party vote which hit 5 in the roy morgan poll suggests a massive political change is occurring within māoridom part of this is demographics māori are a decade younger than pakeha part of it is the reconnection with civics the vaccination drive provided and part is the grotesque racism spewed out over co governance and 3 waters māori represent the highest proportion of non voters and the race baiting rhetoric is dragging those non voters over to being engaged something we haven t seen in the past if the māori party can hold up their party vote they will become the queen maker and the relationship between māori party president jt and willie jackson will become the most important one politically māori party are worth 3 5 plus 2 electorate seats on election day new zealand first winston has done a deal with the necromancer the necromancer is a dirty politics operative who can t be named but their foul stench surrounds a people e initiated referendum that is being planned to coincide with the election next year against co governance winston intends to ride the race baiting against co governance and 3 waters all the way back over the 5 threshold this is currently act party territory and winston and the necromancer intend to rob their vote the only way act can fend winston s push to take some of their 10 support is by ruling winston out of power altogether nz first are worth 3 5 on election day tamaki s qgod antivax umbrella the good news is that brian s current umbrella of sue grey s antivaxxers and his destiny church qgod squad aren t nearly enough to get over 5 however if they added matt king s vanity project and the anti abortion new conservatives that cavalcade of political circus freaks could get over 5 thankfully they are all toxic narcissists who couldn t work together if their lives depended upon it if they do though don t underestimate how many feral qanon antivaxers who have been brainwashed by social media hate algorithms there really are out there tamaki s qgod antivax umbrella are worth 2 5 on election day top the opportunities party leader raf manji has a chance of winning ilam now gerry brownlee has stood down sarah pallett won the seat in 2020 during labour s red wave but manji was competitive against gerry back in 2017 if manji can steal the seat off pallett and against a weak national newbie top could enter parliament and bring in 2 mps off the party list top are talking about housing and the political tax impasses that prevent housing from being built if they can convince the public that he can win in ilam then a vote for top isn t wasted if national were smart they would consider talking to top and offering them an epsom deal in ilam top are worth 1 electorate plus 2 mps coat tailing off mmp list hamilton west the sharma drama ends with karma nirvana as the good dr is banished to sit with trev the right will continue to hail him as a hero while the left will utterly ignore him the danger is that his narrative of bullying and victimisation that sounds so self interested to our ears will find deep resonance amongst a migrant community who in hamilton west feel his narrative as racism everyday the right will hand sharma questions during election year and he will lob grenades under the protection of parliamentary privilege i also think he will find a local electorate drawn from both sides of the idealogical divide that could win him an independent seat in 2023 many are writing him off but i think he s more popular in his electorate than most suspect sharma is worth one electorate seat issues professional managerial class woke culture war free speech the professional managerial class is an issue tdb has focused on we ve argued that middle class virtue signalling dogma has over run the activist base of the left and while the woke fight over pronouns and the militant pronunciation of te reo the voters trying to pay their bills weekly are disillusioned and alienated from our cause this same professional managerial class are over represented in the wellington twitteratti and the nexus of hashtag activism and elite radio nz smugness that allows for neale jones to exist we ve seen how the wellington middle class marxists panicked and wanted an immediate police state to deal with the protestors middle class fear has always driven social policy so it s no surprise the vast amounts of money now being sunk into the domestic intelligence apparatus if a middle class person is threatened on social media western civilisation has ended my feeling is that the political polarisation we are leading into will be so extreme that it just won t matter how alienating the woke get because people will have already fixed their identity flags to their flag poles the danger of woke over reach occurs when the woke get frightened whenever the middle classes are frightened politics jumps that fear was evident in the fire and fury middle class docudrama and it s evident when they come across it on social media it s middle class fear of crime that drives punitive get tough on crime rhetoric and politics similarly it s their middle class woke dogma that is triggering a desire to criminalise free speech the woke are frustrated that the hate laws failed after both the minister and prime minister couldn t even explain what would get people arrested so the energies have gone into the secretive national centre of research excellence for preventing and countering violent extremism who will tell the intelligence agencies who the eye of mordor should be turned on rather than risk political backlash by passing an actual law woke academia have simply partnered up with the domestic intelligence and security services to help them target the new enemies with our failure to de escalate the dumb lives matter protest we have radicalised an entire army against us and now desperately need to ascertain who is violent and who is not in a social media landscape driven by hate algorithms and desperate loneliness we are feeding the whirlpool into a maelstrom the only winners are the security apparatus budgets the economy stupid no amount off ticker tape tantrums can sway fed chair powell any longer the reality of unwinding 25trillion in quantitive easing is upon us and powell has to keep pushing the stake into the heart of these global zombie corporations because there is nothing else left in this late stage capitalism meltdown all that debt all that speculative bubble in property and stocks all of it is about to get hit be demand side and supply side destruction if the fed comes out with 100 point raises rise the pressure will be on orr to follow with 75 points what treasury are wanting to claim is inflation is dropping because demand is dropping but this is a supply chain and scarcity problem as well as consumers retreat the natural scarcity of products also compounds issues by driving prices up even as people can t afford them the super rich and super wealthy will benefit middle classes and below however will suffer with supply chains broken with geopolitical tensions bringing supply chains back to friendly territories and the inflationary pressures of bringing those supply chains home the day of reckoning here suggests a spectacular 1929 stock market crash nz house prices are predicted to drop 21 inflation could hit double digits in december and orr has no choice but to ramp up interest rates there is a crunch point coming and the worst has not hit business nz vs unions the big political fight before the election will be between the unions and business nz fair pay agreements would allow a vast new unionisation agenda to sweep nz and seeing as nzs economy is based on stealing indigenous land and never paying it back alongside a low wage economy that exploits migrant labour business nz don t want any fair pay agreement process the other fight will be the unions trying to push their gold plated unemployment tax for public servants to tag in a 6 month holiday or extra maternity leave if the unions lose both these fights the question must be asked why are they even there housing welfare inequality i am deeply deeply deeply skeptical about removing the children s commissioner oversight from oranga tamariki and replacing that oversight with 6 faceless bureaucrats sitting inside the education review office the new commission will continue to promote and advance the interests and well being of children and young people but its role is weaker in particular unlike the current children s commissioner it will not be able to advise on establishing complaints mechanisms for children or monitor the types of complaints made stripping the new commission of any powers to deal with complaints has a much wider impact on the application of children s rights in aotearoa new zealand if the new commission is not able to advise the multitude of organisations that work with children and young people about how to make a complaint this will significantly limit the extent to which the government can be held accountable for any failure to protect children s rights overall labour are doing this because critics claim carmel sepuloni is totally captured by her ministry and has been ever since they arrested her mother for a show trial over welfare fraud labour are doing what the wellington bureaucracy wants because the sins of their past have been highlighted by the royal commission into historic abuse by the state and they all want to make sure none of them get held accountable in the future the state has used despicable tactics to hide the abuse in their care and have been instrumental in removing oversight so that they can t be held accountable for a broken and failing model remember oranga tamariki is a neoliberal experiment in welfare it uses big data to justify uplifting children immediately to save money in downstream justice crime and health costs oranga tamariki has always been about saving the state s wallet it isn t about the welfare of the child who is viewed as a client to make the cost savings ot had to weaponise uplifts streamline 0800 numbers to immediate action teams and change the law over parental power to stop the state seizing your child the supposed counter weight to such enormous powers was the children s commissioner being temporarily appointed as an oversight while they weren t funded to investigate problems that s why cases were handed over to the ombudsman the children s commissioner could give vital voice to the damage oranga tamariki was causing this matters because when aloha luxon isn t holidaying in hawaii while pretending to care about the cost of living crisis he s endlessly preaching that he will implement bill english s social investment model and what is that why that s oranga tamariki that s the investment model use funds based on how much this client costs the country in the future bring forward some of that money spend it now with immediate interventions and hey presto save money downstream seeing as aloha luxon spent his time in the uk with right wing think tanks who spin this very type of right wing welfare experiment it is very clear that if national get into power more welfare experimentation will very much be on the agenda and the wellington bureaucracy will not want to be held accountable for that the rotorua golden mile expose on tvnz sunday shows that housing the homeless is a cruel joke national are promising to cut the disabled off welfare despite labour being caught doing that 4000 times already and act are demanding children are in ankle bracelets there are more people homeless there are more people living in cars fewer people are owning houses and there are 27 000 on waiting lists if you are poor in this country you are fucked regardless of which party takes power co governance cross burning vs labour māori caucus the naked hypocrisy of the right to twist one person one vote into a negative egalitarian garrotte around the throat of democracy while screaming we are saving democracy is performative art for fascists if labour require the maori party to form a government the personal relationship between willie and jt will become the lynchpin to it holding together jacinda needs to use waitangi day next year to spell out what co governance and 3 waters means in practise because her inability to do that has allowed the right to cast it as apartheid ethno nationalism when the naked truth is the vast number of people bitching about māori gaining local council representation couldn t actually name anyone on their council geopolitical shockwaves an economic depression generated by geopolitical friction beyond our control is going to swamp us with enormous social damage and political carnage russia and ukraine account for 15 of tradable calories the blockade on base line minerals food and resources will continue to damage with the possibility a desperate putin may even resort to nukes putin turning the gas off to europe will cause untold damage in winter and china s november conference demands from xi a gesture that could see china invade taiwanese island chains global droughts and extreme weather events keep throwing the agricultural calendars out and the possibility of mass famine throughout africa can t be ruled out in the middle east israel will continue to threaten an unprecedented military strike on iran if the iranian s successfully test a nuclear weapon covid still has the potential of coming back with vengeance political domestic terrorism i fear the combination of intense political polarisation a steep economic depression and the explosion of disinformation via social media hate algorithms could generate political violence in the 2023 election the immediate threat of political violence comes from the far right the qanon movement in nz is disconnected from this dimension of reality they believe in sovereign citizen sherifs who are empowered to hang enemies of free people they are fucking lunatics who are capable and philosophically compelled to commit an act of political violence add to them far right white supremacist bad faith actors and alt right extremists and you have radicalisation combining with fear grifters to generate a febrile landscape of existential fears that can only be combated by justified political violence out of this cauldron of self loathing and projected cultural hate is the possibility of a lone wolf actor or small cell group committing an attack on a politician climate crisis the climate crisis is happening far faster than feared world s oceans greenhouse gasses at highest levels in 800 000 years climate report warns alarming year for extremes 2021 saw record high greenhouse gas ocean heat and sea levels rise new report finds major sea level rise caused by melting of greenland ice cap is now inevitable the speed and extreme nature of the heatwaves and floods that are destroying the planet in real time are damaging the ability for the economy to function cars batteries solar panels food global shortages and soaring prices are almost certain as china s seemingly never ending heatwave sears on it s the most extreme heat event ever recorded in world history for more than 70 days the intense heat has blasted china s population factories and fields lakes and rivers have dried up crops have been killed factories have been closed more than 900 million people across 17 chinese provinces are subjected to record breaking conditions from sichuan in the southwest to shanghai in the east temperatures have been topping 40c and remember this only gets worse and worse and worse we aren t doing anything meaningful on climate change each country passes the buck to the next country and the future is actually far more dangerous than we are currently anticipating we re going to pay in a big way a shocking new book on the climate crisis in an inconvenient apocalypse authors wes jackson and robert jensen write that society needs to be better prepared for an inevitable collapse the scale of the geopolitical shockwaves coming our way will be enormous increasingly dysfunctional society and climate catastrophe leading humanity to cliff edge spiralling wealth inequality is leading to dysfunctional societies unable to cope with existential threats such as the climate crisis experts have warned a two year research project examining different future scenarios indicates that at present societies around the world are at growing risk of extreme political destabilisation with declines in public trust while the climate crisis intensifies i ve been following the ipcc reports on climate change from the beginning and the criticism made against the ipcc was that due to its strict need for only unilaterally agreed science to make the official report it was always underplaying the urgency and severity of the climate crisis there was always a section in each report where the science was presented that wasn t universally accepted but included to show the reach and scope of debate increasingly over the years the worst case scenarios in the ipcc are playing out in real time the scientists were wrong but only in their optimism you understand that each year that passes now will get worse or remain as starkly bad as they are now right you get that it doesn t go back to normal after this right the extreme weather will get worse and worse more extreme than these extremes now consider this baseline extreme normal now sure the war run ukraine is hurting food prices but that s damage on the baseline reality of a mega drought that has interrupted the agricultural calendar of major food producers the radical adaptation required to get us ready for what s coming will splinter the political spectrum whether we like it or not this summer we will face unprecedented forest fires and could see a repeat of our sky turning orange because of the australian bush fires if you think being carbon neutral by 2050 is the solution you are part of the problem overseas vote the miq over subscription by tens of thousands hints at the incandescent rage many of our diaspora felt trying to get back into their legal home country during the covid lockout there is no way their torture won t have political ramifications last election greens did poorly in their usually high overseas support vote because ardern s global stardom eclipsed the greens this election however the frustration is directly at jacinda s policies so i think the greens will take that vote back and then some our diaspora are furious and if the green party rhetoric is too moderate for their anger acts throw open the borders and let the freed market decide death policy is for you acts policy has the whiff of judgmental vengeance to it that is the perfect cocktail of payback people locked out of their own home want to inflict on those refusing to open the door my guess is that our diaspora are far more motivated to vote in 2023 than we have ever considered and their anger at being locked out will be sharp specials on the day i think you will have so many people voting who don t normally vote that the specials will be huge on the day this along with the unpredictable overseas vote this election could throw any election night result out the window when the specials and overseas votes are counted demographics higher participation rate this will be the first election in nz history where millennials and gen xers are a larger numerical voting block than boomers because lockdown impacted so many i think people who normally sit voting out will have a real passion to make their voice heard even if that voice is an anguished scream of fear and nonsense political polarisation because the political spectrum is so hung and the polarisation so extreme nothing is being collectively done to solve the myriad of problems we are facing post covid from crime to cost of living crisis to climate change to inequality and poverty no big ideas and no real solutions to the challenges we are collectively facing as new zealanders our focus is on hating the person who offended us on social media i just don t think we comprehend what a distortion of reality social media generates and the new subjective rage it manufactures we will end up with a result both sides will refuse to accept if they lose conclusion i think the mmp spectrum is about to shatter there is a chance for nzf tamaiki s qgod antivaxx fanatics a coat tailing top and even an independent all getting into parliament we have lived through a political period of time since mmp that has managed to dilute and temper the idealogical extremes of left right politics in nz the need to compromise and pull punches is fundamental to the mmp dynamic however that completely gets thrown out the window if there is no political centre left the political centre has been hollowed out so much under mmp that labour and national are almost indistinguishable in their acquiescence to neoliberal mantra the far left and far right have enormous pent up political tension that will rupture once labour or national are dependent on their numbers for a majority act s rise is fuelling a toxic polarisation of politics the true economic damage from russia for our collective defiance to putin s invasion of the ukraine has barely begun and china will feel obligated to ratchet up tension before the november conference add to this the evolving covid variant and extreme climate events and i think we can make the possible predictions this will be one of the highest turns outs because politics has impacted everyone regardless of who you vote for the polarisation will become obscene act will cannibalise national vote because luxon won t be able to be as openly race baiting as act will be the political spectrum will shatter and fracture with nz first and possibly some qanon anti vaxx anti abortion christian fringe both crossing 5 an act of political violence is possible because mmp has always brought in moderating forces 3rd parties the pent up political expression of the right and the left has been building for almost a quarter of a century and will finally be expressed next year and with the amplification of anger will result in an election that will see resentment whichever side wins when you dog whistle up the worst angels of our nature by manufacturing existential threats to democracy you generate a confrontation that you are ultimately responsible for i think the conflict policies of a national act government would be disastrous for this country for the right i don t believe for one second that the vast majority of kiwis have any true comprehension of just how hard right a national act government would truly be luxon can t even get his own tax policy straight and david seymour is already bullying him into backing down if it s a national act government it will be seymour calling the shots the quick yellow fox will jump all over the lazy blue log and david seymour will get all his crazy policy passed without luxon caring māori going to the waitangi tribunal over cancellation of 3 waters the moment the national act government scrap 3 waters māoridom will go straight back to the waitangi tribunal win the court case and force luxon into his own helen clark moment and be forced to pass law to simply confiscate the water this will cause an enormous eruption of violent protest

then so be it he doesn t care oh david seymour will hate it but he ll be so fat and full on his amputation of 6 state agencies that he ll only be able to mount a burp as a protest for the left the most important political lesson i ve ever learned in nz politics is from the laila harre school of change back when she was in alliance she had to force labour at gun point to agree to maternity leave can you remember and imagine that having to force labour to give maternity leave laila teaches us that if we ever want the fucking labour party to actually serve the people and not the vested interests of the professional managerial class then you need to smash labour s head against a wall pout a gun to their head and scream do it that s the only way labour will act in the interests of the people if you put a gun to their head there s no point raising benefits msd and winz and ird claw back not of that so the beneficiary is left with the empty promise of transformation a better way to avoid the state clawing back anything we give poor people is to fully fund universal services here s what a labour green maori party government should be committed to passing in the first 100 days of the 2023 election 1 feed every kid in nz a free nutritious and healthy breakfast and lunch at every school using local product and school gardens with parents paid to come in and help the slow incrementalism touted by favourite public sector for dragger apologist max rashbrooke isn t good enough because the lower middle classes are feeling the same pinch thanks to mortgage rises and universal school lunches and breakfasts would help them and reduce truancy as well 2 50 000 state homes council housing for life built using the best environmental and social architecture standards using the public works act to seize land golf courses and immediately start building satellite towns using upgraded public transport hubs plus renter rights rent freezes end accomodation payments long term tenancy arrangements 3 free public transport plus vast infrastructure upgrade for climate crisis 4 30 stake holder in a new government backed supermarket operation run to provide lower food prices for kiwism better prices for supplies and better conditions for workers 5 gst off fresh fruit and vegetables and essentials like tampons toilet paper condoms oral health plus a sugar tax 6 free

science if you can t have good public journalism the right wing media will destroy these other 9 advances 11 refund night schools one of the worst things key did when he entered office was destroy helen clark s night school budgets sure that italian cooking class wasn t generating chefs but the free night school classes allowed lonely disconnected people to have a social life it allowed schools to be used as community hubs and if well designed could become social health hubs and distribution points for community health outreach we urgently need our people to have places where they can mix and mingle and engage because isolation sends them down fucking rabbit holes 12 legal cannabis market to fund meth rehabilitation and create 5000 jobs and create quarter of a billion in revenue for the state plus remove cannabis crime from the courts and prison 13 focus on self sustainability and hyper regionalism over free market globalisation for climate crisis adaptation and community resilience kiwis have to see a progressive government actually doing shit in the first 100 days or they won t believe any change is coming and when you consider the economic maelstrom we are entering the most vulnerable amongst us will be screaming for real change if we on the left don t offer voters real solutions to their material problems and instead prefer to micro aggression police the latest middle class virtue signals of hate speech militant pronoun demands and screaming everyone is racist we are fucked politically in 2023 in previous elections political parties and movements have tried to win voters over in 2023 we won t be doing that in 2023 voters will already know who they hate and who they will vote for party s will be focused on speaking only to their tribe and making sure their tribe votes we will move away from broadchurch politics and focus only on pure temple if you don t believe everything we believe fuck off will become the mantra in 2023 shit is going to get ugly

as the microcredit sector becomes formalised and regulated by the bank of jamaica boj under the microcredit act 2021 access financial services limited and dolla financial services limited have hit the ground running to acquire competitors who are planning to exit the sector this comes amidst dolla s expression of interest to acquire full control of access dolla was listed on the junior market of the jamaica stock exchange jse on june 15 while access listed in october 2009 dolla s loan portfolio as at the end of june was 1 05 billion with 10 locations spread between jamaica and guyana while access has a portfolio of 4 65 billion spread between 19 locations in jamaica and the united states of america while dolla is currently benefiting from an initial five year tax holiday due to its listing access is faced with a 33 per cent income tax rate since becoming the first entity to receive a licence and be approved by the boj to operate as a microcredit institution however the boj has not objected to dolla s continued operations pending the processing of its application before the microcredit act the sector was not formally regulated which meant no entity had to report to the boj however every entity or firm in the microcredit space providing credit to individuals had to apply at the end of july for a licence with the boj or cease operations director neville james left speaks with group chief executive officer frederick williams while executive chairman marcus james looks on photo karl mclarty so i think any private discussions that may take place or are likely to take place i wouldn t comment because those decisions will be taken as a company and an entity those don t really relate to access overall so i wouldn t discuss those matters in an agm said founder and executive chairman of access marcus james who stumbled to respond at the company s annual general meeting last thursday at the courleigh hotel james said that the firm would be guided by the jse rules in response to takeover and merger queries discussions when asked if he s been approached by interested individuals to purchase his stake in springhill holdings limited which holds his direct 47 33 per cent stake in access james said i would not answer that question in this format i think that it is not a company related matter access financial head office on half way tree road st andrew this was james first physical appearance at an agm since the novel coronavirus pandemic with him residing currently in florida frederick williams was promoted to chief executive officer in june 2021 while james became executive chairman james was re elected by shareholders to the board as a director during resolutions james is currently in a marriage dissolution divorce lawsuit in the broward county circuit courts with his estranged wife julie thompson james who filed the suit on april 5 james adept property holdings llc is also listed on the suit thompson james also filed a freezing order and sought to ascertain his assets in an affidavit with the supreme court of jamaica on february 24 the couple got married in 2001 which was a year after the two brainstormed to create access when the jamaica observer checked an article of the law offices of johnny kousa law it stated that florida is an equitable distribution state where marital assets are divided equitably it said on the other hand marital property includes the assets and property acquired while the couple was married this is anything from homes vehicles jewellery art and other physical assets to income debt bank accounts retirement accounts stock and other non physical property access founder marcus james greets shareholder orette staple photo karl mclarty these cases tend to last 12 to 18 months in florida after the agm where williams and james were speaking with the media neville james director and father of marcus lambasted the media for its coverage of the dolla access matter he said i think the way the media has handled this is totally abominable you all claim to be journalists how many questions have you asked how many queries did you make you just accept people telling you nonsense and you write it the senior james has been mixing words with mayberry investments chairman on twitter in recent weeks neville owns 2 62 per cent of access mainly through generation 4 investment company ltd while marcus could acquire his father s stake and have a 50 05 per cent stake to trigger jse takeover rules it would also open it up to the divorce proceedings with thompson james thompson james was listed as a connected party in september 2019 with 263 000 shares in two accounts mairs there s always a plan for acquisition and i think we re the largest fisher dolla can always negotiate a deal with thompson james to buy her shares and could also target proven group limited s and qwi investments limited s respective 24 72 and 3 08 per cent stakes which could then be held through a special purpose vehicle they own more 50 01 per cent or more to gain control of access another option is to acquire more than 20 per cent of the shares and appoint a shareholder appointed director to the board to influence the direction of the company during the post briefing the chairman responded the fact is that at this time while an expression of interest was put forward no formal offer was put to us as a board that we could carry to our shareholders in addition to that only licensed financial institutions can takeover microfinance entities at this time given that access is the only licensed financial entity we wouldn t be able to entertain an offer even if it was made at this time said james to the sunday finance however the microcredit act only speaks to a licencee s intent to acquire amalgamate or transfer the business to another licencee after applying to the supervisor for approval the supervisor is the boj and its possible governor richard byles dolla financial led by kadeen mairs is in acquisition mode it has so far failed in a bid to acquire access financial services which has ignored a proposal from the recently listed microlender on mayberry investments limited s forum held last wednesday dolla ceo kadeen mairs discussed the company s ambitions to expand not just locally but internationally as well as in the region the company intends to fund this through a bond offer we got a no objection from the fsc and we re going ahead to do a private placement or exempt distribution so basically we re looking to raise 1 billion with the possibility to upsize to 1 5 billion it would be to refinance some existing debt that we have as well as look at existing opportunities for acquisitions and secondly organic growth mairs said in a confident voice mairs added so we re definitely looking at some countries right now that have serious potential and as soon as those become material then we ll definitely announce that as well we ve also engaged legal professionals to just let us know what the landscape is like legally with legislations for money lending what we do is look at countries that have a high growth rate serious potential williams explained at the access agm that the company would be opening a second location in the coming week for its embassy loans subsidiary in florida the company recently completed a 2 billion bond raise to refinance a 1 29 billion bond due in 2025 and 2026 plus build its working capital reserves he also explained that the company would be focusing on sme s more going forward considering the company s current loan portfolio of 93 per cent being personal loans so we are very aggressively looking at growing our business loan portfolio with our small business centre in cross roads coming out of a pandemic you have a number of small businesses and microentrepreneurs who would have been impacted and we have new entrants in that space as well williams added when asked about acquisition prospects under the current market consolidation williams added that of the portfolios approached so far they don t meet the company s risk criteria and had high levels of delinquency he noted that access had a seven per cent non performing loan portfolio a part of our strategy does take into consideration acquisitions given the performance of access and strength of the company we have we are viewing opportunities wherever they arise so right now we don t have a specific geographic the ceo added mairs instead said that the company is examining many firms loan portfolios and would pay a discount for any loan book which cannot service any possible debt to be used to fund the acquisition he added there s always a plan for acquisition and i think we re the largest fisher we have made official non binding offers and expressions of interest in not only that company but also others where we ve gotten responses from and as soon as that materializes we can put that out there we wouldn t put ourselves in a position to do an acquisition that wouldn t work for the company dolla has been acquiring fresh talent with david henriques joining dolla and access sales and marketing manager deveta mclaren who will be leaving at the end of this month deveta was left off access presentation to shareholders when asked about the company s growth prospects due to the slow growing interest income from a larger loan portfolio williams said that the competition from the commercial banks amid low interest rates forced the company to be more competitive in attracting customers access earned 1 46 billion in interest income from a 2 93 billion loan book to earn a net profit before tax of 801 95 million in its 2018 financial year however access earned 1 58 billion in interest income from its 4 02 billion loan book portfolio in its 2022 fy and had a profit before tax of 650 15 million no i think that will actually work in our favour and i say that because while commercial banks constantly increase their interest rates we have already priced our product at a higher premium because we take more risk so what that allows us to do is stay at our pricing while they have to increase their pricing to facilitate risk that we have already made provisions for mairs responded to the rising interest rate environment and possible implications for loan demand the battle between the two microcredit companies will continue in the coming months dolla s stock price hit new all time highs in the last week from the current news surrounding the possible takeover while access price gained some traction again due to the news however both prices declined to 3 35 and 22 respectively at the end of the week following the access agm at the end of the day i want dolla to be one of those stocks that are high dividend paying stocks that people view as a blue chip stock so that s really my dream for dolla where people believe in the brand and its reputation to the point where they know they can buy the stock for their kids for 10 to 15 years down the line mairs closed
for decades propaganda has steered the course of the mass media s narrative dominated by the needs of state and corporate power john pilger explains that nothing has changed in today s world in the 1970s i met one of hitler s leading propagandists leni riefenstahl whose epic films glorified the nazis we happened to be staying at the same lodge in kenya where she was on a photography assignment having escaped the fate of other friends of the fuhrer she told me that the patriotic messages of her films were dependent not on orders from above but on what she called the submissive void of the german public did that include the liberal educated bourgeoisie i asked yes especially them she said i think of this as i look around at the propaganda now consuming western societies of course we are very different from germany in the 1930s we live in information societies we are globalists we have never been more aware more in touch better connected are we or do we live in a media society where brainwashing is insidious and relentless and perception is filtered according to the needs and lies of state and corporate power the united states dominates the western world s media all but one of the top ten media companies are based in north america the internet and social media google twitter facebook are mostly american owned and controlled what is really wrong with our media the eden monaro example only by supporting progressive independent factual and fearless news sources can australians overcome conservative media propaganda in my lifetime the united states has overthrown or attempted to overthrow more than 50 governments mostly democracies it has interfered in democratic elections in 30 countries it has dropped bombs on the people of 30 countries most of them poor and defenceless it has attempted to murder the leaders of 50 countries it has fought to suppress liberation movements in 20 countries the extent and scale of this carnage is largely unreported and unrecognised those responsible continue to dominate anglo american political life in the years before he died in 2008 the playwright harold pinter made two extraordinary speeches which broke a silence in accepting the nobel prize for literature pinter said this pinter was a friend of mine and possibly the last great political sage that is before dissenting politics were gentrified i asked him if the hypnosis he referred to was the submissive void described by leni riefenstahl it s the same he replied it means the brainwashing is so thorough we are programmed to swallow a pack of lies if we don t recognise propaganda we may accept it as normal and believe it that s the submissive void in our systems of corporate democracy war is an economic necessity the perfect marriage of public subsidy and private profit socialism for the rich capitalism for the poor the day after 9 11 the stock prices of the war industry soared more bloodshed was coming which is great for business today the most profitable wars have their own brand they are called forever wars afghanistan palestine iraq libya yemen and now ukraine all are based on a pack of lies john pilger war in europe and the rise of raw propaganda marshall mcluhan s prophecy that the successor to politics will be propaganda has happened iraq is the most infamous with its weapons of mass destruction that didn t exist nato s destruction of libya in 2011 was justified by a massacre in benghazi that didn t happen afghanistan was a convenient revenge war for 9 11 which had nothing to do with the people of afghanistan today the news from afghanistan is how evil the taliban is not that u s president joe biden s theft of 7 billion of the country s bank reserves is causing widespread suffering recently national public radio in washington devoted two hours to afghanistan and 30 seconds to its starving people at its summit in madrid in june nato which is controlled by the united states adopted a strategy document that militarises the european continent and escalates the prospect of war with russia and china it proposes multi domain warfighting against nuclear armed peer competitors in other words nuclear war it says i read that in disbelief a measure of this historic success is the war in ukraine news of which is mostly not news but a one sided litany of jingoism distortion and omission i have reported a number of wars and have never known such blanket propaganda in february russia invaded ukraine as a response to almost eight years of killing and criminal destruction in the russian speaking region of donbas on their border in 2014 the united states had sponsored a coup in kyiv that got rid of ukraine s democratically elected russian friendly president and installed a successor whom the americans made clear was their man in recent years american defender missiles have been installed in eastern europe poland slovenia and the czech republic almost certainly aimed at russia accompanied by false assurances all the way back to former white house chief of staff james baker s promise to gorbachev in february 1990 that nato would never expand beyond germany ukraine is the frontline nato has effectively reached the very borderland through which hitler s army stormed in 1941 leaving more than 23 million dead in the soviet union how to sell a controversial ideology in a political world full of harmful ideologies kyle mervin explains how to spin them to the masses and make them work last december russia proposed a far reaching security plan for europe this was dismissed derided or suppressed in the western media who read its step by step proposals on 24 february ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy threatened to develop nuclear weapons unless america armed and protected ukraine this was the final straw on the same day russia invaded according to the western media an unprovoked act of congenital infamy the history the lies the peace proposals the solemn agreements on donbas at minsk counted for nothing on 25 april the u s defence secretary general lloyd austin flew into kyiv and confirmed that america s aim was to destroy the russian federation the word he used was weaken america had got the war it wanted waged by an american bankrolled and armed proxy and expendable pawn almost none of this was explained to western audiences russia s invasion of ukraine is wanton and inexcusable it is a crime to invade a sovereign country there are no buts except one when did the present war in ukraine begin and who started it according to the united nations between 2014 and this year some 14 000 people have been killed in the kyiv regime s civil war on the donbas many of the attacks were carried out by neo nazis watch an itv news report from may 2014 by the veteran reporter james mates who is shelled along with civilians in the city of mariupol by ukraine s azov neo nazi battalion in the same month dozens of russian speaking people were burned alive or suffocated in a trade union building in odessa besieged by fascist thugs the followers of the nazi collaborator and anti semitic fanatic stepan bandera the new york times called the thugs nationalists the historic mission of our nation in this critical moment said andreiy biletsky founder of the azov battalion is to lead the white races of the world in a final crusade for their survival a crusade against the semite led untermenschen since february a campaign of self appointed news monitors mostly funded by the americans and british with links to governments has sought to maintain the absurdity that ukraine s neo nazis don t exist ukraine s refugee crisis revealing western double standards refugees from afghanistan and elsewhere have faced hostility in europe whereas ukrainian refugees are being treated with compassion airbrushing a term once associated with stalin s purges has become a tool of mainstream journalism in less than a decade a good china has been airbrushed and a bad china has replaced it from the world s workshop to a budding new satan much of this propaganda originates in the u s and is transmitted through proxies and think tanks such as the notorious australian strategic policy institute the voice of the arms industry and by zealous journalists such as peter hartcher of the sydney morning herald who labelled those spreading chinese influence as rats flies mosquitoes and sparrows and called for these pests to be eradicated news about china in the west is almost entirely about the threat from beijing airbrushed are the 400 american military bases that surround most of china an armed necklace that reaches from australia to the pacific and southeast asia japan and korea the japanese island of okinawa and the korean island of jeju are loaded guns aimed point blank at the industrial heart of china a pentagon official described this as a noose palestine has been misreported for as long as i can remember to the bbc there is the conflict of two narratives the longest most brutal lawless military occupation in modern times is unmentionable the stricken people of yemen barely exist they are media unpeople while the saudis rain down their american cluster bombs with british advisors working alongside the saudi targeting officers more than half a million children face starvation this brainwashing by omission has a long history the slaughter of the first world war was suppressed by reporters who were knighted for their compliance and confessed in their memoirs in 1917 the editor of the manchester guardian cp scott confided to prime minister lloyd george if people really knew the war would be stopped tomorrow but they don t know and can t know the refusal to see people and events as those in other countries see them is a media virus in the west as debilitating as covid 19 it is as if we see the world through a one way mirror in which we are moral and benign and they are not it is a profoundly imperial view the history that is a living presence in china and russia is rarely explained and rarely understood russian president vladimir putin is adolf hitler chinese president xi jinping is fu manchu epic achievements such as the eradication of abject poverty in china are barely known how perverse and squalid this is joe biden keeps the war on terror alive the biden administration is continuing the war on terror through its own acts of hostility when will we allow ourselves to understand training journalists factory style is not the answer neither is the wondrous digital tool which is a means not an end like the one finger typewriter and the linotype machine in recent years some of the best journalists have been eased out of the mainstream defenestrated is the word used the spaces once open to mavericks to journalists who went against the grain truth tellers have closed the case of wikileaks founder julian assange is the most shocking when julian and wikileaks could win readers and prizes for the guardian the new york times and other self important papers of record he was celebrated when the dark state objected and demanded the destruction of hard drives and the assassination of julian s character he was made a public enemy vice president biden called him a hi tech terrorist hillary clinton asked can t we just drone this guy the ensuing campaign of abuse and vilification against julian assange the un rapporteur on torture called it mobbing brought the liberal press to its lowest ebb we know who they are i think of them as collaborators as vichy journalists when will real

michel martin host earlier this month an investigative reporter for the las vegas review journal jeff german was found stabbed dead outside his home now the murder was disturbing in its own right but then a shocking arrest was made clark county public administrator robert telles was arrested on suspicion of murdering german now the authorities have not provided a specific motive but german had previously reported on mismanagement and a hostile work environment in telles s office telles denied the accusations and went after german on social media although the killing of journalists is rare in the u s threats of doing so are not and the important local reporting german worked on is also disappearing across the u s as more and more local news outlets close their doors margaret sullivan has been thinking about the threats facing journalists and journalism for a long time now she s a longtime news executive she just retired as the washington post s media columnist and she s the author of ghosting the news local news and the crisis of american democracy and she s with us now to share some thoughts about this margaret sullivan welcome thank you for joining us margaret sullivan thanks michel martin you know well one of the reasons we wanted to talk to you is that we often report on violence against journalists in other countries but something like this happening in the united states you know while it is rare we thought that this deserved some attention so i wanted to ask what you make of this story and why you think it matters sullivan so you re absolutely right about how we report on the global threats to journalists but in the united states we you know with our proudly waving the first amendment and the fact that we prize free expression or always have we don t think this kind of thing happens to journalists but journalists are more and more under threat in the united states this is obviously an extreme case and a very disturbing one martin and when you talk about the threats being directed at journalists in the united states what are you talking about sullivan so there s sort of two fronts here and they re very different one as you mentioned is the incredible and precipitous decline of local news seventy million americans live in places where there is not that sort of sustainable local news that s very disturbing two newspapers a week whether weeklies or dailies are going out of business and while we know that newspapers are not the only form of news and not the only form of local news they are very important one so that s one front and the other one is that threats and intimidation of journalists is on the rise so that you know a local tv crew who goes out to cover a school board meeting it would not be unusual these days for them to be bullied intimidated yelled at this is something new and something that s on the rise and extremely disturbing martin ahead of one of german s stories on telles s office he wrote on social media quote looking forward to lying smear piece no 4 by jeff german now i bring this up because that kind of harassment of journalists is something that i think many people began to see in earnest during the campaign of the prior american president and certainly during his tenure you know reporters being doxxed reporters having their personal information being made public where their children go to school you know etc now we know that again actual deaths of journalists in the united states is rare according to the committee to protect journalists since 1992 16 have been killed across the country and one of the worst attacks in american newspaper was in 2018 when a man killed five people and wounded several others at the capital gazette newsroom in annapolis md and this is again noteworthy because the gunman had previously lost a defamation lawsuit against the newspaper for its accurate reporting on a criminal harassment complaints against him and the prosecutors said in that case that he was out for revenge a jury did find him criminally responsible for the rampage so i guess what i m wondering is do you see this as having a chilling effect on reporters willingness to report on difficult subjects of accountability sullivan i think that reporters thankfully tend to be very dedicated to their craft and you know not easily intimidated but it s scary and editors and owners can sometimes become extremely cautious overly cautious because of these kinds of threats so there is the problem of possible self censorship and you know as you say just the pure online harassment of journalists particularly women particularly journalists of color is so disturbing that you do reach a point where you say you know is this something that i want to deal with day after day journalism is really important and needs to be protected and needs to be valued martin i wanted to talk about one of the things that you reported on in your book ghosting the news was that you actually had data on the effects in community in counties and communities that don t have local newspapers doing actual reporting you said sullivan yes martin that there s you can actually demonstrate increased costs of government services that actually the increase in the costs of say even municipal bond offerings sullivan exactly martin when there aren t local journalists following this information that s just fascinating sullivan it is and i mean a few other things happen too that voter participation and citizen engagement go down when local journalism declines corruption finds more fertile ground and false information spreads wildly with nothing to sort of debunk it or counter it so there are many you know measurable effects that occur when local news goes away martin before we let you go in your final column for the post you laid out some of the challenges that you ve been talking about now but you also laid out some recommendations do you want to leave us with just a couple of those thoughts about what you hope would happen next what would you like to see happen next sullivan well i think that journalists need to have a pro democracy mindset and that s you know when they do have that that kind of keeps them from doing some of the things that we have tended to do over time you know when we re covering campaigns to turn it into horse race coverage instead of covering the issues to do this kind of sort of nickname for it is both sides ing where rather than seeking the truth we take unequal things straight down the middle and you know all of those things can get put in their proper place or a more proper place if we think of ourselves as having a public spirited function and being there to serve the democracy which is really what the founders protected when they protected the press martin that was media critic margaret sullivan her new memoir newsroom confidential lessons and worries from an ink stained life comes out next month margaret sullivan thanks so much for talking

veracyte inc nasdaq vcyt announced that new data from a phase 3 trial of the multi center multi national randomized stampede platform protocol confirm the ability of the company s decipher prostate genomic classifier to identify men with advanced prostate cancer who are more likely to benefit from intensified treatment with abiraterone acetate and prednisolone aap in addition to standard of care androgen deprivation therapy abstract 13580 the findings were shared in an oral presentation today at the european society for medical oncology esmo congress 2022 and support the company s continued expansion of its high value genomic tests for patients in the united states and globally there are an increasing number of treatment options available for men with advanced prostate cancer and the challenge for physicians is determining the best treatment combination for the right patient said gerhardt attard m d ph d group leader of the treatment resistance research group at the university college london cancer institute and stampede study co investigator our findings show that the decipher prostate genomic classifier and tumor transcriptomes in general can provide robust and clinically relevant prognostic information that may help guide important decisions about the treatment of advanced prostate cancer most notably this study has identified patients who have poor prognoses and benefit greatly from addition of hormone treatment tablets while other men have a good prognosis and may be able to avoid the toxicities of treatment the decipher prostate classifier is a 22 gene prognostic biomarker that provides a score that indicates the aggressiveness of an individual patient s cancer to help healthcare professionals more accurately categorize risk and select appropriate treatment the stampede systemic therapy in advancing or metastatic prostate cancer evaluation of drug efficacy protocol involves more than 10 000 men to date with high risk non metastatic m0 or metastatic m1 prostate cancer who are starting long term androgen deprivation therapy adt for the first time and are randomized to new treatments in to date seven phase 3 trials in this post hoc analysis of the abiraterone acetate trial prof attard and colleagues evaluated the prognostic ability of the decipher prostate test among 781 men who were randomized to receive standard of care adt with or without abiraterone acetate and prednisolone aap they found that decipher was prognostic in both the m0 and m1 patients with higher decipher scores associated with worse overall survival in m1 patients and worse metastasis free survival in m0 patients additionally study findings suggest that men with high decipher scores who received aap had the greatest improvement in outcomes while those with low decipher scores received less absolute oncologic benefit from the addition of aap the decipher prostate classifier is the most validated genomic test in prostate cancer and this analysis suggests that we may be able to further expand its use to help inform often challenging decisions regarding intensification of therapy in men with advanced prostate cancer said elai davicioni ph d veracyte s medical director urology we are honored to be working with leading prostate cancer researchers around the world to help further advance precision medicine these findings from one of the most important prostate cancer clinical trials of this era further underscore our commitment to clinical rigor and innovation in our efforts to improve patient outcomes in prostate and other cancers said marc stapley veracyte s ceo they also further support our plan to deliver our high value tests including the decipher prostate genomic classifier to patients around the world among the other abstracts presented at the esmo conference researchers shared data derived from veracyte s decipher grid a database of more than 100 000 whole transcriptome profiles from patients with urologic cancers decipher grid has led to the discovery or development of more than 400 genomic signatures that can be leveraged to help advance understanding of prostate and other urologic cancers as well as to support biopharmaceutical companies targeted therapy development programs in a poster presentation today abstract 1381p researchers shared data showing that the decipher grid androgen receptor activity ar a signature is prognostic for outcomes in men with castration sensitive prostate cancer cspc that has spread to no more than three other sites in the body oligometastatic cspc or omcspc the researchers concluded that the grid ar a signature is prognostic for outcomes in men with omcspc treated with metastasis directed therapy mdt or radiotherapy and that patients with a low ar a

it was a bad year for corn and for tomatoes and for many other american crops farmers agricultural economists and others taking stock of this summer s growing season say drought conditions and extreme weather have wreaked havoc on many row crops fruits and vegetables with the american farm bureau federation suggesting yields could be down by as much as a third compared with last year american corn is on track to produce its lowest yield since the drought of 2012 according to analysts at rabobank which collects data about commodity markets this year s hard red winter wheat crop was the smallest since 1963 the bank s analysts said in texas cotton farmers have walked away from nearly 70 of their crop because the harvest is so paltry according to the u s department of agriculture the california rice harvest is half what it would be in a normal year an industry group said the poor yields are likely more than a one year blip as climate change alters weather patterns in agriculturally important parts of the country contributing to higher food prices that experts don t see ebbing any time soon drought has consumed 40 of the country for the past 101 weeks usda meteorologist brad rippey said but precisely where that 40 is has shifted over time meaning different swaths of the country s agricultural land have been affected at different times spreading pain and difficult choices geographically and by crop spring wheat durum wheat barley those were just hammered in 2021 for some of those crops it was the lowest yields we ve seen since the 1980s rippey said the biggest impacts this year have been the central and southern great plains nebraska southward through texas and the two big crops hit this year are grain sorghum and cotton based on last month s numbers he said it looks like abandonment of the texas cotton crop will be the highest on record around 69 that s when farmers just walk away in california farmers are making tough choices to give up on their strawberries and tomatoes lettuces and melons so that whatever water they get goes to crops like almonds grapes and olives where they ve sunk multiyear investments and the payoff is better rippey said even with recent rains a lot of the western united states is still looking at a long term drought said curtis riganti a climatologist at the national drought mitigation center we re seeing widespread extreme and exceptional drought in california s central valley parts of nevada central and southern oregon the central high plains southern oklahoma and texas he said and while we ve seen a pretty active monsoon season this year over new mexico arizona and southern colorado in terms of refilling reservoirs it doesn t do a ton of good every august for the past 30 years a group of agricultural experts and volunteer farmers in the midwest hop in their cars and convoy across seven states a boots on the ground backstop for the usda s ongoing predictions about annual crop yields the usda had reduced its corn forecast last month because of this summer s drought but the pro farmer crop tour which concluded aug 25 found the corn yield was even worse than that lowered expectation the on the ground inspectors also found the corn quality had suffered as a result of heat and dry conditions with cobs carrying small grains and many suffering from tipback when kernels are missing from the outer edge wheat has taken a walloping this year with rains impeding spring planting after a protracted la nina weather pattern meant several years of hotter and drier weather over key production areas drought is also having a dramatic effect on california rice which is grown mostly in the sacramento valley the state which grows medium grain rice like sushi rice is at about half of a normal year s production said katie cahill spokeswoman for the california rice commission many growers decided to fallow their fields and sell their water to perennial crops like almonds to defray their losses the federal government operates a system of dams reservoirs and canals in california that the state relies on for agriculture and drinking water water agencies contract with the federal government for certain amounts of water each year the federal government fulfills the contracts based on how much water is available this year as the state s megadrought dragged into its third year the government said it had no water to give farmers last summer was a disappointment for tomato growers said aaron barcellos partner at a bar ag enterprises in firebaugh in fresno county calif and we re still in a worse water situation than last summer even the river water has been cut back other crops are competing for that same water other crops that have better returns he said on his own farm he has cut back from 2 000 acres of tomatoes in 2020 to 900 last year this year he has only 530 acres of canning tomatoes some of that land has gone to garlic and pima cotton the rest of it has gone fallow he said contracts with canners are negotiated before the season starts so an exceptionally tough year leaves growers in a hole financially we have contracts and those prices aren t viable now a lot of growers are leaving the tomato industry because of the past several years barcellos said the usda recently estimated that the tomato harvest this year will be 10 5 million tons more than a million tons shy of a normal season which will be reflected in the next year s pizza spaghetti sauce and ketchup prices harvest of the new potato crop is underway and rabobank analysts say the harvested area is projected to drop 4 from last year and last year s crop was a decade s low its analysts also said year to date shipments of carrots are down 45 sweet corn down 20 sweet potatoes down 13 and celery down 11 all an indication of short supply and according to the usda total peach production was down 15 from 2021 mostly because of california s small crop one bright spot is soybeans gro intelligence s modeling put a total soybean forecast at 4 30 billion bushels lower than the usda s 4 53 billion bushels but slightly higher than last year but the bad news extends to cattle portending bad news for next year s beef prices when weather is dry and hot there s not enough natural feed to go around to sustain a herd ranchers must bring in hay and feed prices soar prompting ranchers to sell their animals a little early and often to sell heifers the young females rather than keep them as breeding stock said sarah little spokeswoman for the north american meat institute a trade association this has resulted in lower beef prices to consumers in the short term but signals that there will likely be a tighter supply next year a recent farm bureau survey found that the largest herd decline is in texas reported down 50 followed by new mexico down 43 and oregon down 41 largely due to scarce forage and water which cuts into operational income for ranchers producers are especially hard hit because food fuel and fertilizer costs have been rising so although they are getting record prices for cattle inflation has hurt their income little said

two million patients diagnosed in 2020 1 for patients with metastatic nsclc prognosis is particularly poor as only approximately 8 will live beyond five years after diagnosis 2 her2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including lung breast gastric and colorectal cancers certain her2 erbb2 gene alterations called her2 mutations have been identified in patients with non squamous nsclc as a distinct molecular target and occur in approximately 2 to 4 of patients with this type of lung cancer 3 4 while her2 gene mutations can occur in a range of patients they are more commonly found in patients with nsclc who are younger female and have never smoked 5 her2 gene mutations have been independently associated with cancer cell growth and poor prognosis with an increased incidence of brain metastases 6 although the role of anti her2 treatment is well established in breast and gastric cancers there were no approved her2 directed therapies in nsclc prior to the accelerated u s fda approval of enhertu in unresectable or metastatic her2 mutant nsclc 7 next generation sequencing has been utilized in the identification of her2 erbb2 mutations 8 her2 overexpression is associated with a specific her2 gene alteration known as her2 amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poorer prognosis 9 it has

applications for enhertu in breast and gastric cancer are currently under review in several countries based on the destiny breast01 destiny breast03 destiny breast04 destiny gastric01 and destiny gastric02 trials respectively about the daiichi sankyo and astrazeneca collaboration daiichi sankyo and astrazeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize enhertu in march 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan dato dxd in july 2020 except in japan where daiichi sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each adc daiichi sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply

how did the cosmonaute come to become the first swiss wristwatch in space in 1962 the cosmonaute was a watch which was requested by scott carpenter the fourth american in space when he was training in australia he saw the australian pilots of the air force wearing navitimers and he knew it was exactly what project mercury needed for the upcoming orbital missions he then wrote to willy breitling explaining that timekeeping was his specific responsibility for project mercury he needed a reconfigured navitimer to retain the circular slide rule for calculations he wanted a watch with a 24 hour indication and also one that would read like an instrument in his capsule breitling then developed that timepiece which became one of the absolute classics of the watch industry and became the first swiss wristwatch in space there s another very famous cosmonaute worn by john glenn that was acquired by gregory breitling at an auction in 2019 why was he keen to return it to the breitling archives after scott carpenter s journey to space at least seven other prototypes of the same watch were built they were produced for the seven astronauts who took part in the mercury programme the john glenn watch was never in space but it was glenn s personal watch and when gregory breitling heard that it was on auction he decided to buy it this is something we need to do ourselves in the future because we want to build a museum and work on our history we have a clear focus to buy special watches that were once part of our collection building a museum and publishing books around our brand gregory breitling is very supportive of this initiative as is fred mandelbaum who is probably the biggest breitling collector in the world sooner or later all these watches will be available in the museum that can be viewed by our customers and collectors the navitimer itself is 70 years old this year was its existence ever threatened over the last seven decades there are watches that are icons and which are commercially successful and then there are watches which are icons but which were commercial failures the navitimer was always successful and the navitimer s existence as part of our collection was never threatened since it was always a commercial success it is today with the chronomat the most commercially important line we have give us a scale of your global operations last year cvc sold a minority stake to a private equity company today we are present worldwide with subsidiaries we will have roughly 250 boutiques by the end of the year this year we re opening close to two boutiques a week for the time being the whole luxury industry is very resilient we have seen revenge buying because people couldn t go on holidays and hence have a lot of disposable income which is why the luxury industry did very well last year you ve previously said that breitling is yet to achieve its fair market share in china have you capitalised on that china still represents a small portion of our business we re growing strongly but we don t have our fair market share in china yet if i compare it to the us europe or the middle east because we just started to build our presence there four five years ago we are opening 25 boutiques in china this year we have the locations but it would take three four years for us to be at the level where we want to be you don t have an established distribution network of retailers in china like you might have in dubai with seddiqi for example we don t have a strategic problem as much as a tactical problem in implementing the strategies that we implement in our other markets around the world we will have roughly 60 boutiques in china but we should be able to quadruple that number how important is the middle east market for breitling the middle east is an important market it s a high end sophisticated and cultivated market as a region it s smaller than europe but it s growing and is a substantial market for us the key markets are europe the us and the middle east we have joint ventures in saudi arabia where we have opened a huge boutique in riyadh earlier this year and are opening more boutiques in the kingdom too why did breitling decide to unveil the new superocean we had in the 1960s a diving watch called the slow motion which was very much an instrument for diving with big hands and big indexes so we took the slow motion and added modern features to it but kept the same broad design elements including a ceramic bezel and the square blocks on the hands there s a certain similarity to the look of most dive watches but the slow motion always stood out from the crowd what are your plans for the second hand and vintage watch market there are important vintage watches like the navitimer cosmonaute from john glenn acquired by gregory breitling we work with auction houses to address that market we have plans to address it with much more focus than we did in the past the second area is the certified pre owned watches which are traded on certified pre owned platforms where we aren t involved and then there are watches that are no longer produced as part of our collection and here we buy back the stock from the retailer and sell them through our factory outlets around the world what are some of breitling s plans for the short to medium term we have now launched the superocean but we have more products in the pipeline for the remainder of the year as for the mid long term we have changed strategies four years ago and we now have a proven concept what we re doing now is scaling the business in countries like china with our repositioned brand and redesigned collections
sri lanka s crisis and the dilemmas of small states by uditha devapriya sri lanka s economic woes have not cast a shadow over its complex foreign relations on august 16 the southern port of hambantota welcomed the yuan wang 5 a research vessel while colombo had asked for a deferral of the visit it later relented and allowed the ship to dock at the port until august 22 india which denied that it put pressure on the country over the issue nevertheless registered its unease about the visit beijing contends that the vessel was used for research purposes the indian media on the other hand has described it as a dual use spy ship the sequel to the drama unfolded a few days after it left the port when china s ambassador to colombo qi zhenzong wrote a rather frank op ed about the matter the article accused india and the west of continuing to colonise sri lanka arguing that sri lanka had the right to permit the docking of the vessel it noted that the yuan wang 5 had complied with international practice the article sparked outrage the indian high commission registered its displeasure accusing the ambassador of violating basic diplomatic etiquette western embassies by contrast remained silent political analysts have observed that the episode may dampen sri lanka s relations with india since january new delhi has dispensed assistance to the tune of usd 3 8 billion colombo s decision to permit the docking of the chinese vessel might leave india wondering whether the island is pitting the two countries against each other sri lanka cannot afford to engage in such balancing yet it cannot avoid it either reeling from its worst financial crisis since independence the usd 84 billion economy is down to its last few million dollars although rationing and restrictions on imports have eased the pain somewhat such policies are not sustainable the latest spate of import restrictions which even the governor of the country s central bank has questioned bans intermediate capital goods that local industries desperately need the only tenable solution is a bailout from the imf which experts say may take as much as six months the truth is that india has emerged as sri lanka s saviour simply put without indian aid the economy would have collapsed to the ground though commentators compare the situation to the crisis in lebanon such comparisons miss the geopolitical angle colombo is flanked by two powerful neighbours one a regional hegemon the other a rising superpower despite the country s best efforts these two continue to confront other in the neighbourhood such confrontations have played out more to its disadvantage than advantage sri lanka s position is also not comparable to taiwan s or ukraine s while these are states flanked on one side by a regional powerhouse rival powers vying for dominance over the region through them like the united states the european union and nato are not located within that powerhouse s immediate sphere of influence the situation is different in sri lanka and more complex so complex in fact that the island has no choice but to watch as it gets entangled in one showdown after another between delhi and beijing much has been written about sri lanka s dependence on beijing india s assistance to its ailing neighbour and colombo s reticence in siding with what commentators portray as its saviour beijing s reluctance to renegotiate sri lanka s debts has reinforced these narratives according to this reading sri lanka needs to be more upfront about its foreign policy which means abandoning its decades long dalliance with beijing the reality is that its location and economic situation make this an untenable strategy for the island sri lanka can ill afford antagonising any of its powerful allies something it found to its cost in early june when the commercial high court in colombo detained a flight over a transaction between a russian airline and a irish leasing company while the russian foreign ministry immediately condemned the incident the sri lankan foreign ministry replied that the government had nothing to do with the detention order it was a classic catch 22 situation the government could not interfere with the order since it would be seen as an infringement on the judiciary yet it could not detach itself either since russian tourists made up the bulk of arrivals in the country this point is important since all if not most analyses of the controversy ignore the fact that sri lanka s link with the imf has made it susceptible to western discourses of human rights and transparency which explains its seeming reluctance to forge closer economic ties with russia the reason for small states like sri lanka becoming embroiled in these quagmires isn t just that they recklessly borrowed money but that they haven t been properly encouraged or directed to shift to long term development strategies which can enable them to pursue a self reliant foreign policy this does not excuse the vanity projects and white elephants that governments in these states have lavished in the name of development yet as sri lankan economist umesh moramudali has noted while china was the only lender willing to cough up bucks for sri lanka s post war development the rajapaksa administration also pursued capital markets issuing its first isb in 2007 the same year beijing stepped in with a usd 307 million loan for phase i of the hambantota port instead of prioritising long term industrial growth successive regimes went on issuing bonds and racking up external debts in focusing attention on china or for that matter india foreign policy experts have thus missed the bigger picture the role of international sovereign bnds in economic fallouts has been side lined china s reluctance to forgive sri lanka s debts may stall imf negotiations but a more serious setback has been hamilton reserve s decision to sue the country in a us court and sri lanka s stock of market borrowings which make up 47 percent of the total ollowing the global financial crisis writes c p chandrasekhar and jayati ghosh easy access to foreign liquidity encouraged governments to prime the economy with support from foreign capital resulting in the stock of external debt rising to exceed 56 billion in 2020 yet these aspects to the crisis have received little attention sri lanka is the best and possibly the only example of a small state flanked by a regional hegemon that in turn courts its most powerful rival as its immediate neighbour this is a unique position and the country hasn t exactly benefitted from it indeed in a big way its crisis is tied to such complexities a more cohesive analysis of the situation on the ground requires that we consider these complexities heads down instead of blaming one side or the other it would be more apt to view the problems of small states from the standpoint of those states themselves a 360 degree perspective is needed and yet as far as states like sri lanka go such a perspective remains conspicuously missing uditha devapriya is researcher and columnist from sri lanka he is the chief international relations analyst at factum an asia focused thinktank on international relations tech cooperation and strategic communications based in sri lanka

mandela madiba was so worried for africa before he joined his ancestors in 2013 and he noted that the world would not respect africa until nigeria earned that respect and the black people of the world would need nigeria to be great as a source of pride and confidence i am beginning to see that the democracy that our democratically elected leaders have been hailing since 1999 for instance has not elicited any glimmer of hope that africa s most populous nation would be able to live up to the dream of leading africa to rise africa and indeed the black race may have been waiting for godot that samuel beckett says may not appear after all no thanks to our dealers who call themselves leaders relax i am not suggesting here the next election should not hold it is an idea whose time and season have come there will be an election but there are doubts that the 2023 elections in the first quarter of next year will bring peace and development to nigeria reputation managers of candidates relax this isn t casting aspersion on our election candidates they are our brothers and sisters who will be elected this is just a reflection on the expediency of managing our expectations at this time and so i have looked into the seeds of time again i have read so many recent writings on the wall what i have seen and would like to transmit is this blessed are you if you are hopeless for you shall not be disappointed don t get it twisted the election may be freer and fairer technological advancement may prevent large scale electoral malpractices there is also a sense in which one can claim that our election management agency inec has improved tremendously in its internal governance system it appears to have restored confidence in the electoral system that has manifested somehow in the way even our young ones have shown genuine interest in the next leadership recruitment process called elections but i just want to encourage some debate on whether we should just see hope from the outcomes of the 2023 elections that will produce the next president more than 30 governors 109 senators and 360 members of the house of representatives and some hundreds of members of state assemblies in the 36 states of the fragile federation i am beginning to reflect on how democracy may not be safe in nigeria after all i mean who will save democracy that will prevent this troubled federation from damnation i am talking about a democracy that has made nigeria the world s poverty capital let s reflect on how not to crash a democracy that has made the people unsafe even in the land of their births just within 23 years of unbroken democractic process i would like us to think through a democracy that has produced the most expensive parliamentarians in the world i mean national assembly members in one of the poorest nation on earth who earn higher than the president of the richest nation let s talk openly therefore on how to engage the 2023 candidates to tell us how they want to engage democratic institutions and processes to deliver nigeria from the curse of oil we produce that can t deliver prosperity and good life to the people where is that oil producing nation in the world its system of government has failed to deliver wealth to where is the oil rich nation that can t refine its crude for domestic use where is that member of the organisation of petroleum exporting countries that has failed to maintain four refineries and has become petroleum importing country never in the history of mankind has a democratic and oil producing country been so mismanaged to the extent that all critical sectors energy transportation education health financial services media etc have collapsed and the duty bearers called leaders have become so clueless about how to even apologise to the citizens on their poor offerings and incompetence i would like all of us who believe in the future of nigeria to bear this in mind as we glide towards yet another election cycle i mean before we doze off we should realise that unless we renew our minds and get ready to fight the principalities and powers that have made nigeria a laughing stock nothing will change after the elections democracy isn t about regular elections i mean i have been reflecting on a researcher who has just deconstructed the mess democracy is creating around the world claude forthomme a writer and economist once at the united nations food and agriculture says democracy doesn t work just as i too am beginning to see plato thought it democracy was a terrible system a prelude to tyranny giving power to selfish and dangerous demagogues watching what is happening these days in democracies around the world it s hard to disagree with plato claude believes too that democracy appears to produce an abundance of incompetent and dishonest political leaders who exploit people s credulity and prejudices and thrive on emotion driven discourse and fake news this impakter contributor looks at the problems and proposes that people should have courage to implement radical reforms to save democracy in global context the rise of incompetent political leaders most people don t trust democracy to deliver according to 2019 pew survey trust in government is at a historical low only 17 of americans today say they can trust the government to do what is right just about always 3 or most of the time 14 the situation in the rest of the world is not much better a 27 countries pew survey april 2019 revealed that a majority 51 are dissatisfied with the way democracy is working anti establishment leaders parties and movements have emerged on both the right and left of the political spectrum and most people in developing countries find authoritarian figures more trustworthy than democratically elected politicians hence the success of the china model bottom line elections don t deliver the kind of political leaders people want after a honeymoon period between voters and their winning candidate often as short as a month he or she always disappoints why is it the fault of the voters who expect too much or don t they understand what is going on how complex the job of governing can be how campaign promises can t be kept it has been convincingly argued that yes it s the voters fault dambisa moyo the well known zambian economist and author of dead aid 2009 in which she famously argued that foreign aid made africa poorer placed the blame squarely on voters voters generally favour policies that enhance their own well being with little consideration for that of future generations or for long term outcomes politicians are rewarded for pandering to voters immediate demands and desires this quote is out of an article she wrote for foreign policy when her new book came out in 2018 edge of chaos why democracy is failing to deliver economic growth and how to fix it the article sums up her book s arguments in a nutshell because democratic systems encourage such short termism it will be difficult to solve many of the seemingly intractable structural problems slowing global growth without an overhaul of democracy let s put aside for the moment the question whether our overall goal should be global growth a good argument could be made that the unrestrained pursuit of continued economic growth in a world of finite resources and where there is no planet b can only be achieved at the expense of the planet s ecological balance yes climate change is real have you heard ms moyo appears not to consider the possibility but she does make some excellent points regarding governance how we humans govern ourselves and in particular governance in a liberal democracy which is still considered to use churchill s phrase the least bad system the actual quote is indeed it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time obviously democracy is always better than dictatorship so what are the obstacles to good governance let s list the obstacles moyo has identified plus a few of others i believe in 1 too many elections she sees the short electoral cycle embedded in many democratic systems as a major problem frequent elections taint policymaking as politicians driven by the rational desire to win elections opt for quick fixes that have a tendency to undermine long term growth this public and private myopia she contends is behind the collapse of american infrastructure she cites the 2017 report by the american society of civil engineers asce that found 2 170 high hazard dams 56 007 structurally deficient bridges 9 1 percent of the nation s total and estimated that 1 trillion was needed to upgrade drinking water systems over the next 25 years the same can be said of european infrastructure the collapse of bridges in italy notably the morandi bridge in genoa is a case in point germany with its aging highways and insufficient airports is in no better shape 2 interest group lobbying this is something moyo highlights politicians respond to the demands of their funders instead of their voters this can destroy democracy resulting in the one percent governing the 99 percent or as moyo puts it it is the use of wealth to influence political outcomes that helps inequality take root until democracies push back on the use of wealth to influence elections and policies initiatives to address inequality will be blunted this looks like nigeria too 3 voter ignorance and disinformation as peter coy the economics editor for bloomberg despairingly noted in a review of moyo s book voters can be tribal and poorly informed and he cites a survey from the annenberg public policy center u of pennsylvania that found that out of 1 013 u s adults only a quarter could name all three branches of government in moyo s words the proliferation of personalised media diets increasingly means that voters cling to their own facts assumptions and beliefs by media diets she means how people live in their own bubble only listening to like minded people this raises the whole question of fake news a complex subject covered by anthropologist hannah fischer lauder in an impakter essay why fake news go viral 2016 published after trump had unexpectedly won the 2016 elections now we know that it was largely a result of expert online manipulation of voter opinions guided by the now infamous cambridge analytica s techniques for targeting voters doubtless there can be more sophisticated strategy than the cambridge analytica in nigeria s 2023 elections if we doze off again that is why we should not just agonise about the pitiable conditions that democracy has put africa s most populous nation and hope of the black race we should organise to ensure that the candidates who will begin campaign shortly tell us how they intend to change our unitary complicated constitution to reflect a true federation in which true federalism can enhance coherence to rebuild the unity walls our leaders 1999 2003 have destroyed
toronto ontario andean precious metals corp tsxv apm otcqx anpmf andean or the company is pleased to report results received to date from the company s phased drilling program being carried out at its wholly owned san pablo gold project in bolivia we are pleased with the initial results of the exploration program at our san pablo project phase ii drilling has confirmed a high sulfidation and porphyry gold system that demonstrates the potential to host gold mineralization at these targets which have similarities to other major gold occurrences in bolivia said simon griffiths president and ceo of andean bolivia is an underexplored and highly prospective mining jurisdiction where andean s subsidiary empresa minera manquiri operates the only commercial scale oxide processing plant until now no modern day exploration has been conducted on the san pablo property located in the heart of one of the world s oldest and most mineral rich mining jurisdictions the 100 owned san pablo project that comprises 650 hectares is situated in the department of potosi in the southern part of the prolific bolivian tin silver and polymetallic belts this region hosts several of bolivia s largest mines including the former kori kollo gold mine newmont that produced more than 5 million ounces of gold and the cerro rico of potosi where the company s san bartolome mine is located which has produced more than 2 billion ounces of silver as well as a significant amount of tin following up on the 2021 phase i drill program of 12 core holes for a total of 3 581 metres in february 2022 the company started a second program using two drill rigs to date it has drilled 5 573 metres in 11 core holes as part of phase ii and assays are pending for four holes highlights from the phase i as previously published in the company s press release dated november 30 2021 and phase ii drill programs are listed in tables 1 and 2 and the hole locations are shown in figure 1 while the phase i drill program returned several gold intersections the phase ii drilling has confirmed that the san pablo project has many of the characteristics of a porphyry gold system explained dr stewart d redwood the company s principal advisor geology the system is large and anomalous gold occurs in every hole drilled dr redwood added the results show an alteration profile through the upper part of a porphyry system starting with the root of the lithocap with epithermal veins followed by the zone of phyllic alteration and finally by the zone of potassic alteration in the deeper parts the best gold grades occur with polymetallic sulphide veinlets associated with phyllic alteration and with epithermal veins the porphyry intrusions drilled so far are late syn mineral in age and we have yet to encounter the pre mineral porphyries that are expected to have better grades the other important control is structure to give zones with a high percentage of gold bearing sulphide veins this was the main ore control at the kori kollo mine where gold occurred in a zone of sheeted pyrite veinlets geology and mineralization gold mineralization at san pablo is hosted by diamictites of the silurian aged cancaniri formation on the western limb on a major anticline over a large area of at least 2 5 km elongated northwest by 1 5 km wide and multiphase porphyry intrusions in stocks and dykes early potassic alteration affects porphyry and sediments and comprises secondary biotite potassium feldspar and magnetite with quartz veinlets and magmatic hydrothermal breccias accompanied by low grade gold the porphyries encountered to date are syn mineral in relative age the pre mineral porphyries have not been found yet and are an important target the roots of the lithocap occur in the peaks above about 5 000 m comprising minor veins of pyrite covellite or residual vuggy quartz and advanced argillic alteration sericite alteration phyllic alteration with gold rich polymetallic sulphides as bi cu zn partly overprints potassic alteration or fresh rock in structurally controlled zones and veins san pablo target the san pablo target is the zone around the high point of cerro alcandevario in the north western part of the concession in diamictites with porphyry dykes this target gave the best intersection in phase i of 53 80 m at 1 17 g t au from 210 90 m sp21 01 in a stockwork of sulfide veinlets hole sp21 02 intersected several zones including 10 65 m at 0 39 g t au from 92 15 m and 3 10 m at 7 39 g t au from 470 80 m these holes were followed up in phase ii by holes sp22 03 lost at 207 m sp22 03 bis re drilled and sp22 04 with assays pending for the latter two sp22 03 returned 4 50 m at 6 19 g t au 67 07 g t ag 0 41 pb and 0 47 zn from 137 00 m in veinlets of specularite pyrite arsenopyrite and quartz 13 70 m at 0 71 g t au from 165 00 m in veinlets of pyrite arsenopyrite and 2 60 m at 1 97 g t au 331 23 g t ag 1 78 cu 2 20 pb and 4 93 zn from 192 00 m in a pyrite covellite enargite sphalerite vein this is the first hole to return significant silver and base metal grades which are interpreted to be epithermal mineralization in the root of the lithocap please see cross section in figure 2 willacollito target the willacollito target is a ridge at lower elevation east of the san pablo target in diamictite with seven phase i holes spw22 01 to 07 they returned several long intersections in sulfide veinlets including 108 40 m at 0 29 g t au from 183 00 m spw21 01 69 85 m at 0 23 g t au from 209 80 m spw21 01 97 80 m at 0 30 g t au from 8 80 m spw21 03 and 92 75 m at 0 37 g t au from 44 35 m spw21 04 five holes were drilled in willacollito in phase ii spw22 08 to 12 of which two were lost before reaching the target depth they intersected diamictites and altered porphyries with gold in veins such as 0 45 m at 9 93 g t au spw22 09 and 0 50 m at 1 31 g t au spw22 08 and with anomalous gold zones below cut off grade the low grades are believed to be due to the relatively late age porphyries post dating the main gold stage the pre mineral porphyries have not been intersected yet willacollito east target the willacollito east target is east of willacollito in diamictite with porphyries and breccias one hole is under way spwe22 04 in phase ii to drill deeper below the phase i holes spwe21 01 to 03 two phase i holes intersected a magmatic hydrothermal

unit photography by melinda sue gordon smpsp photos courtesy of paramount pictures after serving as director of photography on a series of large scale effects laden action films the matrix trilogy and spider man 2 bill pope instructed his agents to look for something completely different little did the cinematographer know that he d get what he asked for in spades i certainly never saw a puppet movie coming up on my horizon pope says with a chuckle however when matt stone and trey parker sent me the script i literally laughed out loud as i read it at the time i didn t know they wanted to make the film entirely with puppets when i finally met with matt and trey and they told me they wanted to do the whole film with marionettes all in camera with no cgi i told them i was their man cg allows you to do things onscreen that you shouldn t be able to but many times those kinds of effects can take you out of the story for me the organic quality of doing things in camera is usually much more charming team america was certainly inspired by the work that gerry anderson did he created an entire niche with all of his different marionette shows the most popular of which was thunderbirds director matt stone this article originally appeared in ac nov 2004 some images are additional or alternate stone and parker have earned considerable notoriety for their raw and controversial animated television series south park in 1999 the eccentric duo released an even racier feature film installment south park bigger longer uncut their other collaborations include the features baseketball and orgazmo as well as the tv series that s my bush bill was suggested to us by our producer scott rudin who had worked with him on clueless says stone from the outset we felt we should find a cinematographer who had shot these kinds of action movies in fact the entire precept of team america is based on the idea of doing a huge overwrought bruckheimer esque action event movie only with puppets when we wrote the script however we didn t write it with puppets in mind we just wrote it like any big action film a guy jumps his motorcycle over 16 cars and there s a big explosion and handled the script without any thoughts about how we would actually do it in true south park fashion no individual religion or political affiliation is safe from being roasted in this election season satire to focus their gibes the filmmakers dreamed up team america an elite group of world freedom fighters who battle to save democracy against tyrannical oppression and terrorist intimidation they re sort of like the a team and james bond fused together notes pope we don t know if they re government sponsored or whatever but they basically go around solving various problems and fighting terrorism of course they manage to screw things up in as many ways as possible along the way matt and trey send up everything and everyone as in the south park movie nobody is safe and anybody can be made fun of if you re going to have satire you might as well make it all encompassing what would bruckheimer do this single idea informed many of the film s camera lighting and narrative choices the conflict of the film he continues is that kim jong il is trying to take over the world with weapons of mass destruction and he s using the chechens and al qaeda as his pawns his other lackeys are liberal film actors who don t believe in ever fighting battles and in keeping peace at any cost so on one hand matt and trey are mocking all of the high profile left wing liberals on the other hand they simultaneously make fun of the right wing american convention of going in and saving the day in the end we hope to come down someplace in the middle stone and parker took inspiration for the film from the 1960s british marionette series thunderbirds created by gerry anderson and photographed by john read team america was certainly inspired by the work that gerry anderson did stone explains he created an entire niche with all of his different marionette shows the most popular of which was thunderbirds but while those shows gave us some ideas we were not fans of them at all in fact we thought they were pretty boring which inspired us to parody the shows as well pope admits he wasn t a follower of the original puppet series either in fact i had never even seen thunderbirds he confesses my generation sort of missed it and when i did come across it i was at an age where camp didn t appeal to me however what we learned from those shows was to treat the genre seriously and not make fun of the puppets we d just design a scene as you would with any action actor and then let the puppets do it the problem is that marionettes can never quite stand up straight or move gracefully they re inherently stupid things so we didn t need to enhance that factor in fact we tried to downplay it as much as possible bill pope left confers with co director trey parker pope says he relished the opportunity to depart from his recent spate of large scale cgi laden action films devising a plan of attack for the low budgeted shoot demanded considerable r d since the puppets were being created at 1 3 scale all sorts of issues had to be addressed including set design dressing and construction miniature props the scaling down of lighting instruments and the use of camera moving platforms matt and trey had been working on this in their heads for quite a while before i was hired they even took some barbie dolls and a crew out last october to shoot a day of tests just to find out how hard it was going to be of course they quickly discovered it was quite difficult then after i was hired the original plan was to shoot for three weeks in the spring and then shut down while they went back to work on south park after that we would start up again for another four weeks in the summer to finish the movie they figured it would take about seven weeks to shoot the entire film in preparing the film we started with a small three day test shoot in february of this year as we got ready for the tests we started to realize just how long things were going to take the variables became more and more solid and we realized that to control the marionettes we were going to have to fly eight to 10 puppeteers around the set all the time to do that we would have to build bridges above the sets and fly condors overhead we also realized we would have to use some rod puppets from underneath in those instances holes would have to be drilled and grooves made in the floors on a per shot basis still even with storyboards it was difficult to anticipate everything that was needed to execute a particular shot after just three days of prep we realized it was going to be even harder and more time consuming than we thought seven weeks was a ridiculously short amount of time in which to do this type of film shooting the tests shed light on several obstacles that needed to be addressed for the main shoot we learned a lot by shooting things on a smaller scale pope reveals at 1 3 scale a small bump in the dolly track becomes much larger like a 6 on the seismic scale a 2 foot dolly move became the equivalent of a 6 foot move we also had to figure out how to get the dolly to work at 4 inches off of the ground all the time and how to make moves that were really tight additionally we had to determine how to get the lighting in close and which depth of field to work at we looked at shooting at t5 6 or t8 so that the depth of field would look roughly like it would if the puppets were life sized we also tried out shallower depths of field like t4 and t2 8 which made them look more like puppets when we screened the footage we all much preferred the fakery of shooting at t4 than at a stop that would give us more depth of field shooting at t4 was equivalent to shooting a t2 or less when shooting a 6 foot tall actor it created a very shallow depth of field the puppeteering requirements forced us into a pace that was just glacial the entire crew ended up doing a lot of crossword puzzles which were actually printed on the backside of each day s call sheet

noaa has since advised there is no tsunami threat for the area washington renagi ravu was meeting with colleagues at his home in the papua new guinea highlands sunday morning when a huge magnitude 7 6 earthquake struck ravu tried to stand up from his chair but couldn t maintain his balance and ended up in a kind of group hug with his colleagues while plates and cups crashed from his shelves to the ground his children ages 9 and 2 had their drinks and breakfast spill over ravu who is a geologist said he tried to calm everybody as the shaking continued for more than a minute the extent of the damage and whether there have been serious injuries or deaths from the quake was not clear in the immediate aftermath in the remote and underdeveloped region ravu said that about 10 000 people live in and around his town of kainantu which is located 66 kilometers 41 miles from the quake s epicenter and was the nearest big town to the quake he said there are many scattered settlements in the highlands and tens of thousands of people might have been affected he said people were feeling rattled it s a common thing that earthquakes are felt here but it usually doesn t last as long and is not as violent as this one ravu said it was quite intense on sunday morning ravu was still sorting through the damage to his home which he said likely included a broken sewer pipe judging from the smell he said friends elsewhere in kainantu had messaged him with descriptions of cracked roads broken pipes and fallen debris but hadn t described major building collapses or injuries they are starting to clean up their houses and the streets he said communication seems to have been affected he added with some cell towers likely to have fallen a magnitude 7 5 earthquake in 2018 in the nation s central region killed at least 125 people that quake hit areas that are remote and undeveloped and assessments about the scale of the damage and injuries were slow to filter out felix taranu a seismologist at the geophysical observatory in the capital port moresby said it was too early to know the impacts of sunday s earthquake although its strength meant it most likely caused considerable damage according to the u s geological survey the quake hit at 9 46 a m local time at a depth of 90 kilometers 56 miles noaa has since advised there is no tsunami threat for the area papua new guinea is located on the eastern half of the island of new guinea to the east of indonesia and north of eastern australia
new delhi september 11 ani with india banning the export of broken rice with immediate effect the supply chain for the food grain in china seems to be exacerbated as beijing is considered to be the top buyer of it under the restraining order india imposed a 20 per cent duty on exports of white and brown rice the affected rice accounts for about 60 per cent of india s total rice exports india has also banned the export of broken rice but parboiled rice and basmati rice are not included in the restriction order india is the world s largest rice exporter accounting for 40 per cent of the global rice trade india exports rice to more than 150 countries and any reduction in its shipments would increase upward pressure on food prices which are already rising because of drought heat waves and russia s invasion of ukraine at present many countries around the world are suffering from a worsening food crisis or inflation and this move by india will bring further pressure on these countries as per reports india is an important broken rice supplier to some african countries but according to an article published by china agricultural information network china is the largest buyer of indian broken rice importing 1 1 million tons of broken rice from india in 2021 india s total rice exports in 2021 reached a record 21 5 million tons more than the rice exports of the world s top four exporters thailand vietnam pakistan and the united states combined broken rice is mainly used in china as animal feed and in the production of noodles and wine the report stated india s export restrictions on rice could raise global rice prices leading to more food inflation while also adding to the chaos in the global food market caused by the russia ukraine war in stark contrast to the surge in wheat and corn prices following russia s invasion of ukraine rice has been a food item that has helped weather a bigger food crisis thanks to ample stocks but with india s latest move that may be about to change the ministry of consumer affairs food and public distribution said global demand for broken rice has risen due to the geopolitical scenario which has impacted the price movement of commodities including that animal feed rice is the third major agricultural product that the indian government has imposed export sales restrictions on this year after india had its hottest months in more than a century in march and april the government restricted exports of wheat and sugar in may india s major growing states such as uttar pradesh west bengal and bihar experienced insufficient rainfall in june and were hit by erratic rainfall in july and august leading to the reduction of rice acreage from one year to the next the ministry of agriculture said the previous 26 7 million hectares decreased by 13 per cent to more than 23 1 million hectares in the last fiscal year to march india exported about 3 8 million tons of broken rice globally accounting for about a fifth of its total non basmati rice exports from april to june exports of the cheap commodity amounted to 1 4 million tons or about a third of non basmati rice exports the new duty is likely to discourage buyers from making purchases from india and prompt them to shift towards rivals thailand and vietnam which have been struggling to increase shipments and raise prices the ban on exports assumes significance as it appears that the overall sown area under paddy this kharif season could be lower than that of last year this can have an impact on both crop prospects as well as prices going forward farmers in india have sown less paddy this kharif season kharif crops are mostly sown during monsoon june and july and the produce is harvested during october and november ani
traders are worried about the world s largest and most important government bond market as the federal reserve quickens the pace at which it removes one of its primary pandemic supports when the global economy crashed in march 2020 and markets went into free fall the u s treasury market the 25 trillion bedrock of the global financial system broke down sellers struggled to find buyers and prices whipsawed higher and lower the fed stepped in devoting trillions of dollars to steadying the market the importance of the treasury market is hard to overstate it is the main source of funding for the u s government and underpins borrowing costs around the globe for a huge variety of assets if you have a mortgage the interest rate you received was probably priced in relation to treasuries the same goes for credit cards business loans and just about anything with an interest rate attached to it the proper functioning of this market is paramount that s why even small wobbles in this market can generate huge worries at its worst a treasury trading breakdown could cause the value of the dollar stocks and other bonds to tumble economies that borrow a lot in dollars and hold treasuries in their reserves would teeter crucially the u s government could find it hard to finance itself even up to defaulting on its debt the financial equivalent of an earthquake

findings from ancillary study of phase 3 stampede trial reveal decipher prostate test is prognostic for clinical outcomes in men with high risk non metastatic and metastatic prostate cancer data support veracyte s plan to expand test availability in the u s and offer test globally as an in vitro diagnostic south san francisco calif business wire veracyte inc nasdaq vcyt announced that new data from a phase 3 trial of the multi center multi national randomized stampede platform protocol confirm the ability of the company s decipher prostate genomic classifier to identify men with advanced prostate cancer who are more likely to benefit from intensified treatment with abiraterone acetate and prednisolone aap in addition to standard of care androgen deprivation therapy abstract 13580 the findings were shared in an oral presentation today at the european society for medical oncology esmo congress 2022 and support the company s continued expansion of its high value genomic tests for patients in the united states and globally there are an increasing number of treatment options available for men with advanced prostate cancer and the challenge for physicians is determining the best treatment combination for the right patient said gerhardt attard m d ph d group leader of the treatment resistance research group at the university college london cancer institute and stampede study co investigator our findings show that the decipher prostate genomic classifier and tumor transcriptomes in general can provide robust and clinically relevant prognostic information that may help guide important decisions about the treatment of advanced prostate cancer most notably this study has identified patients who have poor prognoses and benefit greatly from addition of hormone treatment tablets while other men have a good prognosis and may be able to avoid the toxicities of treatment the decipher prostate classifier is a 22 gene prognostic biomarker that provides a score that indicates the aggressiveness of an individual patient s cancer to help healthcare professionals more accurately categorize risk and select appropriate treatment the stampede systemic therapy in advancing or metastatic prostate cancer evaluation of drug efficacy protocol involves more than 10 000 men to date with high risk non metastatic m0 or metastatic m1 prostate cancer who are starting long term androgen deprivation therapy adt for the first time and are randomized to new treatments in to date seven phase 3 trials in this post hoc analysis of the abiraterone acetate trial prof attard and colleagues evaluated the prognostic ability of the decipher prostate test among 781 men who were randomized to receive standard of care adt with or without abiraterone acetate and prednisolone aap they found that decipher was prognostic in both the m0 and m1 patients with higher decipher scores associated with worse overall survival in m1 patients and worse metastasis free survival in m0 patients additionally study findings suggest that men with high decipher scores who received aap had the greatest improvement in outcomes while those with low decipher scores received less absolute oncologic benefit from the addition of aap the decipher prostate classifier is the most validated genomic test in prostate cancer and this analysis suggests that we may be able to further expand its use to help inform often challenging decisions regarding intensification of therapy in men with advanced prostate cancer said elai davicioni ph d veracyte s medical director urology we are honored to be working with leading prostate cancer researchers around the world to help further advance precision medicine these findings from one of the most important prostate cancer clinical trials of this era further underscore our commitment to clinical rigor and innovation in our efforts to improve patient outcomes in prostate and other cancers said marc stapley veracyte s ceo they also further support our plan to deliver our high value tests including the decipher prostate genomic classifier to patients around the world among the other abstracts presented at the esmo conference researchers shared data derived from veracyte s decipher grid a database of more than 100 000 whole transcriptome profiles from patients with urologic cancers decipher grid has led to the discovery or development of more than 400 genomic signatures that can be leveraged to help advance understanding of prostate and other urologic cancers as well as to support biopharmaceutical companies targeted therapy development programs in a poster presentation today abstract 1381p researchers shared data showing that the decipher grid androgen receptor activity ar a signature is prognostic for outcomes in men with castration sensitive prostate cancer cspc that has spread to no more than three other sites in the body oligometastatic cspc or omcspc the researchers concluded that the grid ar a signature is prognostic for outcomes in men with omcspc treated with metastasis directed therapy mdt or radiotherapy and that patients with a low ar a score receive the most benefit from the addition of adt to mdt about veracyte veracyte nasdaq vcyt is a global diagnostics company that improves patient care by answering important clinical questions to inform diagnosis and treatment decisions our

in today s volatile market there s a lot to be said for seeking out boring businesses at cheap prices as 2022 has so cruelly reminded us the market doesn t always go up falling stocks are never fun for long term investors but they can create opportunities when strong companies become available at bargain prices thanks to a market that is still down somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 from its highs such deals may finally be coming available with that in mind we asked three experienced investors to pick companies that they view as absolute bargain stocks to consider buying and holding they picked sofi technologies sofi 2 87 home depot hd 1 44 and kinder morgan kmi 0 88 read on to find out why and decide for yourself if any of them represent bargains you re willing to invest in and hold for the long haul a financial suite with sweet potential eric volkman sofi my pick is a fine company whose stock has lost nearly two thirds of its value since the start of the year sofi the once red hot fintech sector has cooled considerably in recent months on fears of an economic slowdown and its potential effects on the industry to some extent that s understandable but sofi is a business well positioned to plow ahead even if the economy is sputtering that s because the company continues to relentlessly expand its slate of offerings bringing it closer to being a convenient one stop money management shop for nearly any type of client one very powerful advancement sofi made at the start of this year was the securing of government approval to operate as a national bank at a stroke running a proper banking operation draws in new customers attracted by relatively high interest rates and provides the company with a nice source of low cost financing in the form of deposits and as a company with a constantly growing menu of financial products and services sofi can cross sell a myriad of offerings to these depositors the company remains loss making but like many a successful tech flavored highflier before it sofi is narrowing its losses while still producing impressive revenue gains in its most recently reported quarter the company s 50 year over year growth in non gaap adjusted net revenue convincingly topped analyst estimates that growth train is expected to continue rolling management is guiding for similar growth in the second half of this year near term headwinds have turned home depot s stock into a bargain parkev tatevosian home depot one of my favorite bargain stocks to buy now is home depot the home improvement retailer thrived at the pandemic s onset when folks spent more time at home and wanted to upgrade their living arrangements however economies have reopened and people are spending more time away from home that s lessened the demand for home improvement projects as a result home depot s stock has been in a bit of a funk that s an excellent opportunity for long term investors to scoop up shares of this top performer at a lower valuation indeed home depot is trading at a price to earnings ratio of 17 8 barring the brief moments immediately following the pandemic s start investors have been able to buy home depot stock at the cheapest it s been in the last decade sure home depot s sales and profits have fluctuated in recent years mostly upward still home depot s results are impressive even when you look back 10 years in that time home depot has increased revenue at a compound annual rate of 7 9 simultaneously it increased earnings per share at a compound annual rate of 20 9 so investors have this opportunity to buy home depot which has proven its ability to grow sales and profits as shown above at its lowest price in the last decade unsurprisingly it s one of my favorite bargains in the market today a stalwart in an underappreciated though critical industry chuck saletta kinder morgan although there s lots of talk about shifting away from fossil fuels the reality is that there will likely be a need for oil and natural gas for decades to come indeed even as the u s energy information agency projects an aggressive uptick in the use of renewables it still expects an increase in annual demand for oil and natural gas between now and 2050 all that energy needs to move from where it s produced to where it s processed and ultimately consumed pipelines are generally among the safest and most economical ways to do that that combination of facts bodes well for kinder morgan which runs around 83 000 miles of pipelines in its north american network in addition to that strong reason to believe its services will remain in demand for decades to come kinder morgan has a very predictable revenue stream sixty three percent of its revenue comes from take or pay contracts 25 is fee based and 6 of it is hedged that leaves only 6 exposed to commodity pricing which means it has a very good handle on what it will get for its efforts that s an island of calmness in the typically volatile energy business which is known for its routine boom and bust cycles that predictability makes it a somewhat boring investment which is reflected in a stock price that trades at around 15 times its expected earnings still that predictability also means that kinder morgan can afford to pay a generous dividend which currently sits around a whopping 6 1 yield a reasonable valuation plus a healthy dividend adds up to exactly the type of company that investors may very well be buying and holding for the long term sometimes boring is good while sofi home depot and kinder morgan may not come across as the most exciting businesses in the world they each have characteristics that make them potential bargains today that could be worth holding for the long haul the thing about stock bargains though is that the market rarely leaves companies cheap for long so if you re interested now is a great time to start investigating these businesses to see for yourself if they deserve a spot in your portfolio
linda larson times writers group there s no such thing as a free lunch or so the saying goes but what if there were minnesota should offer free pre k through 12th grade school lunches all year and expand free food to cover infants last month minnesota became part of a usda pilot program that expanded free lunch to include families enrolled in medicaid now 90 000 new students will be able to lunch every day during the pandemic federal funding supported free lunch for all students that expired in june what didn t expire in june are higher prices on everything from gas to groceries to rent while an average school lunch price seems low at 3 25 take that number times five days a week for four weeks that s 65 a month for one child if a person is working for 15 an hour that s 4 3 hours of work not including payroll deductions some readers may suggest that students take a lunch from home while that can be a good solution for those with higher incomes a recent study from brandeis university found 35 of families who work full time yes full time don t make enough to cover the basics that s surprising and alarming also given the cost of groceries now how easily can a family make a nutritionally balanced meal for 3 25 it s a pretty good deal a good lunch helps students nutritionally sure but it also helps academically it may be the best way to help kids learn in an article on cbsnews com by pauleen le erin bailey the executive director of minnesota s children s cabinet said access to healthy food is tied to better education outcomes it s tied to better health minnesota s lieutenant governor peggy flanagan said as a child who relied on free and reduced price lunch and a lifelong advocate for children and families i know how much access to meals at school means to families across minnesota why should it cover everyone lunch shaming is real poverty carries a stigma for kids even if a family isn t living in poverty someone needs to remember to pay the school lunch bill what better way to end the embarrassment than every kid eats the same meal every day because of the recent hardships with the infant formula shortage let s expand free lunch to babies the recent infant formula shortage was a result of a plant closure and many families endured hardships trying to feed their babies an aug 2 article from cnn points out that while formula has become more available it s still problematic some drive long distances to get formula which adds to the cost of the already expensive formula infants are not in school so it would have to be distributed in a different way during a well child visit families could stock up on formula and baby food medical clinics and larger health organizations have more political clout than individuals which may prevent a shortage from happening again with democrats and republican divided on the federal level it comes down to our state i can understand why people may not want to expand free lunch beyond the parameters of schools but at a minimum we can invest in all school children i like many other minnesotans am ready to support the health and well being of children and a free lunch is a good start this is the opinion of linda larson a st joseph resident she is the author of grow it eat it which won a national award and a year in my garden her column is published the second sunday of the month she welcomes comments at notes4linda hotmail com

article twenty one years after the 9 11 terrorist attack that killed nearly 3 000 people one man who witnessed the atrocity firsthand and survived recounted to fox news digital his story of going to work on the world trade center s 81st floor on the morning of sept 11 2001 david paventi was working for a large bank based out of charlotte north carolina as he sat in a meeting on the 81st floor of the world trade center s north tower 21 years ago in a room with no windows he felt the room shake causing everyone in the room to look at each other at first i thought it was an earthquake because the building shifted one way and then back the other and then it started to shake paventi told fox news digital i started to go under the table because i didn t want the light to fall on me but everyone rapidly started exiting the room paventi says the next thing he remembers is someone yelling a plane hit the building as people headed for the stairs sister of 9 11 pilot who died when hijackers crashed plane into pentagon remembers patriotic hero brother the world trade center is in flames after being hit by two planes on sept 11 2001 in new york city spencer platt getty images in the stairwell there were not a lot of people coming from upstairs paventi said tells you what was going on a few flights up when paventi got down to the 70th floor he says that the narrow stairwell was backed up and he remembers that not many people were talking and that the atmosphere was eerily quiet on his two way pager that he used to get news and stock updates paventi says he learned that a jetliner had hit the tower and soon was informed that a second plane had hit the south tower in what was believed to be a terrorist attack many 9 11 first responders still fighting for health benefits 21 years later david paventi s family david paventi a couple of times we d sit there and we d look at each other thinking should we try another stairwell paventi said about the thought process he and his colleague had while waiting to escape the building knowing an attack was taking place but then it would begin moving so we ended up staying in the same stairwell paventi continued there was one

hot money outflows slow in july businessworld headlined on aug 26 2022 the bangko sentral ng pilipinas bsp collated reports by authorized agent banks aabs of transactions on short term foreign

registered through aabs are known as hot money due to the ease with which they enter and exit financial markets these investors typically want to secure the best short term rates possible leveraging

impact emerging markets the oxford business group says the interest rate hikes increase the cost of servicing us dollar denominated debt for emerging markets lead to a depreciation of their currencies weaker demand for exports in the us and potential outflows of capital from lower income economies the federal reserve itself comments that rising us interest rates are often thought to be bad news for emerging market economies emes as they increase debt burdens trigger capital outflows and generally cause a tightening of financial conditions that can lead to financial crises a key factor influencing the spillovers from us monetary policy is the domestic conditions in the emes themselves financial conditions in economies with higher macroeconomic vulnerabilities tend to be more

opportunistic behavior in times of crisis is not fair and right even for the victims of this necessary self preservation of one at the expense of another opportunism is a legitimate and respected

the fda will most likely approve this company s first drug but what comes next is more difficult to predict in the field of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als also known as lou gehrig s disease there aren t yet any approved treatments that address the disease itself this will most likely change by the end of september a panel of independent advisors to the food and drug administration meeting for the second time to discuss an experimental new als drug from amylyx pharmaceuticals amlx 1 43 recently gave it a thumbs up does the potential approval of amylyx s first drug make this biotech stock a smart buy right now let s weigh reasons to be bullish for amylyx against reasons to remain cautious for now reasons to buy amylyx now amylyx is a pre commercial biotech company in the u s and its lead candidate amx0035 is currently in a phase 3 trial expected to read out top line results late next year obviously the company would like to start selling amx0035 to als patients before phase 3 data is ready it has a chance of earning accelerated approval based on the successful results of a phase 2 trial that wrapped up in 2020 the stock looks like a buy because als currently lacks effective treatment options every year an estimated 6 000 americans are diagnosed with this degenerative neurological disorder after complaining about muscle weakness rates of decline vary but most patients lose the use of their limbs and ability to breathe independently in just three to five years after symptoms appear recently a panel of independent advisors voted 7 to 2 in favor of accelerated approval of amx0035 this is downright shocking because the same panel voted 6 to 4 against accelerated approval of the drug in march the fda doesn t have to follow the recommendations of its independent advisors but it usually lands on the same page based on the panel s new stance it s extremely likely the agency will grant accelerated approval to amx0035 for the treatment of als near the end of september first time drug launches from small companies don t always meet expectations but this one has a better than average chance of becoming a blockbuster drug there s a lot of pent up demand for the first disease modifying als drug and it could drive annual sales past the 1 billion mark in a few short years reasons to remain cautious the fda s advisory panel supported the accelerated approval of amylyx s drug based on a small smattering of new data plus a big promise from amylyx management in a nutshell the company promised to immediately end the commercial launch of amx0035 if its confirmatory trial delivers disappointing data in late 2023 drugmakers that receive accelerated approvals tend to drag out the confirmation process as long as possible nobody said it in so few words but a key reason the panel was willing to vote in favor of an accelerated approval was the unusual commitment amylyx made to the fda an ongoing 600 patient phase 3 study of amx0035 in als patients is expected to read out top line results in november 2023 and success is far from guaranteed the primary outcome measurement will be a change in the als functional rating scale after 48 weeks of treatment in a shorter phase 2 trial with fewer patients those treated with amx0035 declined at a significantly slower rate than the placebo group with a p value of 0 03 though the success was hardly a slam dunk higher p values indicate less reliable results a p value of 0 05 or higher would lead scientists to assume any difference measured is due to random chance and is not a benefit from the drug a very cautious buy now amylyx pharmaceuticals finished june with 207 million in cash after burning through 102 million in the first half of the year it s currently recording sales from an ongoing launch of its drug in canada under the brand name albrioza and a marketing authorization application is under review in europe while albrioza has a chance at succeeding a disappointing result from the ongoing phase 3 trial next november could cause the stock to implode that could be disastrous for shareholders because albrioza is the only drug the company has in clinical stage development amylyx pharmaceuticals looks like a good biotech stock to buy now just make sure it s a small piece of a well diversified portfolio

in today s volatile market there s a lot to be said for seeking out boring businesses at cheap prices as 2022 has so cruelly reminded us the market doesn t always go up falling stocks are never fun for long term investors but they can create opportunities when strong companies become available at bargain prices thanks to a market that is still down somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 from its highs such deals may finally be coming available with that in mind we asked three experienced investors to pick companies that they view as absolute bargain stocks to consider buying and holding they picked sofi technologies sofi 2 87 home depot hd 1 44 and kinder morgan kmi 0 88 read on to find out why and decide for yourself if any of them represent bargains you re willing to invest in and hold for the long haul a financial suite with sweet potential eric volkman sofi my pick is a fine company whose stock has lost nearly two thirds of its value since the start of the year sofi the once red hot fintech sector has cooled considerably in recent months on fears of an economic slowdown and its potential effects on the industry to some extent that s understandable but sofi is a business well positioned to plow ahead even if the economy is sputtering that s because the company continues to relentlessly expand its slate of offerings bringing it closer to being a convenient one stop money management shop for nearly any type of client one very powerful advancement sofi made at the start of this year was the securing of government approval to operate as a national bank at a stroke running a proper banking operation draws in new customers attracted by relatively high interest rates and provides the company with a nice source of low cost financing in the form of deposits and as a company with a constantly growing menu of financial products and services sofi can cross sell a myriad of offerings to these depositors the company remains loss making but like many a successful tech flavored highflier before it sofi is narrowing its losses while still producing impressive revenue gains in its most recently reported quarter the company s 50 year over year growth in non gaap adjusted net revenue convincingly topped analyst estimates that growth train is expected to continue rolling management is guiding for similar growth in the second half of this year near term headwinds have turned home depot s stock into a bargain parkev tatevosian home depot one of my favorite bargain stocks to buy now is home depot the home improvement retailer thrived at the pandemic s onset when folks spent more time at home and wanted to upgrade their living arrangements however economies have reopened and people are spending more time away from home that s lessened the demand for home improvement projects as a result home depot s stock has been in a bit of a funk that s an excellent opportunity for long term investors to scoop up shares of this top performer at a lower valuation indeed home depot is trading at a price to earnings ratio of 17 8 barring the brief moments immediately following the pandemic s start investors have been able to buy home depot stock at the cheapest it s been in the last decade sure home depot s sales and profits have fluctuated in recent years mostly upward still home depot s results are impressive even when you look back 10 years in that time home depot has increased revenue at a compound annual rate of 7 9 simultaneously it increased earnings per share at a compound annual rate of 20 9 so investors have this opportunity to buy home depot which has proven its ability to grow sales and profits as shown above at its lowest price in the last decade unsurprisingly it s one of my favorite bargains in the market today a stalwart in an underappreciated though critical industry chuck saletta kinder morgan although there s lots of talk about shifting away from fossil fuels the reality is that there will likely be a need for oil and natural gas for decades to come indeed even as the u s energy information agency projects an aggressive uptick in the use of renewables it still expects an increase in annual demand for oil and natural gas between now and 2050 all that energy needs to move from where it s produced to where it s processed and ultimately consumed pipelines are generally among the safest and most economical ways to do that that combination of facts bodes well for kinder morgan which runs around 83 000 miles of pipelines in its north american network in addition to that strong reason to believe its services will remain in demand for decades to come kinder morgan has a very predictable revenue stream sixty three percent of its revenue comes from take or pay contracts 25 is fee based and 6 of it is hedged that leaves only 6 exposed to commodity pricing which means it has a very good handle on what it will get for its efforts that s an island of calmness in the typically volatile energy business which is known for its routine boom and bust cycles that predictability makes it a somewhat boring investment which is reflected in a stock price that trades at around 15 times its expected earnings still that predictability also means that kinder morgan can afford to pay a generous dividend which currently sits around a whopping 6 1 yield a reasonable valuation plus a healthy dividend adds up to exactly the type of company that investors may very well be buying and holding for the long term sometimes boring is good while sofi home depot and kinder morgan may not come across as the most exciting businesses in the world they each have characteristics that make them potential bargains today that could be worth holding for the long haul the thing about stock bargains though is that the market rarely leaves companies cheap for long so if you re interested now is a great time to start investigating these businesses to see for yourself if they deserve a spot in your portfolio
among six high profile stock splits alphabet amazon tesla shopify dexcom and palo alto networks is a clear cut bargain as well as a company with serious red flags it s been a historic year for wall street for all the wrong reasons we ve watched the broad based s p 500 and growth focused nasdaq composite plunge into a bear market on the heels of historically high inflation back to back quarterly declines in u s gross domestic product and russia s invasion of ukraine which further compromises the global energy supply chain yet amid this tumultuous year everyday investors have found a source of positivity from stock split stocks stock split euphoria has taken over wall street a stock split is a mechanism that allows a publicly traded company to alter its share price and outstanding share count without affecting its market cap or operations a forward stock split can make shares more nominally affordable for everyday investors who don t have access to fractional share purchases with their online broker meanwhile reverse stock splits can boost a company s share price to ensure it remains compliant for listing on one of the major u s exchanges most investors get excited about forward stock splits because a company wouldn t be conducting a forward split if its share price hadn t risen significant and a company s share price wouldn t soar if it weren t out innovating its competition and executing well in 2022 a half dozen high profile forward stock splits have been announced and or taken place the common theme propelling interest in these stock split stocks is that they re industry leaders or at worst major players alphabet is the parent company of internet search engine google and streaming platform youtube the former controls 91 of global search share while the latter is the second most visited social site on the planet amazon is expected to bring in nearly 40 of all online retail sales in the u s this year and its cloud service segment amazon web services aws accounts for a 31 share of global cloud spending tesla is the top selling electric vehicle ev manufacturer in north america the company is on pace to deliver over 1 million evs this year and has pushed into recurring profitability shopify is one of the world s leading cloud based e commerce platforms with the company estimating an addressable market of 153 billion solely from small businesses dexcom has consistently been the world s no 1 or 2 provider of continuous glucose monitoring systems for diabetics in the u s nearly half the adult population has diabetes or pre diabetes palo alto networks is one of the leading cybersecurity companies that s been steadily shifting to a cloud based software as a service operating model yet among these top tier stock split stocks one stands out as a screaming buy while another has serious warning flags surrounding it the stock split stock to buy hand over fist alphabet there s little question that the top stock split stock for investors to buy hand over fist right now is alphabet the parent company of google youtube and autonomous driving company waymo although concerns about weaker ad spending could adversely affect alphabet in the very short term this is a company that brings sustained competitive advantages to the table alphabet s foundation for more than two decades is internet search engine google according to data from globalstats google has accounted for between 91 and 93 of global internet search share for the trailing two year period having a veritable monopoly on search allows google to command excellent ad pricing power and generate an incredible amount of cash flow but what the investing community should be most excited about is what alphabet is doing with all the cash it s generating for instance the company is aggressively investing in its rapidly growing cloud infrastructure service google cloud though aws is the current king of cloud services google cloud ended june with an 8 global share of cloud spending by the midpoint of the decade this could be a serious cash flow driver for alphabet in addition to cloud alphabet is leaning on streaming platform youtube which is attracting 2 48 billion monthly active users as you can imagine such robust engagement has helped the company s ad pricing power and boosted subscription revenue in ad revenue alone youtube is nearing a 30 billion annual sales run rate alphabet has even turned to share repurchases as a way to boost shareholder value given its robust cash flow in april the company s board of directors authorized a 70 billion share buyback the cherry on the sundae is that alphabet is cheaper now than it s ever been as a publicly traded company investors can buy shares of alphabet for just 18 times wall street s consensus forecast earnings in 2023 even with the strong likelihood of persistent double digit sales growth throughout the decade the stock split stock investors should avoid like the plague tesla on the other end of the spectrum is a stock split stock that should be avoided at all costs ev maker tesla obviously tesla wouldn t have attained a trillion dollar valuation if it wasn t doing something right despite semiconductor chip shortages and china s zero covid strategy adversely impacting production at the shanghai gigafactory the company is profitable on a recurring basis and on pace to deliver more than 1 million evs this year optimists also point to ceo elon musk as a reason for tesla s amazing performance since its initial public offering in 2010 musk is a visionary that s brought four ev models into production and helped diversify tesla into energy storage products and solar panel installation however i believe this perceived upside catalyst to be the biggest risk to tesla over time elon musk has become a legal financial and operating risk to his company that can t be overlooked any longer from his potentially distracting takeover of twitter to his questionable tweets that seem to draw the ire of the securities and exchange commission from time to time musk has proved to be a significant liability what s arguably even more concerning has been tesla s inability to meet or exceed musk s forecasts though musk regularly touts the upcoming release of new evs or innovations virtually every planned release date gets pushed back sometimes indefinitely that s a big problem when a sizable portion of tesla s valuation is based on these new innovations becoming reality the other major issue with tesla is its valuation whereas auto stocks are typically valued at a single digit forward year price to earnings multiple investors are currently paying 54 times wall street s consensus earnings for the upcoming year to own shares of tesla not only is tesla s business every bit as cyclical as traditional automakers but the company s competitive advantages in the ev space are already being chipped away by new and legacy companies as an example relatively new entrant nio introduced two ev sedans the et7 and et5 that can handily outpace tesla s flagship sedans model 3 and model s in range with the top available battery pack upgrade the luster that made tesla a game changer looks to be wearing off
new delhi september 11 ani with india banning the export of broken rice with immediate effect the supply chain for the food grain in china seems to be exacerbated as beijing is considered to be the top buyer of it under the restraining order india imposed a 20 per cent duty on exports of white and brown rice the affected rice accounts for about 60 per cent of india s total rice exports india has also banned the export of broken rice but parboiled rice and basmati rice are not included in the restriction order india is the world s largest rice exporter accounting for 40 per cent of the global rice trade india exports rice to more than 150 countries and any reduction in its shipments would increase upward pressure on food prices which are already rising because of drought heat waves and russia s invasion of ukraine at present many countries around the world are suffering from a worsening food crisis or inflation and this move by india will bring further pressure on these countries as per reports india is an important broken rice supplier to some african countries but according to an article published by china agricultural information network china is the largest buyer of indian broken rice importing 1 1 million tons of broken rice from india in 2021 india s total rice exports in 2021 reached a record 21 5 million tons more than the rice exports of the world s top four exporters thailand vietnam pakistan and the united states combined broken rice is mainly used in china as animal feed and in the production of noodles and wine the report stated india s export restrictions on rice could raise global rice prices leading to more food inflation while also adding to the chaos in the global food market caused by the russia ukraine war in stark contrast to the surge in wheat and corn prices following russia s invasion of ukraine rice has been a food item that has helped weather a bigger food crisis thanks to ample stocks but with india s latest move that may be about to change the ministry of consumer affairs food and public distribution said global demand for broken rice has risen due to the geopolitical scenario which has impacted the price movement of commodities including that animal feed rice is the third major agricultural product that the indian government has imposed export sales restrictions on this year after india had its hottest months in more than a century in march and april the government restricted exports of wheat and sugar in may india s major growing states such as uttar pradesh west bengal and bihar experienced insufficient rainfall in june and were hit by erratic rainfall in july and august leading to the reduction of rice acreage from one year to the next the ministry of agriculture said the previous 26 7 million hectares decreased by 13 per cent to more than 23 1 million hectares in the last fiscal year to march india exported about 3 8 million tons of broken rice globally accounting for about a fifth of its total non basmati rice exports from april to june exports of the cheap commodity amounted to 1 4 million tons or about a third of non basmati rice exports the new duty is likely to discourage buyers from making purchases from india and prompt them to shift towards rivals thailand and vietnam which have been struggling to increase shipments and raise prices the ban on exports assumes significance as it appears that the overall sown area under paddy this kharif season could be lower than that of last year this can have an impact on both crop prospects as well as prices going forward farmers in india have sown less paddy this kharif season kharif crops are mostly sown during monsoon june and july and the produce is harvested during october and november ani

the heinous cost of college is getting even worse don t miss these critical tools to keep it under control faced with rising costs colleges across the country are raising the price of either tuition living expenses or both if you re a student or paying for one you might be wondering how you re going to afford it the big drivers of inflation energy costs food costs rising wages of course hit colleges because they re paying salaries they re providing room and board they re heating buildings says ann garcia a financial adviser and author of how to pay for college just look at brown university which is raising its undergraduate price by 4 2 the largest increase in 14 years the university of virginia will raise its tuition 4 7 this year and 3 7 next year the rising cost of college isn t a new trend by any means the cost of a four year postsecondary program went up nearly 170 from 1980 to 2019 according to a report by georgetown university but some schools are pushing up prices well above the historical average factor in the rising price of borrowing money and students can t afford to make careless decisions mapping out their college years luckily there are a few key tools you can use to help you decide what you can afford and how you can afford it don t miss if you owe 25k in student loans there are ways to pay them off faster too many americans are still missing out on cheaper car insurance a tiktoker paid off 17 000 in credit card debt by cash stuffing can it work for you not the same old story today s students often have more expenses than people realize partially because many no longer fit the classic image of a college student says michele streeter senior director of college affordability at the institute of college access and success ticas students are now often older and have the financial responsibilities that come along with that they need to find ways to cover all of their other life responsibilities says streeter which could include child care or missing out on earnings if they ve left a job i think everyone other than the very wealthiest students in the country are probably rightfully concerned about how to cover all these costs additionally the cost of student loans has gone up as the federal reserve raises interest rates to combat inflation a federal student loan taken out before july would have an interest rate of 3 7 for its life but loans taken out after july 1 have a rate of 4 99 the good news is if students and their families are strategic about where they go and how they pay they can find ways to finance an education without taking on debt that will weigh them down for decades outline your options for financial aid two tools can be particularly beneficial when figuring out how to pay for college the first is the student aid estimator on the department of education website which will give you an estimate of the federal aid you are eligible to receive you type in all your financial information and it will give you an estimate of your expected family contribution which is the amount of money that the federal methodology says you should be able to pay for college says garcia it s possible you could be eligible for aid at some colleges and not others think of a family whose expected family contribution is 35 000 they re not going to be eligible for needs based aid at public colleges but they will be private colleges she says scope out the colleges you re interested in the other essential tool is the net price calculator which every college is required to have on its website it will show how much your family will be expected to pay for that university and estimate how much scholarship money you could be eligible for i always tell people don t apply to any college you haven t done the net price calculator for it says garcia because that s really your best indicator of what that college is going to cost you and that range can vary widely college to college it s just a matter of how colleges price and discount their services based on the students that they want to bring in says garcia if an institution wants to diversify says garcia then it will likely offer more needs based funding for students while a college that wants to move up in the u s rankings is going to offer merit scholarships sadly it s up to students and their families to do the legwork to find out garcia says shake off scholarship misconceptions while many people think of merit scholarships as being for high caliber athletes and students garcia says that s a misconception if you re not eligible for scholarships on the basis of need chances are good that there s some college out there that will offer you a scholarship on the basis of merit garcia suggests letting your financial situation guide your choice of school many colleges are extraordinarily generous to students with high financial needs others are not says garcia so it s not enough to just have a low expected family contribution you have to find what colleges will meet your financial need fill out your federal aid form in addition to scholarships billions of dollars are consistently left on the table because many students don t fill out their federal student aid fafsa forms says streeter filing the fafsa is the way that you become eligible for needs based financial aid but just filing it doesn t guarantee that you re going to get any says garcia and because the filing process is very long and complicated like every part of trying to pay for college it seems many people don t end up completing it it can seem like a daunting task to try to pay for college these days but knowing what you ll actually be expected to pay and where you can potentially make up the difference could save you a lot of money in the long run we have let the stanfords and harvards drive the narrative which is it s really hard to go and you should be super grateful that they even accepted you says garcia the vast majority of colleges are actively trying to recruit and enroll students what to read next high prices rising interest rates and a volatile stock market here s why you need a financial advisor as a recession looms you

it s 1am on the west coast of america but the emerald cloud lab just south of san francisco is still busy here more than 100 items of high end bioscience equipment whirr away on workbenches largely unmanned 24 hours a day and seven days a week performing experiments for researchers from around the world i m visiting via the camera on a chest high telepresence robot being driven round the 1 400 sq metre 15 000 sq ft lab by emerald s ceo brian frezza who is also sitting at home there are no actual scientists anywhere just a few staff in blue coats quietly following instructions from screens on their trolleys ensuring the instruments are loaded with reagents and samples cloud labs mean anybody anywhere can conduct experiments by remote control using nothing more than their web browser experiments are programmed through a subscription based online interface software then coordinates robots and automated scientific instruments to perform the experiment and process the data friday night is emerald s busiest time of the week as scientists schedule experiments to run while they relax with their families over the weekend there are still some things robots can t do for example lifting giant carboys containers for liquids or unwrapping samples sent by mail and there are a few instruments that just can t be automated hence the people in blue coats who look a little like pickers in an amazon warehouse it turns out that they are in fact mostly former amazon employees plugging an experiment into a browser forces researchers to translate the exact details of every step into unambiguous code emerald originally employed scientists and lab technicians to help the facility run smoothly but they were creatively stifled with so little to do poaching amazon employees has turned out to be an improvement we pay them twice what they were getting at amazon to do something way more fulfilling than stuffing toilet paper into boxes says frezza you re keeping someone s drug discovery experiment running at full speed further south in the san francisco bay area are two more cloud labs run by the company strateos racks of gleaming life science instruments incubators mixers mass spectrometers pcr machines sit humming inside large perspex boxes known as workcells the setup is arguably even more futuristic than at emerald here reagents and samples whizz to the correct workcell on hi tech magnetic conveyor belts and are gently loaded into place by dextrous robot arms researchers experiments are delocalised as strateos s executive director of operations marc siladi puts it view image in fullscreen the emerald cloud lab in south san francisco the laboratories are equipped with more than 200 types of scientific instrument that can be controlled remotely from a software command centre photograph emerald cloud automation in science is nothing new especially in fields such as molecular biology where much of the experimental work involves the laborious and repetitive transfer of tiny quantities of liquid from one vial to another the disruption caused by the pandemic also encouraged a number of specialist facilities to develop ways to operate their equipment remotely the beams of the uk s powerful diamond light source for example a particle accelerator that generates ultra high energy radiation to investigate matter can now be operated by users from anywhere in the world and outsourcing difficult or time consuming elements of the experimental process is not new either but emerald and strateos are different these are the world s first laboratories that in theory allow anyone with a laptop and credit card to pay and play with the entire reagent inventory and suite of instrumentation available in a world class research facility the appeal of this approach became obvious during the pandemic when many researchers were unable to visit their own labs in person the founders of cloud labs say this is the future of life science the most obvious benefit is productivity researchers can conduct several experiments at once and queue them up to run overnight or while they do other things our pro users they ll do the work of 10 scientists in a traditional lab says frezza they ll crank ridiculous numbers there s no time spent setting up and tearing down equipment cleaning up maintaining and fixing instruments or replenishing stock arctoris a remote operated drug discovery lab in oxfordshire says its platform has completed projects for pharmaceutical companies in 24 hours that might take at least a week in a traditional setting instead of pipetting for hours each day researchers can spend more time thinking reading and analysing results with colleagues scientists at pittsburgh s carnegie mellon university were so impressed by what staff and students could do at the emerald cloud lab one researcher managed to recreate years of his phd experimentation in a matter of weeks that they recently asked the company to build another one just for them with a year s worth of access to a cloud lab often costing less than the price of a single piece of high end lab equipment the dean of carnegie mellon s college of science rebecca doerge says the model could be transformational i m not interested in just changing science at carnegie mellon i m interested in changing the process of science worldwide she says of the new facility in pittsburgh we all have colleagues in under resourced places that can t do the science that they re capable of just because they don t have enough money so with an internet connection and access to a cloud lab this is a game changer view image in fullscreen a strateos smart lab in san diego the company claims to have reimagined the laboratory as a smart data generation centre photograph strateos doerge a statistician turned science administrator is also excited about removing variation and human error from experimental work there will be no scientists based at the new 1 500 sq metre 16 000 sq ft site just half a dozen technicians helping the place run 24 hours a day people still go to wet labs and they still stand there and they make mistakes i don t think that everything is automatable in science i m not saying that i m just saying that the repetitive stuff once you learn it you don t need to stand there and do it over and over and over again scientists such as doerge believe the precision of remote operated labs could help fix what has become known as science s reproducibility crisis the worrying revelation that the results of troves of published research can t be replicated when different groups of scientists follow the same methods exactly plugging an experiment into a browser to be performed by robots forces researchers to translate the exact details of every step into unambiguous code for example what once might have been described in a scientific paper as mix the samples becomes detailed computer instructions for a certain machine to mix at a certain number of rotations a minute for a certain time other factors that could affect the result such as the ambient temperature at the time are captured in the metadata even though we must remember most people come from a good place there are some pretty crazy people out there too as doerge has encouraged more and more research and even teaching at carnegie mellon to be transferred to the remote labs not all of her colleagues have been supportive many scientists think that working alongside colleagues at the bench and the sights and sounds of experimentation are what help generate exciting ideas and happy accidents others have concerns about the quality of data produced in labs they ve never set foot in if i don t see it with my own eyes it doesn t exist i ve heard that from some of the senior faculty members says doerge it s a mindset shift for sure some experts believe that making access to sophisticated labs this easy is a potential biosecurity or bioterrorism threat in theory small groups or even individuals with no research experience could use a cloud lab to start performing complex biological experiments the labs are saying they only work with trusted partners but of course they are very keen to open their market says dr filippa lentzos an expert in biological risk and biosecurity at king s college london even though we must remember most people come from a good place there are some pretty crazy people out there too barriers are most definitely coming down if you want to deliberately do something harmful cloud labs say that they review all scheduled experiments and have systems to flag or reject any that appear illegal or dangerous plus they argue the complete digitisation of everything happening in the lab actually makes it easier to record and monitor what people are doing than in a traditional lab paul freemont co founder of the uk innovation and knowledge centre for synthetic biology has helped develop several highly automated labs in the uk including a robotic platform that was able to conduct more than 1 000 covid tests a day early in the pandemic he is not sure that remote operated labs are yet mature enough to replicate what is available to scientists who set up their own automated equipment i like the concept and think this is the way science is going to go it would work if we had all the necessary protocols and workflows that a biologist might need but i think that s not currently available to the level of complexity and detail that one needs view image in fullscreen scientists from carnegie mellon university the institution has asked emerald to build it a dedicated cloud lab photograph tim kaulen carnegie mellon university freemont also has concerns about scientists not truly understanding or engaging with the software or the hardware that generates their data you have to have the next generation of scientists understand how to build all this infrastructure themselves and how to work with it you have to have some hands on experience surely the potential for a few labs or big private companies to monopolise that understanding i don t think would be very healthy despite these concerns the appetite for cloud science is growing emerald is expanding capacity to keep up with demand mostly from pharmaceutical companies and biotech startups strateos is working with the us research agency darpa to study in detail how its facilities can improve reproducibility and efficiency of previous experiments and the company is also licensing its software so that other institutions can convert their facilities in future cloud labs may even decide what experiments to do themselves as google s deepmind platform has recently proved machine learning tools can now gobble up decades worth of data and spit out answers to questions that would take scientists many years to solve with physical inquiry pharmaceutical companies are increasingly using these tools to simulate molecular interactions in their search for new drugs data generated through cloud labs which translate biology into an information technology would only make these tools more powerful combining all these technologies could one day lead to systems that can develop theories and physically test them without human input already some advanced emerald cloud lab users have developed algorithms that adjust the parameters or direction of the next experiment based on their own data analysis it s kind of wild stuff very futuristic says frezza all this means scientists are the latest profession to ask what the move towards automation and ai means for the future could more traditional research scientists one day find themselves out of a job it s unlikely after all we ll always need people to prioritise which questions need answering and develop new ways to answer them but the days of sitting at a bench in a white coat and gloves beside the flame of a bunsen burner may soon be a thing of the past the era of the robot researcher is coming

new delhi september 11 ani with india banning the export of broken rice with immediate effect the supply chain for the food grain in china seems to be exacerbated as beijing is considered to be the top buyer of it under the restraining order india imposed a 20 per cent duty on exports of white and brown rice the affected rice accounts for about 60 per cent of india s total rice exports india has also banned the export of broken rice but parboiled rice and basmati rice are not included in the restriction order india is the world s largest rice exporter accounting for 40 per cent of the global rice trade india exports rice to more than 150 countries and any reduction in its shipments would increase upward pressure on food prices which are already rising because of drought heat waves and russia s invasion of ukraine at present many countries around the world are suffering from a worsening food crisis or inflation and this move by india will bring further pressure on these countries as per reports india is an important broken rice supplier to some african countries but according to an article published by china agricultural information network china is the largest buyer of indian broken rice importing 1 1 million tons of broken rice from india in 2021 india s total rice exports in 2021 reached a record 21 5 million tons more than the rice exports of the world s top four exporters thailand vietnam pakistan and the united states combined broken rice is mainly used in china as animal feed and in the production of noodles and wine the report stated india s export restrictions on rice could raise global rice prices leading to more food inflation while also adding to the chaos in the global food market caused by the russia ukraine war in stark contrast to the surge in wheat and corn prices following russia s invasion of ukraine rice has been a food item that has helped weather a bigger food crisis thanks to ample stocks but with india s latest move that may be about to change the ministry of consumer affairs food and public distribution said global demand for broken rice has risen due to the geopolitical scenario which has impacted the price movement of commodities including that animal feed rice is the third major agricultural product that the indian government has imposed export sales restrictions on this year after india had its hottest months in more than a century in march and april the government restricted exports of wheat and sugar in may india s major growing states such as uttar pradesh west bengal and bihar experienced insufficient rainfall in june and were hit by erratic rainfall in july and august leading to the reduction of rice acreage from one year to the next the ministry of agriculture said the previous 26 7 million hectares decreased by 13 per cent to more than 23 1 million hectares in the last fiscal year to march india exported about 3 8 million tons of broken rice globally accounting for about a fifth of its total non basmati rice exports from april to june exports of the cheap commodity amounted to 1 4 million tons or about a third of non basmati rice exports the new duty is likely to discourage buyers from making purchases from india and prompt them to shift towards rivals thailand and vietnam which have been struggling to increase shipments and raise prices the ban on exports assumes significance as it appears that the overall sown area under paddy this kharif season could be lower than that of last year this can have an impact on both crop prospects as well as prices going forward farmers in india have sown less paddy this kharif season kharif crops are mostly sown during monsoon june and july and the produce is harvested during october and november ani
