washington president joe biden on wednesday signed an executive order on government oversight of cryptocurrency that urges the federal reserve to explore whether the central bank should create its own digital currency treasury secretary janet yellen said the effort would promote a fairer more inclusive and more efficient financial system while countering illicit finance and preventing risks to financial stability and national security the biden administration views the explosive popularity of cryptocurrency as an opportunity to examine the risks and benefits of digital assets said a senior administration official who previewed the order tuesday on the condition of anonymity terms set by the white house under the executive order biden also directed the treasury department and other federal agencies to study the impact of cryptocurrency on financial stability and national security brian deese and jake sullivan biden s top economic and national security advisers respectively said the order establishes the first comprehensive federal digital assets strategy for the united states that will help position the u s to keep playing a leading role in the innovation and governance of the digital assets ecosystem at home and abroad in a way that protects consumers is consistent with our democratic values and advances u s global competitiveness deese and sullivan said wednesday in a joint statement the action comes as lawmakers and administration officials are increasingly voicing concern that russia may be using cryptocurrency to avoid the impact of sanctions imposed on its banks oligarchs and oil industry because of the invasion of ukraine last week democratic sens elizabeth warren mark warner and jack reed asked the treasury department to provide information on how it intends to inhibit cryptocurrency use for sanctions evasion the biden administration has argued that russia won t be able to make up for the loss of u s and european business by turning to cryptocurrency officials said the democratic president s order had been in the works for months before russia s vladimir putin invaded ukraine last month daleep singh a deputy national security and economic adviser to biden told cnn on wednesday that crypto s really not a workaround for our sanctions the executive order had been widely anticipated by the finance industry crypto traders speculators and lawmakers who have compared the cryptocurrency market to the wild west despite the risks the government said surveys show that roughly 16 of adult americans or 40 million people have invested in cryptocurrencies and 43 of men ages 18 29 have put their money into cryptocurrency coinbase global inc the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the united states said the company had not seen a recent surge in sanctions evasion activity yellen said last week that many participants in the cryptocurrency networks are subjected to anti money laundering sanctions and that the industry is not completely one where things can be evaded as for the federal reserve getting involved with digital assets the central bank issued a paper in january that said a digital currency would best serve the needs of the country through a model in which banks or payment firms create accounts or digital wallets some participants in digital currency welcome the idea of more government involvement with crypto adam zarazinski ceo of inca digital a crypto data company that does work for several federal agencies said the order presents the opportunity to provide new approaches to finance the u s has an interest in growing financial innovation zarazinski said he added that china and russia were looking at crypto and building their own currency more than 100 countries have begun or are piloting their own digital sovereign currency according to the white house katherine dowling general counsel for bitwise asset management a cryptocurrency asset management firm said an executive order that provides more legal clarity on government oversight would be a long term positive for crypto but hilary allen a financial regulation professor at american university cautioned against moving too fast to embrace cryptocurrencies i think crypto is a place where we should be putting the brakes on this innovation until it s better understood she said as crypto becomes more integrated into our financial system it creates vulnerabilities not just to those who are investing in crypto but for everybody who participates in our economy on tuesday the treasury department said its financial literacy arm would work to develop consumer friendly materials to help people make informed choices about digital assets history has shown that without adequate safeguards forms of private money have the potential to pose risks to consumers and the financial system said nellie liang undersecretary for domestic finance bitcoin and cryptocurrency related stocks got a boost wednesday following biden s executive order the price of bitcoin was up 9 8 at 42 211 according to coindesk shares in cryptocurrency exchange coinbase global surged 9 3 in midday trading while online brokerage robinhood markets rose 4 5

new york a bank s decision to loan donald trump s company us 100 million is the latest evidence the former president might survive fraud investigations and a business world backlash over his efforts to stay in office after losing the 2020 election san diego based axos bank finalized the loan with the trump organization on feb 17 according to documents filed with the city tuesday that s just three days after public revelations that the republican s longtime accountants had disavowed a decade s worth of his financial statements amid allegations by new york s attorney general that they had exaggerated his wealth the axos loan is being used to pay back an old loan backed by commercial space at trump tower that was coming due in september a year ago it looked possible that trump might become a pariah after his supporters stormed the u s capitol in an attempt to stop a vote certifying president joe biden s election win banks insurers and other business partners all cut ties following the riot last year the trump organization was indicted in new york on charges it helped executives evade taxes and for two years the company has been the subject of civil and criminal investigations by new york attorney general letitia james and the manhattan district attorney but in the fall trump struck a deal to sell his washington hotel for far more than expected and a partnership he s involved with that owns two office towers recently took out new loans for far more than needed to pay off old ones coming due he bounces back says barbara res a former trump organization executive who is not a fan and even urged people not to vote for him if a guy brings me a property with good cash flow a good location and good tenants why do i care what his politics are says mike offit a former deutsche bank lender to trump who now consults on real estate finance trump has good buildings and manages them well the trump organization declined to disclose the interest rate on the new loan and other terms axos citing customer privacy rules would not comment asked for comment for this story one of trump s sons lashed out at journalists for depicting the family company as struggling we should have never been underestimated eric trump said in an emailed statement adding we have very low debt are sitting on tremendous amount of cash and have extremely profitable properties assessing the trump organization s overall financial health is challenging given that it is a private company that releases few figures publicly during his presidency trump s name was stripped off hotels and residential towers in several cities his scottish golf course lost millions and condos in his apartment buildings have been selling at deep discounts coronavirus shutdowns added to the trouble revenue at the company s biggest golf property the doral outside of miami plunged us 33 million in the two years through 2021 down 44 percent according to financial records obtained by a government ethics agency then came the capitol riots and a rush to exits as trump s longtime commercial office broker his two biggest lenders the pga of america and others cut ties the company helping him shop around his washington hotel severed its relationship too after removing it from the market for a lack of demand new york city announced it was canceling all city contracts with trump including the rights to operate a public golf course in the bronx eric trump branded the city s move a product of cancel culture and vowed to fight it the city s decision to kick trump off the course has been tied up in court and now several months after trump was supposed to leave he is still running it his name spelled out on a hillside in giant paving stones seen from miles away the trump organization says that it will go but that the city has to pay it us 30 million first meanwhile trump s biggest office buildings though suffering have not seen a widescale exodus of tenants one of its biggest commercial tenants gucci decided last year to extend its trump tower lease for another 16 years according to financial documents from commercial lending research firm trepp that building pulled in us 19 million in revenue in the first nine months of last year down from previous years but enough to pay expenses and interest axos previously made loans backed by at least two properties owned by the kushner cos the family real estate firm once run by trump son in law and white house adviser jared kushner the bank also benefited from a policy change in the trump administration allowing high interest loans the trump tower loan follows other deals to refinance mortgages on a building in san francisco and for a sixth avenue tower in new york both 30 percent owned by the trump organization and 70 percent owned by publicly traded real estate giant vornado on at least one of those deals arranged by vornado the partnership borrowed more money than it owed on the old loan and trump s share of that extra cash could have been as much as us 200 million based on the size of his stake trump s company still has plenty of other loans to refinance including a us 125 million one involving doral due next year more than a dozen hotel brokers and experts who talked to the associated press in recent months had estimated trump was unlikely to make money off a sale of his long term lease of the old post office building a federal property he started turning into a hotel nearly a decade ago but then a miami firm joined with former yankees star alex rodriguez to offer us 375 million for the money losing property the deal still needs to be approved by a federal agency overseeing the building mar a lago trump s property in palm beach florida is doing brisk business too with initiation fees rising as gop groups and politicians regularly hold events there in hopes of a visit from the president and possibly a coveted imprimatur trump s social media company aiming to take on twitter had a botched launch full of glitches and freezes as people who had signed up were locked out and left fuming still investors have kept the stock of the company tied to the truth social app aloft in the belief that he will prevail against the naysayers at current prices trump s personal stake could be worth billions

elita chikwati senior agriculture reporter preparations for the opening of the 2022 tobacco marketing season are advanced with prices expected to firm due to anticipated reduced volumes this year auction floors will open on march 30 while contract sales will start on march 31 the bulk of the tobacco will be sold through contract floors as 118 465 registered farmers are contracted while 4 530 self financed growers will sell through the auction floors ninety five percent of the tobacco is produced under contract system while 5 percent farmers are self funded this season tobacco farmers will be paid 75 percent of their sales proceeds in foreign currency and the remaining 25 percent in local currency converted at the prevailing auction exchange rate on the day of sale the 75 percent will be paid directly into the growers foreign currency accounts and this is treated as free funds while 25 percent local currency will be deposited into the growers local bank accounts or e wallets there will be strict covid 19 regulations at all auction and contract floors to curb the spread of the disease auction floors are required to consolidate tobacco deliveries to minimise the number of farmers coming to harare briefing journalists on the state of preparedness yesterday timb chief executive mr meanwell gudu said prices were expected to improve this season due to increased demand brazil is likely to be 80 million kilogrammes short of their usual production level because of drought this creates less competition for us india has fixed its 2021 22 production of flue cured virginia up to 270 million kilogrammes against 236 million kg in the previous year top quality tobacco grades for premium brands are likely to remain unchanged 3 5 5 40 kg in prices compared to last season the high end market for this grade has reached its ceiling in price increase the major market for these grades is in china and there are no indications to change prices upwards he said mr gudu said brazil had an almost similar flavour to zimbabwe but faces challenges in consistency in the supply of orders and some changes in flavour due to sometimes natural disasters like floods due to anticipated reduced volumes in zimbabwe this season there will be more pressure on the demand side to take the crop which should naturally increase prices upwards this is likely to be experienced in the medium to filler grades some kind of hoarding of tobacco is likely to happen that may influence prices to be better because of disruptions in logistics caused by covid 19 supply chains were disrupted from 2020 into 2021 due to shortage of vessels and closure of some shipping lines now that the world has lifted the covid 19 restrictions and uncertainty in the possibilities of other waves customers are likely going to grab this opportunity to stock up their tobacco thereby increasing artificial demand he said timb acting chief operations officer mr blessing dhokotera said 122 995 growers had registered with the timb for the season compared to 145 000 farmers during the same period last year of the registered growers 607 are registering for the first time compared to 1 600 last season mr dhokotera attributed the decline in registered growers to strict measures taken by timb to ensure compliance to regulations timb has licensed 33 contractors compared to 39 past year 33 a class buyers compared to 31 last season and we have also licensed suppliers for wrapping paper prices on auction floors will be determined by the bidding process the highest bid being the final price on every tobacco bale a grade price matrix derived from the average grade prices from the previous day auction sales will determine the floor price for every grade on the contract sales he said head of inspectorate mr saviour muvirimi said timb had put in place measures to curb sidemarketing we introduced an inspectorate department to curb illegal activities including sidemarketing we are urging farmers to deliver their crop to their contractors we have also engaged contractors to only buy from their contracted growers and we have recruited informers to have information on illegal activities on sidemarketing he said the 2021 22 tobacco was affected by late rains the irrigated crop is medium to heavy bodied predominantly lemon in colour and reflecting a fair to good quality the main dryland crop is medium bodied in the commercial sector whilst being light to medium bodied in the smallholder sector the late dryland crop has poor stand due to prolonged dry spell which was experienced post planting time towards end of december

a group of senior retired us military officers and former chiefs of defense of three eastern european countries are advocating for supplying the ukrainian military with air defense capabilities to defend against attacks by the russian air force according to an open letter obtained by cnn supplying the ukrainians with such weaponry would be effective in allowing them to shoot down aircraft or missiles in their airspace and it is something that ukrainians have specially asked the us and western countries to provide the purpose of this letter is to urge in the strongest possible sense immediate action to provide the ukrainian armed forces with a viable mid and high altitude air defense capability they need immediate reconstitution of their capability to defend themselves against air attacks from the russian air force the retired military officials write we cannot stand idly by and wish them well as russia prosecutes an unrestricted campaign of destruction on the ukrainian government its infrastructure and its people this move should would stop short of creating a no fly zone which the us and nato have so far resisted supporting due to concerns that this could embroil the alliance in a war with a nuclear armed power earlier this week 27 foreign policy experts published an open letter calling on the biden administration and the international community to establish a limited no fly zone in ukraine surrounding the humanitarian corridors the retired military leaders say that nato s decision to reject a no fly zone was devastating to the ukrainian government and people s morale they go on to assert that supplying the mid and high altitude air defense capability would prevent the russians from dominating ukrainian airspace while delivering devastation of ukraine s cities they note that some nations have air defense systems similar to those which were previously destroyed in the opening days of the russian campaign those nations could transfer existing stocks of soviet era and russian produced weapon systems to include radars other nations can purchase them on the international market and expedite their delivery to ukraine this proposal may have a better chance of success than implementing a no fly zone because supplying the ukrainian military with advanced air defense capabilities the ukrainians already have some s300 missile systems which are a type of air defense which means they are trained in operating these the croatians and few either other nato nations have s300s in their inventory turkey could use this an opportunity to offload the s400s they bought from russia which was a purchase that created deep tensions within the nato alliance the letter s signatories they include general phillip m breedlove former supreme allied commander europe and general sir richard shirreff former deputy supreme allied commander europe the former chiefs of defense of three eastern european countries also signed on to the letter lieutenant general raimonds of latvia lieutenant general vytautas jonas žukas of lithuania and general riho terras of estonia a number of key former leaders of us special operations forces also signed the letter including lieutenant general john f mulholland former deputy commander special operations command vice admiral sean pybus former deputy commander special operations command lieutenant general francis m beaudette former commanding general army special operations command and major general michael s repass former commander special operations command europe cnn military analyst lieutenant general mark p hertling was also a signatory to the letter more background their letter comes just a day after the chair of ukraine s parliament requested surface to air defense systems no fly zones over critical areas and fighter jets for ukraine in a letter to us lawmakers on tuesday according to the letter reviewed by cnn the chair ruslan stefanchuk said that there is a need for military assistance suitable for countering russian attacks and military advances citing the iron dome as one example of the military equipment that ukraine needs when asked about providing this type of additional military assistance to ukraine state department undersecretary for political affairs victoria nuland told lawmakers that some of it could be possible but cited challenges with certain highly advanced equipment i would only say with regard to iron dome you can t just you know snap your fingers and you have an iron dome it takes training it takes the ability to emplace it and all of those kinds of things but there are other things on your list on their list which we think that we can do nuland said she added that she could get into more detail in a classified setting read the full letter below

listen to this article listen to this article washington lawmakers followed through wednesday on their threat to seek a criminal investigation of amazon asking the justice department to investigate whether the tech giant and senior executives obstructed congress or violated other federal laws in testimony on its competition practices the house judiciary committee escalated the bipartisan battle against the world s biggest online retailer with a letter to attorney general merrick garland referring the case for a criminal inquiry amazon engaged in misleading conduct that appeared designed to influence obstruct or impede the antitrust subcommittee s 2019 20 investigation into the market dominance of big tech the letter says as an example it cited testimony by a senior amazon official maintaining that the company doesn t use the data it collects on third party merchants on its platform to compete with them and doesn t list its own products in customer search results before those of third parties those assertions have been contradicted by credible news reports the letter says news reports have detailed amazon s alleged practice of undercutting the businesses that sell on its platform by making knock offs or very similar products and boosting their presence on the site amazon attempted to clean up the inaccurate testimony through ever shifting explanations of its internal policies and denials of the investigative reports the lawmakers said the committee uncovered evidence from former amazon employees and former and current sellers that corroborated the reports claims after amazon was caught in a lie and repeated misrepresentations it stonewalled the committee s efforts to uncover the truth the letter says it was signed by judiciary committee chairman jerrold nadler d n y and the democratic and republican leaders of the antitrust subcommittee the seattle based company has previously denied that its executives misled the panel in their testimony in a statement wednesday amazon said there s no factual basis for the committee s action as demonstrated in the huge volume of information we ve provided over several years of good faith cooperation with this investigation amazon s third party marketplace with independent merchants listing millions of their products on the site is a huge part of the company s business it has about 2 million sellers and amazon has said that more than half the goods sold on amazon com come from third party sellers it also makes money by charging third party sellers fees bringing in tens of billions in revenue in a may 2020 letter to amazon founder and then ceo jeff bezos the antitrust subcommittee threatened a subpoena if bezos didn t agree voluntarily to appear before the panel the wall street journal reported at that time that amazon used sensitive confidential information about sellers on its marketplace their products and transactions to develop its own competing products an amazon executive denied such a practice in statements at a subcommittee hearing in july 2019 saying the company has a formal policy against it amazon says it investigates any allegation of violations of its policies and takes appropriate action when warranted bezos testified on the issue in an appearance at a july 2020 hearing on big tech s alleged monopolistic practices along with facebook ceo mark zuckerberg apple ceo tim cook and google ceo sundar pichai addressing allegations that amazon has used data generated by independent sellers on its platform to compete against them bezos said it would be unacceptable if those claims were proven to be true andy jassy took over the top position from bezos last july bezos became executive chairman some independent merchants who sell products on amazon com have complained about the company s practices such as contract provisions said to prevent sellers from offering their products at lower prices or on better terms on any other online platform including their own websites in its defense amazon has said that sellers set their own prices for the products they offer on its platform the district of columbia sued amazon last year in an antitrust action accusing the company of anticompetitive practices in its treatment of sellers on its platform the practices have raised prices for consumers and stifled innovation and choice in the online retail market the lawsuit alleged the lawsuit maintains that amazon has fixed online retail prices through contract provisions that prevent merchants selling their products on amazon com from offering them at lower prices or on better terms on any other online platform including their own websites amazon rejected the allegations

president joe biden s long awaited executive order about cryptocurrency is finally here while the order is the first major attempt to bring the government together around regulating crypto it s not quite the crackdown some expected from an administration that has spent months warning about impending oversight in fact a lot of people with crypto are even happy about the new order so much so the price of bitcoin is going up the executive order doesn t change how the us approaches crypto in the immediate future but it will start the process of creating regulations for digital currencies as part of this effort biden has ordered federal agencies to dig into many of the problems that crypto created as it became more mainstream including its role in money laundering and terrorist groups despite the government s plans to explore some of crypto s most contentious issues and the many open questions about crypto s future in the us the fact that the white house is giving bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies some real recognition is cause for many crypto advocates to celebrate the message i take from this is that the federal government sees cryptocurrency as a legitimate serious and important part of the economy and society and i think it s a good signal to serious people who ve been holding back from getting involved jerry brito executive director of the dc based crypto think tank coin center said in a tweet biden s executive order is focused on updating us financial regulations to address cryptocurrency specifically by instructing federal agencies to study crypto and propose new rules to regulate it the treasury department will come up with ideas for ways to protect investors and consumers from the financial risks that come with crypto which can be more volatile than other types of assets the financial stability oversight council a government organization that studies the us financial system will evaluate what kind of threat crypto poses to the overall economy meanwhile the attorney general the secretary of the treasury and the department of homeland security will come up with a national strategy to combat crimes facilitated with cryptocurrency biden has also ordered the federal government to analyze what impact crypto which requires an enormous amount of energy to produce might have on the climate but the white house seems to think crypto could do some good too the commerce department will investigate how cryptocurrencies might boost us competitiveness in the global economy the order also directs the government to support technological advances that would jumpstart the use of crypto and digital assets with privacy and security in mind biden even encouraged the government to continue studying a proposal to create a digital currency of its own this nascent but controversial plan would have a central bank like the federal reserve issue a digital currency that s pegged to the us dollar some call it the digital dollar while a digital dollar wouldn t be quite as volatile as bitcoin is the logistics of using it would likely be similar like crypto a government backed digital coin would probably involve a ledger and digital wallets we must reinforce united states leadership in the global financial system and in technological and economic competitiveness including through the responsible development of payment innovations and digital assets said biden in the order continued united states leadership in the global financial system will sustain united states financial power and promote united states economic interests for crypto companies the positives outlined by biden outweigh the negatives sam bankman fried the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange ftx called biden s approach constructive kathryn haun a former andreessen horowitz general partner who sits on the boards of coinbase and the nft platform opensea said the order was a step in the right direction cryptocurrency prices also shot up in response to the news which was leaked tuesday night after the treasury department inadvertently shared a statement from treasury secretary janet yellen that called the order historic as of wednesday afternoon bitcoin was up about 8 percent the day after news of the executive order broke evidence that the order is popular among many crypto investors as well this enthusiastic response makes sense many crypto advocates feared that the white house might try to suppress the industry and biden hasn t said much about crypto the president probably doesn t own any bitcoin either still this effort signals that at the very least biden thinks crypto is a serious part of the us economy and that it might even have some potential and because the government plans to develop its new regulations over time the white house is also giving the growing number of crypto oriented advocacy organizations and lobbying groups in washington a chance to try to influence how the new rules work not everyone is happy about biden s more welcoming stance on crypto some believe the government shouldn t be involved in regulating crypto at all and that biden could still end up hamstringing the technology conversely critics who claim the crypto industry is rife with fraud scams and criminal activity are arguing for tighter regulations of cryptocurrency not wider acceptance leading up to this executive order the narrative that had been circulating was that the administration was set to crack down on crypto lee reiners executive director of duke law school s global financial markets center told the wall street journal this executive order is a complete 180 from that it s still too early to say though whether the federal government will fully embrace crypto after all we don t know what these new rules will eventually say or if they ll ultimately support or stifle crypto usage in the us what we do know is that biden seems intent on taking a middle of the road approach one that acknowledges that crypto is no longer a niche technology but rather a growing part of the average american s finances and it isn t going away anytime soon
opec may ride to the rescue of u s car owners what happened oil stock investors were having a terrific run in late february and early march with eight straight trading days of consistently higher stock prices for shares of oil giants exxonmobil xom 0 57 and chevron corporation cvx 0 86 but their run came to a screeching halt on wednesday as of 2 30 p m et shares of chevron are down 3 5 and exxon stock is off 6 2 underwater pipeline inspection and oil drill repair company oceaneering international oii 2 21 is having an even worse time down 9 2 and the united arab emirates uae is the reason for all of it so what as cnn just reported the government of the uae a member of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec says it will encourage opec to ramp up oil production in order to offset supply constraints created when the u s and allied nations announced a boycott of russian oil earlier this week no sooner had this been announced than oil prices began dropping as of 2 30 west texas international crude prices are already down nearly 13 at just under 108 a barrel pricier brent crude is falling even farther down nearly 14 at barely 110 a barrel so what high oil prices gaveth to the oil majors lower oil prices are taketh ing away this in a nutshell is why the share prices of oil stocks are sliding today now what and yet you may have noticed that neither exxon stock nor chevron nor oceaneering international is down 13 or 14 either the real question here it seems to me is why oil stocks aren t selling off even harder given the scale of the sell off in oil prices the answer of course is that although the uae is encouraging opec to open its oil spigots opec hasn t yet said it will do so to the contrary just last week a meeting between opec and its partners one of which is russia decided to not increase oil production any faster than at the gradual pace they had already agreed to of course that was before the embargo on russian oil that was before oil prices briefly topped 130 a barrel you see while oil producers logically love the idea of getting more money for the oil they sell they still must maintain a kind of balancing act if prices go too high they risk incentivizing their customers to wean themselves off of oil altogether by developing clean energy sources such as wind solar and nuclear power once that happens it will be difficult to get them to ever come back to oil and the customers will be gone for good with that risk in mind it makes sense that the uae might believe now is a good time to begin increasing oil production before prices get too high it makes sense that the rest of opec if not necessarily russia and opec might agree even if that means oil prices will begin to subside and if that s the case there s still plenty of chance that oil prices down today will fall even further tomorrow

like that from an investor that you respect and admire so much it almost compels you to do further research i spent two months literally doing a deep dive on kkr because of that one sentence chris hill i m chris hill that was motley fool senior analyst john rotonti stock investing can be intimidating in part because it s hard to know where to even begin this saturday classroom is about just that getting started and the ideation phase of investing in great companies john talks with fellow motley fool analysts auri hughes and yasser el shimy in a discussion about how they find stock ideas and what they look for before investing in any company john rotonti hi fools i am john rotonti i m here with yasser el shimy and auri hughes hi yasser yasser el shimy hi john john rotonti hey auri auri hughes hey john john rotonti fools we are here to talk today about where we find stock ideas and where we start our stock research and what our stock research process looks like step for step so maybe yasser starting with you first where do you find stock ideas yasser el shimy oh my gosh how about just looking around since i started investing almost 15 years ago now i usually found stock ideas in the universe around me i just try to pay attention whenever i m reading a news article whenever i m watching even tv or even just looking around i try to see things that i d like to use things that i believe have a bright future ahead and just try to imagine what that future could look like just to give you an example one of my very first investment ideas that came to me was amazon the stock that was simply by just looking around and seeing all these brown boxes arriving at the doorsteps of my neighbors and starting to use the service myself and just loving it and realizing you know what this is the future of commerce the service saves us a ton of time that otherwise we would have to spend going to individual stores to shop for every single item and arrives conveniently seamlessly and is actually cost competitive too what could possibly go around there that s how i started and i always hearken back to one of my favorite all time investors peter lynch who argued in his classic book on wall street that ordinary investors did not need really to understand computers to notice that dell was onto something or have phds in biology to know that amgen had made strides in the biotech field all you need to do is just to look around imagine the future and pay attention and chances are you will do well from there john rotonti auri what about you where do you look for stocks auri hughes i do a combination of three things and i will talk about the one i like the most but the first one is the observations of the world the peter lynch thinking that yasser is talking about the other one is screen so using data to screen for what i d like to see the financial profile in the company then the third one is my favorite i call it cloning i took it from investors i like where essentially you copy or discover stocks from a respected source so that can be an analyst a portfolio manager but the great thing about this is the smart person has already looked at the company and vetted it so you can read investor letters from your favorite investors a few people i like are these gentlemen named scott miller terry smith and really understand their thinking i can look at 13fs or dataroma or whalewisdom to see what stocks these big funds or money managers are holding and then research from there you can see what percentage of the portfolio it is or how high of a conviction is there s a lot of great funds out there which we can see what they re holding like tiger global fund smith holding capital it s a source i love because i know it has been vetted and then i can go back to understand the company myself and i know smart people have taken a look at it so i call that cloning john rotonti auri i love that you mentioned scott miller one of scott miller s letters is how i came across kkr in one of his letters maybe a year ago he mentioned that if he could only own one stock for the next five years it would be kkr scott miller is obviously an investor that i respect and admire a lot just like you i respect and admire him a lot so when you read a statement like that from an investor that you respect and admire so much it almost compels you to do further research i spent two months literally doing a deep dive on kkr because of that one sentence that i read in a scott miller letter where he said and i m paraphrasing but it was something almost identical to if i could only own one stock for the next five years it would be kkr during that two month research process i found out that a bunch of other investors that i respect and admire deeply all had not just positions in kkr but large positions in kkr chuck akre and his team at akre capital bill nygren at oakmark the team at valueact capital one of my favorite investors in the world c t fitzpatrick from vulcan value based out of birmingham alabama for a while they were the largest institutional holder of kkr outside of the major funds like blackrock and vanguard scott miller s one sentence in his one letter a year ago brought me into a two month deep dive on kkr yasser just like you said yeah i look all around me i see what people are buying what brands are relevant and in high demand in the world today so maybe to the second part of this yasser el shimy can i just jump in here john real quick john rotonti please yasser el shimy because both auri and you bring up very important points here which is the importance of just not paying attention to what s around and what do you think has a bright future ahead but this is just the very first step of finding an attractive idea that could potentially be an investment however finding attractive idea is not enough to make it investment worthy so we have to do our research and as i ve grown as an investor so has the list of things that i check for when i decide whether or not any particular company is worth investing in i try to look for product market fit mission creditability customer retention and expansion sustainable competitive advantage etc these are very important things speaking of cloning one of my all time greats of course is david gardner and for a long time i ve seen the recommendations he has made and those have forced me to also pay attention to companies that i may not have otherwise paid attention to john rotonti i m really glad that you stressed that point yasser so this is our starting point this is how we identify ideas this does not mean we will ultimately determine that it s a good stock buy or a good stock to recommend to our members this is how we originally come across the idea and then we do our own thorough rigorous fundamental bottoms up business analysis on the company which could take anywhere from weeks to months after we ve done all of that business analysis we use that analysis to try to estimate the fair value of that business and then that stock so it s a process and maybe the perfect segue into our research process maybe auri starting with you this time what does your typical research process look like what s the first thing you read or the first source that you go to then take us through all of the subsequent steps for you to get comfortable enough with a company before you are ready to say it s a buy or it s a sell auri hughes sure after the discovery process the first document is the 10 k of course i think that s one of the holy books for investing it s public information it describes the business then i m going to read the 10 k as i read the 10 k the first thing i look for is do i understand this business can i easily explain it in conversation can i explain it to a child once i understand the business i should have an understanding of the variables that affect that business what s going on you re mentioning kkr kkr is money management so they re managing a pool of assets they have to generate performance on those assets a big driver of that business is probably going to be how many assets what s their aum things like that so i think once you understand the fundamentals of the business then you keep digging further i want to look at the management discussion and analysis understand the business model and then understand some of the risks that are inherent to that business and then next probably look at the last two quarters over the conference call then usually by that time i have a good understanding of the business maybe i ll read some more articles online and then by that time i should have an understanding whether i want to continue further whether it s investable john rotonti that s incredible yasser what does your step by step process look like to get you comfortable enough with the business to decide if you think it s a good time to buy or sell the stock yasser el shimy i have quite a few steps so please bear with me the first one i take is usually i want to lay my hands on the product or service myself if i can some of the investments we make are companies let s say software as a service companies that as just individual we may never have the opportunity to try out the product but for example recently i was looking at social media companies like nextdoor and snap inc i should say i downloaded the apps myself i tried to get my hands on them use them see what the experience is like see what people are saying that to me is part and parcel of making this a very personal experience of investing and just actually judging for myself the quality of the service or the product now i go to the company s website i want to see how they present their product what their mission is how qualified the management team is as well and from there i usually go to documents so latest investor presentation keeping in mind of course that s going to be like the company s pr page almost but it can still be very constructive if i still am interested in the company at that point i will dig deeper into the latest earnings call the 10 k or 20 f if it s a foreign company and any available third party research i can lay my hand on now once i ve established that background and i m still interested i will dig deeper into valuation multiples especially compared to peers so back in the day when i first started investing i would only usually look at revenue growth and price to sales ratios but as i grew as an investor i have been paying attention to many other metrics including operating and financial margins especially ebit gross margin sg a and free cash flow margins i also look at return on invested capital and how that has grown over time earnings growth and in my view a great company that promises to be a good investment or a great investment will show improvement over time on these metrics so you have to understand why a company is valued the way it is to differentiate between good value and value traps you d be surprised how many investors just jump in head first into growth companies based on that promise that they might be the next fang stock the big stock but you have to differentiate and be discerning on terms of the resiliency and fragility of these companies you have to understand what makes for a sustainable competitive advantage or for attractive unit economics for any particular business once you develop that understanding then you can hone in with developing the list of key performance indicators or kpis that you want to monitor over time in that business so in an e commerce business like farfetch or etsy you want to look at metrics like order contribution margins and take rates in a cloud saas business that might be something else like remaining performance obligations rpos or net dollar expansion rates nders only by keeping tabs on these things can you actually see how the company is delivering on its key performance indicators over time and therefore whether this management team is actually delivering on the things that matter chris hill that was incredibly thorough and awesome answer yasser last question to you auri you mentioned the 10 k as the number one place to go to start your research for each of you if you can only use two or three sources what two or three sources do you think you spend the most of your time in so auri in addition to the 10 k that s one of them what s the next other big source that you spend a lot of time in auri hughes good question i think probably just press those quarterly press releases understanding the financial direction of the company is that something i m comfortable with is it attractive does it look like value is being created at a rate i m happy with then probably i d say third depending on the company third party research if i can find some strong reviews online a consensus there s multiple of these software review websites that you have an aggregate of reviews from people and their commentary so i think that s great because you can get a consensus based on the customers that are actually using some of these software products or products online which are great because i love to get as close to the customer as possible and understand why they like this product am i seeing evidence of that let s say it s a product being sold on amazon you can see the number of reviews you could see how popular it is you can read through why people like it so i would say quarterly press releases and then if i can get customer data or some type of insight of how people feel about this product chris hill yeah because that helps you determine the value proposition that the company is providing yasser over to you in addition to the 10 k what s the one or two sources you spend most of your time in yasser el shimy i love listening to earnings calls not just reading them but actually listening to them the reason is i think even though numbers speak sometimes you can pick on subtle cues in the way that management talks about the business especially in the q a session where it s not scripted anymore and they re getting questions from analysts and they have to respond to them in real time that can often be very illuminating on the state of the business and where management believes things are likely to go from there another source that i often go to as well is investor letters i want to see how some of the biggest investors out there both on the growth and value size of investing are thinking about this particular business what is their thesis for it is it similar or different from mine and if there can be any aspects of thinking about that business that i had not personally paid attention to before so i find these two sources to be pretty helpful to my process chris hill love it there you have it fools how two of the motley fool investing team s top analysts identify stock ideas and do their research process in a step by step manner thank you auri thank you yasser that s all for today but coming up tomorrow the bull case for bitcoin as always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against so don t buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear i m chris hill thanks for listening we ll see you tomorrow
regulation can be a good word for crypto stocks what happened the share prices of crypto mining companies took a big bounce on wednesday after president biden released an executive order related to digital assets this order could bring sweeping regulation to the crypto industry but that s actually being viewed as a good thing for cryptocurrencies some of the biggest movers wednesday were crypto related companies at various points during the trading session canaan can 5 83 was up by as much as 13 2 hut 8 mining hut was up by 13 8 hive blockchain technologies hive 6 14 was up by 11 6 bit digital btbt 8 74 was up by 13 1 and riot blockchain riot 5 82 popped by 13 8 these stocks didn t hold their peak prices but were all still up sharply as the market closed so what president biden s executive order essentially asks most government agencies to outline opportunities and risks for digital assets that includes asking the federal reserve to look into central bank digital currencies cbdcs cross border transactions and innovation in the digital asset market the tone of the document was actually positive for cryptocurrencies and digital assets which should be good for everyone from cryptocurrency holders to web 3 0 developers it also could mean that miners will be given steady rules rather than constantly being under the threat of inconsistent regulations the crypto industry broadly has been asking congress and regulators to set rules for the industry for years but this is washington s first big step in that direction it ll be another six months until we hear what regulators recommend but it could lay the groundwork for further innovations including in the mining space now what an executive order to study cryptocurrency and digital assets has been coming for months but this was the first concrete word we have gotten investors generally saw it as supportive of the industry and that s why we saw cryptocurrencies rally by more than 10 early in trading wednesday despite the fact that we won t know what rules will be set for cryptocurrencies or their miners for months if not years i do see the u s as being increasingly supportive of the crypto industry cities and states are trying to attract developers and the federal government seems to be following suit that s bullish for the industry long term as bullish as i consider wednesday s news the impact here will be long term in nature so the immediate price surge may not last cryptocurrencies continue to be volatile assets and miners are reliant on both crypto prices for revenue as well as value since most hold significant quantities of tokens on their balance sheets in short be careful about assuming that this will drive crypto miners higher in the short term this pop could fade quickly

preservation chicago s annual list of the seven most endangered buildings is so big that this year it includes eight historic sites topping the list issued wednesday is an urgent late addition two century old chicago skyscrapers that the federal government purchased 15 years ago and now wants to demolish a 52 million bill is moving through congress that would tear down the century and consumers buildings in the 200 block of south state street long vacant monuments to early chicago high rise architecture the government acquired the buildings in 2007 as a security buffer and potential expansion of federal office space behind the adjacent dirksen u s courthouse those expansion plans never materialized and the federal government appears ready to cut its losses these are two of the last buildings representing the chicago school of architecture and those early skyscrapers in chicago said ward miller executive director of preservation chicago a nonprofit group focused on protecting historically significant architectural structures their loss would be tragic to the city of chicago and its reputation as a city of architecture the empty century and consumers buildings at 202 220 s state st in chicago on march 9 2022 the terra cotta skyscrapers are deteriorating but still stand tall as seminal developments in downtown chicago completed in 1915 the 16 story century building at 202 s state st was designed by holabird roche a pioneering chicago architecture firm that built a number of prominent commercial high rises the 22 story consumers building at 220 s state st was completed in 1913 and designed by jenney mundie jensen lead architect william le baron jenney is credited as building the first modern skyscraper the nearby home insurance building in 1885 a proposed 141 million mixed use redevelopment of the buildings by ca ventures fell through in 2019 over security concerns raised by federal judges working at the dirksen building preservation chicago is proposing an adaptive reuse as a collaborative national archives center for religious groups and other organizations with the federal government selling the buildings to a nonprofit created for that purpose miller suggested the federal government put the 52 million allocated for demolition into renovation the federal government should invest that 52 million into repairing the facades on these buildings with the idea that they would get a chicago landmark designation miller said these landmark buildings belong to all of us as chicagoans and these are important buildings to the development of the skyscraper as we know it today other sites making the 2022 chicago 7 most endangered list range from a stretch of north dusable lake shore drive earmarked for redevelopment to the original cabrini row houses the last vestiges of the mostly demolished near north side public housing complex public housing sites built in the early 1940s hundreds of cabrini row houses sit vacant and fenced off on a 16 acre site that was once part of the cabrini green housing complex on chicago s near north side the high rises were demolished between 1995 and 2011 a catalyst for gentrification in the once crime ridden neighborhood the cha renovated 140 of the 584 row houses leaving more than 440 units to languish for years amid plans to tear them down bounded by chicago avenue and larrabee street the row houses were built to a beautiful scale and should be renovated and reused as low and middle income public housing miller said we ve got these modest townhouse buildings that are not unlike something you would see in a european city and it could house a lot of families in need as we are having an affordable housing crisis in chicago miller said fencing surrounds a building at the lathrop homes south campus on march 8 2022 in chicago preservation chicago also listed the south campus of lathrop homes a historic public housing complex on chicago s north side as endangered completed in 1938 lathrop homes was one of the first public housing complexes in chicago and among the last to be tackled as part of the chicago housing authority s 2000 plan to transform the city s entire public housing stock while developers have restored the north campus into a mixed income residential community redevelopment of the south campus has stalled and remains mostly vacant according to preservation chicago the group also listed two nonresidential buildings at the cha owned altgeld gardens public housing complex on the far south side as endangered north dusable lake shore drive a five year old plan to redevelop and expand north dusable lake shore drive between grand and hollywood avenues put the iconic chicago roadway on this year s endangered list vehicles drive along north dusable lake shore drive near north avenue on may 26 2021 in chicago miller said turning lake shore drive into something closer to a highway might improve traffic but would destroy the scenic character and slower pace of a lakefront boulevard which has defined its use throughout the city s history you d have lake shore drive tunnels between navy pier and oak street miller said citing one proposed improvement that would be just miserable you d be driving in a car and you wouldn t even be able to see the lake other endangered sites st martin de tours church 5848 s princeton ave a 130

a new spinoff plan delighted the market what happened shares of xpo logistics xpo 1 93 a global transportation company specializing in less than truckload shipping and freight brokerage were climbing today after management announced it would split the company in half breaking apart those two divisions and divesting from the company s remaining operations the move comes after xpo successfully spun off its contract logistics business gxo logistics last august and investors applauded as gxo shares have climbed 30 since the stock started trading today xpo shares were up 13 6 as of 3 06 p m et on the news so what in a press release last night the company said it had approved a plan that it believes is the optimal path to unlock value for xpo shareholders that plan is to create two stand alone companies one as a tech enabled brokered transportation business and the other as a north american less than truckload ltl carrier ltl is a shipping service for relatively small loads or quantities of freight that minimizes costs of individual shipments management plans to sell off the remainder of xpo which includes its european business and north american intermodal operations the company intends to spin off the freight brokerage leaving xpo as a pure play ltl company that will be the third largest provider of domestic and cross border ltl shipping management also said it would either sell the european business or take it public on a european stock exchange and that it was in talks with a buyer for its intermodal business ceo brad jacobs explained the move saying our two core businesses of north american less than truckload and tech enabled truck brokerage are industry leading platforms in their own right each with a distinct operating model and a high return on invested capital we believe that by separating these businesses through a spinoff we can significantly enhance value creation for our customers employees and shareholders as we did with our successful spinoff of gxo last year now what though the announcement might have been unexpected it s not a complete surprise in fact in january 2020 the company had announced its intention of spinning off all of its business segments except north american ltl though it scotched that idea after the pandemic hit given the success of gxo and jacobs belief that xpo stock has been undervalued because of a conglomerate discount it s not surprising to see the company separate ltl and the freight brokerage each of which have their own distinct strengths and advantages after that strategy proved to be the right move with gxo it makes sense that the market cheering today

re in the right place motley fool money starts now it s the motley fool money radio show i m chris hill and i m joined by motley fool senior analysts jason moser and emily flippen good to see you both jason moser hey emily flippen hey chris chris hill we ve got the latest headlines from wall street we will dip into the full mailbag and as always we ve got a couple of stocks on our radar but we begin with the big macro the us economy added nearly 700 000 jobs in february with the biggest gains coming in the leisure and hospitality industries in keeping with the reopening seen this week apple alphabet salesforce and twitter all outlined plans for employees returning to offices and emily when you think about the rise of vaccines and covid cases falling all over the country this all makes sense emily flippen it s good to have some positive news to kick off in this week i should say we re still above the unemployment rate pre pandemic but it s definitely trending in the right direction all the metrics you just mentioned point to an economy that is reopening relatively strong consumer base with those businesses like apple recently announcing their plans for office reopening it s going to be really interesting to see what happens with labor pools and unemployment rates moving forward because there s been this collection of feelings from workers and businesses that yeah i mean a lot of people want to be in the office while at the same time a lot of people have become extremely accustomed to a certain level of flexibility and their work life balance so try to find that middle ground of both having some sense of control and efficiency in the office while also having the flexibility whether it be for your health for your family or really just having a separation of work and life by having flexibility around your work arrangements how they marry those two things together will be very interesting to see we ve seen the fallout from businesses costar being one recently who tried to bring the move into the office a little too aggressively had a lot of pushback from employees we ll see if some of these big tech businesses can find the right way to do it chris hill well and jason you looked at something like marc benioff at salesforce talking about collaboration and flexibility flexibility for the employees but getting people into the office for that in person collaboration jason moser yeah i think it s very telling to see all of these companies microsoft google twitter salesforce apple so focus now on getting their employees back it doesn t sound like it s something that s necessarily optional but i agree with emily i think what we re looking at going forward is companies are going to have to be more thoughtful about how they do this i think ultimately we ve talked a lot in the past about the changing retail space and we ve always used that word omnichannel and i feel like going forward really you need to be like the omnichannel employer i mean i think speaking in absolutes as far as this stuff s concerned probably leaves a lot of opportunity on the table if you re like up a fully remote company that probably isn t going to work out very well in the long run just like if you re a company that just demands everyone to be onsite all of the time as well i think the companies they can basically develop that omnichannel employer of philosophy that embraces hybrid work allowing that flexibility while also really i think honing in on that need for people to be together i think that s really going to be the key to it all chris hill this week target held its first in person investor day since the start of the pandemic ceo brian cornell talked about how the company is getting more efficient and that the average target store has added 15 million in sales over the past few years by the way jason their fourth quarter profits were also higher than expected jason moser yeah this one has been just hiding in plain sight it s very impressive to see what ceo brian cornell has done in his time coming in and having to implement strategy change really building that omnichannel retailer that they envision that consumers are looking for and all of the signs here show that he s doing it he s succeeding the stock is up 290 percent of the last five years and that s for good reason success in omnichannel has translated into success in the business and they note this frequently that omnichannel guests spend four times as much is store only guests and even more compared to digital only guess so really driving that omnichannel identity is what s been a key point of focus here from cornell 19 consecutive quarters now of comps growth which is really impressive when you think about what we ve just been through over these last couple of years for the quarter comps grew 8 9 percent comp traffic grew 8 1 percent it s impressive to see they ve grown nearly 28 billion in revenue more than 35 percent over the last couple of years in and it s looking like for fiscal 2022 that will moderate a little bit they re expecting low to mid single digit revenue growth but again you look back to how the stock has performed that doesn t seem to be an accident as ron would say this company is firing on all cylinders chris hill well and we talked about capital allocation all the time about it s such an important skill and you think about brian cornell and anytime there s been a question about his decision to allocate capital in a certain way and the questions are fair whenever you asked is this going to work the answer almost always is yes when he came out and said we re actually going to get out of the pharmacy business we re going to sell our in store pharmacy presence to cvs they ve got a lot of money for that and it s like well what are you going to do with it we re going to invest in apparel and in both cases i was like is this going to work the answer is yes jason moser yeah they ve done a really good job allocating capital i think you make some very good points there i think obviously the acquisition of shipped has been a tremendous boost for this business they continue to repurchase shares very opportunistically bringing that share count down significantly over the past five years so it really does feel like from a capital allocation perspective mr cornell has nailed it as well chris hill costco second quarter report had a little something for everyone for bulls it was the higher foot traffic in stores with customers buying high margin items like jewelry and home goods for bears it was costco still battling supply chain problems although historically emily being bearish on costco not a great idea for investors emily flippen well if anybody s driven past a costco recently they already probably had an inkling that this quarter was going to be decent revenue row 16 percent earnings even better rising 36 percent year over year largely because of that increase in food traffic as well as higher margin sales but as you mentioned there was a good reason to be a little bit bearish on this quarter i won t go as far as saying being added all out bear on costco but there are certainly worse some headwinds we had permanent wage increases for employees that came into effect in october 2021 that was expected to weigh on this quarter as well as those supply chain issues logistics challenges labor shortages there were lots of things that could impact costco but those higher margin products sales combined with the foot traffic more than made up for the headwinds they experienced over the past quarter largely thanks to again that capital allocation investing heavily into their logistics and warehousing business but here s what i found really interesting about this quarter costco chose to keep its membership fee the same now they may increase it at some point this year they didn t promise it was going to be the same forever but we ve seen other businesses netflix and amazon raise prices amid this inflation you have to wonder what s going through the minds of the costco management team here because from my perspective i think they know their customers are a bit price sensitive with the chip shortages as well as rising inflation they re already seeing the prices rise on their everyday goods with the prices also rising on their costco membership maybe they d be afraid that they d knock their renewal rates a little bit if they raise prices right now chris hill but if you are able to bet on whether or not they raise their membership fee at some point in 2022 wouldn t you bet on that because if history is any guide this is the year they re going to do it emily flippen yes historically speaking they raise their fee every 5 6 years so they re right about in that timeframe right now i do think they can do it and i would expect for them to do it if not in 2022 definitely in 2023 they keep their renewal rates near 90 percent pretty consistently so you know they re going to be smart about when and if they do it chris hill it s pretty amazing when you consider we talked about businesses like netflix or hbo max and churn rates with customers those businesses would kill to have a retention rate anything approaching what costco has salesforce wrapped up its fiscal year with profits and revenue higher than expected two years ago salesforce bought slack for 28 billion but co ceo bret taylor said on the earnings call the company has no big acquisition plans in the near term jason it sounds like they are trying to optimize slack as much as they can jason moser i think you ve probably heard a collective sigh of relief from salesforce investors it s not to say that acquisitions are a bad thing and they ve had i think a successful track record thus far but yeah let s go ahead and take a step back and digest this slack deal first always a good reminder of what salesforce does customer relationship management getting data from all of these different communications channels today which help businesses then learn more about their target audiences it helps them retain customers and drive sales based on the numbers based on everything we ve seen customers find a lot of value in what salesforce has to offer the numbers again very impressive fourth quarter revenues 7 33 billion it was up 26 percent remember the overwhelming majority of that is subscription revenue that translated into earnings per share of 0 84 they continue to recognize the data benefits from the tableau and mulesoft acquisitions those are the data businesses and it altogether those acquisitions that data business now they accelerated growth to 23 5 percent from a year ago sales cloud and service cloud are both now 6 billion businesses on their own in fourth quarter they grew 17 and 18 percent respectively back to slack yes slack continues to perform very well under the salesforce umbrella the number of customers spending 100 000 annually with slack increased 46 percent from a year ago so you put it all together marc benioff i think one of the more glass half full ceos you ll hear out there i love listening to him talk just because he lights up a room and he lights up a conference call it seemed like he was really excited to get employees back together and have the offices open i can imagine that s exciting for a lot of folks it sounds like this coming year is going to be a good one they re calling for 4 63 in earnings that put shares now around 43 times full year estimates so cheap no but relatively speaking it s actually starting to look like a compelling multiple for a business like this that has a stellar track record it s growing and it continues to push those margins higher chris hill more after the break so stay right here you re listening to motley fool money welcome back to motley fool money chris hill here with jason moser and emily flippen sweetgreen s first quarterly report since it went public last november was a hit with investors the fast casual salad chain is not profitable but expects sales to be strong this year emily salad is rarely my first option for a meal but as a business i have to say sweetgreen intrigues me emily flippen i have to say if you ve eaten at a sweetgreen you re probably familiar with why this business had such a great quarter because the food is really pretty decent for a salad now they did report a loss that was greater than expected but revenue grew nearly 63 percent admittedly coming off some pretty weak comparables there s an interesting device of community behind the sweetgreen business as an investment because more than a third of their sales actually come from the new york metropolitan area you can see why a fancy salad chain would have a lot of success especially with people coming back to the office grabbing lunch in between meetings this model works in urban areas but there s also been a large constituent of investors who think sweetgreen might be the next chipotle when you look at their cash on cash returns and their unit economics for their stores it s actually really impressive the big question is sweetgreen only has around 140 150 locations currently can they make a model work in the suburban areas that has succeeded so readily in urban districts i m not entirely sure i am sold on it i do think their prices are a bit higher than what suburban customers may be accustomed to paying for lunch out however i will say the food is really decent if i can speak for myself here and i can see an argument for a larger store count than the one they have currently chris hill would it make sense for them to offer some type of value salad something that has a price point of like 8 10 emily flippen when you look at the success of chipotle part of the reason why chipotle management isn t that worried about the fact they ve had to raise prices over the past year is because they ve consistently had an option price below 10 their most popular item their chicken burrito that s been really steady regardless of where your price point has been you ve been able to walk into a chipotle and know that you re going to get a reasonably priced chicken burrito sweetgreen doesn t have that right now they charge per topping which is challenging i think for a lot of consumers their salads readily end up being 15 20 per salad it doesn t translate as easily to maybe a more price sensitive market i do concern a little bit with how sweetgreen is going to expand i do think having some base level option that is priced at or below 10 would dramatically helped them assuming of course they can make that profitable chris hill the headline for domino s pizza is not the company s fourth quarter earnings report it s the fact that ceo rich allison is retiring after less than four years in the corner office allison will step down later this spring and hand the keys to domino s chief operating officer russell weiner jason rich allison is 53 years old he s not staying on the board he sounds like someone who s just going to live the next stage of his life jason moser i m getting hungry i mean it s chipotle and sweetgreen and pizza focus up jason all right yeah you re right the big story rich allison calling it a day i mean he s with the company for 11 years ceo for about four obviously done a tremendous job particularly in a difficult time very sensible to promote russell weiner who served as the coo for about four years and has been with the company since 2008 we ll have to see how he performs that s not always a guarantee but typically like to see that coo take the step up as far as the quarter it was ok it wasn t anything really to write home about but us same store sales growth one percent international same store sales growth of 1 8 percent that means they continue their streak of 112 consecutive quarters of positive international comps growth just really impressive but not terribly surprising when you consider their global retail sales reach 17 8 billion in 2021 that s up almost 12 percent from a year ago even more impressively this was in the call when they compare it back to pre pandemic 2019 they ve grown the domino s brand by 3 5 billion in retail sales on a global basis over the last few years it s been a tremendous time that said i think going forward they re going to witness some challenges here inflation i think is going to be really a key point of focus management noted on the call they are seeing unprecedented cost pressures they re calling for 8 10 percent cost increases there and that will likely be loaded on the front half of the year but it s been a wonderful investment thus far because they ve managed capital so well and continue to grow out in what is a very large and growing market opportunity in pizza chris hill a story of best buy s fourth quarter report involves supply chain challenges staffing challenges and lower revenue than expected naturally shares at best buy are up nearly 10 percent this week emily emily flippen naturally the market is just showing how irrational it is especially when you compare it to something like costco but i will say the market was baking in some big headwinds here due to supply and chip shortages and maybe the market just wasn t expecting things to be not as bad as they were i will say my concern with best buy it s an amazing business it s consistently blown investors out of the water but are they suffering from scope creep because their move into total tech their 200 membership program i can see that working but getting into furniture and healthcare it feels outside their areas of core competencies i really want to see execution here in a way that i m not sure is possible given their existing business lines chris hill so when i go into a best buy and they ve got their stereo setup and they ve got those large comfy chairs i can buy one of those i can walk out with one of those emily flippen that s the plan outdoor furniture indoor furniture and maybe even telehealth at some point in the future i guess everything s on the table for best buy chris hill more after the break including a closer look at disney s latest decision for its streaming service stay right here you re listening to motley fool money welcome back to motley fool money chris hill here with emily flippen and jason moser third quarter results for elastic were better than expected but shares of the software as a service company basically flat this week jason this was the first quarter with new ceo ash kulkarni how is he doing so far jason moser yeah i d say one quarter in the book seems like he s off to a good start remember elastic they focus on search primarily for the enterprise and they did pre announce the results a little while back that they would exceed their guidance for the quarter so there are no real surprises here but as you mentioned new ceo ash kulkarni is now at the helm we ll learn more about him as a leader in the coming quarters founder shay banon has now stepped down to serve as the cto he s going to help lead the company for just not in that same executive level but the numbers continue to impress total revenue 224 million that was up 43 percent from a year ago elastic cloud which the company continues to make big investments in that becomes a larger part of the business that segment of the business revenue grew 80 percent it now represents 36 percent of total revenue as compared to 29 percent a year ago that s something to keep an eye on because they see this being accounting for more than half of overall revenue here over the next couple of years or so of course still working at profitability market that don t like these stocks too much these day but positive operating cash flow 5 1 million was a good thing to see but the key performance indicators tell us they re doing something right chris the total subscription customer account was over 17 900 versus 13 800 a year ago customer account with annual contract value greater than 100 000 was over 890 versus 670 a year ago and that net expansion rate remains just below 130 percent the business is guiding for 30 percent revenue growth in its current quarter sounds like 40 percent growth for the full year yeah tough time for companies like these in this type of volatile market but it feels like elastic is doing what they say they re going to do chris hill i realize i m about to throw a rock inside this glass house but we work at a company where we call each other fool did you you know that at elastic they refer to each other as elasticians jason moser i had heard that now i ve never heard someone used the word but i had read that somewhere i found that interesting chris hill just keep that in mind if you re applying for a job at elastic that s the direction you re going in on friday disney announced that later this year it will launch a new ad supported tier for its disney plus streaming service the company did not say exactly when or what the price would be only that the ad supported offering would expand internationally in 2023 emily i can see the bull case for this and i can also see this as a little bit of a warning flag emily flippen i eventually want to pass the question off to each of you if you think this is a reactive or proactive move but before i do i want to rewind back to late 2019 when disney first announced that they were going to come out with disney plus a streaming service now i will say i was a bit of a bear on the idea i clearly underestimated how many people adults included would continue to pay for an offering from disney plus for their streaming services i thought coming in at such a low cost there d be no pricing power here while i have been wrong i do think this is a little bit of a yellow flag that maybe the second half of my original thoughts were a bit on the mark which is the pricing power of disney plus as a streaming service part of what made it so attractive at launch was that it was so reasonably priced people could slip it into their budgets but they ve increasingly raised the price and it seems like in order to meet their really lofty subscriber goals upwards of 260 million subscribers by 2024 is their intention they re having to come out with an ad supported tier presumably at a lower price in order to increase the average revenue per user and bring themselves more in line with existing offerings from my perspective i ve been so impressed with the offerings to say netflix which has always managed to both increased prices and retain and grow users without ever having to move toward ads seeing disney so quickly pivot into the ad supported space to me says hey we re aware that there s a cap on how much people are willing to pay for this so for the people who don t want to pay that much will have you pay a little bit less and you could watch some ads if we re having to do that to me it s saying the content on our platform isn t as appealing but what do i know i want to pass that question off to each of you i ve been a benefit of a skeptic on disney plus for awhile but jason i know you ve been a fan jason moser yeah i mean we re definitely fans we were subscribers in our household you make a lot of really good points there and i don t mean to be on the fence but i feel like this is a bit of them playing offense and defense i mean i think they see an opportunity to grow the user base the subscriber base in the face of like we saw on netflix recently it seems like a lot of that success had been pulled forward perhaps subscriber growth has slowed down a little bit there maybe they see this as an opportunity at disney to jump in there and offer something a little bit differentiated but by the same token it also feels defensive because those goals were so lofty i even said i ve been a little bit skeptical of that 230 260 million number up to this point just because it was so great now what this most recent report really for them to get there by 2024 that s 20 percent annualized growth and that seems more reasonable at least and maybe this is an insurance plan to help really get to that point i think you re right the content on disney plus and in its related properties needs to continue to get better if it s going to be a household core offering like netflix is and i think that s ultimately where they need to try to get is just be a household core offerings when you consider services that you re going to switch off netflix probably isn t one of them and they want to make sure that disney plus isn t one of them either so that ll take a little time to get there still i think but to me it really is very curious i feel like the international opportunity here maybe is greater than some might think and that s just from the perspective of the advertising supported video on demand offering is a much more popular offering outside of the united states i think globally speaking it s just a more popular offering because it s a better value proposition for i think a lot of people so maybe they see the opportunity there it will be interesting to see how this develops i would imagine though it will bring more subscribers in the door which is what they re looking to do chris hill emily my immediate reaction when i saw the news was this is a reactive move now i could very easily be wrong about that but in the moment that was my first thought they are reacting to subscriber growth not being what they wanted to be and so therefore they re going with this they don t really share a ton of information about hulu and the bull case for this is they re looking at their internal data and seeing if we get people in on the ad supported version of hulu that s a pathway to them becoming subscribers at a higher price point where they don t have to watch ads maybe that they re looking at their own data and saying we need to offer this ad supported model because it s going to be a pathway and it may also enable them to raise the price more quickly on the regular streaming service of disney plus emily flippen let me say if this is a reactive move i appreciate the fact that they are reacting quickly as opposed to reacting slowly which is the other alternative chris hill yes particularly you mentioned when they rolled it out wasn t 2016 the original year they were looking to roll out their streaming service and then it got pushed back to 2017 they finally got it and they got it right but to your point yes if it s reactive at least bob chapek and his team are moving quickly zoom video s fourth quarter results were better than wall street was expecting it s shares fell a bit when zoom management said they expect 10 percent growth in the fiscal year ahead i get that it s not as growthy as someone on wall street would like jason but this seems very much in character with the guidance that ceo eric yuan has given quarter in and quarter out jason moser yeah i don t think really much has changed here i think this certainly falls in line with many of the other stay at home stocks that have been on such a wild ride for these past couple of years zoom shares is down i think close to 75 percent from 52 week high now maybe that s an overreaction but maybe not i mean one thing is for sure growth is slowing down and we see that in that 10 percent guide for this full year hopefully that proves to be conservative but again i mean it s a good business its recording some very impressive numbers fourth quarter revenue just over 1 billion that was up 21 percent from a year ago and you re looking at non gaap net income earnings per share at 1 22 cents i mean the key performance indicators again for a business like zoom similar to a lot of these other saas type offerings you re looking at customers and in those that are spending more and they have 2 725 customers now contributing more than 100 000 in trailing 12 month revenue that s up 66 percent from a year ago they have approximately 509 800 customers with more than 10 employees that s up nine percent from a year ago the net dollar expansion rate for customers with more than 10 employees is 129 percent so that continues to be a bright spot there remember what not that long ago zoom had that five nine acquisition that that was something that was really going to bring two companies together zoom focusing a little bit more on that call center side of the market and perhaps becoming a little bit more like a salesforce focusing on that customer relationship management we know that deal got mixed however that is not preventing zoom from making investments in this space now they had the zoom contact center offering that has rolled out that is going to be something that they continue to invest in here in the coming year and beyond then i think really the longer term the bigger question just really is how will they be able to leverage their technology their apis the software development kits how will they be able to leverage that technology embedded in such a way that companies are utilizing zoom on many different levels for all of their communication needs in the future because that s really the ultimate goal but until we get some more clarity there i think the pull back in the stock price makes sense chris hill up next we ll dip into the fool mailbag we ve got a couple of stocks on our radar stay right here you re listening to motley fool money as always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against sell or buy ourselves stocks based solely on what you hear welcome back to motley fool money chris hill here with jason moser and emily flippen our email address is that s podcasts with an s at the end drop us a note we re lonely got an email from fareed who says i started listening to your show last year and looked forward to each episode i like the mixture of opinions and points of view each member brings to the show my question for the team is was quality of stocks down because of recent events should i sell my vanguard s p 500 index fund to purchase individual stocks more than half my investment is with individual stocks in case you re wondering why i purchased the vanguard index fund when i first started investing i didn t know any better and took the safe route my average cost is 200 and it s around 400 now and if it helps to answer my question better we re young adults with a baby look forward to hearing your thoughts fareed thank you for the email congrats on the baby as always you can never drink enough coffee before we get into this the usual disclaimer that we can t give individual advice i got to say jason i love starting with the vanguard s p 500 index fund i think that s as good if not the best first step for anyone just starting out jason moser i couldn t agree more fareed you re wise beyond your years knowing what you don t know is really key to becoming a good investor i think that was a wonderful first step i applaud you for that in as someone who s probably been investing for a little bit longer than you listen i own shares in the s p 500 index fund as well like you ve got to protect yourself from yourself sometimes i like the question and it s something that i grapple with sometimes as well owning that index fund i think it depends on your risk tolerance to degree i think it depends on what tax implications if any you would encounter from selling shares of that fund the thing about index funds i think for many of us they re just the easiest way to gain instant diversification the longer you own them the more sense it makes as those returns just continue to compound but i also understand the desire to invest in individual stocks and that is also something i grapple with i think probably my preferred first course of action would be to focus on putting new money in individual stocks if possible and letting that money invested in the funds just keep doing its thing if that s not an option then you ll have to weigh the decisions from there but that s how i would approach the problem at least chris hill emily you and i recorded something the other day that s going to run on next tuesday s podcast part of our conversation gets at this notion of selling i think you and i are of like mind which is if possible we really don t want to be in the position of selling since sometimes you have to sometimes you want to because you re making a big purchase or investing in some other manner but i think that is our inclination emily flippen yes i think there s a false dichotomy that exists with some investors where they think they re either all passive or are all active when they re ready to dip their toes into buying individual companies they assume that they can t have passive exposure that s not necessarily the case i have a ton of my money in index funds personally you can have a mixture of both but i do agree that selling tends not to be the best way to go about reallocating because it s a reactive instead of proactive approach you should develop an asset allocation that works for you then as you have money as you have money to invest invest per that asset allocation otherwise what you re trying to do is time the market with when is the right time to jump from asset class to asset class or investment to investment which again tends to be the worst time to try to reevaluate that chris hill i ll just wrap up by saying i love fareed s recognition that there are quality stocks that are on sale keep that mindset because that is how you become and stay a net buyer of stocks over the years let s get to the stocks on our radar our man behind the glass rick engdahl is going to hit you with a question mr moser you re up first what are you looking at this week jason moser yes sir taking a look at accenture ticker is acn accenture is a professional services company they provide strategy and consulting and interactive and technology operations and services worldwide this is seen as the gold standard in the industry the revenue is derived primarily from forbes global 2000 companies governments and government agencies around the world serving five core markets communications media and technology financial services health and public services and products and resources this is a business to me they got ceo julie spellman sweet she s been the ceo since 2019 with the company for better over a decade though what really caught my eye this volatile market chris i mean this is a company that generate a better than 7 billion in free cash flow last year with a stock down 23 percent year to date this could be some nice stability in a volatile market chris hill rick question about accenture rick engdahl i m sorry i nodded off there for a second i know you re supposed to follow stocks that are of interest to you what is it that is interesting about this stock to follow for someone like me jason moser i know it sounds boring but i think there s some interesting dynamics to business they have an actual immersive technology division within the company where they have expertise within the entire immersive technology and extended reality market there as we see that grow they re going to be able to serve companies around the world with their skillsets regarding that hey think metaverse rick now do i have your attention chris hill i ll just add that years ago my friend rebecca worked at this company when they changed their name to accenture i remember saying what is accenture she said wow it s a mash up of accent on the future i said look that s just not going to work this is totally going to backfire you can just add that to the long list of times that i was completely wrong about something related to business emily flippen what are you looking at emily flippen well if you think accenture is a silly name then you ve really going to have a field day with my radar stock that s bilibili the ticker is bili it s a chinese gaming company i could spend the next few minutes talking about all of the very real regulatory and geopolitical risks that exist with this business that would make it potentially not an investment for many people but instead of doing that i m going to focus on their most recent quarter which was actually really stellar from just a core business perspective revenue grew 54 percent but more importantly more than nine percent of all of bilibili s users are paying subscribers now even interestingly enough ceo rui chen is using his own capital to buy back up to 10 million worth of us listed shares certainly one to maybe not buy today but to at least have on your radar jason moser rick question about bilibili rick engdahl is it strictly a chinese company as far as it s customer base there s a lot of media out there that s made the cross overseas and not that one as far as i know emily flippen yes all of their users are chinese based users so it s a pure play in that sense but they do license games and contents from other countries japan as well as other countries across asia there is a little bit of exposure there but user base all chinese chris hill what do you want to add to your watch list rick rick engdahl sweetgreen i m sorry it s lunchtime chris hill all right jason moser emily flippen thanks for being here emily flippen thanks chris chris hill that s going to do it for this week s motley fool money radio show show is mixed by rick engdahl i m chris hill thanks for listening we ll see you next time
investors breathed a sigh of relief as energy prices fell what happened financial stocks rallied on wednesday as investors fears of an imminent recession were lessened by the close of trading shares of megabanks jpmorgan chase jpm 0 06 wells fargo wfc 0 89 and bank of america bac 0 45 were up 4 5 8 and 6 4 respectively so what events in eastern europe have led to a sharp rise in the prices of oil gas and other commodities this combined with the federal reserve s indication that it will raise interest rates to combat persistently high inflation has sparked concerns among investors that the u s economy could fall into a deep and prolonged recession however oil prices retreated on wednesday following reports that other countries might increase oil production to offset the loss of imports from russia lower energy prices would be a welcome relief for businesses and consumers they could also help to stave off a recession by lowering costs for many companies and boosting consumer sentiment that would be a huge relief for the banking industry whose profits are generally tied to the health of the economy now what stronger economic growth could allow the u s market to better withstand higher interest rates that would be a boon for banks which typically see their profit margins rise as rates increase a healthier economy would likely also mean fewer loan defaults which would further strengthen banks earnings astute investors know this and they bid up the prices of banking giants jpmorgan wells fargo and bank of america to reflect their more optimistic view of the industry s prospects
each company would certainly benefit if the fighting in russia and ukraine came to an end what happened shares of many financial stocks are rising today on media reports that russian president vladimir putin and ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky may be open to a potential compromise that would end the fighting in ukraine that has now ensued for 12 days the price of oil also dipped today after a relentless march higher in recent days that saw the price of u s crude oil rise to about 130 per barrel shares of mastercard ma 1 20 traded roughly 4 5 higher in the final hour of trading while shares of the dutch bank ing groep ing 0 19 had jumped nearly 10 shares of goldman sachs gs 2 92 were up about 4 3 so what russia s invasion of ukraine has created incredibly difficult market conditions as the war threatens to slow global demand and wide ranging sanctions from the u s and europe are starting to spill over and have a bigger impact globally more specifically the large payment processor mastercard along with other major card networks like visa and american express recently announced that it would suspend operations in russia in response to the conflict russian cardholders can still make purchases inside russia until their cards expire but they will not be able to use the cards for online international payments or outside of the country roughly 90 of credit and debit payments globally go through mastercard and visa cards excluding china for ing groep the bank has about 1 of its total loan book in russia and ukraine most of which is russian exposure in a recent disclosure the bank said that of its roughly 5 3 billion euros worth of total outstanding loans in russia about 700 million euros are being impacted by new sanctions ing does have collateral in place but obviously the longer the conflict goes on the higher the likelihood that these loans start to go into default or become write downs the investment bank goldman sachs also has some employees and staff in russia although it s not material but bloomberg recently reported that goldman among others has been buying up bonds tied to distressed russian companies anonymous sources in the article say goldman is buying corporate debt on the steel manufacturing company evraz the russian state owned energy company gazprom pao and russian railways if the conflict ends goldman could profit significantly from these investments that s easier said than done however credit default swaps suggested the likelihood of default on russian government debt within five years is currently around 65 now what investors should not be making investments based on the likelihood of a compromise between russia and ukraine putin has proven to be extremely unpredictable in recent weeks and this is a conflict that may still not end for a while when investing it s important to focus on the fundamentals of the business and its long term prospects with that said i feel somewhat optimistic about all three of these stocks mastercard essentially holds a duopoly on processing payments so it s not going anywhere ing has an incredibly strong balance sheet with lots of excess capital to support unexpected loan losses the bank should also benefit if the european central bank raises its benchmark lending rate later this year which is still likely and goldman currently trades at only 8 4 times forward earnings and roughly 119 to its tangible book value essentially its net worth so i could see there being some long term upside there as well

ukraine and everyone who s been impacted by the destruction the devastation and the loss of thousands of lives our prayers go out to all of those who were impacted by this unnecessary war and by the human misery that s taking place turning from that and an entirely different view i am pleased with our results during the third quarter we once again achieved new financial performance size we generated about 681 million in fee revenue that was up 43 year over year our diluted and adjusted diluted eps was 1 54 and 1 59 respectively and those were also new highs our performance over the recent quarters is a reflection of the relevance of our strategy and solutions the resilience of our colleagues and more importantly the connection with our korn ferry brand 10 stocks we like better

the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and korn ferry international wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of march 3 2022 we re replicating and scaling our success and continuing to lead innovation at the intersection of talent and strategy in an increasingly digitally enabled new world of work the metrics of our business are very good it s hard to believe that it was two years ago almost to the day that the pandemic was declared and those were certainly uncertain times and now again we face ourselves with uncertain times but when we think about the power of the firm the breadth of what we offer and particularly the sacrifices made by our colleagues over the last couple of years it affirms what this company is all about we ve accelerated from that uncertainty we re now up 32 compared to the quarter preceding the pandemic which at that time was an all time high and we haven t just talked about it we ve walked it we ve walked it from the vast ip we have we developed over 1 million professionals a year we walked it by living our purpose and we continue to innovate replicate and scale allowing people and organizations to exceed their potential in this rapidly changing world elements of our strategy include driving a top down go to market approach based on our marquee and regional accounts which year to date represent about 37 of our portfolio this not only facilitates growth and enduring partnerships but is also key to more scalable and durable revenues for example on a year to date basis about 28 of our revenue is driven by cross referrals within our firm up several million dollars sequentially which demonstrates the effectiveness of our go to market strategy we also believe there s substantial market opportunity with our talent acquisition and interim businesses particularly given the acceleration of the nomadic labor market and looking at our digital and consulting businesses we ll continue to innovate marrying korn ferry s capabilities with tomorrow s opportunities from organizational transformation to sales effectiveness and accelerated revenue growth to m a and esg we re going to continue to further push to monetize our ip and continue to move more of our digital business to a subscription offering and we re also going to scale our learning development outsourcing capabilities ldo leveraging our korn ferry advance platform 150 000 professionals around the world have used advance both as individuals and as part of their professional development journeys with their employers and lastly we re going to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy including a disciplined approach to m a with that i m joined by gregg kvochak and bob rozek and bob i ll turn it over to you bob rozek executive vice president chief financial and corporate officer great thanks gary and good morning good afternoon depending on where you are a couple of weeks ago i celebrated my 10 year anniversary at korn ferry looking back to when i started i really believed that there were great opportunities ahead for us and as i stand here today after 10 years looking at the business we built the data the assets the solutions and most of all the incredibly talented colleagues we have to serve our clients it s pretty clear to me that i underestimated our true potential the investments we ve made in ip people data and processes have enabled us to thrive in today s environment and more importantly have positioned us for future growth our operational execution continues to drive consistent and superior financial performance i ve always said the best way to measure performance is by looking at results now you heard gary say that we continue with strong financial performance in the third quarter delivering new highs in our fee revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share this is a direct result of the exceptional execution of our strategy and the growing relevance of our solutions you also heard gary talk about our go to market success with our marquee and regional accounts and the cross line of business top line synergies we re able to generate with our highly complementary portfolio of services and solutions i look at the growing relevance of our consulting services and solutions around major issues or what we refer to as mega trends that companies are wrestling with today whether it s esg diversity equity and inclusion accelerating revenue growth in a post pandemic world or developing professionals and leaders to operate in the evolving digital world you can also look at our digital business which as you ll hear from gregg in his prepared remarks really continues to expand the monetization of our data through increasing levels of license and subscription new business was really really great potential for further expansion as we enter new sales channel partnerships with major technology companies all of this leaves us uniquely positioned in fact the only company able to meet the entire spectrum of human capital needs of companies across the globe and we are well positioned to continue to gain market share in the markets that we serve now let me turn to the third quarter fee revenue as gary indicated was 681 million that s up 205 million or 43 year over year normally with the year end holidays our third quarter has historically been our seasonal low however in the current year fee revenue was actually up 41 million or 6 sequentially by line of business fee revenue growth for executive search was up 42 year over year while rpo and professional search was up 98 year over year growth for consulting and digital was also very strong at 20 and 19 respectively earnings also grew to new highs in the quarter adjusted ebitda grew 42 million or 43 year over year to 138 million with an adjusted ebitda margin of 20 3 our earnings and profitability continue to benefit from both higher consultant and execution staff productivity as well as lower g a spend today our earnings and profitability have never been higher if you go back and you look at the first three quarters of fiscal 20 that s right before the pandemic recession hit our adjusted ebitda is up 71 and it s actually grown two and a half times faster than our fee revenue has grown our adjusted fully diluted earnings per share also advanced to a new high in the quarter improving to 1 59 per share which was actually up 0 64 year over year new business was also very strong in the third quarter up 30 year over year reaching a new quarterly high if you look at it by month the consolidated new business we saw a real sharp rebound in january from a seasonal low in december we saw solid new business growth in every line of business of particular note growth in our rpo new business was very strong at 135 million of new contract awards and that s the second consecutive quarter they achieved that level our investable cash position remains strong at the end of the third quarter cash and marketable securities totaled about 1 1 billion now if you exclude amounts reserved for deferred compensation arrangements and accrued bonuses our global investable cash balance was approximately 592 million which is up 58 million or 11 year over year i would note that the investable cash position is net of 91 million that we used to acquire the lucas group on november 1 and about 22 million for share repurchases in the quarter as gary mentioned we continue to take a balanced approach to allocating capital in addition to investing in m a and hiring of additional fee earners and execution staff we have repurchased approximately 55 million worth of our stock and have paid cash dividends of approximately 20 million so far in fiscal year 22 with that i ll turn the call over to gregg to review our lines of business in more detail gregg kvochak senior vice president finance treasury tax investor relations thanks bob i m going to start with kf digital global fee revenue for kf digital was 90 2 million in the third quarter which was up 19 year over year additionally the subscription and licensing component of kf digital fee revenue grew to 29 million in the third quarter which was up 26 year over year and up 12 sequentially globally new business for kf digital in the third quarter grew 8 year over year to 108 million which was the fifth consecutive quarter over 100 million 39 million or 37 of the total digital new business in the third quarter was related to subscription and license sales earnings and profitability remained strong with adjusted ebitda of 28 1 million and a 31 2 adjusted ebitda margin now turning to consulting in the third quarter consulting generated 162 9 million of fee revenue which was up approximately 27 million or 20 year over year fee revenue growth continued to be broad based across all solution areas and strong regionally in north america and emea which were up 28 and 16 respectively consulting new business also reached a new high in the third quarter growing approximately 10 year over year regionally new business growth in the third quarter was strongest in north america and emea which were up 10 and 16 respectively adjusted ebitda for consulting in the third quarter was 28 6 million with an adjusted ebitda margin of 17 5 the growth trend for rpo and professional search remained strong in the third quarter driven by the surge in demand for top skilled professionals globally fee revenue grew to 188 6 million which was up 98 year over year and up approximately 38 million or 25 sequentially rpo fee revenue grew approximately 68 year over year and 3 sequentially while professional search revenue was up approximately 150 year over year and up 67 sequentially the integration of the lucas group has gone well revenue in the third quarter for the lucas group was approximately 33 million which was up approximately 10 compared to the revenue for the three months preceding the acquisition new business wins for both rpo and professional search were also strong in the third quarter reaching new highs professional search new business was 93 million and rpo was awarded 135 million of new contracts consisting of 74 million of renewals and extensions and 61 million of new logo work adjusted ebitda for rpo and professional search continued to scale with revenue improving to 44 1 million with an adjusted ebitda margin of 23 4 finally in the third quarter global fee revenue for executive search reached another new high of 239 million which was up 42 year over year growth was also broad based with north america growing 44 year over year and emea and apac growing 32 and 45 respectively market demand in international regions continued to improve in the third quarter with core sequential growth accelerating in emea apac and latin america we continue to invest in expanding our team of

year to 1 787 in the third quarter global executive search adjusted ebitda grew approximately 66 million which was up 24 grew to approximately 66 million which was up 24 million year over year with an adjusted ebitda margin of 27 5 now i ll turn the call back over to bob to discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 22 bob rozek executive vice president chief financial and corporate officer great thanks gregg as previously discussed our consolidated new business grew to a new high in the third quarter again with real strength across all lines of business backlog exiting the third quarter was strong as was february new business february generally is the shortest month in the year in terms of working days however this february was actually our eighth best new business month ever excluding rpo and if you include rpo it was actually our best new business month ever now despite the continuing strength in new business trends and backlog coming out of q3 the very recent situation in eastern europe presents a level of risk and uncertainty that is difficult to quantify with this in mind and assuming no new major pandemic related lockdowns or further changes in worldwide geopolitical conditions economic conditions financial markets or foreign exchange rates we expect our consolidated fee revenue in the fourth quarter to range from 670 million to 690 million and our consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share to range from 1 49 to 1 63 per share and our gaap diluted earnings per share to range from 1 44 per share to 1 60 now let me end as i started as i look ahead for all the reasons previously discussed i m more optimistic now than i have ever been about our long term opportunity to continue to build on our financial success our company today has more durable revenue streams has achieved a new level of business activity and profitability that is sustainable and has positioned us for continued growth and we have a core set of integrated solutions that are highly relevant to the mega trends that we re seeing in the world today korn ferry has never been better positioned to serve all of its constituencies colleagues clients candidates and shareholders for years to come with that we ll conclude our remarks and be glad to answer any questions you may have questions answers operator our first question is from tobey sommer from truist securities your line is open please go ahead tobey sommer truist securities analyst thanks i wanted to ask you the business and the recruiting market have just surged so much over the last six seven quarters kind of everybody is at all time highs usually surpassing 2019 how do we think about growth from here and not specifically in the april quarter but even some sort of medium term vision i don t expect you to necessarily answer in dollars but any of sort of the inputs that drive growth productivity headcount any kind of way you could help frame that so that we can put together an intelligent model would be helpful gary burnison chief executive officer ok well tobey it s good to hear your voice i think that barring inflation which we ve put aside for a second this is a it s an incredibly nomadic labor market when you look at the labor participation rate it s pretty much what it was right before the pandemic i mean maybe it s 1 million people short but it s pari passu it s pretty close but when you look at the number of people that have left the labor market it s millions of people maybe it s not as high as 10 million people but it s a significant number then you ve got all the changes that have happened during the pandemic around how you work when you work where you work efficiency and the like and i think there is in the near term a scarcity of talent and so i would expect again barring the impact of inflation that there s going to continue to be this war for talent and so i would think that the labor market is extremely tight which is good for our business then when you look at our consulting business and all the trends around the work scape today i think that s another positive tobey sommer truist securities analyst good to hear your voice too gary and then kind of a follow up along the lines that your answer prompted to me with the sort of structural change to work from anywhere and the way employers have to open their aperture and adapt to be flexible in that regard what are the implications for pricing across your businesses and i don t know if you could actually address it by line of business but executive search professional search rpo what does that mean to sort of unit based economics for your business gary burnison chief executive officer well we have increased our pricing over the last few months now that will take some time to bleed in because of longer term contracts msa agreements and the like but we ve certainly we made that move probably five or six months ago when you look at the from a line of business perspective clearly what you re saying in our talent acquisition businesses particularly executive search and professional search is the impact of wage inflation and you will see that the average fee the average fees in both those businesses has gone up double digit over the last call it 12 to 15 months and so again hard to predict but i would think there s going to continue to be wage pressure there and that coupled with the scarcity of talent is very very positive for the business when you look at what s actually happening today around culture around how people get worked on i think it presents an enormous opportunity for us around professional development what we call ldo learning development outsourcing i think that s an opportunity for us on the consulting side we have like the other parts of our business we have raised the pricing and if you look at our rate per hour now it s almost 400 it s not quite but you can see that that has steadily gone up so i look in this environment i think there is that opportunity how much it really is that s kind of hard to quantify but i think it has an upward trajectory to it tobey sommer truist securities analyst last question from me how are you thinking about margins going forward in the sort of resumption of some business expenses like travel and i say that as someone who s actually been on the road a little bit recently myself gary burnison chief executive officer yes and bob can answer this maybe and put a little bit more definition around it i think that the big question is inflation i think that s actually more germane than even travel and that s hard to predict where that s going to go and what the fed really does and where oil where it is today so i think that that is probably the biggest question i think when it comes to how people get work done that s forever changed and i would when this thing broke out two years ago i said that whatever we were doing before how we consume how we re entertained how we produce how we travel for business it s going to be kind of 50 of what it was i even think it s probably a greater change than 50 and i ll give you an example i was interviewing a young professional college grad second full time job mid 20s and this person last week was really bragging around their office culture well the truth is that none of them actually go into the office but yet he was really hyping up the office culture and it s an entirely different perspective today than when i entered the workforce so i think that change is pretty profound now in terms of margins bob maybe you could comment on that bob rozek executive vice president chief financial and corporate officer sure thank you tobey as we i think on the last earnings call talked about where we saw margins settling from a long term perspective as this kind of 18 19 range we still feel that that s the range that we ll settle into we reduced our real estate footprint by about a little over 20 if you remember we took a charge in q2 for that and then we still have probably another four percentage points of reduction but that will happen as leases come to their natural term over time it will be a couple of years before that works its way through i think on the bd and travel side that s the one area that we re watching very very closely if you remember before the pandemic we were spending 11 million or 12 million a quarter on that year to date we re probably averaging in the say 2 million 2 5 million a quarter range i expect that that will increase i think it will probably end up somewhere between the midpoint of zero and the 11 to 12 that we were at over the long haul but we ve got that factored into our long term views of where the margin is and then the last piece is obviously we manage our headcount closely and so as new business comes in we need resources to deliver it we ll bring people on board and to the extent there would be any slowdown we would just moderate that hiring to accommodate the slowdown in business and so we feel pretty good about the 18 to 19 tobey sommer truist securities analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of george tong from goldman sachs your line is open please go ahead george tong goldman sachs analyst hi thanks good morning can you talk a bit about the sensitivity of each of your lines of business to macro conditions which of course are currently evolving gary burnison chief executive officer well the big elephant in the room is obviously what s happening in ukraine and so that has an impact on our business in the ukraine and russia the ukraine business for us was probably about 1 million the russian business was 8 million those essentially have gone to zero overnight now we haven t seen a knock on effect for in other countries or other companies we haven t seen that to date march new business is starting out actually ahead of where february was of course it s very early in the month and that does not make a trend but it certainly is not negative if anything it s neutral to positive i think the biggest and i touched on this i think the biggest macro trend is really inflation and where does that really settle into over the next 12 to 18 months and what these central banks what is their stance toward inflation i think that s probably the biggest factor george tong goldman sachs analyst got it and maybe sticking to the topic of inflation can you talk a bit about pricing not just where pricing is increasing today but how much do you expect pricing to increase looking ahead and how that aligns with wage inflation that you re seeing among your recruiters internally gary burnison chief executive officer well we have a big comp and benefits advisory in digital business in our most recent survey that we did of companies around the world what you would find is that the companies are expecting about a 5 wage pressure now that varies by country and certainly our intuition on top of the data would absolutely support that so i think if you look at the recruiting businesses one would expect that there s going to continue to be pressure resulting from this nomadic labor market the scarcity of talent now how much that is george it s very hard to quantify because we don t know what central banks posture is going to be but as i indicated we have over the past few months increased our pricing and not just because of the macro environment but because of what our view of the impact that we have on companies and so we ll have to see where that goes george tong goldman sachs analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of mark marcon from baird your line is open please go ahead mark marcon robert w baird and company analyst hey hello everybody and thanks for taking my question congratulations on a strong quarter and a strong year to date performance just going to the elephant in the room gary obviously it s early and everything is occurring real time how do you think clients would are going to react and how would you differentiate that in terms of regions i would imagine emea would be the most impacted area but how what s your sense just in terms of in your conversations with your consultants and with clients gary burnison chief executive officer well right now it seems to be other than russia and ukraine it seems to be cautious but people are still moving forward and making decisions so i would say that that s probably the view part of that i think is dependent on if you go to emea what exactly how far does the eu go in terms of would they cut off natural gas or oil from russia that s a big question and not to say that was to happen but if that was to happen i think there s definitely a pretty huge impact on emea so asia we haven t really seen much we had chinese new year here in february but we really haven t seen as much as we have say in emea around people uniting around an atrocity and here in the united states the same view of course it s not closer to home mark marcon robert w baird and company analyst great and so it sounds like you re not seeing any cancellations of confirmations or any freezes yet or anything along those lines gary burnison chief executive officer no mark marcon robert w baird and company analyst but if you did you did a great job during covid in terms of managing expenses and being able to adjust quickly and preserving the earnings power and also the future potential do you feel like you have the same level of flexibility as what you were able to exercise during covid if something were to occur gary burnison chief executive officer absolutely yes there s no question about that i think great companies make their best moves in uncertain times i think we ve got a track record of that we clearly have contingency plans if that were to happen we ve put contingency plans in place over the last few weeks in eastern europe helping our colleagues that have been impacted by this so yes absolutely mark mark marcon robert w baird and company analyst great and then with regards to inflation you mentioned that several times it s also mentioned in the release multiple times what are you seeing just in terms of your own personnel and then in the context of the way that you were mentioning it how are you thinking about the range of possibilities there s obviously all sorts of different projections with regards to what central banks may end up doing both in the u s as well as the ecb and bofe in terms of what they may end up doing but how are you thinking about the potential range of those impacts gary burnison chief executive officer well on the one end it s the are you going to volcker ize paul volcker are you going to are we going to go back to the 70s where we crank up rates to 18 or 19 that s really hard for me to imagine that we re going to get back to that stance politically i just that seems pretty far out there so i don t see that and my own view would be that the fed at least is going to have to back off a little bit what they were talking about but in our just take our own company we ve for eligible employees trailing 12 months we ve raised salaries about 12 or so if you run that across the entire population it s probably more like 8 or 9 and i think at some point for companies if there is this forget oil i mean you could have a debate on whether somebody could afford gas or groceries but i think the bigger thing is around wages and that s a question that if that were to continue at some point companies are not able to pass that on to consumers which does impact earnings so that s i think that s the fundamental question here mark marcon robert w baird and company analyst got it and then what are you seeing just in terms of your ability to recruit obviously you ve distinguished yourself in terms of range of services the marquee programs going well what are you seeing just in terms of your ability to recruit and particularly like when we think about like areas that you ve targeted for growth like digital when we take a look at the consultant count there how should we think about that gary burnison chief executive officer in the digital area the thing that s exciting is that we have made a purposeful effort to expand our ecosystem and to work with partners to help drive that now that s not going to be next quarter but that s been a major pivot for us over the last call it six to nine months where we re partnering with at least a couple of companies to have a broader platform to distribute the ip that could be very meaningful for korn ferry in the digital business we re also going to have to continue to increase our own commercial capabilities our own commercial sales force so we ll do that we re still all out in finding consultants fee earners partners principals we very rarely dial that back so we re being very aggressive there and i think that people are attracted to the platform i mean we are i think at the intersection of what matters most and that s strategy and organization and its talent so we re continuing to recruit we re recruiting account leaders into the organization so we re still moving forward with that mark marcon robert w baird and company analyst great and then last question for me is it sounds like the lucas group is going really well how does that make you feel about future acquisitions in professional recruitment how are you feeling about the stat area and what you ve seen thus far gary burnison chief executive officer it makes me feel really good today it s a round up here it s a 400 million business the interim piece of that today is probably 60 million or 70 million and so i think we ve got not only the opportunity around professional search but also the interim business given this nomadic labor market we re going to continue to make investments there and i think that the it s not just a question of entering another talent acquisition market of professional search but it actually plays to the broader theme that we re really trying to build out is around developing professionals and today we develop over 1 million professionals a year and so the play there isn t strictly let s increase talent acquisition but let s also get into a market that could lead to learning journeys career development that plays into the digital businesses we look at the digital business today it s there s a couple really big areas we re trying to make a push on one is sales transformation and that if you look at this last quarter it s probably 17 18 of new business there s 15 million sales professionals in the united states alone that s going through enormous change we ve got fantastic ip around how salespeople can prioritize strategically opportunities we can couple that with coaching we could couple it with our developmental ip that we have so that s one and then the second one is around professional development so the leadership development for the organization overall is about 10 11 of revenue historically that s been at the high end of the work scape and we think we can actually through the digital business we re making a big push there around professional development below say the ceo level mark marcon robert w baird and company analyst all right thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of marc riddick from sidoti your line is open please go ahead marc riddick sidoti and company analyst good afternoon i was wondering if you could spend some time talking about if you re seeing much differentiation with end customer markets between various industry verticals as to maybe how far along they are in addressing the as you described it on the call the nomadic realities of the business and i was wondering if you could sort of discuss maybe some opportunities that maybe some industry verticals may be a little further along in taking advantage of as opposed to others gary burnison chief executive officer well it ranges i really do believe that we re in for more change over the next couple of years clearly we ve seen a great deal of change over the last two years but i think we re in for a lot of change over the next two years in terms of how people get work done and that should bode well for our firm it s hard to say if there s one particular industry that s ahead of others some are more have to be on the front line in terms of how they deliver products or services to consumers so it s hard to pinpoint one i would say that the clearly the push around esg is real and if you look at what s happened over the last couple of weeks not that that will solve today s crisis but it will create tomorrow s opportunity and so i do believe that that push of sustainability and we ve got a broad based solution anchored around that i think that s real whether that s it could be our energy business is only 4 of the company s top line but clearly we re seeing a lot of movement around there around how they reskill upskill create a green business so that should gain even further momentum over the next few quarters and years marc riddick sidoti and company analyst great and then just a quick follow up i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the recurring revenue and subscription revenue that as far as specifically to price increases around those types of services whether or not you re seeing much in the way of it doesn t seem as though there s much pushback but i was wondering if you could sort of give a bit of updated thoughts as to maybe what you re seeing as to those types of services that whether people are sort of rethinking how they utilize that or gives that an opportunity to sort of expand gary burnison chief executive officer well let me make a couple of comments and bob you can add to it i mean as you know we ve made a push to drive the digital business more and more through subscription and so this quarter in terms of new business it was almost 40 of new business now that is substantially different than say two or three years ago where we were not pushing that as much and so you ve got a different revenue recognition policy that s happening as a result of that subscription business so subscription business was 100 million i think one of the things and i mentioned that we re excited about is using an ecosystem to drive that business not only for our own commercial sales and consulting teams which we re going to continue to do because the digital business drives consulting and the consulting business drives digital there s definitely pull through but part of the answer to your question is also around the partners that we are doing business with and trying to embed our ip into their technology platforms that can over the long term drive that business now how we price that subscription business is similar to other saas models it s a license basis per seat basis so i can t say that there we ve seen that kind of an uptick in pricing that we ve seen in the talent acquisition businesses it s not as direct whereas in search professional search executive search you can see that you can see the wage pressure but i think as we if we put anchors down we put anchors down around sales transformation and we put anchors down around professional development and we could get both of those to 60 65 of the offering there we have just tremendous ip and that s a real opportunity for korn ferry bob rozek executive vice president chief financial and corporate officer yes gary the only thing i would add to that is the you talk about the how tremendous the ip is one of the very large tech companies that where we have a partnership with now who kind of specializes in sales and customer relationship management actually uses our ip with their sales force marc riddick sidoti and company analyst thank you very much operator next we have a follow up question from tobey sommer from truist securities your line is open please go ahead tobey sommer truist securities analyst thanks the question i wanted to ask is just to dig into your comments and kind of tone on inflation i think investors might assume that wage inflation in particular on average been good for the business and could be constructive on a go forward basis as well but you kind of struck a cautious tone so there may be other impacts could you dig into that a little bit more for me gary burnison chief executive officer well look it is overall i think if you look at the nomadic labor market and the change that s happening around how work gets done and you go to various things from organizational transformation to esg to d i all of those are an extreme positive and i think on korn ferry s business we ve been able and we will manage any kind of wage pressure and bob alluded to that around how we tightly manage the business and we ve got a track record of actually accelerating through an economic turn so i don t think anybody should take my comments and say ok gary is negative on what korn ferry can do but the reality is when you start seeing gas at 7 a gallon which it almost is in los angeles it does impact consumers and the big unknown is ecb and other federal what exactly is going to be their policy and i just believe i m not an economist but i think that they re going to have to back down i just don t see the political will particularly what s going on with this tragedy i mean what s unfolding in ukraine i just don t i think they re going to have to back off so i don t think you should read it as cautionary but it is a macro factor that is out there for any company in the world carolyn did we lose tobey operator he s still in the queue he may be on mute at this time and we did lose him just now gary burnison chief executive officer carolyn any other questions operator it appears we have no further questions mr burnison gary burnison chief executive officer ok listen thank you very very much and on the one

legislature s just concluded general session increasing the education budget by 383 million in ongoing revenue up 9 over the previous year the lion s share of the increase was a 6 bump to the value of the weighted pupil unit the basic building block of education funding in utah lawmakers also appropriated 10 million for teacher bonuses an acknowledgment of the additional responsibilities brought on by the covid 19 pandemic they also approved a one time 64 million increase for paid professional hours for teachers under hb396 which was a priority for the utah education association we re so excited about that bill s passage and what that s going to mean for our licensed educators we can t make more hours in the day but we can certainly respect it and the legislature has respected that request said uea president heidi matthews what wasn t funded school fees while utah schools will receive record funding it apparently wasn t enough that education leaders felt comfortable covering school fees with their robust appropriations parents pay the fees charged by junior high and high schools for curricular and extracurricular programs low income households are eligible for fee waivers but half of those who qualify do not seek them according to a recent report to the legislature hb211 which sought to eliminate curricular fees died in the senate meaning schools can charge the fees this fall unless they choose not to do that but there s no prohibition on charging them said rep adam robertson r provo bill s sponsor robertson said he understands that with rising fuel costs and unmet labor needs in schools educators were nervous about assuming the costs associated with fees but the costs were not insurmountable given the total 6 billion appropriated to schools for the coming year i know it s not easy to run a school i get the pressures but i just don t find a lot of tolerance for not being able to deal with these fees given the huge huge increase in the amount of public money going to schools he said robertson vowed to continue to work on school fees legislation and funding the bill passed in the house by a wide margin but was not considered in the senate he said he is deeply concerned about the accountability for school fees particularly the general fees that can range from 65 to 120 what is that used for i will dare say it s a slush fund used for a variety of things it has no oversight and it can be used for everything like a pep rally parents are paying for a general fee for that that s wrong robertson said sorting through extreme bills while the overall increase in funding and funding for specific needs identified by education stakeholders were in many cases addressed by lawmakers a number of curriculum transparency bills emerged during the session which educators viewed as attacks on their practice as professionals and they pushed back none of those bills advanced utah gov spencer cox said in an interview with the deseret news on friday teachers were extremely worried about the message the bills sent inferring that they educators don t know how to do their job such bills can be harmful and damaging cox said none passed which was the legislature s way of saying yeah we re not going to pass those extreme bills the governor said that said there have been some incidents of utah teachers behaving inappropriately in their classrooms he said now where there are real problems we certainly need to fix those and we ve had teachers fired who have been bad actors in the past and that s how it s supposed to work cox said lawmakers however did approve hb374 which prohibits elementary junior high and high schools from having materials that describe or depict pornographic or indecent acts senate floor sponsor sen todd weiler r woods cross explained on the final night of the legislative session this is not about banning books it s about a good process for reviewing what books are appropriate in schools under the same standard already applied to students and other materials in our existing code he said what happened with school choice vouchers another education proposal actively opposed by most education stakeholders was the hope scholarship program which sought to use public funds to help parents seek private education choices for their children hb331 sponsored by rep candice pierucci r herriman advanced to the house through

or replaying the story in its archived form does not constitute a republication of the story washington president joe biden on wednesday signed an executive order on government oversight of cryptocurrency that urges the federal reserve to explore whether the central bank should jump in and create its own digital currency treasury secretary janet yellen said the effort would promote a fairer more inclusive and more efficient financial system while countering illicit finance and preventing risks to financial stability and national security the biden administration views the explosive popularity of cryptocurrency as an opportunity to examine the risks and benefits of digital assets said a senior administration official who previewed the order tuesday on the condition of anonymity terms set by the white house under the executive order biden also directed the treasury department and other federal agencies to study the impact of cryptocurrency on financial stability and national security brian deese and jake sullivan biden s top economic and national security advisers respectively said the order establishes the first comprehensive federal digital assets strategy for the united states that will help position the u s to keep playing a leading role in the innovation and governance of the digital assets ecosystem at home and abroad in a way that protects consumers is consistent with our democratic values and advances u s global competitiveness deese and sullivan said wednesday in a joint statement the action comes as lawmakers and administration officials are increasingly voicing concern that russia may be using cryptocurrency to avoid the impact of sanctions imposed on its banks oligarchs and oil industry due to the invasion of ukraine last week democratic sens elizabeth warren mark warner and jack reed asked the treasury department to provide information on how it intends to inhibit cryptocurrency use for sanctions evasion the biden administration has argued that russia won t be able to make up for the loss of u s and european business by turning to cryptocurrency officials said the democratic president s order had been in the works for months before russia s vladimir putin invaded ukraine last month daleep singh a deputy national security and economic adviser to biden told cnn on wednesday that crypto s really not a workaround for our sanctions the executive order had been widely anticipated by the finance industry crypto traders speculators and lawmakers who have compared the cryptocurrency market to the wild west despite the risks the government said surveys show that roughly 16 of adult americans or 40 million people have invested in cryptocurrencies and 43 of men ages 18 29 have put their money into cryptocurrency coinbase global the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the united states said the company had not seen a recent surge in sanctions evasion activity treasury secretary janet yellen said last week that many participants in the cryptocurrency networks are subjected to anti money laundering sanctions and that the industry is not completely one where things can be evaded as for the federal reserve getting involved with digital assets the central bank issued a paper in january that said a digital currency would best serve the needs of the country through a model in which banks or payment firms create accounts or digital wallets some participants in digital currency welcome the idea of more government involvement with crypto adam zarazinski ceo of inca digital a crypto data company that does work for several federal agencies said the order presents the opportunity to provide new approaches to finance the u s has an interest in growing financial innovation zarazinksi said he added that china and russia were looking at crypto and building their own currency more than 100 countries have begun or are piloting their own digital sovereign currency according to the white house katherine dowling general counsel for bitwise asset management a cryptocurrency asset management firm said an executive order that provides more legal clarity on government oversight would be a long term positive for crypto but hilary allen a financial regulation professor at american university cautioned against moving too fast to embrace cryptocurrencies i think crypto is a place where we should be putting the brakes on this innovation until it s better understood she said as crypto becomes more integrated into our financial system it creates vulnerabilities not just to those who are investing in crypto but for everybody who participates in our economy on tuesday the treasury department said its financial literacy arm would work to develop consumer friendly materials to help people make informed choices about digital assets history has shown that without adequate safeguards forms of private money have the potential to pose risks to consumers and the financial system said

continues to foster renewed interest in the uranium sector the paris climate agreement calls for net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and certain nations are now targeting earlier realization of net zero the u s rejoined the agreement last year and the biden administration continues to voice support for the nuclear industry japan several member nations of the european union including france and the united kingdom have all made announcements of action plans placing nuclear energy as an integral part of the climate change solution the renewed support for nuclear energy prompted financial funds and uranium etfs as well as uranium developers and producers to purchase uranium inventories further supporting the uranium spot price in july 2021 the newly formed sprott physical uranium trust began its purchases of uranium and has established the means in the equity markets to raise more than 3 billion for such purchases the most recent participant in the long term investment in uranium is the physical uranium fund formed by kazakhstan that physical fund announced plans to raise as much as 500 million for purchasing uranium these events moved the spot price more than 68 percent from the beginning of 2021 to mid september when uranium spot prices reached a daily high of 50 50 after retreating to the mid and upper 40s for the remainder of 2021 uranium prices have rallied again in 2022 with spot prices reaching 50 75 recently in 2021 the company raised 55 2 million our unrestricted cash position as of march 3 2022 is 44 7 million in addition to our strong cash position we have nearly 284 000 pounds of finished u s produced u 3 o 8 inventory worth approximately 14 4 million at recent spot prices our financial position provides us with adequate funds to maintain and enhance operational readiness at lost creek as well as allowing us to preserve our existing inventory to sell into higher prices to further heighten our readiness to return to production operations at lost creek we commenced a drilling and development program in october initially we are drilling developing and constructing an additional header house hh2 4 in our fully permitted mu2 we anticipate that when this work is complete we will advance a delineation drill program in mu2 in preparation of operations beyond the hh2 4 the estimated cost of these development programs is 2 2 million we continue to diligently work to optimize processes and refine production plans to strengthen our operational readiness at lost creek our experienced lost creek operational staff is prepared to expand uranium production to an annualized run rate of up to 1 2 million pounds upon a go decision for ramp up our current and planned development initiatives will further enhance our operational readiness for a production ramp up which will then include further development work in the first two mine units followed by the ten additional mining areas as defined in the lost creek initial assessment prepared pursuant to s k 1300 following receipt of an approved license amendment in 2021 q2 the lost creek facility now has the constructed and licensed capacity to process up to 2 2 million pounds of u 3 o 8 per year and sufficient mineral resources to feed the processing plant for many years to come lost creek operations can increase to full production rates in as little as nine months following a go decision simply by developing additional header houses within the fully permitted mu2 once completed the ongoing mu2 development and construction programs will shorten the time to production development expenses during the full period of ramp up are estimated to be approximately 14 million these planned costs are nearly all related to mu2 drilling and construction of hh2 4 and beyond our long tenured operational and professional staff have significant levels of experience and adaptability which will allow for an easier transition back to full operations we are prepared to ramp up and

lost creek isr uranium property sweetwater county wyoming usa we filed an initial assessment technical report summary on our lost creek property sweetwater county wyoming usa the lost creek report march 7 2022 which was prepared by wwc the lost creek report not only provides the most recent resource update but also calculates the property s economics assuming a near immediate restart of wellfield development activities and the subsequent ramp up to a one million pound per year production rate the mineral resource estimate for the property is 11 9 million pounds eu 3 o 8 in the measured and indicated categories and 6 6 million pounds eu 3 o 8 in the inferred category lost creek has produced 2 7 million pounds u 3 o 8 as of december 31 2021 the mineral resource estimate was reduced to account for production to date notes sum of measured and indicated tons and pounds may not add to the reported total due to rounding eu 3 o 8 is a measure of gamma intensity from a decay product of uranium and is not a direct measurement of uranium numerous comparisons of eu 3 o 8 and chemical assays of lost creek rock samples as well as pfn logging indicate that eu 3 o 8 is a reasonable indicator of the chemical concentration of uranium table shows resources based on grade cutoff of 0 02 eu 3 o 8 and a grade x thickness cutoff of 0 20 gt measured indicated and inferred

before income taxes and 267 1 million after income taxes payback of the initial capital investments including 23 7 million in sunk costs which occurred prior to the beginning of the analysis is estimated during the second quarter of 2024 the property has a calculated before tax internal rate of return irr of 72 2 percent and a before tax net present value npv of 210 9 million applying an eight percent discount rate when income taxes are included in the calculation the after tax irr is 66 8 percent and the after tax npv is 156 8 million because inferred resources are mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have modifying factors applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves under relevant u s standards there is no certainty that this economic assessment which includes inferred resources will be realized to account for the chance that the inferred resources are not upgraded as the company collects additional drilling data while mining progresses at lost creek a second economic analysis was prepared which excludes inferred resources as required by s k 1300 the estimated lom production excluding the inferred resources is modeled to be 8 6 million pounds from 2022 to early 2032 all in the estimated total costs per pound including royalties and extraction taxes is estimated at 36 23 per pound

taxes excluding inferred resources the property has a calculated before tax irr of 71 7 percent and a before tax npv of 153 4 million applying an eight percent discount rate when income taxes are

rachel robasciotti said she became aware at a very young age how much having or not having enough money mattered growing up poor in a segregated neighborhood and raised by a black single mother who struggled to make ends meet she saw firsthand how different life was for the haves and have nots opportunities were harder to come by strong families buckled under constant pressure and crises seemed to hit the black parts of her rural community a bit harder than others so robasciotti who graduated from high school at 15 understood that money could also be the key to making a difference ten years later at age 25 she founded her own financial firm to put power back into the hands of the people in 2020 she launched adasina social capital the firm s social justice investing strategy and has been pushing to make matters of race gender economic and climate justice priorities for the industry she believes need to change as the world does i wanted to bring to women and people of color information about how they could manage their own financial lives and i wanted to do that on the investing side in a way that was really inclusive and responsible for the world robasciotti told financial planning it s no surprise that the people who are most impacted by climate change are people of color it s no surprise that the people who are impoverished by the sub minimum wage are disproportionately women of color i often say if you want to stop playing crisis whack a mole with social justice issues start to see the intersection of these and the intersection of extractive capitalism people s kindness and the resources of the planet are an exhaustible resource so i think it s really important that the investment industry start to see that and own our roles as asset managers insurance brokers and financial planners it s important that we move toward the future with an intention of understanding that what you invest in matters those are some of the topics robasciotti hopes to cover during the upcoming future proof festival slated to take place sept 11 14 on a half mile of beachfront in huntington beach california organizers for the event being billed as the world s largest wealth festival recently announced a slate of eight additional speakers who will deliver remarks at the conference including robasciotti as a keynote presenter future proof is gearing up for the event via its changing faces of wealth initiative a movement centered around leveling the playing field for historically underrepresented financial professionals in wealth management in conjunction with that effort onyx advisor network and advisor circle last month unveiled a partnership that will send some attendees to the festival for free it s all possible because of the risetogether campaign which runs from feb 1 through march 31 to coincide with black history month and women s history month during this time any attendee who registers for the future proof festival will be able to offer an underrepresented industry colleague a complimentary ticket to the event each paying attendee who extends a complimentary ticket will then be entered into a raffle to win a three night stay at hyatt huntington beach during the conference it s true that as an industry we have not done a good job at fostering diversity which is why the demography of our business looks nothing like the demography of america josh brown ceo of ritholtz wealth management and co creator of the future proof festival said in a statement but it is also true that there is a massive wave of talented people of color blazing new trails in the financial advisory space i m hoping our event can blow the lid off of this phenomenon and help usher in a more inclusive future we believe that our ability to innovate as an industry relies on varying perspectives and thoughts to challenge the status quo added advisor circle ceo matt middleton by cultivating an inclusive event environment we create opportunities that empower our financial services and wealth management audience to collaborate develop and inspire positive change together as a community robasciotti believes that future proof and other events like it can have a tremendous impact on the industry by changing the perception of what an industry leader looks like by lifting up new voices that buck the status quo you ensure that the future that you re creating is much different from the past she added that because the entire world is advocating for a change financial professionals are doing themselves a disservice when they listen to the same perspective over and over again the industry has not shifted significantly in terms of who s managing the assets and who s doing the advising on the investing side and i think we re at a place globally because of the times and the pandemic and racial justice uprisings and the me too movement we re in a moment where people want things to happen and that s going to come from new voices robasciotti said what you get when you don t let new water into a system is a swamp so if we aren t happy with the way things are turning out it s probably because we need some new voices and some new blood moved into the system robasciotti also thinks the conversations and experiences at future proof won t be quickly forgotten by its attendees generally when these kinds of things are over people block out whatever the events are and go about business as usual she said but what i think will happen at future proof is something that will be very different just by virtue of who we have speaking it s going to illuminate the common thread that all of the inequities and crises that we are facing in the world are intersectional here are the other recently announced speakers who will take the stage at future proof this september they join robasciotti equity army founder annie jean baptiste and onyx advisor network founders emlen miles mattingly and dasarte yarnway rashad bilal financial

google is fortifying its cloud services with a 5 4 billion acquisition of the cyber security firm mandiant the companies announced tuesday the acquisition is the first of many that analysts foresee in the cyber security sector following russia s invasion of ukraine analysts and government officials have said they expect a wave of cyberattacks from russia and others as geopolitical tensions rise in a massive growth backdrop for cyber security and further tailwinds seen during this ukraine invasion from russia bad actors nation state attacks we believe today s deal is the tip of the iceberg to a massive phase of consolidation potentially ahead for the cloud space wedbush analyst dan ives wrote tuesday google a subsidiary of mountain view california based alphabet inc will pay 23 per mandiant share in all cash deal expected to close this year the price represents a 57 premium on mandiant s share price in early february when speculation about a deal between the companies first surfaced mandiant based in reston virginia and its 5 300 employees will join google cloud as soon as the transaction closes the mandiant brand is synonymous with unmatched insights for organizations seeking to keep themselves secure in a constantly changing environment said google cloud ceo thomas kurian this is an opportunity to deliver an end to end security operations suite and extend one of the best consulting organizations in the world on tuesday mandiant reported that hackers working on behalf of the chinese government broke into the computer networks of at least six state governments in the united states in the last year mandiant s report does not identify the compromised states or offer a motive for the intrusions which began last may and continued through last month but the chinese group believed responsible for the breaches apt41 is known to launch hacking operations both for old fashioned espionage purposes and for financial gain technology research and advisory firm gartner estimates that total spending for worldwide information security and risk management reached 155 billion last year and is forecast to grow another 10 this year to more than 170 billion even before the war stock analysts have been predicting growth of as much as 20 in the cyber security sector russia has long been accused of disrupting other governments and businesses via online attacks and western officials have warned that russia could launch more cyberattacks against ukraine and its allies just one week before last month s invasion the u s blamed russia for a series of cyberattacks that knocked the websites of the ukrainian army the defense ministry and major banks offline anne neuberger the biden administration s deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies said there was no intelligence indicating that the u s would be targeted by a cyberattack but that remained a concern giving that the banking system does not have the cyber resilience that it should last fall microsoft said the same russia backed hackers responsible for the 2020 solarwinds breach continue to attack the global technology supply chain and have been relentlessly targeting cloud service companies and others since summer however the bid to acquire mandiant will likely get a thorough review from antitrust regulators groups that advocate for stronger antitrust regulation have already said the deal should be stopped the security arguments google is using to justify its second largest acquisition in history are the very same reasons why antitrust enforcers must block this deal said krista brown of the american economic liberties project regulators must investigate the cybersecurity space more broadly to understand the unknown and dangerous costs of consolidation in such an essential sector credit associated press ap photo credit ap

march 7 2022 which was prepared by wwc the lost creek report not only provides the most recent resource update but also calculates the property s economics assuming a near immediate restart of wellfield development activities and the subsequent ramp up to a one million pound per year production rate the mineral resource estimate for the property is 11 9 million pounds eu 3 o 8 in the measured and indicated categories and 6 6 million pounds eu 3 o 8 in the inferred category lost creek has produced 2 7 million pounds u 3 o 8 as of december 31 2021 the mineral resource estimate was

eight percent discount rate when income taxes are included in the calculation the after tax irr is 66 8 percent and the after tax npv is 156 8 million because inferred resources are mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have modifying factors applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves under relevant u s standards there is no certainty that this economic assessment which includes inferred resources will be realized to account for the chance that the inferred resources are not upgraded as the company collects additional

first things first there is no need for panic and it is important to remember the united states is a net food exporter the u s is blessed with a food production and capacity industry that leads the world we have fertile land abundant harvests and the strong advantage of food independence that said the influence of multinational corporations in our agriculture industry over the past three decades has ramifications and we have outlined exhaustively on these pages what the real world consequences are as we head into a chapter of global food crisis the food production capacity of the united states can be viewed as an asset but only insofar as we are willing to secure a national food supply for our own america first interests what we have talked about prudently on these pages is now coming into greater focus as global leaders are beginning to prepare their own citizens for the long term consequences of their disruption to the food supply chain the meteor of government intervention hit the ocean back in the spring of 2020 when government intervened in the food supply process the tsunami the ripple effect from that intervention is now within sight of shore i m not going to repeat the history here cth readers already know the details go deep for everyone else use the site search function as a result of intervention global covid intervention food stocks were depleted combined with increased energy costs driven by the ideological chase for climate change under the guise of build back better we end up with higher fertilizer costs for this year the ripple effect becomes a tsunami and the next round of global food harvests becomes more critically important and simultaneously more expensive for the past three months the sound of the alarms have grown louder now people are really starting to pay attention food supply chain commodity markets are soaring wheat is up about 50 in two weeks and corn just touched a decade high the surging costs could end up weighing on currencies in emerging markets where food represents a bigger share of consumer price baskets and analysts are predicting export flows will continue to be disrupted for months even if the war were to end tomorrow the crisis extends beyond just the impact of grain exports critical as they are russia is also a key supplier for fertilizers virtually every major crop in the world depends on inputs like potash and nitrogen and without a steady stream farmers will have a harder time growing everything from coffee to rice and soybeans plainly speaking there are few other places on the planet where a conflict like this could create such a devastating blow to ensuring that food supplies stay plentiful and affordable it s why russia and ukraine are known as the breadbaskets to the world read more there is some alarmism in that last cited paragraph russia and ukraine are not breadbaskets to the world they are breadbaskets to europe parts of the middle east and parts of asia in the northern hemisphere it is more accurate to say russia and ukraine are to europe what the united states is to north america canada and mexico could survive without the u s farmland but they would have to modify quickly europe the u k and scandinavia can survive without russia ukraine but they too would need to modify quickly analogously central america would be less impacted by u s harvest disruptions than eastern asia the destination for most of our agricultural exports the beneficiaries of ukraine russia harvests in southern europe and the middle east are more vulnerable than the beneficiaries in the u k and northern europe the issue for us in the united states is going to be increased global demand for agricultural food products from us to fill any void created by the ukraine russia conflict this demand side issue is made more complicated by multinational ownership of our farm outputs big ag corporate ownership of u s food products could become an issue if we have external geopolitical influences upon the u s food supply the united states government has never had to view food supplies as a national security threat however because supply has never been an issue and because the multinational ownership rose up during a time frame when supply was never an issue there is no reference point for how or even if the u s government will react if domestic food outputs are distributed away from american citizens by corporations chasing the highest financial return think about it note wheat corn and soybeans are the foundation of the u s food supply they are primarily used as ingredients in processed foods oils and are fed to the cattle hogs and poultry that supply meat and eggs for the american diet when those grain harvests go up in price the downstream increase in price is far reaching remember there is no such thing as a commodity market in the free market sense of the word those commodity markets are now controlled markets and fully under the control of massive multinational agricultural corporations it is critical to think of big ag in the same way we already are familiar with multinational manufacturing of durable goods we are already familiar how china mexico and asean nations export our raw materials ore coking coal rare earth minerals etc the raw materials to manufacture goods are then trans shipped back into the u s for purchase it is within this decades long process where we lost the manufacturing base and the multinational economic planners world trade organization put us on a path to being a service driven economy the road to a service driven economy is paved with a great disparity between financial classes the wealth gap is directly related to the inability of the middle class to thrive elite financial interests including those within washington dc gain wealth and power while the u s workforce is reduced to servitude service of their affluent needs the destruction of the u s industrial and manufacturing base is exactly why the wealth gap has exploded in the past 30 years with that familiarity did you think the multinationals would stop with only durable goods they don t they didn t the exact same exfiltration and exploitation has been happening with increased speed over the past 20 years with consumable goods i e food raw material foodstuff is exported to china asean nations and mexico processed and shipped back into the u s as a finished product this is the same design flow with food as previously exploited by other economic sectors including auto manufacturing multinational corporations big ag are now invested in controlling the outputs of u s agricultural industry and farmers this overall process is why food prices were rising so fast in the past decade government covid intervention in the food supply chain made these pricing issues worse government energy policy under the guise of build back better is pouring fuel into the inflationary furnace the free market was not determining price before covid there was no supply and demand influence in the modern agricultural dynamic food commodities have been a controlled market just like durable goods the raw material harvests writ large was exploited by the financial interests of massive multinational corporations all of these dynamics created the meteor which quietly hit the ocean when no one noticed now the tsunami warning sirens are sounding and people are starting to wonder why this global crisis could provide the perfect entry for global government to fundamentally transform their relationship with the people food insecurity will generate massive demands on governments around the world for solutions even the preppers who are well prepared for what might happen will be subject to the outcomes of the government solutions just like all travelers having to take their shoes off at the airport security check we all live in the same world so when they change it for the few it changes for the many final thought even if you are well prepared for the worst case scenario when they hand the ration cards or food gas coupons get in line with everyone else and use them even if you don t need them do not draw any attention to yourself do not behave any differently than anyone else even if it doesn t suck for you give the appearance that it does keep the eyes of a mouse and the ears of an elephant

r1t truck make rivian segment sports car we can all agree that rivian has not had the strongest start to the year things were looking good when we drove the r1t late last yearand then saw the truck having fun in the snow to start 2022 but just shortly after that it was revealed that the company was struggling to get its cars off the production line as a result of this its substantial stock value began a steady decline shortly after that it was met with massive pushback from the locals after it announced that it had plans to construct a new 5 billion production facility in georgia in the last few days of february an agreement was found between the company and the state of georgia for the new plant but then rivian went and jacked up all its prices causing big problems close it cited the reason for this to be that it had not adjusted its initial 2018 pricing for the current rate of inflation as you can expect this was met with massive outrage that resulted in its stock price lowering ever further rivian acted fairly quickly by reversing the increases but it looks as if the damage has already been done this particular situation is so severe that it has now been revealed a shareholder in the company is filing a case against rivian for not informing investors that the products were underpriced as reported by reuters shareholder charles larry crews filed a complaint with the u s district court of san francisco stating that rivian was not transparent about the pricing of its products close he suggests that the brand intentionally raised the cost of its cars shortly after its ipo became public last november more than 30 defendants have been named in the lawsuit such as scaringe and lead ipo underwriters jpmorgan chase goldman sachs and morgan stanley crews who purchased 35 shares in the company on opening day adds that rivian s decision to make its range more expensive would tarnish rivian s reputation as a trustworthy and transparent company as we saw the result of this decision did result in some of 55 400 reservation holders canceling their orders crews also classifies the reversal of the price increase as a futile attempt at damage control hopefully rivian can get past yet another setback

as the city s inhabitants work to remove the dead amid brutal shelling from russian troops ukraine has rejected most russian evacuation routes because they lead to russian soil or that of its ally belarus while routes that ukraine has proposed have come under bombardment the only successful evacuation to take place so far has been from sumy to poltava in green local official pavlo kyrylenko confirmed the fears in a post on facebook the maternity ward in the city centre the children s ward and the therapy ward at the hospital all destroyed in the russian air raid just hours before the hospital was hit ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kuleba warned that 3 000 babies were without food or medicines and begged for a humanitarian corridor to allow them to flee moscow had promised a ceasefire in the city today so civilians could be evacuated but failed for the fourth time to keep its word a move kyrylenko said crossed the line of humanity before declaring russians should stop calling yourselves human beings residents of mariupol were pictured on wednesday dumping bodies into mass graves dug on the outskirts of the city in a desperate attempt to remove the dead amid the sustained russian bombardment it is not the first time that russian airstrikes have targeted hospitals while fighting alongside bashar al assad in syria in 2016 putin s generals were accused of deliberately and systematically blowing up hospitals as a way of weakening the city of aleppo ahead of a ground assault observers have suggested that russia is now using a syria style battleplan against ukraine after its early precision strikes failed the ukrainian healthcare center a think tank based in the country says that between the outbreak of fighting on february 24 and yesterday their team documented 42 cases of russian forces attacking either healthcare facilities or medics in order to deliberately provoke a humanitarian crisis hospitals had been struck in every theatre where russian forces were operating the think tank said including donetsk luhansk mariupol kyiv chernihiv kharkiv sumy zhytomyr zaporizhzhia and mykolaiv the humanitarian catastrophe is a part of russia s hybrid war intends to spread panic create a flow of refugees at the borders and force the ukrainian government to surrender said pavlo kovtonyuk co founder of the think tank the bombing took place during what was supposed to be a ceasefire in mariupol so that civilians could evacuate it marks the fourth time a so called humanitarian corridor out of the city has failed because russian forces opened fire the mayor of izyum to the east of kharkiv said evacuations that were supposed to be underway there yesterday also had to stop because russians were bombing the escape route but in sumy a short distance away some civilians had managed to make it out successful evacuations also took place in enerhodar in the south with women and children able to leave it is feared the evacuations are simply a precursor to russia stepping up its bombardment of the cities to wear down dogged ukrainian defenders before rolling in troops and tanks to capture them cia director william burns briefing congress on putin s state of mind tuesday warned the angry and frustrated despot is likely to double down and try to grind down the ukrainian military with no regard for civilian casualties giving an update on the military situation yesterday afternoon ukrainian commanders said russian units continue to try and surround the capital kyiv with attacks taking place to the west and north east of the city with several highways blocked new footage released on wednesday purported to show russian armour just 13 miles from kyiv as the invaders pushed through the town of irpin fighting also raged close to the city of sumy in an attempt to surround ukraine s second largest city of kharkiv commanders said battles also broke out around the city of mykolaiv in the south as russians attempted to push out from kherson towards odessa but were turned back ukrainian commanders also said russian military police had rounded up 400 activists protesting against the invasion in the occupied city of kherson as the long arm of vladimir putin s police state reached across the border to grab people on foreign soil russia s defence ministry meanwhile acknowledged for the first time on wednesday that some conscripts had been sent to fight on the frontlines in ukraine just days after putin promised that only professional soldiers would be sent in some associations of soldiers mothers in russia had raised concerns about a number of conscripts going incommunicado at the start of what kremlin calls a special military operation in ukraine suggesting they could have been sent to fight despite a lack of adequate training the revelation comes just one week after russia s parliament passed a law imposing a prison term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally fake news about the military unfortunately we have discovered several facts of the presence of conscripts in units taking part in the special military operation in ukraine practically all such soldiers have been pulled out to russia the defence ministry said promising to prevent such situations in the future liz truss described the hospital attack as absolutely abhorrent but continued to reject ukraine s request for a no fly zone to be imposed over its skies speaking in washington she said the best way we can protect the skies is through anti air weaponry which the uk is now going to be supplying to ukraine of course the attack on the hospital is absolutely abhorrent reckless and appalling us secretary of state antony blinken said us involvement in a no fly zone could prolong the conflict making it even deadlier our goal is to end the war not to expand it including potentially expanding it to nato territory he said we want to make sure it is not prolonged to the best of our ability otherwise it is going to turn even deadlier involve more people and i think potentially even make things harder to resolve in ukraine itself earlier uk defence secretary ben wallace told the mps that the ministry of defence was looking at whether they could supply anti aircraft missiles as well as more anti tank weapons a baby is evacuated as people flee near a destroyed bridge to cross the irpin river on the outskirts

the same time as shelling a maternity hospital in mariupol in his latest vile display of hypocrisy the russian leader spoke with maria lvova belova at the kremlin today after overseeing a savage two week campaign in ukraine which has seen children killed orphaned or forced to flee their homes putin held the meeting to discuss changes to the law which will allow russians to adopt ukrainian orphans after his forces killed their parents the changes will mean children from donetsk and luhansk who do not have russian citizenship will qualify for adoption putin said in the meeting these are extraordinary circumstances and it seems to me that we need to think not about bureaucratic delays but about the interests of children i will make proposals we will change the legislation we will appeal to the state duma i am sure that the deputies will support you lvova belova said 1 090 orphans have been evacuated to russia from the two republics an estimated one million children have been forced to flee ukraine since the barbaric invasion was launched advertisement we can all see the horrific devastation inflicted on civilian areas by russian artillery and air strikes indiscriminate and murderous he said it is vital therefore that ukraine maintains its ability to fly and to suppress russian air attack mr wallace said that in response to a ukrainian request the government was exploring the donation of starstreak high velocity man portable anti air missiles he also confirmed that 3 615 nlaw anti tank weapons had been supplied up from the previously announced figure of 2 000 and small consignments of the javelin system would also be sent to ukraine other western officials expressed concern that putin could next resort to the use of non conventional weapons such as chemical weapons in the conflict one official speaking on condition of anonymity said i think we ve got good reason to be concerned about possible use of non conventional weapons partly because of what we ve seen has happened in other theatres as i ve mentioned before for example what we ve seen in syria partly because we ve seen a bit of setting the scene for that in the false flag claims that are coming out and other indications as well before the rocket attack took place mariupol s deputy mayor spoke about the dire situation in the besieged city saying residents had been forced to use melted snow as drinking water as it runs dangerously low on supplies serhiy orlov admitted that he didn t know how long the blockaded urban centre would be able to continue under siege as he spoke to cnn s john berman about the devastating bombings on wednesday orlov said today was their fifth attempt to provide a humanitarian corridor to get supplies and transport into mariupol but he added that by 3pm local time the buses had not made it anywhere near the city he said many residents are unable to leave as mariupol is being bombed each second after russian forces have broken their ceasefire agreement despite agreeing to open humanitarian corridors allowing citizens to flee there is no ceasefire any ceasefire in mariupol mariupol is under continuous shelling from the artillery and bombing each hour each minute each second he added mariupol which has been under blockage for eight days is one of the ukrainian cities worst hit since the invasion began with russian forces bringing widespread destruction to residential and administrative centres speaking about the devastation across the city orlov said russian forces had destroyed their biggest steel planter as he warned that the situation is unmanageable he praised the bravery of the ukrainian army but warned that it is the humanitarian crisis is also worsening adding we are not able to protect our lives president volodymyr zelensky yesterday warned that the port city was running dangerously low on food water and medicine ukrainian territorial defence forces have been able to deliver vital supplies to some residents but many more remain isolated and unable to access lifesaving rations reiterating zelensky s stark warning orlov said there is no more electricity heating gas or water supplies in mariupol adding that residents have had to resort to collecting wood to make fires for warmth and using melted snow as drinking water it s an awful situation and i cannot imagine in my mind that it s possible in the 21st century but it is true he said when asked how long the city might be able to continue under siege orlov admitted he didn t know as he claimed there are at least 3 000 infants who are currently without food american talk show host berman also asked the deputy mayor whether his own family are safe after he previously spoken about being unable to reach his parents in response a devastated orlov said the district where his parents lived has been completely destroyed saying it does not exist anymore as he admitted he doesn t know if they are alive he added the district where they live is flattened and i m not sure that i can see them anymore but i hope and pray they are alive ukrainian commanders said today that russia s attack on the country has slowed significantly with no major gains in any sector while its forces were bolstering defenses in key cities and holding the line in the northern city of chernihiv russian forces are placing military equipment among residential buildings and on farms the ukrainian general staff said and in the south it said russians dressed in civilian clothes are advancing on the city of mykolaiv it did not provide any details of new fighting in kyiv back to back air alerts wednesday morning urged residents to get to bomb shelters as quickly as possible over fears of incoming russian missiles soon after an all clear was given for the first alert a second alert followed such alerts are common though irregular keeping people on edge kyiv has been relatively quiet in recent days though russian artillery has pounded the outskirts kyiv regional administration head oleksiy kuleba said the crisis for civilians was growing in the capital with the situation particularly critical in the city s suburbs russia is artificially creating a humanitarian crisis in the kyiv region frustrating the evacuation of people and continuing shelling and bombing small communities he said meanwhile boris johnson continued to resist calls to drop visa requirements for ukrainians fleeing the violence insisting the security checks were vital to prevent president putin infiltrating agents into the uk the prime minister said a thousand visas had been granted under the scheme allowing relatives of people in britain to flee the war zone to join their families and he promised another programme allowing individuals to offer a home to ukrainians would be set out in the next few days more than 2 million people have now fled ukraine according to the united nations we know how unscrupulous putin can be in his methods it would not be right to expose this country to unnecessary security risk and we will not do it he said we are going to be as generous as we can possibly be but we must have checks his comments in the commons followed a call from ukraine s ambassador to the uk to temporarily drop the visa requirement vadym prystaiko hit out at the bureaucracy of the british system telling mps i don t want to see these

since its formation in 2020 the big sky passenger rail authority bspra has been successful in touting its mission to re establish rail passenger service through southern montana enthusiasm for the project was heightened in november 2021 with the passage of infrastructure investment and jobs act which for the first time in the service s 51 year history has designated significant funding for amtrak america s intercity rail passenger service but often lost in press releases by the bspra and in recent news articles are what should be the primary goals for the funding fixing the amtrak s infrastructure and placing it on a path of sustainability contrary to highways waterways and airports which receive recurring lavish funding from numerous government entities amtrak has always been a shoestring operation since its 1971 inception and relies on private infrastructure i e america s freight railroads for most of its routes including in montana amtrak is currently broken in the northeast where amtrak owns and maintains its own trackage routes need upgrades to handle more traffic and to repair deferred maintenance some of which goes back to damage caused by hurricane sandy in 2012 on other routes like the empire builder on the hi line trains operate short of rolling stock with equipment over 40 years old many station facilities remain non compliant with ada guidelines and the host freight railroads are undercompensated for operating amtrak trains resulting in timekeeping issues without repairing and stabilizing the amtrak we have adding additional routes like a north coast hiawatha is counterproductive based on a 2009 study done by amtrak restoring the north coast hiawatha would cost about 1 4 billion in 2022 dollars much has changed in railroad operations since 2009 during the great recession so indeed a new study to determine cost would be needed even with that hefty price tag the 2009 study dramatically understated cost for stations and some track infrastructure the capital costs alone for this one route will consume a good portion of the funding available for new services the elephant in the room rarely mentioned by proponents of new routes is that operations funding is not perpetual for amtrak s current chicago west coast routes according to questionable amtrak accounting that s about 55 million annually per train the infrastructure investment and jobs act covers operations funding for only six years covering 90 percent the first year declining to 30 percent by the sixth year before being discontinued any shortfall and funding beyond the sixth year must be covered by congress in the annual amtrak appropriation this is why the north coast hiawatha was discontinued in 1979 it and other trains were added over the course of the decade when congress declined to no longer fully fund all the routes some were discontinued the same thing could happen again possibly even to long established well patronized trains such as the empire builder we must urge that our elected and appointed officials see that the amtrak we have is fixed and strengthened before building on a house of cards mark meyer is a passenger rail advocate from portland oregon formerly from cut bank

david a lieb the associated press with gas prices at record highs across the u s an increasing number of governors and state lawmakers are calling for the suspension of gas taxes to provide relief to motorists who are facing the prospect of even higher pump prices as the country cuts off russian oil imports proposals for a gas tax holiday to counter inflation had been moving slowly in congress and state capitols before russia invaded ukraine but they have gained momentum this week amid surging prices that averaged 4 25 a gallon on wednesday according to aaa republican legislative leaders in michigan and pennsylvania announced proposals wednesday to suspend or reduce state gas taxes that came after the republican governor of georgia and democratic governor of california both called for relief from state gas taxes tuesday when president joe biden ordered a ban on russian oil imports meanwhile the democratic governors of colorado michigan minnesota new mexico pennsylvania and wisconsin sent a joint letter to congressional leaders urging them to support legislation suspending the federal government s 18 4 cent a gallon gas tax through 2022 critics of the proposals say there is no guarantee the savings would get passed on to consumers and worry that suspending gas taxes could hurt funding for road projects even so the eye popping prices at the pump are prompting lawmakers to act prep for the polls see who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our voter guide in the past several days we have seen gas prices skyrocket to historic levels pennsylvania senate president pro tempore jake corman a republican running for governor said in a memo seeking co sponsors for the legislation we must do all that we can to address this now at the state government level and offer our support to hard working families pennsylvania s 57 6 cent a gallon gas tax is the highest in the nation just ahead of california s corman said he is introducing legislation for a roughly one third reduction through the rest of the year the lost gas tax revenue would be offset by directing 500 million of federal covid 19 relief aid to state police and issuing 650 million in bonds to ensure infrastructure projects remain funded gas prices are up will rising oil costs increase food prices next legislation pending to offset gas tax revenue loss legislation pending in both the u s house and u s senate also would offset lost revenue from a gas tax suspension by transferring an equal amount of general fund dollars to the accounts that fund state highway and public transit programs the legislation is opposed by groups that advocate for road and bridge funding they fear a tax suspension would set a poor precedent and become politically difficult to restore if politicians are cast as supporting a tax hike when it kicks back in the potential for lost infrastructure funding has been one of the biggest obstacles to those seeking to suspend or reduce gas taxes but some state officials say they can afford the financial hit many states ended their 2021 fiscal years with record cash balances due to an influx of federal pandemic aid and a resurgent economy that yielded greater income and sales tax revenue than expected suspending michigan s 27 2 cent a gallon fuel tax for the remaining six months of the state fiscal year would cost about 750 million republican legislative leaders said michigan has billions of dollars in surplus revenue available house speaker jason wentworth said in statement wednesday the solution here isn t complicated republicans are going to take action today and put a real plan on the governor s desk to actually lower the cost at the pump though average gas prices are at record levels they are not yet the highest that americans have paid when adjusted for inflation the previous record high of 4 10 a gallon in july 2008 would be equal to about 5 24 in today s dollars proposals to suspend gas taxes are based on an assumption that the savings would be passed on to consumers money saved at the pump translates into dollars back in consumers pockets for groceries childcare rent and more the six democratic governors wrote in their letter tuesday to democratic and republican congressional leaders but transportation advocates say that because of other factors affecting gas prices the full amount of tax cuts may not be reflected at the pump financial pressures these 7 occupations may feel the heat from soaring gas prices how much of gas tax savings would be passed on to drivers on average only about one third of the value of previous gas tax cuts or tax increases were passed on to consumers according to a 2020 report from the american road transportation builders association that analyzed 113 state gas tax changes enacted over several years that s because retail gas prices are influenced by complex factors including the price of crude oil and supply and demand pressures the real problem with this approach at both the federal and the state level is that there s no way to ensure that the people will see this savings when they go to the gas pump to fill up their cars their suvs and trucks said jim tymon executive director of the american association of state highway and transportation officials last year georgia gov brian kemp suspended state motor fuel taxes for several days to offset increasing prices after a computer hack led to the shutdown of a key pipeline that carries fuel to much of georgia kemp on tuesday said he again wants to suspend the state s 29 1 cent a gallon gas tax because of rising prices though details remain to be worked out in legislation introduced in the general assembly california gov gavin newsom also renewed a call to provide relief from rising gas prices during his state of the state address tuesday after a previous proposal gained little traction in the democratic led legislature the average price for a gallon of gas in california reached 5 57 on wednesday the highest nationally according to aaa after newsom s speech california senate president pro tem toni atkins and assembly speaker anthony rendon issued a joint statement saying they plan to pursue tax relief from the general fund instead of a small cut to the gas tax that might not get passed on to consumers virginia lawmakers also were negotiating this week whether to suspend a recent gas tax hike for one year the proposal was a key campaign pledge of gov glenn youngkin a republican elected last november the republican controlled house included the temporary 5 cent gasoline tax cut in its budget proposal but the democrat controlled senate did not before russia s invasion of ukraine republican gov ron desantis of florida had proposed a five month pause on the state s gas tax this summer as part of a broader package of tax relief democratic gov j b pritzker of illinois also had proposed to halt an automatic 2 2 cent increase in the state s motor fuel tax as part of a broader tax cut plan lawmakers in other states including maryland minnesota new york and ohio also have proposed to suspend or roll back gas taxes a day after russia invaded ukraine missouri state rep andrew schwadron a republican filed legislation to suspend the state s motor fuel taxes for six months citing an emergency to protect consumers from rising prices the quickest way that we could provide that relief would be by temporarily suspending that gas tax he said rising gas prices in the u s high gas prices affecting you share your thoughts and photos with usa today are you changing

the only plausible solution to climate change ur energy is in the enviable position of being able to quickly ramp up and participate in an improving uranium market and in addition we could immediately deliver up to 284 000 pounds u 3 o 8 into the uranium reserve program currently being established by the u s department of energy on march 3 2022 we had 44 7 million in cash plus our ready to sell u s produced inventory worth approximately 14 4 million at recent spot prices additionally we continue to advance the construction of header house 2 4 to expedite production when market signals allow us to ramp up at lost creek financial results as of december 31 2021 we had cash resources consisting of cash and cash equivalents of 46 2 million no sales of u 3 o 8 were necessary in 2021 the company had a net loss of 22 9 million or 0 12 per common share lost creek operations due to persistent low uranium prices we continued to limit our production operations following our reduction in operations in 2020 q3 we maintained controlled reduced level production operations throughout 2021 the reduced operations have allowed us to sustain operating cost reductions at lost creek while conducting preventative maintenance and optimizing processes in preparation for ramp up to full production rates during 2021 we captured 251 pounds of u 3 o 8 at our lost creek plant we made no sales of u 3 o 8 in 2021 the first two mine units at lost creek mu1 and mu2 have all appropriate operating permits as we awaited the return of a robust uranium market we worked to make ready mu2 and the lost creek plant for an efficient transition to full production rates the main trunkline that services the first five mu2 header houses is installed and the entirety of mu2 has been fenced in 2021 q4 we commenced a drilling and construction program to complete the development of the fourth header house in mu2 hh2 4 hh2 4 and its associated drilling and wellfield development is expected to be complete in 2022 q2 at which time hh2 4 will be ready for production a delineation drilling program to support geologic design in the following four header houses of mu2 will also be completed in 2022 q2 together with our optimization of plant processes these wellfield programs will significantly advance our readiness and shorten the time frame to production when ramp up occurs 2021 results the

working group and positive developments in the uranium markets as a result production rates at lost creek declined significantly during the past two years and will remain low until a decision to ramp up is made no pounds were drummed in 2021 at the end of the year we had 283 790 pounds of u 3 o 8 at the conversion facility including 267 049 produced pounds at an average cost per pound of 28 04 and

continues to foster renewed interest in the uranium sector the paris climate agreement calls for net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and certain nations are now targeting earlier realization of net zero the u s rejoined the agreement last year and the biden administration continues to voice support for the nuclear industry japan several member nations of the european union including france and the united kingdom have all made announcements of action plans placing nuclear energy as an integral part of the climate change solution the renewed support for nuclear energy prompted financial funds and uranium etfs as well as uranium developers and producers to purchase uranium inventories further supporting the uranium spot price in july 2021 the newly formed sprott physical uranium trust began its purchases of uranium and has established the means in the equity markets to raise more than 3 billion for such purchases the most recent participant in the long term investment in uranium is the physical uranium fund formed by kazakhstan that physical fund announced plans to raise as much as 500 million for purchasing uranium these events moved the spot price more than 68 percent from the beginning of 2021 to mid september when uranium spot prices reached a daily high of 50 50 after retreating to the mid and upper 40s for the remainder of 2021 uranium prices have rallied again in 2022 with spot prices reaching 50 75 recently in 2021 the company raised 55 2 million our unrestricted cash position as of march 3 2022 is 44 7 million in addition to our strong cash position we have nearly 284 000 pounds of finished u s produced u 3 o 8 inventory worth approximately 14 4 million at recent spot prices our financial position provides us with adequate funds to maintain and enhance operational readiness at lost creek as well as allowing us to preserve our existing inventory to sell into higher prices to further heighten our readiness to return to production operations at lost creek we commenced a drilling and development program in october initially we are drilling developing and constructing an additional header house hh2 4 in our fully permitted mu2 we anticipate that when this work is complete we will advance a delineation drill program in mu2 in preparation of operations beyond the hh2 4 the estimated cost of these development programs is 2 2 million we continue to diligently work to optimize processes and refine production plans to strengthen our operational readiness at lost creek our experienced lost creek operational staff is prepared to expand uranium production to an annualized run rate of up to 1 2 million pounds upon a go decision for ramp up our current and planned development initiatives will further enhance our operational readiness for a production ramp up which will then include further development work in the first two mine units followed by the ten additional mining areas as defined in the lost creek initial assessment prepared pursuant to s k 1300 following receipt of an approved license amendment in 2021 q2 the lost creek facility now has the constructed and licensed capacity to process up to 2 2 million pounds of u 3 o 8 per year and sufficient mineral resources to feed the processing plant for many years to come lost creek operations can increase to full production rates in as little as nine months following a go decision simply by developing additional header houses within the fully permitted mu2 once completed the ongoing mu2 development and construction programs will shorten the time to production development expenses during the full period of ramp up are estimated to be approximately 14 million these planned costs are nearly all related to mu2 drilling and construction of hh2 4 and beyond our

by michael lebowitz while higher gas prices may be welcome news to the oil industry the rest of us should be concerned as it is a glaring recession warning over the last 40 years higher gas prices have been linked to economic stagnation and recession the ford f 150 is the most popular car in america per edmunds it gets on average about 21 miles to the gallon the u s department of transportation claims americans drive 13 500 miles a year according to aaa the average price for regular gas was 2 76 a year ago today the average is 4 17 the average u s consumer spent 1 774 on gasoline a year ago at current prices the average consumer is spending nearly 1 000 more the current spike in oil and gas prices is primarily due to two factors the elephant in the room is russia and its invasion of ukraine second and behind the scenes is the global push toward greener energy sources we explore these considerations and the relationship of high gas prices to economic activity to help better appreciate the recessionary omen staring us in the face we use the terms oil and gas interchangeably throughout this article please understand gas is a byproduct of oil and therefore its price is a function of oil prices and other factors high gas prices and recessions before a broader discussion of why oil prices are increasing we explain the extensive role that oil plays in the economy and why the price of oil can have such a significant impact on economic activity micro perspective personal consumption accounts for about two thirds of economic activity that is a very important consideration when thinking about gas prices and economic activity in economics gasoline is considered an inelastic good regardless of how high the gas price is consumer demand does not vary much without gas we can t get to work go shopping or do many of the things we enjoy accordingly the price of oil and specifically gasoline play a prominent role in budgeting our money given the difficulty in reducing gas usage many consumers must spend less on other items or borrow to offset higher gas prices the less obvious but equally important role gas prices play is with our consumer psyche gas prices are better advertised than any other good or service gas stations are everywhere we drive and every one of them has a billboard flashing gas prices the price of gas is one of a select few items in which most consumers can regularly quote a price with great accuracy as gas prices rise consumers tend to associate it with broader inflation whether true or not energy goods and services only account for 7 5 of cpi but it plays a much bigger role in many people s minds as such higher gas prices drive a greater fear of inflation which often causes consumers to pull back on other purchases macro perspective oil is not just used to fuel our engines but it is a component in a considerable number of products even if oil or an oil byproduct is not a product component it plays a role in producing and shipping that product to the consumer the list below from ranken energy scratches the surface of everyday products made from petroleum given the widespread reliance on oil in almost every good there is a strong correlation between oil prices and economic activity the graph below shows spikes in oil prices orange correspond well with recessions gray and recession probabilities blue the st louis federal reserve furnishes recession probabilities data data jeremy piger s website contains more information on the calculation behind the data we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the graph below courtesy of pictet asset management goes back a little further in time and affirms the relationship between oil price spikes and economic activity russia the elephant in the room russia is the world s largest natural gas producer and edges out saudi arabia behind the u s in oil production it accounts for about an eighth of global oil production sanctions on russia and the ramifications of the invasion are beginning to significantly impact the oil price however the flow of oil from russia has not yet been materially curtailed a further ratcheting of sanctions especially any directed directly at their ability to sell oil will push gas prices higher crude oil traders do not wait for sanctions to be levied they put odds on such sanctions as such the price of oil today reflects the market s collective mindset on what may or may not happen with russia the longer the conflict carries on and the more intense the fighting the higher the likelihood that oil prices will stay elevated and possibly rise further on march 2nd opec elected to stick with its current plan of gradual production increases they had an opportunity to increase production considering the crisis but didn t many nations are releasing oil from their reserves thus far these actions have had a limited ability to counteract rising prices barring an immediate sharp decline in demand which is not probable or cessation of russian activities oil prices will weigh on economic activity the graph below shows that the backwardation of oil futures prices is extreme without going into detail the chart below shows that oil prices are between 20 and 40 a barrel above what fundamentals justify for more information on the graph please read our daily commentary from 3 8 2022 green energy higher gas prices are a result of the russian crisis and a function of the macro trend toward disinvestment from carbon based energy sources per cnbc investment in new wells has dropped 60 causing u s crude oil production to plummet by more than 3 million barrels per day or nearly 25 instead of investing in new wells and exploration oil companies are giving precious capital back to their shareholders and executives per accountable u s 12 oil and gas corporations buying back over 8 billion worth of stock by the end of the year with plans to buy even more in future quarters 16 oil and gas corporations raised their dividend at least once in 2021 11 oil and gas companies gave payouts to shareholders totaling north of 36 5 billion the same corporations paid their ceos massive salary and compensation packages most over 10 million and as high as 33 million for chevron ceo michael wirth at first blush many are angry at such profit motivated actions however put yourself in management s shoes energy companies and their customers are increasingly under heat to reduce their carbon footprint assuming the push toward green energy continues executives must carefully consider new long lived projects not only from an environmental perspective but from a profit perspective higher taxes on oil and oil exploration and increasing sources of green energy will potentially make future drilling less profitable unknowns such as these result in a lack of investment into the oil infrastructure to this end u s oil rig counts have woefully kept up with prices as they have in the past based on the current oil price we should see more than twice as many oil rigs in operation summary as if declining production and the russian invasion of ukraine weren t enough of a problem oil prices are also being boosted by rising demand as the global economy normalizes from the pandemic demand is steadily increasing higher gas prices are a tax on consumers and corporations they will slow economic growth and eventually reduce the oil demand it s too early to say if higher oil prices and other economic factors will ultimately cause a recession however economic activity is already weak this quarter the atlanta fed gdpnow model forecasts 0 0 gdp growth for the first quarter the effect of 4 or 5 gas has yet to factor into their forecast we will begin to get a better idea of how current gas prices impact consumption in mid april when the next round of economic data is released until then we can track consumer sentiment gauges to foreshadow what the spring months have in store

could gas prices affect the u s economy how the ukrainian invasion will impact local economies wilmington nc wway the stock market has waffled up and down in the wake of russia s invasion of ukraine but to get a better idea of how this conflict could affect us locally we ll need to take a closer look at fuel and oil the united states doesn t rely on ukraine of russia fuel as much as most of the european nations still financial experts like brendan viehman are keeping a close eye on sanctions especially fuel my big concern for the stock market was the energy sector viehman said russia produces most of europe s energy a large amount of it and we even get stuff from them before fuel sanctions the u s bought about 10 of russia oil energy products are one of russia s biggest exports they are accounted for 62 of its total exports last year the u s isn t one of russia s biggest buyers but sanctions and boycotts are driving up energy prices and cost at the pump gas prices have a real outsized impact on our brain because you see that price every single day said mike giordano with williams wealth management and so if we see the price going up you start seeing people not being sure about how much they should spend tightening the budget for many like sydney roberts who invests in stocks on the side it could potentially cause further inflation you drive around and you fill up your tank and it s shot up like 15 cents which is not nothing she said over the phone so i definitely feel that on my paycheck like of course it s going to ripple back and affect things like the economy but if oil prices continue to rise it won t just affect gas prices because lumber prices went up it was more expensive to build houses viehman explained and anything that involved lumber and wood was then being more expensive afterwards and it s the same sort of thing with the gas prices going up while our economic fallout won t be nearly as drastic as russia s it could affect travel and purchasing raising airline prices and the cost of manufacturing if oil prices continue staying high the manufacturing of goods cost more money and so people start saying you know what i m not going to buy as much as i thought i was going to buy because it s costing a lot more for each particular item and this is how you slow down the economy giordana said

the torrent of information is cacophonous as one dire prediction for the direction of the oil price after another rolls across the ticker nonetheless it behooves us to try and ferret out relevant details from this torrent of data as i applied myself to this task one thing in particular became blindly apparent to me the substance behind most of what i was hearing was pretty thin as in almost non existent thin we will avoid the political side of this debate and focus on the impact on our wallets and the ability to pull up to a gas pump and fill up our f 150s the last week and in the early part of this week one emerging aspect of the energy market struck me people were now talking about the increasing likelihood of banning russian imports to the u s and one of them was joe biden sanctions talk for oil began to ramp up in earnest and the talk had gone from no how no way to it just might happen on tuesday president biden acted to go it alone and block russian oil from coming to the u s europe where winter runs a bit longer simply can t follow suit and will continue to purchase russian oil and gas what is the impact of this decision on americans now at first glance this appears to be just a great idea that helps starve the russian war machine of capital we only import about 600k bopd from russia a relatively small amount that picking up about 50 rigs could replace so what s the problem it turns out we need russian oil or something like it and therein lies the rub we don t produce much of what we need in terms of blending stock heavy oil that is rbn energy blog now we are looking high and low for replacements in a lot of places with less than savory reputations and some under u s sanctions currently as i have explained in various places recently oil companies need blending stock to improve the api gravity of the throughput from their refineries as the btu analytics graph below shows the major fracking basins that produce most of the 9 mm bopd that we rely upon produce very little of this heavy oil that s just life btu analytics what this means though is that we have to replace like for like in terms of api gravity oil and once again therein lies the rub nations that the president is contacting to ease the strain on american motorists include venezuela saudi arabia and iran what is the likelihood of our friends in these far flung places coming to our rescue related opec discusses oil market with u s shale executives venezuela has been under the thumb of u s sanctions for several years now forcing the country to look for assistance from russia as this wsj article notes recently a delegation from the u s flew to caracas to discuss relaxing sanctions on that country so the u s could buy more oil this reuters article suggests that nicholas maduro the russian puppet dictator in caracas has learned the art of negotiation well from his patron vladimir putin over in moscow instead of a big nyet the two parties agreed to a basis for future negotiations venezuelan production most recently at around 800k bopd has been heading eastward to china in order to evade the sanctions orinoco grade crude is so thick and heavy that it needs a diluent to pump at ambient temps and our friends in tehran helped with that so some 2 mm barrels went to repay iran the thought that venezuela has meaningful excess production to send to the u s stretches reality just a hair saudi arabia and the u s are not on the best of terms these days in days of yore an exhortation by the u s president to pump more oil would have had considerable sway since we indelicately pinned the murder of khashoggi on the crown prince mohammed bin salmon has been cultivating other relationships specifically with russia as it happens including a military cooperation agreement with the additional de facto membership of russia in opec the notion that president biden was ever going to shake any extra oil loose in saudi arabia is chuckle worthy in fact the trip isn t going to happen at all i am hearing astoundingly according to an article in the wall street journal the saudis didn t take the call from the american president saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman and the u a e s sheikh mohammed bin zayed al nahyan both declined u s requests to speak to mr biden in recent weeks the officials said as saudi and emirati officials have become more vocal in recent weeks in their criticism of american policy in the gulf wsj i would be surprised if that s ever happened before that brings us to iran iran has also been under u s sanctions since time immemorial and basically does just fine it turns out another close friend of the u s has been helping them evade the full impact of our sanctions that would be china you can see from the graph below only about 1 5 mm bopd remains unsold thanks to mr xi trading economics advertisement as if iran and china s relationship wasn t much closer than we d like putin has been nosing his way into their sphere to expand his influence in the middle east it looks as though the only likely opportunity to put more oil on the market lies with the re entry of the u s into the iran nuclear accord it s anybody s guess if the leadership in that country will send it our way your takeaway for good or ill the president just eliminated about 3 of our oil supply that doesn t sound like much but remember how tight supplies are and as i have established oil quality matters the loss of these barrels is going to raise prices one thing the president didn t do is give any sign that he was going to pivot toward u s production that simply is politically unacceptable to his base which is about what he has left in terms of support it is also curious that he didn t mention our two closest trading partners canada and mexico with this address canada is supplying most of our imports now about 3 5 mm bopd and could certainly do more if biden hadn t canceled the keystone xl pipeline which would have been just about finished by now it would have certainly helped in this regard there are other ways to get more production from canada should the administration choose to seek assistance from that source new production from mexico might be problematic as they are focused on their own energy needs from declining fields but would have way more reason to help than either of the three countries he did mention curiosities on energy policy are a hallmark of the current administration it is difficult to say that one is more notable than another for now americans should resign themselves to paying more for energy and consider themselves lucky when they have it security of supply is no longer as certain as it once was just a short time ago by david messler for oilprice com more top reads from
