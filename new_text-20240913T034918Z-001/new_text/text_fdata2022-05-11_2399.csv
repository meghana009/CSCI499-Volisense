vol 46 no 18 friday may 6 2022 parents hunting for baby formula as shortage spans us print front page email this story you have entered an invalid email address to required from required message you have entered an invalid email address from email required message required washington ap parents across the u s are scrambling to find baby formula because supply disruptions and a massive safety recall have swept many leading brands off store shelves months of spot shortages at pharmacies and supermarkets have been exacerbated by the recall at abbott which was forced to shutter its largest u s formula manufacturing plant in february due to contamination concerns on monday white house press secretary jenn psaki said the food and drug administration was working around the clock to address any possible shortages and will try to expedite imports of foreign baby formula to increase supply for now pediatricians and health workers are urging parents who can t find formula to contact food banks or doctor s offices they warn against watering down formula to stretch supplies or using online diy recipes for babies who are not being breastfed this is the only thing they eat said dr steven abrams of the university of texas austin so it has to have all of their nutrition and furthermore it needs to be properly prepared so that it s safe for the smallest infants laura stewart a 52 year old mother of three who lives just north of springfield missouri has been struggling for several weeks to find formula for her 10 month old daughter riley riley normally gets a brand of abbott s similac designed for children with sensitive stomachs last month she instead used four different brands she spits up more she s just more cranky she is typically a very happy girl stewart said when she has the right formula she doesn t spit up she s perfectly fine a small can costs 17 to 18 and lasts three to five days stewart said like many americans stewart relies on wic a federal program similar to food stamps that serves mothers and children to afford formula for her daughter abbott s recall wiped out many wic covered brands though the program is now allowing substitutions trying to keep formula in stock retailers including cvs and walgreens have begun limiting purchases to three containers per customer nationwide about 40 of large retail stores are out of stock up from 31 in mid april according to datasembly a data analytics firm more than half of u s states are seeing out of stock rates between 40 and 50 according to the firm which collects data from 11 000 locations baby formula is particularly vulnerable to disruptions because just a handful of companies account for almost the entire u s supply industry executives say the constraints began last year as the covid 19 pandemic led to disruptions in ingredients labor and transportation supplies were further squeezed by parents stockpiling during lockdowns then in february abbott recalled several major brands and shut down its sturgis michigan factory when federal officials concluded four babies suffered bacterial infections after consuming formula from the facility two of the infants died when fda inspectors visited the plant in march they found lax safety protocols and traces of the bacteria on several surfaces none of the bacterial strains matched those collected from the infants however and the fda hasn t offered an explanation for how the contamination occurred for its part abbott says its formula is not likely the source of infection though the fda says its investigation continues the shortages are especially dangerous for infants who require specialty formulas due to food allergies digestive problems and other conditions unfortunately many of those very specialized formulas are only made in the united states at the factory that had the recall and that s caused a huge problem for a relatively small number of infants abrams said after hearing concerns from parents the fda said last month that abbott could begin releasing some specialty formulas not affected by the recalls on a case by case basis the company is providing them free of charge in coordination with physicians and hospitals food safety advocates say the fda made the right call in releasing the formula but that parents should talk to their pediatricians before using it there s still some risk from the formula because we know there are problems at the plant and fda hasn t identified a root cause said sarah sorscher of the center for science in the public interest but it s worth releasing because these infants might die without it it s unclear when the abbott plant might reopen an fda spokeswoman said the company is still working to rectify findings related to the processes procedures and conditions the agency also is working with other manufacturers to consider options for increasing production industry professionals say it will be hard to boost supply quickly because the fda requires extensive testing labeling and inspections it s a long and rigorous process to bring any new manufacturers into this country said ron belldegrun co founder of byheart a new york based formula maker

for a long time netflix insisted it would never interrupt its programming with commercials that was part of the service s appeal the movies were uncut and the tv shows came without breaks the better to binge things for hours upon hours but that was before netflix faced serious competition in the streaming video space mostly from services that do offer cheaper subscriptions for programming that is occasionally broken up by ads netflix also lost 200 000 subscribers in the first quarter of 2022 and it s said it expects to lose 2 million more this quarter which has sent their stock tumbling and so perhaps not surprisingly they are now looking to create a ad supported netflix tier and to do it quickly according to a netflix memo to employees reported by the new york times netflix plans to introduce its cheaper tier with commercial interruptions by the end of the year the move will presumably boost subscriptions and the ads will generate revenue as well netflix there was a period not that long ago when a netflix subscription was one of the best deals in entertainment for a couple bucks a month you got access to an enormous and varied library of movies and shows all available instantly but in the last few years netflix s library has shrunk and a lot of their more recent originals are just not on par with the content they lost plus their subscription prices have continued to rise their standard plan now costs a whopping 15 49 a month that s still cheaper than most cable packages but when you factor in how often you use the service and how many families feel the need to supplement it with other services like hulu or disney or hbo max you start to see why they might have lost a few subscribers recently a cheaper tier with some ads will likely attract some lapsed customers back and if you don t want the ads you can continue to pay more to watch without them but beware according to the times netflix is also planning to crack down on password sharing by the end of the year as well so if you re freeloading off your parents netflix account those days might be numbered netflix s most popular tv shows ever these are the most popular tv shows ever on netflix based on hours viewed in their first 28 days on streaming

zaporizhzhia ukraine ap russia pummeled the vital port of odesa ukrainian officials said tuesday in an apparent effort to disrupt supply lines and western weapons shipments as ukraine s foreign minister appeared to suggest the country could ex zaporizhzhia ukraine ap russia pummeled the vital port of odesa ukrainian officials said tuesday in an apparent effort to disrupt supply lines and western weapons shipments as ukraine s foreign minister appeared to suggest the country could expand its war aims with the war now in its 11th week and kyiv bogging down russian forces and even staging a counteroffensive foreign minister dmytro kuleba seemed to indicate that the country could go beyond merely pushing russia back to areas it or its allies held on the day of the feb 24 invasion the idea reflected ukraine s ability to stymie a larger better armed russian military which has surprised many who had anticipated a much quicker end to the conflict one of the most dramatic examples of ukraine s ability to prevent easy victories is in mariupol where ukrainian fighters remained holed up at a steel plant denying russia s full control of the city the regiment defending the plant said russian warplanes continued bombarding it striking 34 times in 24 hours in recent days the united nations and the red cross organized a rescue of what some officials said were the last civilians trapped at the plant but two officials said tuesday that about 100 were believed to still be in the complex s underground tunnels donetsk regional gov pavlo kyrylenko said those who remain are people that the russians have not selected for evacuation kyrylenko and petro andryushchenko an adviser to mariupol s mayor did not say how they knew civilians were still in the complex a warren of tunnels and bunkers spread over 11 square kilometers 4 square miles others said their statements were impossible to confirm fighters with the azov regiment released photos of their wounded comrades inside the plant including some with amputated limbs they said the wounded were living in unsanitary conditions with open wounds bandaged with non sterile remnants of bandages without the necessary medication and even food in its statement on telegram the regiment appealed to the u n and red cross to evacuate the wounded servicemen to ukrainian controlled territories the photos could not be independently verified in another example of the grisly toll of the war ukrainian officials said they found the bodies of 44 civilians in the rubble of a building destroyed weeks ago in the northeastern city of izyum new u n figures meanwhile said that 14 million ukrainians were forced from their homes by the end of april including more than 5 9 million who have left the country in washington a top u s intelligence official testified tuesday that eight to 10 russian generals have been killed in the war lt gen scott berrier who leads the defense intelligence agency told a senate committee that because russia lacks a noncommissioned officer corps its generals have to go into combat zones and end up in dangerous positions ukraine said tuesday that russian forces fired seven missiles at odesa a day earlier hitting a shopping center and a warehouse in the country s largest port one person was killed and five wounded the military said images showed a burning building and debris including a tennis shoe in a heap of destruction in the city on the black sea mayor gennady trukhanov later visited the warehouse and said it had nothing in common with military infrastructure or military objects ukraine alleged at least some of the munitions used dated to the soviet era making them unreliable in targeting ukrainian british and u s officials say russia is rapidly using up its stock of precision weapons raising the risk of more imprecise rockets being used as the conflict grinds on since president vladimir putin s forces failed to take kyiv early in the war his focus has shifted to the eastern industrial heartland of the donbas but one general has suggested moscow s aims also include cutting ukraine s maritime access to both the black and azov seas that would also give it a swath of territory linking russia to both the crimean peninsula which it seized in 2014 and transnistria a pro moscow region of moldova even if russia falls short of severing ukraine from the coast and it appears to lack the forces to do so the continuing missile strikes on odesa reflect the city s strategic importance the russian military has repeatedly targeted its airport and claimed it destroyed several batches of western weapons odesa is also a major gateway for grain shipments and its blockade by russia already threatens global food supplies beyond that the city is a cultural jewel dear to ukrainians and russians alike and targeting it carries symbolic significance russian forces have made slow advances in the donbas but there have been multiple setbacks military analysts suggest that hitting odesa might serve to stoke concern about southwestern ukraine thus forcing kyiv to put more forces there that would pull them away from the eastern front as ukraine s military stages counteroffensives near the northeastern city of kharkiv kharkiv and the surrounding area has been under sustained russian attack since the early in the war in recent weeks grisly pictures testified to the horrors of those battles with charred and mangled bodies strewn in one street russian aircraft twice launched unguided missiles tuesday at the sumy area northeast of kharkiv according to the ukrainian border guard service the region s governor said the missiles hit several residential buildings but no one was killed the chernihiv region along the ukrainian border with belarus was hit by mortars fired from russian territory there was no word on casualties but ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy said tuesday that the military was gradually pushing russian troops away from kharkiv the ukrainian military s general staff said its forces drove the russians out of four villages to the northeast of kharkiv as it tries to push them back toward the russian border kuleba the ukrainian foreign minister meanwhile appeared to voice increasing confidence and expanded goals amid russia s stalled offensive he told the financial times that ukraine initially believed victory would be the withdrawal of russian troops to positions they occupied before the feb 24 invasion now if we are strong enough on the military front and we win the battle for donbas which will be crucial for the following dynamics of the war of course the victory for us in this war will be the liberation of the rest of our territories the comments seemed to reflect political ambitions more than battlefield realities many analysts acknowledge that although russia isn t capable of making quick gains the ukrainian military isn t strong enough to drive the russians back zelenskyy used his nightly address to pay tribute to leonid kravchuk the first president of an independent ukraine who died tuesday at 88 zelenskyy said kravchuk showed courage and knew how to get the country to listen to him that was particularly important in crisis moments when the future of the whole country may depend on the courage of one man said zelenskyy whose own communication skills and decision to remain in kyiv when it came under russian attack have helped make him a strong wartime leader in the u s president joe biden signed a bipartisan measure monday to reboot the world war ii era lend lease

discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties actual results and the timing of events may differ significantly from those expressed or implied in such forward looking statements due to a number of factors including those included in the section of this report entitled item 1a risk factors the highlights listed below have had significant effects on many items within our condensed consolidated financial statements and affect the comparison of the current period s activity with those of prior periods target returns included in this report are presented gross and do not account for fees expenses and taxes which will reduce returns target returns are neither guarantees nor predictions or projections of future performance there can be no assurance that target returns will be achieved or that apollo will be successful in implementing the applicable strategy actual gross and net returns for funds managed by apollo and individual investors participating directly or indirectly in funds managed by apollo may vary significantly from the target returns set forth herein general our businesses founded in 1990 apollo is a high growth global alternative asset manager and a retirement services provider apollo conducts its business primarily in the united states through the following three reportable segments asset management retirement services and principal investing these business segments are differentiated based on the investment services they provide as well as varying investing strategies asset management our asset management segment focuses on three investing strategies yield hybrid and equity we have a flexible mandate in many of the funds we manage which enables our funds to invest opportunistically across a company s capital structure we raise invest and manage funds on behalf of some of the world s most prominent pension endowment and sovereign wealth funds as well as other institutional and individual investors as of march 31 2022 we had total aum of 512 8 billion our asset management segment had a team of 2 336 employees as of march 31 2022 with offices throughout the world this team possesses a broad range of transaction financial managerial and investment skills we operate our asset management business in a highly integrated manner which we believe distinguishes us from other alternative asset managers our investment teams frequently collaborate across disciplines and believe that this collaboration enables the funds we manage to more successfully invest across a company s capital structure our objective is to achieve superior long term risk adjusted returns for our clients the majority of the investment funds we manage are designed to invest capital over periods of seven or more years from inception thereby allowing us to seek to generate attractive long term returns throughout economic cycles we have a contrarian value oriented investment approach emphasizing downside protection and the preservation of capital we believe our contrarian investment approach is reflected in a number of ways including our willingness to pursue investments in industries that our competitors typically avoid the often complex structures employed in some of the investments of our funds our experience investing during periods of uncertainty or distress in the economy or financial markets and our willingness to undertake transactions that have substantial business regulatory or legal complexity we have applied this investment philosophy to identify what we believe are attractive investment opportunities deploy capital across the balance sheet of industry leading or franchise businesses and create value throughout economic cycles the yield hybrid and equity investing strategies of our asset management segment reflect the range of investment capabilities across our platform based on relative risk and return as an asset manager we earn fees for providing investment management services and expertise to our client base the amount of fees charged for managing these assets depends on the underlying investment strategy liquidity profile and ultimately our ability to generate returns for our clients we also earn transaction and advisory fees as part of our growing capital solutions business and as part of monitoring and deployment activity alongside our sizeable private equity franchise after expenses we call the resulting earnings stream fee related earnings or fre which represents the primary performance measure for the asset management segment 95 yield yield is our largest asset management strategy with 372 7 billion of aum as of march 31 2022 our yield strategy focuses on generating excess returns through high quality credit underwriting and origination beyond participation in the traditional issuance and secondary credit markets through our origination platforms and corporate solutions capabilities we seek to originate attractive and safe yielding assets for our investors within our yield strategy we target 4 to 10 returns for our clients since inception the total return yield fund has generated a 6 gross return on equity roe and 5 net roe annualized through march 31 2022 the investment portfolios of the yield oriented funds apollo manages include several asset classes as described below corporate fixed income 92 2 billion of

vehicles that are of indefinite duration and where there is generally no requirement to return capital to investors upon realization of investments or through redemptions as of march 31 2022 perpetual capital includes without limitation certain assets in our yield strategy including assets relating to publicly traded and non traded vehicles certain origination platform assets and assets managed for certain of our insurance clients perpetual capital assets may be withdrawn under certain circumstances retirement services our retirement services business is conducted by athene a leading financial services company that specializes in issuing reinsuring and acquiring retirement savings products designed for the increasing number of individuals and institutions seeking to fund retirement needs athene provides retail annuity retirement solutions to policyholders and reinsures fixed indexed annuities fia multi year guaranteed annuities myga traditional one year guarantee fixed deferred annuities immediate annuities and institutional products from reinsurance partners in addition athene offers institutional products including funding agreements and pension group annuities apollo s asset management business provides a full suite of 97 services for athene s investment portfolio including direct investment management asset allocation mergers and acquisition asset diligence and certain operational support services including investment compliance tax legal and risk management support as of march 31 2022 athene had 1 451 employees our retirement services business focuses on generating spread income by combining the two core competencies of 1 sourcing long term generally illiquid liabilities and 2 using the global scale and reach of our asset management business to actively source or originate assets with athene s preferred risk and return characteristics athene s investment philosophy is to invest a portion of its assets in securities that earn an incremental yield by taking measured liquidity risk and complexity risk and capitalizing on its long dated and persistent liability profile to prudently achieve higher net investment earned rates rather than assuming solely credit risk a cornerstone of athene s investment philosophy is that given the operating leverage inherent in its business modest investment outperformance can translate to outsized return performance because athene maintains discipline in underwriting attractively priced liabilities it has the ability to invest in a broad range of high quality assets to generate attractive earnings our asset management expertise supports the sourcing and underwriting of asset classes for athene s portfolio athene is invested in a diverse array of corporate bonds and more structured but highly rated asset classes athene establishes risk thresholds which in turn define risk tolerance across a wide range of factors including credit risk liquidity risk concentration risk and caps on specific asset classes in addition to other efforts we partially mitigate the risk of rising interest rates by strategically allocating a meaningful portion of athene s investment portfolio into floating rate securities athene also maintains holdings in less interest rate sensitive investments including collateralized loan obligations clo commercial mortgage loans residential mortgage loans non agency residential mortgage backed securities rmbs and various types of structured products consistent with its strategy of pursuing incremental yield by assuming liquidity risk and complexity risk rather than assuming solely credit risk rather than increase athene s allocation to higher risk securities to increase yield we pursue the direct origination of high quality predominantly senior secured assets which we believe possess greater alpha generating qualities than securities that would otherwise be readily available in public markets these direct origination strategies include investments sourced by 1 affiliated platforms that originate loans to third parties and in which athene gains exposure directly to the loan or indirectly through its ownership of the platform and 2 our extensive network of direct relationships with predominantly investment grade counterparties athene uses and may continue to use derivatives including swaps options futures and forward contracts and reinsurance contracts to hedge risks such as current or future changes in the fair value of its assets and liabilities current or future changes in cash flows changes in interest rates equity markets currency fluctuations and changes in longevity products athene principally offers two product lines annuities and funding agreements annuities athene s primary product line is annuities which include fixed indexed annuities registered index linked annuities fixed rate annuities payout annuities and group annuities fixed indexed annuities fias fias are the majority of athene s net reserve liabilities fias are a type of insurance contract in which the policyholder makes one or more premium deposits which earn interest on a tax deferred basis at a crediting rate based on a specified market index subject to a specified cap spread or participation rate fias allow policyholders the possibility of earning interest without significant risk to principal unless the contract is surrendered during a surrender charge period a market index tracks the performance of a specific group of stocks or other assets representing a particular segment of the market or in some cases an entire market athene generally buys options on the indices to which the fias are tied to hedge the associated market risk the cost of the option is priced into the overall economics of the product as an option budget athene generates income on fia products by earning an investment spread based on the difference between 1 income earned on the investments supporting the liabilities and 2 the cost of funds including fixed interest credited to customers option costs the cost of providing guarantees net of rider fees policy issuance and maintenance costs and commission costs 98 registered index linked annuities rila a rila is similar to an fia in offering the policyholder the opportunity for tax deferred growth based in part on the performance of a market index compared to an fia a rila has the potential for higher returns but also has the potential for risk of loss to principal and related earnings a rila provides the ability for the policyholder to participate in the positive performance of certain market indices during a term limited by a cap or adjusted for a participation rate negative performance of the market indices during a term can result in negative policyholder returns with downside protection typically provided in the form of either a buffer or a floor to limit the policyholder s exposure to market loss a buffer is protection from negative exposure up to a certain percentage typically 10 or 20 percent a floor is protection from negative exposure less than a stated percentage i e the policyholder risks exposure of loss up to the floor but is protected against any loss in excess of this amount fixed rate annuities fixed rate annuities include annual reset annuities and mygas unlike fias fixed rate annuities earn interest at a set rate or declared crediting rate rather than a rate that may vary based on an index fixed rate annual reset annuities have a crediting rate that is typically guaranteed for one year after such period athene has the ability to change the crediting rate at its discretion generally once annually to any rate at or above a guaranteed minimum rate mygas are similar to annual reset annuities except that the initial crediting rate is guaranteed for a specified number of years rather than just one year before it may be changed at athene s discretion after the initial crediting period mygas can generally be reset annually withdrawal options for deferred annuities after the first year following the issuance of a deferred annuity the policyholder is typically permitted to make withdrawals up to 5 or 10 depending on the contract of the prior year s value without a surrender charge or market value adjustment mva subject to certain limitations withdrawals in excess of the allowable amounts are assessed a surrender charge and mva if such withdrawals are made during the surrender charge period of the policy the surrender charge for most athene products at contract inception is generally between 7 and 15 of the contract value and decreases by approximately one percentage point per year during the surrender charge period which generally ranges from 3 to 20 years at maturity the policyholder may elect to receive proceeds in the form of a single payment or an annuity if the annuity option is selected the policyholder will receive a series of payments either over the policyholder s lifetime or over a fixed number of years depending upon the terms of the contract some contracts permit annuitization prior to maturity a fixed annuity policyholder may also elect to purchase an income rider income riders to fixed annuity products athene s income riders on its deferred annuities can be broadly categorized as either guaranteed or participating guaranteed income riders provide policyholders with a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit glwb which permits policyholders to elect to receive guaranteed payments for life from their contract without having to annuitize their policies participating income riders tend to have lower levels of guaranteed income than guaranteed income riders but provide policyholders the opportunity to receive greater levels of income if the policies indexed crediting strategies perform well as of march 31 2022 approximately 36 of athene s deferred annuity account value had rider benefits payout annuities payout annuities primarily consist of single premium immediate annuities spia supplemental contracts and structured settlements payout annuities provide a series of periodic payments for a fixed period of time or for the life of the policyholder based upon the policyholder s election at the time of issuance the amounts frequency and length of time of the payments are fixed at the outset of the annuity contract spias are often purchased by persons at or near retirement age who desire a steady stream of payments over a future period of years supplemental contracts are typically created upon the conversion of a death claim or the annuitization of a deferred annuity structured settlements generally relate to legal settlements group annuities group annuities issued in connection with pension group annuities transactions usually involve a single premium group annuity contract issued to discharge certain pension plan liabilities the group annuities that athene issues are non participating contracts the assets supporting the guaranteed benefits for each contract may be held in a separate account group annuity benefits may be purchased for current retired and or terminated employees and their beneficiaries covered under terminating or continuing pension plans both immediate and deferred annuity certificates may be issued pursuant to a single group annuity contract immediate annuity certificates cover those retirees and beneficiaries currently receiving payments whereas deferred annuity certificates cover those participants who have not yet begun receiving benefit payments immediate annuity certificates have no cash surrender rights whereas deferred annuity certificates may include an election to receive a lump sum payment exercisable by the participant upon either the participant achieving a specified age or the occurrence of a specified event such as termination of the participant s employment 99 athene earns income on group annuities based upon the spread between the return on the assets received in connection with the pension group annuity transaction and the cost of the pension obligations assumed group annuities expose athene to longevity risk which would be realized if plan participants live longer than assumed in underwriting the transaction resulting in aggregate payments that exceed athene s expectations funding agreements funding agreements are issued opportunistically to institutional investors at attractive risk adjusted funding costs funding agreements are negotiated privately between an investor and an insurance company they are designed to provide an agreement holder with a guaranteed return of principal and periodic interest payments while offering competitive yields and predictable returns the interest rate can be fixed or floating athene also includes repurchase agreements with a term that exceeds one year at the time of execution within the funding agreement product category distribution channels athene has developed four dedicated distribution channels to address the retirement services market retail flow reinsurance institutional and acquisitions and block reinsurance which support opportunistic origination across differing market environments additionally athene believes these distribution channels enable it to achieve stable asset growth while maintaining attractive returns retail athene has built a scalable platform that allows it to originate and rapidly grow its business in deferred annuity products athene has developed a suite of retirement savings products distributed through its network of approximately 53 independent marketing organizations imos approximately 68 000 independent agents in all 50 states and a growing network of 18 banks and 119 regional broker dealers athene is focused in every aspect of its retail channel on providing high quality products and service to its policyholders and maintaining appropriate financial protection over the life of their policies flow reinsurance flow reinsurance provides another opportunistic channel for athene to source liabilities with attractive cost of funds and offer insurance companies the opportunity to improve their product offerings and enhance their financial results as in the retail channel athene does not pursue flow volume growth at the expense of profitability and therefore tends to respond rapidly to adjust pricing for changes in asset yields reinsurance is an arrangement under which an insurance company the reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurance company the ceding company or cedant for all or a portion of certain insurance risks underwritten by the ceding company reinsurance is designed to 1 reduce the net amount at risk on individual risks thereby enabling the ceding company to increase the volume of business it can underwrite as well as increase the maximum risk it can underwrite on a single risk 2 stabilize operating results by reducing volatility in the ceding company s loss experience 3 assist the ceding company in meeting applicable regulatory requirements and 4 enhance the ceding company s financial strength and surplus position within its flow reinsurance channel athene generally conducts third party flow reinsurance transactions through its subsidiary athene life re ltd alre as a fixed annuity reinsurer alre partners with insurance companies to develop solutions to their capital requirements enhance their presence in the retirement market and improve their financial results the specific liabilities that alre targets to reinsure include fias mygas traditional one year guarantee fixed deferred annuities immediate annuities and institutional products for various transaction related reasons from time to time athene s us insurance subsidiaries will reinsure business from third party ceding companies in these instances the respective us insurance subsidiary will generally retrocede a portion of the reinsured business to athene annuity re ltd or alre institutional the institutional channel includes pension group annuity transactions and funding agreements pension group annuity transactions athene partners with institutions seeking to transfer and thereby reduce their obligation to pay future pension benefits to retirees and deferred participants through pension group annuities athene works with 100 advisors brokers and consultants to source pension group annuity transactions and design solutions that meet the needs of prospective pension group annuity counterparties funding agreements athene participates in a funding agreement backed notes fabn program through which it may issue funding agreements to a special purpose trust that issues marketable medium term notes the notes are underwritten and marketed by major investment banks broker dealer operations and are sold to institutional investors the proceeds of the issuance of notes are used by the trust to purchase one or more funding agreements from athene subsidiaries with matching interest and maturity payment terms athene has established a funding agreement backed repurchase program in which a special purpose unaffiliated entity may enter into a repurchase agreement with a bank and the proceeds of the repurchase transactions are used by the special purpose entity to purchase secured funding agreements from athene subsidiaries athene is also a member of the fhlb and athene has issued funding agreements to the fhlb in exchange for cash advances finally repurchase agreements with an original maturity exceeding one year are also included within the funding agreement channel acquisitions and block reinsurance acquisitions acquisitions are an important source of growth in our retirement services business athene has a proven ability to acquire businesses in complex transactions at favorable terms manage the liabilities acquired and reinvest the associated assets athene plans to continue leveraging this expertise in sourcing and evaluating transactions to profitably grow its business athene believes its demonstrated ability to source transactions consummate complex transactions and reinvest assets into higher yielding investments as well as its access to capital provide it with distinct advantages relative to other acquisition candidates block reinsurance through block reinsurance transactions athene partners with life and annuity companies to decrease their exposure to one or more products or to divest of lower margin or non core segments of their businesses unlike acquisitions in which athene must acquire the assets or stock of a target company block reinsurance allows the retirement services segment to contractually assume assets and liabilities associated with a certain book of business in doing so athene contractually assumes responsibility for only that portion of the business that it deems desirable without assuming additional liabilities capital we believe that athene has a strong capital position and that it is well positioned to meet policyholder and other obligations athene measures capital sufficiency using an internal capital model which reflects management s view on the various risks inherent to its business the amount of capital required to support its core operating strategies and the amount of capital necessary to maintain its current ratings in a recessionary environment the amount of capital required to support athene s core operating strategies is determined based upon internal modeling and analysis of economic risk as well as inputs from rating agency capital models and consideration of both naic risk based capital rbc and bermuda capital requirements capital in excess of this required amount is considered excess equity capital which is available to deploy deployable capital athene s deployable capital is comprised of capital from three sources excess equity capital untapped debt capacity and available undrawn capital commitments from athene co invest reinsurance affiliate holding ltd acra as of march 31 2022 we believe that athene had approximately 7 3 billion in total excess equity capital untapped debt capacity and available undrawn acra commitments available to be deployed subject in the case of debt capacity to favorable market conditions and general availability acra in order to support growth strategies and capital deployment opportunities athene established acra as a long duration on demand capital vehicle athene owns 36 55 of acra s economic interests and 100 of acra s voting interests with the remaining 63 45 of the economic interests being owned by adip a series of funds managed by apollo acra participates in certain transactions by drawing a portion of the required capital for such transactions from third party investors equal to adip s proportionate economic interest in acra this strategic capital solution allows us the flexibility to simultaneously deploy capital across multiple accretive avenues while maintaining a strong financial position for athene and its subsidiaries 101 uses of capital capital deployment includes both the payment for a business opportunity such as the payment of a ceding commission to enter into a block reinsurance transaction or the payment of cash to acquire our shares on the open market and the retention of capital based on our internal capital model currently we deploy capital from our retirement services business in four primary ways 1 supporting organic growth 2 supporting inorganic growth 3 making dividend payments to agm from time to time and 4 retaining capital to support financial strength ratings upgrades athene generally seek returns on its capital deployment of mid teens or higher internal reinsurance subject to quota shares generally ranging from 80 to 100 substantially all of the existing deposits held and new deposits generated by athene s us insurance subsidiaries are reinsured to its bermuda reinsurance subsidiaries athene maintains the same reserving standards for its bermuda reinsurance subsidiaries as it does for its us insurance subsidiaries athene also retrocedes certain inorganic transactions pension group annuity transactions and certain flow reinsurance transactions to acra and effective january 1 2022 it began to retrocede a quota share of its retail business to a subsidiary of acra athene s internal reinsurance structure provides it with several strategic and operational advantages including the aggregation of regulatory capital which makes the aggregate capital of its bermuda reinsurance subsidiaries available to support the risks assumed by each entity and enhanced operating efficiencies as a result of its internal reinsurance structure and third party direct to bermuda business the significant majority of athene s aggregate capital is held by its bermuda reinsurance subsidiaries ratings as of march 31 2022 each of athene s significant insurance subsidiaries is rated a or a by the three rating agencies that evaluate the financial strength of such subsidiaries to achieve financial strength ratings aspirations in the retirement services segment athene may choose to retain additional capital above the level required by the rating agencies to support operating needs athene believes there are numerous benefits to achieving stronger ratings over time including increased recognition of and confidence in the financial strength by prospective business partners particularly within product distribution as well as potential profitability improvements in certain organic channels though lower funding costs principal investing our principal investing segment is comprised of our realized performance fee income realized investment income from our balance sheet investments and certain allocable expenses related to corporate functions supporting the entire company the principal investing segment also includes our growth capital and liquidity resources at agm we expect to deploy capital into strategic investments over time that will help accelerate the growth of our asset management segment by broadening our investment management and or product distribution capabilities or increasing the efficiency of our operations we believe these investments will translate into greater compounded annual growth of fee related earnings given the cyclical nature of performance fees earnings from our principal investing segment or principal investing income pii is inherently more volatile in nature than earnings from the asset management and retirement services segments we earn fees based on the investment performance of the funds we manage and compensate our employees primarily investment professionals with a meaningful portion of these proceeds to align our team with the investors in the funds we manage and incentivize them to deliver strong investment performance over time we expect to increase the proportion of performance fee income we pay to our employees over time and as such proportion increases we expect pii to represent a relatively smaller portion of our total company earnings 102 the diagram below depicts our current organizational structure following the mergers note the organizational structure chart above depicts a simplified version of the apollo structure it does not include all legal entities in the structure 1 includes direct and indirect ownership by agm business environment economic and market conditions our asset management and retirement services businesses are affected by the condition of global financial markets and the economy price fluctuations within equity credit commodity foreign exchange markets as well as interest rates which may be volatile and mixed across geographies can significantly impact the performance of our business including but not limited to the valuation of investments including those of the funds we manage and related income we may recognize we carefully monitor economic and market conditions that could potentially give rise to global market volatility and affect our business operations investment portfolios and derivatives which includes global inflation we have seen u s inflation continue to rise during 2022 which has been driven by various factors including supply chain disruptions consumer demand employment levels low mortgage interest rates and a severely distorted supply demand housing imbalance and residential vacancy rates during the first quarter of 2022 the u s federal reserve indicated its plan to be more aggressive at the beginning of the tightening cycle to lessen inflation transpiring widely through the u s economy resulting in considerable market volatility as a result the federal reserve voted to increase the federal funds rate during the first quarter of 2022 the u s bureau of labor statistics reported that the annual u s inflation rate increased to 8 5 as of march 31 2022 compared to 7 0 as of december 31 2021 and continues to be the highest rate since the 1980s adverse economic conditions may result from domestic and global economic and political developments including plateauing or decreasing economic growth and business activity civil unrest geopolitical tensions or military action such as the armed conflict between ukraine and russia and corresponding sanctions imposed by the united states and other countries and new or evolving legal and regulatory requirements on business investment hiring migration labor supply and global supply chains in the u s the s p 500 index decreased by 4 9 during the first quarter of 2022 following an increase of 10 6 during the fourth quarter

appreciated by 33 3 during the quarter after appreciating by 0 2 the fourth quarter of 2021 although some pressure on oil prices eased in late 2021 oil price per barrel rose during the first quarter and is expected to continue to rise throughout 2022 institutional investors continue to allocate capital towards alternative investment managers for more attractive risk adjusted returns in a low interest rate environment and we believe the business environment remains generally accommodative to raise larger successor funds launch new products and pursue attractive strategic growth opportunities interest rate environment interest rates are expected to rise in 2022 a period of sharply rising interest rates could increase the cost of debt financing for the company the funds we manage as well as their portfolio companies which can lead to reduced investment returns and missed investment opportunities rising interest rates may also contribute to a sustained period of decline in the equity markets and make it more difficult to realize value from investments including portfolio investments of the funds we manage with respect to retirement services athene s investment portfolio consists predominantly of fixed maturity investments if prevailing interest rates were to rise we believe the yield on athene s new investment purchases may also rise and athene s investment income from floating rate investments would increase while the value of athene s existing investments may decline if prevailing interest rates were to decline it is likely that the yield on athene s new investment purchases may decline and athene s investment income from floating rate investments would decrease while the value of athene s existing investments may increase athene addresses interest rate risk through managing the duration of the liabilities it sources with assets it acquires through asset liability management alm modeling as part of its investment strategy athene purchases floating rate investments which we expect would perform well in a rising interest rate environment and which we expect would underperform in a declining rate environment which was experienced in the prior year if prevailing interest rates were to rise we believe athene s products would be more attractive to consumers and its sales would likely increase if prevailing interest rates were to decline it is likely that athene s products would be less attractive to consumers and athene s sales would likely decrease in periods of prolonged low interest rates the net investment spread may be negatively impacted by reduced investment income to the extent that athene is unable to adequately reduce policyholder crediting rates due to policyholder guarantees in the form of minimum crediting rates or otherwise due to market conditions a significant majority of athene s deferred annuity products have crediting rates that it may reset annually upon renewal following the expiration of the current guaranteed period while athene has the contractual ability to lower these crediting rates to the guaranteed minimum levels its willingness to do so may be limited by competitive pressures see item 3 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk which includes a discussion regarding interest rate and other significant risks and our strategies for managing these risks overview of results of operations key financials measures under u s gaap asset management the following discussion of key financial measures under u s gaap is based on apollo s

contributions or stockholders equity each as defined in the applicable limited partnership agreement and or management agreement of the unconsolidated funds or accounts advisory and transaction fees net as a result of providing advisory services with respect to actual and potential investments we are entitled to receive fees for transactions related to the acquisition and in certain instances disposition and financing of companies some of which are portfolio companies of the funds we manage as well as fees for ongoing monitoring of portfolio company operations and directors fees we also receive advisory fees for advisory services provided to certain funds in addition monitoring fees are generated on certain structured portfolio company investments under the terms of the limited partnership agreements for certain funds the management fee payable by the funds may be subject to a reduction based on a certain percentage up to 100 of such advisory and transaction fees net of applicable broken deal costs management fee offset such amounts are presented as a reduction to advisory and transaction fees net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations see note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more detail on advisory and transaction fees net performance fees the general partners of the funds we manage are entitled to an incentive return of normally up to 20 of the total returns of a fund s capital depending upon performance of the underlying funds and subject to preferred returns and high water marks as applicable performance fees categorized as performance allocations are accounted for as an equity method investment and effectively the performance fees for any period are based upon an assumed liquidation of the funds assets at the reporting date and distribution of the net proceeds in accordance with the funds allocation provisions performance fees categorized as incentive fees which are not accounted as an equity method investment are deferred until fees are probable to not be significantly reversed the majority of performance fees are comprised of performance allocations as of march 31 2022 approximately 52 of the value of our funds investments on a gross basis was determined using market based valuation methods i e reliance on broker or listed exchange quotes and the remaining 48 was determined primarily by comparable company and industry multiples or discounted cash flow models see item 1a risk factors risks relating to our asset management business the performance of the funds we manage and our performance may be adversely affected by the financial performance of portfolio companies of the funds we manage and industries in which the funds we manage invest in this report for discussion regarding certain industry specific risks that could affect the fair value of our private equity funds portfolio company investments in our equity strategy funds the company does not earn performance fees until the investors in the fund have achieved cumulative investment returns on invested capital including management fees and expenses in excess of an 8 hurdle rate additionally certain of our yield and hybrid strategy funds have various performance fee rates and hurdle rates certain of our yield and hybrid strategy funds allocate performance fees to the general partner in a similar manner as the equity funds in our equity certain yield and hybrid funds so long as the investors achieve their priority returns there is a catch up formula whereby the company earns a priority return for a portion of the return until the company s performance fees equate to its incentive fee rate for that fund thereafter the company participates in returns from the fund at the performance fee rate performance fees categorized as performance allocations are subject to reversal to the extent that the performance fees distributed exceed the amount due to the general partner based on a fund s cumulative investment returns the company recognizes potential repayment of previously received performance fees as a general partner obligation representing all amounts previously distributed to the general partner that would need to be repaid to the apollo funds if these funds were to be liquidated based on the current fair value of the underlying funds investments as of the reporting date the actual general partner obligation however would not become payable or realized until the end of a fund s life or as otherwise set forth in the respective limited partnership agreement of the fund 105

except for those funds that are gross of taxes as defined in the respective funds governing documents 5 other includes certain sias expenses compensation and benefits the most significant expense in our asset management business is compensation and benefits expense this consists of fixed salary discretionary and non discretionary bonuses profit sharing expense associated with the performance fees earned and compensation expense associated with the vesting of non cash equity based awards our compensation arrangements with certain employees contain a significant performance based incentive component therefore as our net revenues increase our compensation costs rise our compensation costs also reflect the increased investment in people as we expand geographically and create new funds in addition certain professionals and selected other individuals have a profit sharing interest in the performance fees earned in order to better align their interests with our own and with those of the investors in funds we manage profit sharing expense is part of our compensation and benefits expense and is generally based upon a fixed percentage of performance fees profit sharing expense can reverse during periods when there is a decline in performance fees that were previously recognized profit 107 sharing amounts are normally distributed to employees after the corresponding investment gains have been realized and generally before preferred returns are achieved for the investors therefore changes in our unrealized performance fees have the same effect on our profit sharing expense profit sharing expense increases when unrealized performance fees increase realizations only impact profit sharing expense to the extent that the effects on investments have not been recognized previously if losses on other investments within a fund are subsequently realized the profit sharing amounts previously distributed are normally subject to a general partner obligation to return performance fees previously distributed back to the funds this general partner obligation due to the funds would be realized only when the fund is liquidated which generally occurs at the end of the fund s term however indemnification obligations also exist for realized gains with respect to fund iv fund v and fund vi which although our former managing partners and contributing partners would remain personally liable may indemnify our former managing partners and contributing partners for 17 5 to 100 of the previously distributed profits regardless of the fund s future performance see note 16 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s indemnification liability the company grants equity awards to certain employees including rsus restricted shares of common stock and options that generally vest and become exercisable in quarterly installments or annual installments depending on the award terms in some instances vesting of an rsu is also subject to the company s receipt of performance fees within prescribed periods sufficient to cover the associated equity based compensation expense see note 13 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of equity based compensation other expenses the balance of our other expenses includes interest placement fees and general administrative and other operating expenses interest expense consists primarily of interest related to the 2024 senior notes the 2026 senior notes the 2029 senior notes the 2030 senior notes the 2048 senior notes and

under u s gaap income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and in evaluating income tax positions including evaluating uncertainties we recognize the income tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only where the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on the technical merits of the positions the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement if a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained then no benefits of the position are recognized the company s income tax positions are reviewed and evaluated quarterly to determine whether or not we have uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition or de recognition deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences using currently enacted tax rates of differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized non controlling interests for entities that are consolidated but not 100 owned a portion of the income or loss and corresponding equity is allocated to owners other than

revenues revenues were 1 1 billion in 2022 a decrease of 1 2 billion from 2 3 billion in 2021 due to lower investment income and management fees the decrease in investment income was due to a decrease in performance allocations as a result of equity market volatility in 2022 performance allocations were higher in 2021 due to fund appreciation leading to higher unrealized performance allocation gains management fees in both 2022 and 2021 were primarily driven by the yield funds due to fee generating aum inflows from our perpetual capital vehicles the decrease in management fees in 2022 is due to the elimination of management fees in consolidation between apollo and athene as a result of the mergers expenses expenses were 0 9 billion in 2022 a decrease of 108 million from 1 0 billion in 2021 due to a decrease in profit sharing expense of 295 million resulting from lower performance allocations during 2022 in any period the blended profit sharing percentage is impacted by the respective profit sharing ratios of the funds generating performance allocations in the period this decrease was partially offset by increases in equity based compensation of 100 million and an increase in salary bonus and benefits of 42 million due to accelerated headcount growth in 2021 including for certain senior level roles as the company strategically invests in talent that will seek to capture its next leg of growth in addition equity based compensation increased as a result of i performance grants which are tied to the company s receipt of performance fees within prescribed periods and are typically recognized on an accelerated recognition method over the requisite service period to the extent the performance revenue metrics are met or deemed probable and ii the impact of one time grants awarded to the co presidents which vest on a cliff basis subject to continued employment over five years and the company s achievement of fre and sre per share general administrative and other expenses were 148 million in 2022 an increase of 48 million from 100 million in 2021 the increase in 2022 is driven by increases in professional fees travel and entertainment expenses and absorption of occupancy and technology expenses to support the company s increased headcount other income loss other income loss was 378 million in 2022 a decrease of 71 million from 449 million in 2021 this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in net gains from investment activities largely offset by an increase in net gains earned from investment activities of consolidated vies net gains from investment activities in 2021 were primarily attributable to a gain from apollo s investment in athene during 2021 retirement services revenues retirement services revenues were 234 million in 2022 revenues were adversely impacted by investment related gains and losses partially offset by pension group annuity premiums and net investment income investment related losses of 4 2 billion were primarily driven by unfavorable changes in the fair value of reinsurance assets mortgage loans trading securities fia hedging derivatives and provision for credit losses as well as realized losses on afs securities these were mainly driven by the increase in u s treasury rates and credit spread widening as well as the unfavorable equity market impact decreasing the fia hedging derivatives expenses retirement services expenses were 2 5 billion in 2022 expenses were primarily driven by pension group annuity obligations interest credited to policyholders and policy and other operating expenses partially offset by the favorable change in fia embedded derivatives 112 income tax provision the income tax benefit provision totaled 608 million and 203 million in 2022 and 2021 respectively the change was primarily related to the decrease in pre tax income and a tax benefit from the derecognition of a deferred tax liability related to the mergers the provision for income taxes includes federal state local and foreign income taxes resulting in an effective income tax rate of 28 4 and 11 8 for 2022 and 2021 respectively the most significant reconciling items between the u s federal statutory income tax rate and the effective income tax rate were due to the following i a benefit realized from the derecognition of a deferred tax liability related to the company s historical holdings in athene ii foreign state and local income taxes including nyc ubt iii income passed through to non controlling interests and iv equity based compensation net of the limiting provisions for executive compensation under internal revenue code section 162 m see note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the company s income tax provision managing business performance key segment and non u s gaap performance measures we believe that the presentation of adjusted segment income supplements a reader s understanding of the economic operating performance of each of our segments adjusted segment income and adjusted net income adjusted segment income or asi is the key performance measure used by management in evaluating the performance of the asset management retirement services and principal investing segments adjusted net income ani represents adjusted segment income less holdco interest and other financing costs and estimated income taxes for purposes of calculating the adjusted net income tax rate adjusted segment income is reduced by holdco interest and financing costs income taxes on fre and pii represents the total current corporate local and non u s taxes as well as the current payable under apollo s tax receivable agreement income taxes on fre and pii excludes the impacts of deferred taxes and the remeasurement of the tax receivable agreement which arise from changes in estimated future tax rates certain assumptions and methodologies that impact the implied fre and pii income tax provision are similar to those used under u s gaap specifically certain deductions considered in the income tax provision under u s gaap relating to transaction related charges equity based compensation and tax deductible interest expense are taken into account for the implied tax provision income taxes on sre represent the total current and deferred tax expense or benefit on income before taxes adjusted to eliminate the impact of the tax expense or benefit associated with the non operating adjustments management believes the methodologies used to compute income taxes on fre sre and pii are meaningful to each segment and increases comparability of income taxes between periods we believe that asi is helpful for an understanding of our business and that investors should review the same supplemental financial measure that management uses to analyze our segment performance this measure supplements and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations discussed below in overview of results of operations that have been prepared in accordance with u s gaap see note 18 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more details

condensed consolidated financial statements for more details regarding the components of fre sre and pii we use asi ani fre sre and pii as measures of operating performance not as measures of liquidity these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other income data prepared in accordance with u s gaap the use of these measures without

share of investments associated with the non controlling interest net invested assets are averaged over the number of quarters in the relevant period to compute a net investment earned rate for such period while athene believes net invested assets is a meaningful financial metric and enhances the understanding of the underlying drivers of its investment portfolio it should not be used as a

congress is poised to approve nearly 40 billion in additional military and humanitarian aid for ukraine outstripping president biden s 33 billion request and extending a fresh lifeline to kyiv as moscow plows ahead with plans to annex vast swaths of the country s south and east the house approved the proposal late tuesday on a 368 to 57 vote with the senate likely to follow suit as early as this week passage of the measure would bring the total amount of ukrainian aid provided by congress since the feb 24 invasion to more than 53 billion the bill includes almost 15 billion earmarked for military equipment training intelligence support and ukrainian defense force salaries a further 14 billion would be allocated for nonmilitary support including humanitarian aid and another 5 billion would address global food security issues the house on may 10 approved a 39 8 billion military and humanitarian aid for ukraine in a bipartisan vote of 368 to 57 video the washington post in remarks on the house floor tuesday night house speaker nancy pelosi d calif repeatedly denounced russian president vladimir putin as a coward described the aid package as an act of mercy and cast the war in ukraine as one on which the future of global democracy hinges advertisement we should all be very proud that we had the opportunity when putin decided whatever it is he decided to be brutal and cruel and a coward that we were there to help pelosi said it s about democracy versus a dictatorship democracy must prevail the ukrainian people are fighting the fight for their democracy and in doing so for ours as well secretary of state antony blinken and defense secretary lloyd austin urged lawmakers to pass the measure in an open letter ahead of the debate the ability to draw upon existing stocks has been a critical tool in our efforts to support the ukrainians in their fight against russian aggression the letter reads in short we need your help aid for ukraine has so far drawn bipartisan support including a house vote of 417 to 10 to pass a lend lease bill expediting weapons shipments to ukraine a measure that biden signed into law on monday it comes as the united states joined the european union and britain in blaming russia for a brazen cyberattack in late february that crippled the u s based satellite internet company viasat disrupting service for tens of thousands of satellite modems in ukraine and other european countries at the outset of the war the united states did not initially assign blame for the attack which shuttered communications across ukraine just an hour before the invasion began ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kuleba said on tuesday that the country s aims were evolving as the war dragged on and indicated that outside support could help the country not only repel the invasion but also reclaim territories such as crimea that have been controlled by russian forces since long before the war advertisement in the first months of the war the victory for us looked like withdrawal of russian forces to the positions they occupied before feb 24 kuleba said now if we are strong enough on the military front and we win the battle for donbas which will be crucial for the following dynamics of the war of course the victory for us in this war will be the liberation of the rest of our territories a top u s intelligence official said that between eight and 10 russian generals have been killed while fighting in ukraine an unusually high number for a conflict that is still less than three months old the toll is due in part to the unusual role russian military leaders are playing on the battlefield lt gen scott d berrier director the defense intelligence agency told the senate armed services committee instead of commanding forces from afar berrier said moscow s generals have had to travel to the front to ensure their orders are carried out advertisement but ukraine faces a daunting uphill battle over cities that have been shattered and are still being pummeled by russia s offensive share this article share russia began a fresh assault on cities in ukraine s south and east this week including fatal attacks on the key southern port city of odessa using hypersonic missiles fired from crimea according to ukrainian officials images showed firefighters scouring rubble for survivors on tuesday in the wake of the attacks which struck a warehouse shopping mall and tourism infrastructure according to the ukrainian regional military administration capturing odessa a port city on the black sea would be a big strategic win for moscow though the pentagon has assessed that russian forces don t currently have the ability to launch ground or maritime offensives in the region advertisement around 300 miles east of odessa more than 100 civilians and 1 000 fighters are still holed up in mariupol s besieged azovstal steel plant which is being bombarded by constant russian shelling according to a local official heavy artillery and aircraft continued to strike the plant all day attempts to storm the ground continue to fail petro andryushchenko an aide to the mariupol mayor wrote tuesday on telegram ukrainian officials said on saturday that a u n backed evacuation effort had shepherded more than 300 women children and elderly people from the plant but fighters say civilians could still be hiding in the complex s vast underground labyrinth a senior u s defense official said on tuesday that the equivalent might of two russian battalion tactical groups remains in the ravaged port city but that most forces have been redeployed elsewhere north of mariupol in izyum ukrainian officials said that 44 bodies have been pulled from the rubble of a five story building that was destroyed in a russian shelling attack in the first week of march oleh synyehubov governor of the kharkiv region where izyum is located said efforts to search other buildings leveled by the attack have been hindered by constant shelling advertisement the head of the u n human rights monitoring mission in ukraine matilda bogner said on tuesday that the true number of civilians slain in the conflict is likely thousands higher than the currently confirmed toll of 3 381 fighting in the country s large southern urban centers has obscured investigations into the true toll of the war the big black hole is really mariupol where it has been difficult for us to fully access and to get fully corroborated information bogner said ukrainian officials from mariupol have estimated that as many as 20 000 civilians have died in russia s bombardment of the city bogner also said the u n mission has received credible information of torture ill treatment and incommunicado detention of russian prisoners of war by ukrainian forces the information includes videos online that appear to show inhumane treatment and humiliation including coerced statements and apologies while the scale is significantly higher on the side of allegations against russian forces we are also documenting violations by ukrainian forces she said a separate report by the u n international organization for migration on monday said that more than 8 million ukrainians have been internally displaced by the fighting a 24 percent increase since mid march the report said there is an overwhelming need for financial help and shelter for those fleeing their homes to other parts of ukraine and that the hostilities had cut off access to some of those in dire need advertisement millions of other ukrainians have fled the country in what s become the largest migration of humans in europe since world war ii the vast majority of them women and children anti trafficking organizations say their risk of falling prey to human traffickers will increase as the war drags on those who have fled alone with no relatives or contacts in neighboring countries face a significantly increased risk as they need to rely on people they do not know said suzanne hoff coordinator at la strada international an amsterdam based consortium of anti trafficking organizations that released a report on tuesday about the dangers refugees face from trafficking groups including labor and sexual abuse

steven abrams of the university of texas austin so it has to have all of their nutrition and furthermore it needs to be properly prepared so that it s safe for the smallest infants laura stewart a 52 year old mother of three who lives just north of springfield missouri has been struggling for several weeks to find formula for her 10 month old daughter riley riley normally gets a brand of abbott s similac designed for children with sensitive stomachs last month she instead used four different brands she spits up more she s just more cranky she is typically a very happy girl stewart said when she has the right formula she doesn t spit up she s perfectly fine a small can costs 17 to 18 and lasts three to five days stewart said like many americans stewart relies on wic a federal program similar to food stamps that serves mothers and children to afford formula for her daughter abbott s recall wiped out many wic covered brands though the program is now allowing substitutions how widespread is the shortage trying to keep formula in stock retailers including cvs and walgreens have begun limiting purchases to three containers per customer nationwide about 40 of large retail stores are out of stock up from 31 in mid april according to datasembly a data analytics firm more than half of u s states are seeing out of stock rates between 40 and 50 according to the firm which collects data from 11 000 locations what caused the shortage baby formula is particularly vulnerable to disruptions because just a handful of companies account for almost the entire u s supply industry executives say the constraints began last year as the covid 19 pandemic led to disruptions in ingredients labor and transportation supplies were further squeezed by parents stockpiling during lockdowns then in february abbott recalled several major brands and shut down its sturgis michigan factory when federal officials concluded four babies suffered bacterial infections after consuming formula from the facility two of the infants died when fda inspectors visited the plant in march they found lax safety protocols and traces of the bacteria on several surfaces none of the bacterial strains matched those collected from the infants however and the fda hasn t offered an explanation for how the contamination occurred for its part abbott says its formula is not likely the source of infection though the fda says its investigation continues chicago based abbott said it is increasing production at its other facilities to fill the gap including air shipping formula from a plant in ireland what about specialty formulas the shortages are especially dangerous for infants who require specialty formulas due to food allergies digestive problems and other conditions unfortunately many of those very specialized formulas are only made in the united states at the factory that had the recall and that s caused a huge problem for a relatively small number of infants abrams said after hearing concerns from parents the fda said last month that abbott could begin releasing some specialty formulas not affected by the recalls on a case by case basis the company is providing them free of charge in coordination with physicians and hospitals food safety advocates say the fda made the right call in releasing the formula but that parents should talk to their pediatricians before using it there s still some risk from the formula because we know there are problems at the plant and fda hasn t identified a root cause said sarah sorscher of the center for science in the public interest but it s worth releasing because these infants might die without it what s next it s unclear when the abbott plant might reopen the fda said the company is still working to rectify findings related to the processes procedures and conditions other infant formula makers are meeting or exceeding capacity levels to meet current demand the agency said among other steps the fda said it was waiving enforcement of minor product labeling issues to increase availability of both u s and imported products ___

capitation revenue is paid monthly based on the number of enrollees by the contracted managed care organization per member per month or pmpm capitation contracts generally have a legal term of one year or longer payments in capitation contracts are variable since they primarily include pmpm fees associated with unspecified membership that fluctuates throughout the term of the contract however based on our 36 table of contents experience our total underlying membership generally increases over time as penetration of ma products grows certain contracts include terms for a capitation deduction where the cost of out of network referrals of members are deducted from the future payment revenue is recognized in the month services are rendered on the basis of the transaction price established at that time fee for service revenue ffs revenue represents revenue earned under contracts in which we bill and collect for medical services rendered by the toi pcs employed physicians the

various payors as of march 31 2022 the company had 95 534 of cash including 875 of restricted cash the company may incur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future due to the investments management intends to continue to make in expanding operations and sales and marketing and due to additional general and administrative expenses management expects to incur in connection with operating as a public company as a result the company may require additional capital resources to execute strategic initiatives to grow the business management believes that the cash on hand and cash conferred from the business combination will be sufficient to fund the company s operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months management s assessment of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties the company s actual results could vary because of and its future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate the timing and extent of spending to open or acquire new clinics and expand into new markets and the expansion of sales and marketing activities the company may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses services and technologies including intellectual property rights the company has based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and the company could use its available capital resources sooner than management currently expects the company may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources the company may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to management or at all if unable to raise additional capital when desired or if the company cannot expand operations or otherwise capitalize on business opportunities

effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the exchange act are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards the jobs act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable the company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies the company as an emerging growth company can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard this may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used 41 table of contents critical accounting policies the company prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states u s gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions leases on january 1 2022 the company adopted asu 2016 02 leases with various amendments issued in 2018 and 2019 collectively asc 842 using the modified retrospective approach for leases that existed on january 1 2022 asc 842 requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases the company evaluates whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception a lease exists when a contract conveys to the customer the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration upon lease commencement the date on which a lessor makes the underlying asset available to the company for use the company classifies the lease as either an operating or finance lease the company applied certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance including the package of practical expedients which permits the company not to reassess its prior conclusions related to lease identification lease classification and initial direct costs capitalization the company solely acts as a lessee and its leases primarily consist of operating leases for its real estate in the states in which the company operates the company has other operating or financing leases for various clinical and non clinical equipment generally upon the commencement of a lease the company will record a right of use rou asset and lease liability an rou asset represents the company s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the remaining fixed lease payments at lease commencement the company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the later of adoption inception or modification in determining the present value of lease payments rou assets are measured at an amount equal to the initial lease liability plus any prepaid lease payments less any incentives received and initial direct costs at the lease commencement date the company has elected to account for lease and non lease components as a single lease component for all underlying classes of assets as a result the fixed payments that would otherwise be allocable to the non lease components are account for as lease payments and included in the measurement of the company s right of use asset and lease liability lease arrangements with an initial term of 12 months or less are considered short term leases and are not recorded on the balance sheet the short term lease payments are recognized as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term the lease term includes any period covered by renewal options available that the company is reasonably certain to exercise and any options to terminate the lease that the company is not reasonably certain to exercise variable interest entities the company consolidate entities for which it has a variable interest and is determined to be the primary beneficiary the company holds variable interests in the toi pcs comprised of the oncology institute a professional corporation toi ca and

maker codm manages the business the company s 42 table of contents codm is our chief executive officer the codm reviews financial information and allocates resources across three operating segments dispensary patient care and clinical trials other revenue recognition the company recognizes consolidated revenue based upon the principle of the transfer of control of our goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled this principle is achieved through applying the following five step approach 1 identification of the contract or contracts with a customer 2 identification of the performance obligations in the contract 3 determination of the transaction price 4 allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 5 recognition of revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation consolidated revenue primarily consists of capitation revenue fee for service ffs revenue dispensary revenue and clinical trials revenue revenue is recognized in the period in which services are rendered or the period in which the toi pcs are obligated to provide services the form of billing and related risk of collection for such services may vary by type of revenue and the payor the following paragraphs provide a summary of the principal forms of billing arrangements and how revenue is recognized for each capitation capitation contracts have a single performance obligation that is a stand ready obligation to perform specified healthcare services to the population of enrolled members and constitutes a series for the provision of managed healthcare services for the term of the contract which is deemed to be one month since the mix of patient customers can and do change month over month the transaction price for capitation contracts is variable as it primarily includes pmpm fees associated with unspecified membership that fluctuates throughout the term of the contract further we adjust the transaction price for capitation deductions based on historical experience revenue is recognized in the month services are rendered on the basis of the transaction price established at that time if subsequent information resolves uncertainties related to the transaction price adjustments will be recognized in the period they are resolved when payment has been received but services have not yet been rendered the payment is recognized as a contract liability fee for service ffs revenue consists of fees for medical services actually provided to patients these medical services are distinct since the patient can benefit from the medical services on their own each service constitutes a single performance obligation for which the patient accepts and receives the benefit of the medical services as they are performed the transaction price from ffs arrangements is variable in nature because fees are based on patient encounters credits due to patients and reimbursement of provider costs all of which can vary from period to period the company estimates the transaction price using the most likely methodology and amounts are only included in the net transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur once any uncertainty is resolved as a practical expedient the company adopted a portfolio approach to determine the transaction price for the medical services provided under ffs arrangements under this approach the company bifurcated the types of services provided and grouped health plans with similar fees and negotiated payment rates at these levels portfolios share the characteristics conducive to ensuring that the results do not materially differ from the standard applied to individual patient contracts related to each medical service provided revenue is recorded on the date the services are rendered based on the information known at the time of entering of such information into our billing systems as well as an estimate of the revenue associated with medical services when the performance obligation is not satisfied the billing is recognized as a contract liability dispensary 43 table of contents dispensed prescriptions that are filled and delivered to the patient are considered a distinct performance obligation the transaction price for the prescriptions is based on fee schedules set by pbms and other third party payors the fee schedule is often subject to dir fees which are based primarily on pre established metrics dir fees may be assessed in periods after payments are received against future payments the company estimates dir fees to arrive at the transaction price for prescriptions revenue is recognized based on the transaction at the time the patient takes possession of the oral drug clinical research clinical research contracts represent a single integrated set of research activities and thus are a single performance obligation the performance obligation is satisfied over time as the output is captured in data and documentation that is available for the customer to consume over the course of arrangement and furthers progress of the clinical trial the company has elected to recognize revenue for clinical trials using the as invoiced practical expedient the customer is invoiced periodically based on the progress of the trial such that each invoice captures the revenue earned to date based on the state of the trial as established under contract with the customer direct costs of sales direct cost of sales primarily consists of wages paid to clinical personnel and other health professionals oral and iv drug costs and other medical supplies used to provide patient care costs for clinical personnel wages are expensed as incurred and costs for inventory and medical supplies are expensed when used generally by applying the specific identification method goodwill and intangible assets

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video here are the reasons behind the shortage and what the fda plans to do about it washington parents across the u s are scrambling to find baby formula because supply disruptions and a massive safety recall have swept many leading brands off store shelves months of spot shortages at pharmacies and supermarkets have been exacerbated by the recall at abbott which was forced to shutter its largest u s formula manufacturing plant in february due to contamination concerns on monday white house press secretary jenn psaki said the food and drug administration was working around the clock to address any possible shortages on tuesday the fda said it was working with u s manufacturers to increase their output and streamlining paperwork to allow more imports doctors warn against diy formula recipes for now pediatricians and health workers are urging parents who can t find formula to contact food banks or doctor s offices they warn against watering down formula to stretch supplies or using online diy recipes for babies who are not being breastfed this is the only thing they eat said dr steven abrams of the university of texas austin so it has to have all of their nutrition and furthermore it needs to be properly prepared so that it s safe for the smallest infants laura stewart a 52 year old mother of three who lives just north of springfield missouri has been struggling for several weeks to find formula for her 10 month old daughter riley riley normally gets a brand of abbott s similac designed for children with sensitive stomachs last month she instead used four different brands she spits up more she s just more cranky she is typically a very happy girl stewart said when she has the right formula she doesn t spit up she s perfectly fine a small can costs 17 to 18 and lasts three to five days stewart said like many americans stewart relies on wic a federal program similar to food stamps that serves mothers and children to afford formula for her daughter abbott s recall wiped out many wic covered brands though the program is now allowing substitutions how widespread is the shortage trying to keep formula in stock retailers including cvs and walgreens have begun limiting purchases to three containers per customer nationwide about 40 of large retail stores are out of stock up from 31 in mid april according to datasembly a data analytics firm more than half of u s states are seeing out of stock rates between 40 and 50 according to the firm which collects data from 11 000 locations what caused the shortage baby formula is particularly vulnerable to disruptions because just a handful of companies account for almost the entire u s supply industry executives say the constraints began last year as the covid 19 pandemic led to disruptions in ingredients labor and transportation supplies were further squeezed by parents stockpiling during lockdowns then in february abbott recalled several major brands and shut down its sturgis michigan factory when federal officials concluded four babies suffered bacterial infections after consuming formula from the facility two of the infants died when fda inspectors visited the plant in march they found lax safety protocols and traces of the bacteria on several surfaces none of the bacterial strains matched those collected from the infants however and the fda hasn t offered an explanation for how the contamination occurred for its part abbott says its formula is not likely the source of infection though the fda says its investigation continues chicago based abbott said it is increasing production at its other facilities to fill the gap including air shipping formula from a plant in ireland what about specialty formulas the shortages are especially dangerous for infants who require specialty formulas due to food allergies digestive problems and other conditions unfortunately many of those very specialized formulas are only made in the united states at the factory that had the recall and that s caused a huge problem for a relatively small number of infants abrams said after hearing concerns from parents the fda said last month that abbott could begin releasing some specialty formulas not affected by the recalls on a case by case basis the company is providing them free of charge in coordination with physicians and hospitals food safety advocates say the fda made the right call in releasing the formula but that parents should talk to their pediatricians before using it there s still some risk from the formula because we know there are problems at the plant and fda hasn t identified a root cause said sarah sorscher of the center for science in the public interest but it s worth releasing because these infants might die without it what s next it s unclear when the abbott plant might reopen the fda said the company is still working to rectify findings related to the processes procedures and conditions other infant formula makers are meeting or exceeding capacity levels to meet current demand the agency said among other steps the fda said it was waiving enforcement of minor product labeling issues to increase availability of both u s and imported products ___

russia has pummelled the vital port of odesa ukrainian officials said an apparent effort to disrupt supply lines and western weapons shipments critical to kyiv s defence ukraine s ability to stymie a larger better armed russian military has surprised many who had anticipated a much quicker end to the conflict with the war now in its 11th week and kyiv bogging down russian forces and even staging a counteroffensive ukraine s foreign minister appeared to suggest the country could expand its aims beyond merely pushing russia back to areas it or its allies held on the day of the february 24 invasion one of the most dramatic examples of ukraine s ability to prevent easy victories is in mariupol where ukrainian fighters remained holed up at a steel plant denying russia full control of the city the regiment defending the plant said russian warplanes continued bombarding it in recent days the united nations and red cross organised a rescue of what some officials said were the last civilians trapped at the plant but two officials said on tuesday about 100 were believed to still be in the complex s underground tunnels others said that was impossible to confirm in another example of the grisly toll the war continues to take the ukrainians said they found the bodies of 44 civilians in the rubble of a building destroyed weeks ago in the northeastern city of izyum smoke rising after a suspected artillery strike on the front lines near izyum ukraine photo planet labs pbc via ap in washington a top us intelligence official testified tuesday that eight to 10 russian generals have been killed so far in the war lieutenant general scott berrier who leads the defence intelligence agency told a senate committee that because russia lacks a non commissioned officer corps its generals have to go into combat zones and end up in dangerous positions ukraine said russian forces fired seven missiles at odesa hitting a shopping centre and a warehouse in the country s largest port one person was killed and five wounded the military said images overnight showed a burning building and debris including a tennis shoe in a heap of destruction in the city on the black sea mayor gennady trukhanov later visited the warehouse and said it had nothing in common with military infrastructure or military objects ukraine alleged at least some of the munitions used dated to the soviet era making them unreliable in targeting but the centre for defence strategies a ukrainian think tank said moscow used precision weapons against odesa kinzhal or dagger hypersonic air to surface missiles ukrainian british and us officials say russia is rapidly using up its stock of precision weapons raising the risk of more imprecise rockets being used as the conflict grinds on ever since president vladimir putin s forces failed to take kyiv early in the war his focus shifted to the eastern industrial heartland of the donbas but one general has suggested moscow s aims also include cutting ukraine s maritime access to the black and azov seas that would also give it a swath of territory linking russia to the crimean peninsula which it seized in 2014 and transnistria a pro moscow region of moldova even if it falls short of severing ukraine from the coast and it appears to lack the forces to do so continuing missile strikes on odesa reflect the city s strategic importance the russian military has repeatedly targeted its airport and claimed it destroyed several batches of western weapons odesa is also a major gateway for grain shipments and its blockade by russia already threatens global food supplies beyond that the city is a cultural jewel dear to ukrainians and russians alike and targeting it carries symbolic significance as well a bridge has been repeatedly targeted by russian missile strikes outside of odesa ukraine photo planet labs pbc via ap in mariupol russians also bombarded the azovstal steel mill the azov regiment said targeting the sprawling complex 34 times in the past 24 hours attempts to storm the plant also continued it said meanwhile petro andryushchenko an adviser to mariupol s mayor estimated on social media that at least 100 civilians are trapped in the plant donetsk regional governer pavlo kyrylenko said those who remain are people that the russians have not selected for evacuation the two officials didn t say how they knew civilians were still in the complex a warren of tunnels and bunkers spread over 11 square kilometres sviatoslav palamar the deputy commander of the azov regiment told the associated press that he could not confirm any civilians remained mayor vadym boichenko also said there was no way to know with russian forces struggling to gain ground in the donbas military analysts suggest that hitting odesa might serve to stoke concern about southwestern ukraine thus forcing kyiv to put more forces there that would pull them away from the eastern front as ukraine s military stages counter offensives near the northeastern city of kharkiv aiming to push the russians back across the border there kharkiv and the surrounding area have been under sustained russian attack since early in the war in recent weeks grisly pictures testified to the horrors of those battles with charred and mangled bodies strewn in one street dozens of bodies were found in a five storey building that collapsed in march in izyum about 120km from kharkiv said oleh synehubov the head of the regional administration ukraine s foreign minister meanwhile appeared to voice increasing confidence and expanded goals amid russia s stalled offensive in the first months of the war the victory for us looked like withdrawal of russian forces to the positions they occupied before february 24 and payment for inflicted damage dmytro kuleba said in an interview with the financial times now if we are strong enough on the military front and we win the battle for donbas which will be crucial for the following dynamics of the war of course the victory for us in this war will be the liberation of the rest of our territories ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kuleba photo valentyn ogirenko pool via ap that appears to indicate that ukraine wants to try to retake crimea as well as regions of the donbas taken by russia and the separatists it backs but the comments seemed to reflect political ambitions more than battlefield realities many analysts acknowledge that while russia isn t capable of making quick gains the ukrainian military isn t strong enough to drive the russians back ukraine s natural gas pipeline operator said it would stop russian shipments through its novopskov routing hub which is in a part of eastern ukraine controlled by moscow backed separatists and which handles about a third of the russian gas that passes through the country to western europe it said it will stop the flow starting wednesday because of interference from occupying forces including the apparent siphoning of gas which it said endangered the pipeline network s stability it said russia could reroute affected shipments through ukraine s other main hub sudzha which is in a northern part of the country controlled by ukraine a significant amount of russian gas still flows through ukraine to western europe and it wasn t immediately clear how the shutdown might affect long term supplies benchmark natural gas prices in europe jumped by as much as 8 per cent after the announcement before dropping to a 4 per cent increase simone tagliapietra an energy expert at the brussels based think tank bruegel said that the shutdown illustrates the obvious risks of running energy infrastructures in wartime he added that it might not have a big impact on europe s supply because the ukrainians will be able to divert volumes through another pipeline which has spare capacity and the transit to europe will not be affected russian military actions led to the interruption of gas transit through an infrastructure that in 2021 transited 1 3 of gas via ukraine transit to europe not affected as volumes are diverted to another pipeline located in an area controlled by ukraine simone tagliapietra tagliapietra_s may 10 2022 sergei kupriyanov a spokesman for russia s state controlled natural gas giant gazprom said however that ukraine s request to route shipments through another hub would be technologically impossible he said the company sees no grounds for ukraine s decision meanwhile us president joe biden signed a bipartisan measure to reboot the world war ii era lend lease programme which helped defeat nazi germany to bolster kyiv and its allies western powers continued to rally around ukraine s embattled government german foreign minister annalena baerbock traveled to the kyiv suburb of bucha where the bodies of civilians some bound burned or shot at close range were found after russian forces withdrew we owe it to the victims that we don t just commemorate them here but that we hold the perpetrators to account she said ap

afternoon everyone 2022 is off to a strong start with over 69 million of revenue in q1 driven by robust demand for our iconic playboy brand as we said in our last call this year we are focused on two main priorities one is the continued expansion of our direct to consumer business by integrating in the assembling the pieces we have acquired and the other is to build out of our creator platform centerfold which we expect to ultimately drive incremental high margin revenue and create a flywheel effect for our consumer products i am pleased to report that we have made significant progress on both fronts in the first quarter our consumer products in digital channels are coming together into one cohesive ecosystem to fuel our long term growth strategy we already have some great examples of ways that we are integrating our brands across various channels and i couldn t be more excited about the opportunity that lies ahead of us with centerfold itâ s the core of our consumer ecosystem we believe there will be three critical factors for success brand creators and product playboy is in arguably one of the most unique and valuable brands in the world it is iconic on a global basis with over 97 unaided brand awareness and billions of dollars to consumer spend against it it would cost multiples of our current market cap and many years to attempt to replicate but more importantly this is a brand that generates endless organic growth opportunities it is perfectly situated for today s and tomorrow s global consumer this is demonstrated by the partnerships we have forged with consumer brands and celebrities alike it s hard to think of another brand they can play in both the physical and digital worlds across consumer products experiences nft and blockchain on a global basis centerfold allows us to work with a variety of creators across verticals including music art fashion beauty and modeling which then provides us with the valuable organic customer acquisition platform that we believe is central to fueling the top of the funnel for our broader ecosystem on an ongoing basis our current centerfold creators already reached 100s of millions of social media followers and we expect that reach to expand significantly over time as we scale the platform centerfoldâ s potential to drive organic customer acquisition and serve as a massive top of the funnel for our products and services is more valuable than ever given the recent disruptive changes to ios and privacy regulations we believe it will allow us to further target the marketing of our consumer products brands our future nft and blockchain initiatives and our irl and virtual events as centerfold continues to evolve we plan to integrate it with playboy com and drive all customers to one central location in addition centerfold provides leverage for any future partnerships we pursue through licensing hospitality and other channels because we not only show up to the table with an iconic global brand but we also bring direct access to an engaged targeted audience for creators there is immense value will being part of our ecosystem not only have we envision is safe place for freedom of expression inclusion and direct connections between fans and creators we are also launching new avenues for our creators to generate additional revenue streams beyond core offerings including digital subscriptions unlocks and live hang out as creators they have the additional opportunity to become affiliates by promoting our products we ve already signed 40 of our top creators as part of a new affiliate ambassador program to promote our merchandise on their social channels through centerfold our creators also dramatically expand the reach through access to our playboy audience opportunities for modeling contracts with our brands early access to our merchandise the potential to be featured in our upcoming nft projects and opportunities to participate in our irl and virtual experiences with access to exclusive events to this end these brand integrations with centerfold have already begun just last week we co host the met gala after party at the boom boom room in new york city with cardi b not only did cardi b wide stream she is planning to give her centerfold subscribers exclusive access to behind the scenes content for a fee we also opted dancers at the party in our iconic bunny costume in addition to the organic social media and positive press coverage about the playboy after party it reached over 2 billion consumers globally in one week with millions in add value equivalency our ecosystem integration work continues with our partnership with the tao group as we co host friday pool parties all some of long in las vegas as well as some other larger parties throughout the balance of the year these parties kicked off a week ago in feature multiple marketing opportunities to build awareness including billboards qr codes to download the centerfold mobile web app for fans centerfold branded photo stations recruiting opportunities and the chance to win the modeling contract with yandy we are also looking forward to multiple integrations following the partnership we just announced with model and entrepreneur and burrows who joined centerfold yesterday as a founding creator on the centerfold product itself we are taking a very methodical approach to its build out working closely with our founding creators to incorporate their feedback and hiring world class product design and engineering leaders from top organizations including uber youtube twitch and square the team is hyper focused on executing against our roadmap and we recently began rolling out major upgrades these include enhanced creator profiles and the integration of a new back end payment providers to allow us to expand our creator universe and improve our unit economics next up on the roadmap our improvements to the user flow in conjunction with creators other social channels as well as new features around live streaming and direct messaging both of which we expect to enhance our monetization capabilities the long term unified playboy digital product vision includes an integration of our creator platform our digital content offerings and our digital and physical commerce experience off the back of centerfold we are exploring several exciting nft and blockchain opportunities and while it s too early to reveal further details we intend to continue building on the success we achieved last year in the nft space you may recall that we initially started testing the ability to monetize our ip by collaborating with artist in may of 2021 which culminated in our successful rabbitar launch and the creation of 12 million of nft revenue last year our aim is to leverage our past success and learnings to create sustainable revenue and recurring nft revenue streams through ongoing and repeatable strategies we believe we can achieve further success by leveraging our brands partnering with our centerfold creators testing gamification and ultimately monetizing our men s 10 million plus piece archives through nfts and the blockchain these brand product platform and creator integrations are just the beginning of our strategies we have plan to showcase the immense value of our brand propel the flywheel and drive momentum for all aspects of our business you can hear my excitement about this ecosystem because with centerfold we have more than just a direct channel to our consumers we have the brand halo and the product integration as well as i mentioned earlier and other top priority this year is the continued integration of our direct to consumer business within our ecosystem during the first quarter our consumer products business delivered great results while overcoming covid impacts and supply chain disruptions in q1 we continued our global expansion plans for honey birdette with a store opening at aventura in miami in february and the stores already one of our best performing ranking third globally our next location will open in june in stratford uk and the team is hard at work to reach our expansion plans of 10 new locations by the end of 2022 we ve also secured an exciting brand integration opportunity with the exclusive schofield miami in the heart of south beach which features the world s most innovative brands beginning in june we will be showcasing a curated selection of playboy apparel through a limited time product installation as we begin testing playboy in the retail experience rebranding work also began for yandy and lovers as we test the impact of leveraging the playboy name this work will be completed in time for important halloween season with strong momentum behind the brand and proven leaders like ashley kechter leading consumer products we are attracting world class industry talent and have invested in building our depth and our teams in the first quarter as we continue to focus on building a solid infrastructure and integrating our business we are identifying synergies across the brands and opportunities for scale and operational efficiency to that end we eliminated approximately 5 million of annualized overhead costs over the last few weeks we expect this foundational work to continue for the balance of the year and may run higher costs in the short term as we onboard top industry talent and continue our work to consolidate functions across our brands looking at has it the year in the full opportunity before us i want to reiterate my excitement and confidence in the unique business we are building as evidenced by my purchase of roughly 1 million of our stock a few weeks ago while not linear the path forward is clear it is going according to our plan i am confident that we are creating something truly unique and believe no other company can replicate our value proposition now i will turn the call over to lance lance barton thanks ben first quarter revenue grew 63 year over year to 69 4 million our growth once again driven by the continued expansion of our direct to consumer businesses furthermore our gross profit margin expanded driven by the acquisition of honey birdette and the superior product margins that business is able to achieve direct to consumer revenue was up 125 year over year to 49 6 million in the first quarter and we made great strides executing on our growth strategy which consists of expanding our product line building out our merchandising and marketing function strategically expanding our retail footprint and consolidating and optimizing our tech infrastructure playboy e commerce grew revenue more than 300 over the prior year quarter growth was driven by increases across the board and site traffic orders average order value conversion and repeat customers our product line continues to expand to meet consumer demand as we saw more than 120 increase in unique skus sold versus q1 last year consumers gravitated toward our tokyo club apparel collection along with pacsun and near the end of the quarter we launched a collaboration with drake ovo capsule collection which saw massive demand and led to our highest level of sales in a single hour when we launched on march 29 with most of those products selling out quickly we have a number of other high profile designer collaboration coming out later this year that we believe will continue to fuel consumer demand we see opportunity for playboy e commerce to improve margins over time via economies of scale achieved through overall revenue growth expansion of private label and improved marketing efficiency as we continue to build out our merchandising and marketing functions and streamline our tech infrastructure honey birdette achieved over 22 million of revenue in the quarter driven by 23 growth in e commerce and 11 growth in brick and mortar sales in january and february were impacted by the omicron variant which was most noticable around the busy valentine s day buying season but revenue picked up in march as the variant waned but lovers store traffic in the typically strong valentine s shopping season were similarly impacted by the omicron variant along with weather related store closures and the pacific northwest which led to a decline in store revenue compared to q1 of last year we did however see meaningful growth in lovers e commerce and view that as a growth opportunity for the business going forward yandy continues to face tough year over year comps given the significant growth achieved in the first 18 months after we acquired the business and the meaningful impact on marketing efficiency due to apple s ios privacy changes similar to playboy e commerce we believe that we can improve operating efficiency and future margins by bringing our marketing function in house increasing our selection of private label products and consolidating our tech infrastructure across all of our direct to consumer businesses licensing revenue of 14 5 million was a decrease of 1 1 million versus the prior year quarter that was primarily due to contractual amendments we made with our fragrance partner last year and enabled us to recapture rights and beauty and grooming and also amendments with our domestic apparel partners to increase minimum guaranteed royalties over expanded contract terms we continue to optimize the licensing business launching a slate of 15 brand collaborations already this year exciting new brand collaborations planned for upcoming quarters and a robust new business development pipeline we are pleased by the positive response to exciting new creative and innovative campaigns we are introducing around our upcoming 70th anniversary and the year of the rabbit in 2023 which we expect will contribute to a full year of growth for our licensing business this year as well as into the years ahead on the digital side we believe centerfold will not only drive incremental high margin revenue for us over the long term but that it will also serve as an engine for organic customer acquisition which is particularly valuable given the recent impact on marketing efficiency due to apple s ios privacy changes we re often asked how much revenue we think centerfold can generate and while it s still too early to increase our long term outlook itâ s important to understand the potential scale of the opportunity the addressable market of the creator led economy is large and growing rapidly many estimates place that it over 100 billion of revenue today if you look at some of the most successful businesses competing in this space they are generating north of 1 billion in revenue annually and are highly profitable achieving all of this without the benefit of a ubiquitous brand like playboy to take advantage of the opportunity that we see here we are investing today and to building a platform that will combine the power of our globally recognized brand with the massive reach of our creators our goal is to create a business that is successful could eclipse our consumer products business from a revenue and ebitda perspective by 2025 to that end we spent approximately 2 6 million in the first quarter on centerfold as we build the foundation of this platform for long term growth net income in the first quarter was 5 5 million and adjusted ebitda was 1 2 million we spent 9 5 million more in sg a compared to the first quarter of last year on cost related to functioning as a public company such as expanded headcount insurance tech licenses and implementation and third party service providers these costs are largely fixed in nature and many of them we already started to incur in the second quarter of last year so as we continue to grow revenue we expect to see operating leverage and margin expansion i also want to highlight that our cash and equivalents as of march 31st were impacted by the timing of cash flows and working capital we had a significant amount of payables coming out of the fourth quarter related to the increased marketing spend from the holiday season along with accruals related to inventory purchases that we paid down in the first quarter we also saw a material increase in prepaid assets as we have to pay upfront for software licensing and implementation costs as of today cash and equivalents are above 40 million and we have over 20 million of gross cash collection do before the end of the second quarter in terms of outlook i want to reiterate that we continue to expect full year revenue in 2022 to be approximately 350 million and adjusted ebitda to be around 55 million this year has started off strong and we factor the ongoing macro headwinds into our prior outlook as i previously stated we expect the bulk of revenue and ebitda to come in the back half of the year especially in the fourth quarter as we start to realize the operating leverage and anticipated revenue growth tied to all of the foundational work that we are doing today we believe that we are well on our way to achieving our stated goal of 600 million of consumer product revenue by 2025 and as we start to see results from the centerfold business we look forward to when we can raise the long term outlook accordingly for centerfold revenue contribution we are excited by the strong foundation we are building and the tremendous demand for our brand with that i d like to ask the operator to please open the line for questions question and answer session operator thank you one moment please for the first question which comes from the line of jason tilchen with canaccord genuity please go ahead jason tilchen yes thanks a lot for taking the question and congrats on the strong results two questions from me the first is given the china exposure within the licensing business and of the lockdowns of economic development there iâ m just curious you could maybe provide a framework for how to think about the impact there both in q1 and throughout the rest of the year and then the second one is just on the broader supply chain environment you ve heard a bunch of different things from e commerce companies that have reported so far some noted that product availability was getting better throughout the then it was sort of back half of last year others have talked about obviously rising transportation and labor costs i m just curious if you could maybe give us an update on where in the supply chain recovery you guys are and how product availability was throughout the quarter lance barton thanks jason so yes on china in particular so there was no impact in the first quarter we had a little over 10 million of revenue coming from china in the first quarter i mean obviously they ve got very strict covid restrictions that are in place i think those started more recently kind of towards the end of q1 early q2 and obviously presents business challenges to our licensing partners in the market weâ re still evaluating what that impact could be but our partners are committed to limiting any disruptions and returning to normal as quickly as possible with that in mind we re not forecasting any impact going forward itâ s around 40 million of full year revenue based on minimum guarantees that we already have in place that we continue to hold too so look we ll continue to evaluate the situation but we haven t seen any impact yet on the supply chain issues i think all the things that youâ ve highlighted i mean we re seeing the same thing as well in the first quarter in particular honey birdette will do a global marketing launch around there around each product that they put out there so they will market a product globally and it should be in stores globally and online globally part of the challenge we had was actually making sure that the product within all of the stores globally so that certainly had an impact on their ability to sell through some of the product that they brought in we certainly see rising costs from a shipping perspective and also from a fulfillment perspective but what we re trying to do is leverage our consolidated efficiencies across the multiple businesses to really build economy in scale from this another thing that we re trying to do going forward this year is mitigate some of the risk in the back half of the year by receiving available inventory early and this is particularly important as we gear up for the halloween season which is that so important to our business so we re working through with our suppliers now trying to receive that inventory much sooner than we would to make sure that we re in a good place for halloween and then the other thing that i d still highlight yandy in particular we saw this last year but unfortunately it hasn t really gotten any better but our top selling products consistently to be or sold out or out of stock which really has an impact on their ability to continue selling i think last year we saw kind of in the 15 to 25 range we ve seen that percent go up in some cases as high as 40 to 45 out of stock on our top selling items so it has improved from that but certainly has been a headwind and impact for the business jason tilchen okay great and is there anything that you guys are can do to sort of bring that down over time is it diversifying suppliers is there anything that is in your control there or is it mostly out of your control lance barton one of the things that we re doing actually is working on our private label piece of the business i mean we see that is actually some of our better selling product there so the more that we can to your point kind of control this and work more closely i think that can not only improve the amount of stock that we have on better selling items but it can also eliminate some of the stock on the i ll call it lower performing lower margin items ben kohn yes jason i ll just add to that yandy as we alluded to in the last call and we said in this call we are in the process of repositioning yandy and integrate it more into playboy and as we do that and lance talked about the private label products that allows us to diversify suppliers it also allows us to realize higher gross margins on a private label product versus we selling a third party product and so that will continue and as we said we re gearing that up for the halloween season lance barton one other thing i did i failed to mention but obviously another lever we could pull and are contemplating is around increasing the prices on the product obviously you have to do that thoughtfully but in the current environment i think everything is increasing price so it wouldn t be shocking i donâ t believe to our consumers if we do that to offset some of these higher costs that we re facing jason tilchen yes that makes lot of sense thanks a lot for the thoughtful answers operator the next question comes the line of alex fuhrman with craig hallum capital group please go ahead alex fuhrman great thanks very much for taking my question direct to consumer revenue was very strong in the quarter a little bit stronger than we were looking for and i think you mentioned in the prepared remarks yandy is running into some very difficult comparisons lapping some of the strength that that the business saw last year after the acquisition as well as just challenges with the ios changes are there any other brands in particular that really drove the strong quarter for you and just as you look out into q2 we re hearing from a lot of other e commerce companies that consumer spending has pulled back a little bit the last three four five weeks as inflation has ramped up i m curious if you re seeing any pressure in any of your brands lance barton yes so the real drivers of the growth not surprisingly are the brands both playboy and honey birdette we talked about it a lot in the prepared remarks around how strong we see the brand to be and how strong we see demand out there that s not only true for playboy but it s also true for honey birdette and was a big reason why we acquired that company because they have such a loyal following and are really able to generate such brand equity yandy and lovers obviously don t really have a brand they are more like channels for us and so as we explore what can we do to leverage the playboy brand within yandy and lovers that s kind of our longer term strategy around that anytime we ve done a collaboration on the yandy or if weâ ve sold playboy product in lovers stores we actually see really strong demand for that a lot of the growth we saw at playboy in particular was driven through expanded assortment better awareness of playboy com as an e commerce destination not a content destination that s something i talked about i think a lot last year we were really a lot of people with historically go to playboy com expecting a content or a media business and we ve had to really pivot what customers are expecting when they go there and people are now knowing that they can go there for great apparel also honey birdette the growth there driven by continued e com strength and then also the new store opening in miami so look there are certainly headwinds on the business from a macro perspective but what we really like to see is the fact that the brands remains strong and we see opportunity for actually leveraging that more broadly across direct to consumer to drive our longer term growth alex fuhrman okay that s really helpful lance thank you lance barton great thanks next question please operator the next question comes from line of george kelly with roth capital partners please go ahead george kelly hi everybody thanks for taking my questions so first lance you were just talking honey birdette and i was just hoping you could or ben fill in some detail about what s happening in the u s and what i m most curious about i guess is how quickly is the brand growing in the u s and what s the typical store as you re opening these things i mean what s the kind of financial profile of those stores and how quickly do you see a lift in sort of regional e commerce spending after that store openings so any kind of commentary just about the u s ramp lance barton yes sure so in the u s in particular right we i talked about this a little bit on the last call which is here in the u s those stores are producing revenue i think it s somewhere around 40 more on a per store basis than we ve seen in australia and that has continued to be the case and we just opened to have into our store in miami in february and it s already the third highest performing store for us globally so thatâ s been two months time itâ s already shot up the ranks there the other thing when we open these new stores we re really targeting 30 four wall ebitda margin they re able to get there pretty quickly a new store opening cost around 600 000 800 000 to open up in terms of upfront expense but you re able to recover that pretty quickly as these businesses scale and what we also see usually when you open a new store it can contribute to a halo effect on the e com side because you get customers coming into the store figuring out what size works for them what products they like and then if you ve got them as the loyal customer win new product lines drop there are more likely to buy that online so that s why we re really optimistic about the growth prospects at honey birdette particularly in the u s and in europe and the u k because that we open these stores we just see tremendous demand we do have plans to open some additional stores across the atlantic in the u k as well this year as part of our 10 store plan most of the stores that we re opening this year that will be focused on the u s george kelly okay and then second question so on honey birdette but what are your plans to build awareness in the u s do you have any kind of big marketing campaigns or anything else that you re planning for this year ben kohn yes george so obviously the opening of new stores is some of the best awareness we can build and so when we look at the roadmap for the balance of the year as we move honey birdette into the northeast and around the new york metropolitan region that s the best marketing because it s profitable marketing right where as lance said those stores do about 30 ebitda margin and off the back of that what we see is a very high return customer rate on e com as well there are other integrations i don t want to go into that right now but there are other things planned around live events that we can do in a profitable way and other organic marketing initiatives that we are exploring for hb lance barton to tying back to some of the things we also talked about in the prepared remarks so we re launching this showfields pop up concept here in down in miami in the second quarter that s going to carry honey birdette products as well so that s one way to get the word of mouth out there the other thing that we ve talked about is leveraging the centerfold platform as an engine for organic customer acquisition a lot of these creators that we re working with already have a propensity to wear and to use honey birdette branded product so people are really excited about hey how can i get involved how can i work as an affiliate to promote honey birdette granted product so when we talk about centerfold and serving as top of funnel over the long run that is an area that we see is a really interesting opportunity because it can bring in new customers for the honey birdette brand through the top of the funnel on centerfold and do that in a very organic way so that s another thing that we re pretty excited about it and again the creators that we work with are quite excited about the product you also see it organically on social media on tiktok and other live streaming platforms there has been some pretty big celebrities and influencers out there that have been seeing wearing honey birdette lingerie and again they re doing that organically itâ s not something that to take placement george kelly okay understood thank you operator your next question comes from line of daniel adam of loop capital markets please go ahead daniel adam hi good afternoon it looks like you guys burned through a decent amount of cash in the quarter just looking at the queue i guess what s the outlook for cash generation and what s the minimum cash balance you need to run the business working capital and so on thanks lance barton yes i talked about a little bit in the prepared remarks it was really a timing issue in the first quarter you had a lot of payables coming out of the fourth quarter both from a inventory purchase perspective and also a marketing perspective obviously the fourth quarter is a huge push from a marketing perspective those payables come due in the first quarter so we were effectively paying down a lot of that in the first quarter of the other things that impacted as we work on building this foundational infrastructure across the company we re implementing a lot of technology and what you end up having to do there is your implementation costs and your licensing costs don t come over time they come as an upfront payment so our prepaid increased significantly because there is a lot of what we do so those were a lot of the outflows that we saw in the first quarter the other thing is around our licensing partners the timing of those payments that we get from them are largely centered around 2 times a year which is the fourth quarter and the second quarter so i mentioned we ve got another 20 million plus of gross cash receipts that we re expecting to come in this quarter our cash balances already up over 40 million from where we ended march 31st so it s already increased and kind of going back to what i said on a full year basis we re expecting this to be a cash flow positive business even when you factor in our debt service working capital and everything like that so itâ s something that again as you scale this business you re investing upfront we opened the miami store as well where we re planning to open more stores for honey birdette those are also upfront costs that you incur that you recoup over time so from our perspective it s really just a timing issue we can certainly manage the working capital if we need to but from our perspective it was really just timing around a lot of these payments daniel adam so is it safe to assume that the 33 million or so quarter end is the low point for the year lance barton yes daniel adam okay all right thanks lance barton next question operator the next question comes the line of brian dobson with chardan capital markets please go ahead brian dobson yes thanks for taking my question so just returning to centerfold for a second do you think you could give us a little bit more color on the e commerce and cross selling potential there and really how you envision that evolving as the platform continues to mature ben kohn sure so when i talked about in the prepared remarks was the integration of centerfold into playboy com and consolidating all of our digital products into that when we look at for example playboy com the e commerce revenue coming off of that 25 of that revenue today is already coming from affiliates we recently added 40 of our centerfold creators to be affiliates and so as we think about one cohesive ecosystem where centerfold eventually gets merged into playboy com you will have the ability to cross sell merchandise along with other media or subscription products tipping premium unlock subscription revenue et cetera and so it s all one cohesive ecosystem and that s what we ve been testing and what we ve been working on the integration up right now and so when we think about other consumer brands out there what makes me so excited is i think this is one of the most unique differentiators we have is the ability to work with talent to also then cross sell consumer products when you think about the privacy changes with ios and what s happened in other e commerce companies as well as other media companies have commented on this we are effectively building our own social media network in house with this that we believe is a very efficient customer acquisition tool that will create a flywheel effect for the rest of the business brian dobson great thanks very much and then in terms of cost synergies i guess moving forward how much potential do you see there or at least where might you be focused in terms of gaining efficiencies over the next year or so ben kohn so from a macro perspective when we talked about this in the prepared remarks we ve taken out approximately 5 million of annualized cost over the last few weeks moving forward what the companies we bought in 2021 what we are focused on is consolidating infrastructure consolidating functions and i think we ve been successful at doing that so far this year again this is a step function itâ s not linear and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to realize synergies as we move through the balance of the year there is a lot of stuff that was hosted upon us not only through the acquisitions but through the accelerated filing status that we achieved in june of last year and so all of that infrastructure had to be implemented on an accelerated basis from what we were originally planning lance barton yes and i see look there is a few areas from my perspective ben mentioned a lot of these fixed costs that we ve taken on over the last 12 months that we ve kind of ramped up into i think we re kind of at that point right now where most of that has been layered on to the business i mean we will have kind of some ongoing annualization of head count and other tech cost that has come in but i think we ve largely kind of hit that absence so and now it s really about as you scale revenue those costs kind of remain fixed so as a percent of revenue those do go down over time so as e com and continues to scale one centerfold actually starts contributing from a revenue perspective you can get real operating leverage out of that the other thing that i m really interested in is what type of efficiency we can get on the marketing side that s not only from bringing our marketing in house we ve been working with weâ ve historically have been too small from a marketing perspective to warrant our own in house marketing team but we re building out a small team that we can then leverage across the entire portfolio i think you can be a lot more efficient with your marketing spend that way and then when we talk about centerfold being a very large organic top of funnel from a customer acquisition perspective i believe that that can give us a lot more efficiency on the customer acquisition side again hopefully leading to some real economies of scale as we build out this business so i think there are a lot of areas that we re putting in place the foundation today and as we scale revenue you should start to see that really materialize in the margin really kind of at the end of this year and into next year and beyond brian dobson great thanks very much operator as there are no further questions at this time and that does concludes the conference for today we thank you for participation and ask that you please disconnect your line
for a long time netflix insisted it would never interrupt its programming with commercials that was part of the service s appeal the movies were uncut and the tv shows came without breaks the better to binge things for hours upon hours but that was before netflix faced serious competition in the streaming video space mostly from services that do offer cheaper subscriptions for programming that is occasionally broken up by ads netflix also lost 200 000 subscribers in the first quarter of 2022 and it s said it expects to lose 2 million more this quarter which has sent their stock tumbling and so perhaps not surprisingly they are now looking to create a ad supported netflix tier and to do it quickly according to a netflix memo to employees reported by the new york times netflix plans to introduce its cheaper tier with commercial interruptions by the end of the year the move will presumably boost subscriptions and the ads will generate revenue as well there was a period not that long ago when a netflix subscription was one of the best deals in entertainment for a couple bucks a month you got access to an enormous and varied library of movies and shows all available instantly but in the last few years netflix s library has shrunk and a lot of their more recent originals are just not on par with the content they lost plus their subscription prices have continued to rise their standard plan now costs a whopping 15 49 a month that s still cheaper than most cable packages but when you factor in how often you use the service and how many families feel the need to supplement it with other services like hulu or disney or hbo max you start to see why they might have lost a few subscribers recently a cheaper tier with some ads will likely attract some lapsed customers back and if you don t want the ads you can continue to pay more to watch without them but beware according to the times netflix is also planning to crack down on password sharing by the end of the year as well so if you re freeloading off your parents netflix account those days might be numbered netflix s most popular tv shows ever these are the most popular tv shows ever on netflix based on hours viewed in their first 28 days on streaming

supermarkets have been exacerbated by the recall at abbott which was forced to shutter its largest u s formula manufacturing plant in february due to contamination concerns on monday white house press secretary jenn psaki said the food and drug administration was working around the clock to address any possible shortages on tuesday the fda said it was working with u s manufacturers to increase their output and streamlining paperwork to allow more imports doctors warn against diy formula recipes for now pediatricians and health workers are urging parents who can t find formula to contact food banks or doctor s offices they warn against watering down formula to stretch supplies or using online diy recipes for babies who are not being breastfed this is the only thing they eat said dr steven abrams of the university of texas austin so it has to have all of their nutrition and furthermore it needs to be properly prepared so that it s safe for the smallest infants laura stewart a 52 year old mother of three who lives just north of springfield missouri has been struggling for several weeks to find formula for her 10 month old daughter riley riley normally gets a brand of abbott s similac designed for children with sensitive stomachs last month she instead used four different brands she spits up more she s just more cranky she is typically a very happy girl stewart said when she has the right formula she doesn t spit up she s perfectly fine a small can costs 17 to 18 and lasts three to five days stewart said like many americans stewart relies on wic a federal program similar to food stamps that serves mothers and children to afford formula for her daughter abbott s recall wiped out many wic covered brands though the program is now allowing substitutions how widespread is the shortage trying to keep formula in stock retailers including cvs and walgreens have begun limiting purchases to three containers per customer nationwide about 40 of large retail stores are out of stock up from 31 in mid april according to datasembly a data analytics firm more than half of u s states are seeing out of stock rates between 40 and 50 according to the firm which collects data from 11 000 locations what caused the shortage baby formula is particularly vulnerable to disruptions because just a handful of companies account for almost the entire u s supply industry executives say the constraints began last year as the covid 19 pandemic led to disruptions in ingredients labor and transportation supplies were further squeezed by parents stockpiling during lockdowns then in february abbott recalled several major brands and shut down its sturgis michigan factory when federal officials concluded four babies suffered bacterial infections after consuming formula from the facility two of the infants died when fda inspectors visited the plant in march they found lax safety protocols and traces of the bacteria on several surfaces none of the bacterial strains matched those collected from the infants however and the fda hasn t offered an explanation for how the contamination occurred for its part abbott says its formula is not likely the source of infection though the fda says its investigation continues chicago based abbott said it is increasing production at its other facilities to fill the gap including air shipping formula from a plant in ireland what about specialty formulas the shortages are especially dangerous for infants who require specialty formulas due to food allergies digestive problems and other conditions unfortunately many of those very specialized formulas are only made in the united states at the factory that had the recall and that s caused a huge problem for a relatively small number of infants abrams said after hearing concerns from parents the fda said last month that abbott could begin releasing some specialty formulas not affected by the recalls on a case by case basis the company is providing them free of charge in coordination with physicians and hospitals food safety advocates say the fda made the right call in releasing the formula but that parents should talk to their pediatricians before using it there s still some risk from the formula because we know there are problems at the plant and fda hasn t identified a root cause said sarah sorscher of the center for science in the public interest but it s worth releasing because these infants might die without it what s next it s unclear when the abbott plant might reopen the fda said the company is still working to rectify findings related to the processes procedures and conditions other infant formula makers are meeting or exceeding capacity levels to meet current demand the agency said among other steps the fda said it was waiving enforcement of minor product labeling issues to increase availability of both u s and imported products ___

tuesday trading the native token of the terra ecosystem was recently down over 53 over the past 24 hours after the organization s ust stablecoin continued to fall well short of its dollar peg and amid a report that the luna foundation guard lfg the non profit established to support the terra network was aiming to raise 1 billion to restore this parity the decline followed a 30 drop on monday ust was recently in the red over 6 meanwhile bitcoin s roughly 1 4 upturn represented an improvement over the previous day when the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dove below 30 000 in

which is widely expected to show that inflation slowed but prices remained high in emailed comments jaime baeza ceo of miami based crypto hedge fund anb investments noted the pressure of macroeconomic events including inflation and a tightening of central bank monetary policy on stocks and digital assets but attributed the most recent drop off in bitcoin to the de peg of the ust baeza wrote that lfg s decision to defend the peg by selling bitcoin reserves accelerated the sell off of the broader crypto market as panic spread and a more black swan systemic risk event loomed closer in an interview on coindesk tv s first mover program joseph kelly ceo of bitcoin financial services firm unchained capital called the depegging a scary headline thing but he added optimistically it s one of those things that you get to hold in contrast to bitcoin as a more sound more explainable asset that isn t overpromising and trying to do things like maintain a dollar peg it s one way that bitcoin continues to shine in the long run markets s p 500 4 001 0 2 djia 32 160 0 2 nasdaq 11 737 0 9 gold 1 839 0 8 insights predicting crypto markets is challenging the last week in crypto has shown an immense volatility that few if any assets can match markets have lost more than 1 billion as terra s ust stablecoin was thrown off its 1 1 dollar peg and the crypto majors collapsed bringing with it plenty of liquidations there s a lot to unpack about the collapse of terra s ust probably the least understood part of it was the luna foundation guard s decision to lend out almost the entirety of their reserves to market makers to support the 1 ust peg by specifically making trades marked to 1 somewhere there s theoretical merit to this but the market saw lfg s reserves at critically low levels and pushed to liquidate as much as it could the timing of the u s federal reserve s report on stablecoins couldn t have been better these vulnerabilities may be exacerbated by a lack of transparency regarding the riskiness and liquidity of assets backing stablecoins the report read with nellie liang the treasury department s undersecretary for domestic finance adding at an event they have the potential to generate destabilizing runs if the value of the assets backing the stablecoin decline abruptly in many ways stablecoins were one of the post march 2020 legacies they were supposed to create real utility and acceptance for the asset class and reflected growing institutional interest after all before march 2020 stablecoins had a market cap of just over 5 billion now that number is closer to 175 billion some might think that this triple whammy of the de pegging of ust and its likely failure a violent decline in crypto prices and a condemnation of stablecoins by the fed would put the asset class in a precarious position it would be a test of faith and conviction sure some data suggests that very thing bitcoin is flowing into exchanges at a pace not seen since november 2017 just over 50 000 bitcoin went into exchanges on monday traditionally exchange inflow means that traders are getting ready to sell their assets which is seen as a bearish signal for prices but it also means that traders might be preparing to make a play for the derivatives market in this scenario they would open long positions to accelerate their gains as the price of crypto recovers consider what happened during november 2017 as glassnode data shows there was plenty of bitcoin on exchanges it was the peak of the initial coin offering bubble and the price of bitcoin continued to appreciate despite all these bitcoin on exchanges yes there was a derivatives market as bitmex launched in 2014 but at the time it was still relatively unsophisticated and wouldn t come of age until 2018 the point is this asset class in the grand scheme of things is still in its infancy there are many signals we can use to help navigate through the market but at the end of the day crypto s unpredictability means these indicators signify predictions and are not definitive technician s take bitcoin holding support at 30k resistance at 35k bitcoin btc stabilized at around the 30 000 support level which could keep short term buyers active still upside appears to be limited initially toward the next resistance level at 35 000 btc rose by as much as 4 over the past 24 hours it s down by 16 over the past week several alternative cryptos altcoins are outperforming btc over the past 24 hours suggesting a greater appetite for risk among short term traders typically btc declines less than altcoins during market recoveries because of its lower risk profile relative to smaller tokens the relative strength index rsi on the daily chart is rising from extreme oversold levels which could support a brief relief rally similar to what occurred in late january this time however negative momentum signals have increased the chance of additional breakdowns on the chart further the 14 day moving average of volume based on coinbase exchange data provided by tradingview ticked higher which could be an initial sign of capitulation still current volume levels are lower than june of

by davide barbuscia new york reuters interest rate jitters keep hammering the u s bond market but some investors are starting to think a possible slowdown in price pressure as well as support from yield seeking buyers could soon put a ceiling or at least a pause on rising yields u s treasuries have had their worst start to the year in history and the selloff in parts of the curve continued last week after the u s federal reserve hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate by 50 basis points and announced it would begin to trim its balance sheet next month to counter unabated inflation yet for some investors most of the inflation driven weakness in bond markets has been priced in and while there is still room for upside yields could start subsiding soon as financial conditions tighten on the back of the fed s actions we re probably getting closer to the peak in terms of yields said john madziyire a senior portfolio manager and head of us treasuries and inflation within vanguard s fixed income group yields can still go higher as a function of the fact that volatility is so high but we re probably getting close to a point where we re pricing in the highs in yields and buyers will start being more attracted to buying at these levels he said yields of 10 year u s government bonds a benchmark for mortgage rates and other financial instruments hit a fresh high of 3 2 on monday a level last seen in november 2018 if it breaks above 3 26 it will pierce those 2018 highs and be at 2011 levels brian reynolds chief markets strategist at reynolds strategy pointed to 2018 and 2011 as two highly emotional events in bond market history with 2018 marking investors being frightened that the fed was going to tighten to infinity while 2011 was the year when the united states lost its triple a rating yields had already blasted past expectations a march 29 april 5 reuters poll showed that fixed income experts projected the 10 year bond will rise to 2 60 in a year after hitting 3 2 on monday however yields have fallen back to around 3 in a flight to safety as stocks plummeted due to concerns over rising interest rates and an economic slowdown in china after a recent rise in coronavirus cases the momentum in the upwards push in interest rates seems to be slowing a bit said mike vogelzang chief investment officer at captrust also pointing to relatively stable yields on two year u s government bonds with prices having seemingly reflected the fed s planned rate hikes this year two year yields which are particularly sensitive to changes in monetary policy have inched lower since the fed hiked rates last week and the yield curve between two year notes and 10 year bonds has been steepening sharply from 18 9 basis points before the fed s hike to 44 basis points on monday that part of the curve inverted in late march and then in april sending a warning sign for investors that a recession could follow the curve was pretty flat a month ago and it s now steepened out generally a steeper curve is healthy said eric stein co head of global fixed income and chief investment officer at morgan stanley investment management we re starting to get to the conditions in place for yields to stop continuing to go up stein said pointing to a tightening of financial conditions and lower inflation expectations as measured by treasury inflation protected securities breakeven inflation rates indicating the market s expectations for future inflation have plummeted the 10 year breakeven inflation rate an indicator of future inflation declined to 2 79 on monday further retreating from a 3 14 hit last month the highest since at least september 2004 fed chair jerome powell said last week policymakers were ready to approve half percentage point rate hikes at upcoming policy meetings in june and july for jimmy lee chief executive officer of the wealth consulting group a wealth management firm demand for 10 year notes will likely increase should they hit a 3 5 yield over the next two months the pain is probably not over yet but i m sensing that we re getting close he said between now and after those two hikes i think there s going to be some potential buying i think fund managers are seeing value that they haven t seen in a long time for captrust s vogelzang however there is no sign in the market that an upper limit in yields is about to be reached and the fed s balance sheet runoff expected to start next month could add further pressure there s too many outcomes that can take place that could really leave you in a bad spot he said the story corrects last sentence to say many instead of may reporting by davide barbuscia in new york editing by megan davies and matthew lewis

tiger global is having a year according to a new report from financial times the low flying yet seemingly ubiquitous 21 year old outfit has seen losses of about 17 billion during this year s tech stock sell off ft notes that s one of the biggest dollar declines for a hedge fund in history as shocking per ft according to the calculations of a fund of hedge funds run by the edmond de rothschild group tiger global s hedge fund assets have been so hard hit that the outfit has in four months erased about two thirds of its gains since its launch in 2001 ouch the question is whether that trouncing will impact the firm s venture business which like that of many other venture businesses has ballooned rapidly in recent years in 2020 the firm closed its twelfth venture fund with 3 75 billion in capital commitments early last year it closed its thirteenth venture fund titled xiv for superstitious reasons with 6 65 billion before closing its newest fund fund xv with a massive 12 7 billion in capital commitments in march of this year yet even that new fund which reportedly took less than six months to raise and includes 1 5 billion in commitments from tiger global s own employees is almost fully invested already according to a source close to the firm on the one hand it s not entirely astonishing to anyone paying attention that tiger global has put so much money to work already it added 118 unicorn companies to its list of portfolio companies last year according to crunchbase news and it continued to outpace every other investor in the first quarter of this year those rounds at least until earlier this year were not small in december tiger global led a 1 8 billion series b investment into the nuclear fusion startup commonwealth fusion systems it november it led a 600 million series d round for the electric vehicle company nuro the 78 deals it led in the first quarter of this year including a 768 million series e round for getir the istanbul based on demand delivery service a 530 million series d round for the paris based online bank qonto and a 273 million series c round for french wholesale marketplace ankorstore wound up in companies that collectively raised 7 6 billion crunchbase news reported last month still 12 7 billion is a lot of money and it s not even june it s not even mid may the question begged naturally is how much money tiger global can collect for its next fund and by when in all likelihood the firm which declined to comment has soft commitments in place already based on its recent performance according to a letter to investors obtained by techcrunch the firm s private portfolio funds as of the end of the first quarter of this year had generated a 25 net irr since inception in 2003 story continues in the first quarter this year wrote the firm remaining value in the funds decreased by 9 following an increase of 54 in 2021 presumably that value has sunk further in q2 as valuations begin to drop broadly across the startup ecosystem according to that same investor letter tiger global boasts of stakes in 38 companies that went public last year including coinbase freshworks sentinelone and toast and says it distributed 3 7 billion to investors last year either way there could hardly be a worse time to be raising another enormous venture fund almost every institutional investor in the world has seen its stock portfolio hammered and it isn t like venture firms set aside money inside a giant piggy bank they call down committed capital from their investors as they need it that process allows vcs to begin the clock on each investment as soon as a check is written but it also subjects them to extreme market volatility when public shares start to nosedive as now university endowments pension funds and other institutional investors grow loath to fulfill their capital obligations because it means having to sell public company shares that are underwater these same institutions also typically pull back from their new fund commitments because as their public market portfolios shrink they become overweighted by their private market allocations most have targets they re supposed to meet to ensure that they re sufficiently diversified current trends will begin impacting everyone if the market doesn t bounce back but with tiger global s performance so dramatically changed from even four months ago the terrain could prove especially tricky for its team it certainly has a weaker case to make according to ft hedge fund investors who invested at tiger global s 2001 launch have made more than 20 times their initial investment despite its massive new losses but that s just twice the return they would have received by investing in the s p 500 over the same 21 year period and that s not taking into account tiger global s management fees meanwhile tiger global s venture bets could go sideways along with many other firms investments if the market for exits doesn t improve tiger global apparently saw what was coming its team which works as one unit to make both hedge fund and venture bets had already all but abandoned late stage venture deals by early february as the information reported that same month venture capitalist keith rabois whose firm founders fund sometimes competes with hedge funds told the information at the time that some pullback from those giant rounds was inevitable given the plummeting share price of publicly traded tech companies if you have a high burn rate and have raised money at high prices you re going to run into a brick wall very fast he d said of late stage startups there s no free money anymore it s easy to wonder if tiger global s own strategy shift to earlier stage startups has come too late and there are no fast answers on this front unlike with its hedge fund business tiger global has the luxury of some time before its more recent venture bets can be judged the firm has historically enjoyed some big venture wins including bets on facebook linkedin airbnb and peloton in the meantime tiger global which prides itself on its due diligence may be celebrating a separate apparent win right now it passed on the one click checkout company bolt which is currently being sued by its biggest customer for having utterly failed to deliver on the technological capabilities that it held itself out as possessing says the customer as bad bolt s former employees say it had a tendency to overstate its metrics as the new york times wrote today in a piece about bolt after tiger global executives met with the company they weren t convinced the merchants to which bolt pointed them would use bolt beyond a trial and they deemed bolt s revenue projections overly bullish while a lot of heavy hitting firms proceeded to fund bolt including general atlantic westcap and untitled investments a firm founded by a former tiger global investor who left the outfit in 2017 tiger global passed on the deal
parents hunting for baby formula as shortage spans us a sign is posted at a cvs pharmacy indicating a shortage in the availability of baby food tuesday may 10 2022 in charlotte n c parents in much of the u s are scrambling to find baby formula after a combination of supply disruptions and safety recalls have swept many of the leading brands from store shelves ap photo chris carlson washington ap parents across the u s are scrambling to find baby formula because supply disruptions and a massive safety recall have swept many leading brands off store shelves months of spot shortages at pharmacies and supermarkets have been exacerbated by the recall at abbott which was forced to shutter its largest u s formula manufacturing plant in february due to contamination concerns on monday white house press secretary jenn psaki said the food and drug administration was working around the clock to address any possible shortages and will try to expedite imports of foreign baby formula to increase supply for now pediatricians and health workers are urging parents who can t find formula to contact food banks or doctor s offices they warn against watering down formula to stretch supplies or using online diy recipes for babies who are not being breastfed this is the only thing they eat said dr steven abrams of the university of texas austin so it has to have all of their nutrition and furthermore it needs to be properly prepared so that it s safe for the smallest infants laura stewart a 52 year old mother of three who lives just north of springfield missouri has been struggling for several weeks to find formula for her 10 month old daughter riley riley normally gets a brand of abbott s similac designed for children with sensitive stomachs last month she instead used four different brands she spits up more she s just more cranky she is typically a very happy girl hughes said when she has the right formula she doesn t spit up she s perfectly fine a small can costs 17 to 18 and lasts three to five days stewart said like many americans hughes relies on wic a federal program similar to food stamps that serves mothers and children to afford formula for her daughter abbott s recall wiped out many wic covered brands though the program is now allowing substitutions trying to keep formula in stock retailers including cvs and walgreens have begun limiting purchases to three containers per customer nationwide about 40 of big box stores are out of stock up from 31 in mid april according to datasembly a data analytics firm more than half of u s states are seeing out of stock rates between 40 and 50 according to the firm which collects data from 11 000 locations baby formula is particularly vulnerable to disruptions because just a handful of companies account for almost the entire u s supply industry executives say the constraints began last year as the covid 19 pandemic led to disruptions in ingredients labor and transportation supplies were further squeezed by parents stockpiling during lockdowns then in february abbott recalled several major brands and shut down its sturgis michigan factory when federal officials concluded four babies suffered bacterial infections after consuming formula from the facility two of the infants died when fda inspectors visited the plant in march they found lax safety protocols and traces of the bacteria on several surfaces none of the bacterial strains matched those collected from the infants however and the fda hasn t offered an explanation for how the contamination occurred for its part abbott says its formula is not likely the source of infection though the fda says its investigation continues the shortages are especially dangerous for infants who require specialty formulas due to food allergies digestive problems and other conditions unfortunately many of those very specialized formulas are only made in the united states at the factory that had the recall and that s caused a huge problem for a relatively small number of infants abrams said after hearing concerns from parents the fda said last month that abbott could begin releasing some specialty formulas not affected by the recalls on a case by case basis the company is providing them free of charge in coordination with physicians and hospitals food safety advocates say the fda made the right call in releasing the formula but that parents should talk to their pediatricians before using it there s still some risk from the formula because we know there are problems at the plant and fda hasn t identified a root cause said sarah sorscher of the center for science in the public interest but it s worth releasing because these infants might die without it it s unclear when the abbott plant might reopen an fda spokeswoman said the company is still working to rectify findings related to the processes procedures and conditions the agency also is working with other manufacturers to consider options for increasing production industry professionals say it will be hard to boost supply quickly because the fda requires extensive testing labeling and inspections it s a long and rigorous process to bring any new manufacturers into this country said ron belldegrun co founder of byheart a new york based specialty formula maker that recently launched its first product after four years in development ___

in 2019 barton embarked on his biggest bhag yet and his most disastrous the previous year zillow had introduced a new business zillow offers that was meant to compete with a buzzy new crop of companies called ibuyers more than us2 trillion worth of homes change hands in the us every year through a process that often combines the excruciating task of selling a house with the exasperating job of buying one the ibuyers used software to figure out what homes were worth then bought them for cash made light repairs and listed them for sale the idea was to charge customers a convenience fee for relieving the headache of selling a home zillow s entrance into the business made some sense it had a huge audience and lots of experience estimating the prices of homes but it was attempting to pivot from selling online advertising to operating what amounted to a hedge fund and a sprawling construction business two fields in which it had no experience at all zillow hired some former commercial real estate executives to manage the new initiative and added operation excellence to its list of core values in february 2019 barton climbed down from his role as executive chairman and took over as chief executive rallying employees to the task of remaking the company while he persuaded shareholders to accept the massive expenditures needed to finance the venture his goal he said on his first quarterly conference call was to sell 5000 homes a month within five years which would put zillow on par with the biggest us home builders the target was so exciting he waxed lunar investors are used to me pointing at the moon and saying i want to go step on that thing he said at the time by the accounts of barton and those around him the early days of zillow offers were a swinging time harvard business school published a case study framing zillow s pivot as an aggressive move to disrupt the disruptors effectively inducting barton into the big hairy hall of fame a rising housing market meanwhile was making him look like a genius in austin for instance you could buy a house for us375 000 at the end of 2020 and sell it for us550 000 a year later without so much as swiping a paintbrush too good to be true zillow s market cap approached us50 billion making barton s stake worth more than us1 billion in late august 2021 he boasted to investors that customers biggest complaint with zillow offers was it was too good to be true in september the company issued us700 million worth of home flipping bonds signalling a long term commitment to the business a few weeks later i started hearing that zillow had stopped pursuing acquisitions when i wrote a story noting the pause a zillow spokesman blamed the labour shortage explaining that the company was struggling to find enough workers to inspect and renovate homes in the two weeks that followed my colleagues and i reported that the company had been overpaying for properties often by tens of thousands of dollars and it had begun offering thousands of them to investors in what appeared to be a going out of business sale then on november 2 barton announced he was closing down the operation taking what turned out to be a us405 million writedown and laying off 2000 workers by the time the news sank in shares had fallen 75 per cent from their peak in february 2021 a us35 billion wipeout that reminded observers in the tech and real estate sectors that what made a big goal hairy was its likelihood of failure zillow s headquarters in downtown seattle had an after the bhag energy when i visited in february early in the pandemic the company told employees to work wherever they wanted and on most days attendance was running in the area of 5 per cent advertisement in employees absence decorators had remade the office in the style of a boutique hotel a first draft at designing the company s remote working future there seemed to be more plants than work stations and the remaining desks were surrounded by plush furniture workers who did come in could choose their own adventure on the day i was there an economist had commandeered a small conference room for a video chat with biden administration officials warning them that the combination of rabid home buying demand and rapidly rising mortgage rates made housing trends difficult to predict these kinds of things your body knows your stomach knows before your head knows and my stomach knew rich barton chief executive officer of zillow group barton greeted me on the 40th floor and led me across a small pool he had installed at the threshold of his office after he was told that crossing water helped people leave their worries behind for a guy who d just vaporised billions of his own company s market cap he seemed untroubled at 54 he still looked the part of the executive geek with hair that was grey at the temples but flopped jauntily across his brow he spoke quickly peppering his speech with pop culture references and seemed earnest even when making comically grand pronouncements such as when he gestured out over puget sound at the olympic mountains and told me that s where zeus resides new shit came to light zillow had gotten into ibuying he says during a period when investors were eager to fund audacious efforts the business depended on economies of scale so barton pushed employees to chase rapid growth but the pandemic set off a nationwide home buying spree that led to the fastest price acceleration on record and barton s quest for growth exposed zillow to bigger price swings than he d thought possible although he once viewed ibuyers as market makers earning fees for the relatively safe activity of connecting sellers and buyers he came to feel as though he was borrowing huge sums to make risky bets we were doing something that was clearly a potential long term capital management kind of thing he says invoking the hedge fund that crashed spectacularly in 1998 after the new shit came to light barton says paraphrasing the dude shutting down zillow offers was a straightforward if emotionally difficult decision it meant firing thousands of people enraging investors and subjecting barton to criticism from those not initiated into the way of the bhag but he felt he was saving the company from potential ruin on the day he announced the decision barton says he felt relief these kinds of things he says your body knows your stomach knows before your head knows and my stomach knew zillow has always concerned itself with easing anxiety the company s name combines the letter z with pillow aiming to convey safety and comfort and perhaps borrowing from dr seuss but the zillow on my pillow always helps me fall asleep from there s a wocket in my pocket advertisement at first this was as easy as shedding light on an opaque market real estate agents earned their commissions by collecting and collating information says clelia warburg peters the managing partner of era ventures a venture capital firm who grew up in her family s new york real estate brokerage when my dad got into the business he d walk up and down park avenue with a stack of 10 and 20 dollar bills and give money to the doormen to find out who had died who d gotten divorced who was moving she says zillow made the industry more transparent taking information from the shared multiple listing services and serving it to consumers online this innovation transformed the way people started their home search and the zestimate helped zillow outshine similar listing sites but it did nothing to change the stressful process of actually buying or selling a home this dynamic was parodied effectively by saturday night live last year in a bit that suggested surfing zillow listings was akin to a sexual fantasy in the skit cast member mikey day lusts over home offices and outdoor kitchens finally letting his passion guide his cursor to the contact an agent button on zillow s website at that point cecily strong enters the frame as nasally remax agent donna lazaritti who interrupts day s reveries by calling him repeatedly to set up a home tour hundreds of billions ibuying provided a way around that mess cutting out intermediaries providing an experience customers actually liked and bringing zillow to the lucrative heart of housing transactions in theory zillow could make money flipping homes and then add on mortgages and other services that had huge appeal to barton who along with his co founder and zillow s executive chairman lloyd frink controls the company through a special class of shares stock market investors valued zillow at roughly us10 billion when it started flipping homes but barton told colleagues that zillow offers gave the company a path to being worth hundreds of billions according to people familiar with the conversations who like others in this story requested anonymity because they were discussing internal company matters barton liked the business for another reason opendoor technologies which pioneered the ibuying model had raised more than us1 billion in venture capital and increasingly appeared to be a threat to zillow s dominance in online real estate if opendoor s service got popular enough with home sellers the company might be able to bypass the multiple listing service diverting inventory and ultimately house hunters from zillow zillow s initial approach to ibuying was relatively conservative the company used software to generate an offer then asked pricing experts to vet the bid if the seller accepted zillow sent workers to estimate the cost of needed repairs subtracting that amount from its final bid but after opendoor went public via a special purpose acquisition company or spac barton decided to take his bhag to the next level zillow introduced an initiative dubbed project ketchup to close the gap with opendoor employees got merchandise to mark the occasion including water bottles made up to resemble condiment containers as well as an actual bottle of heinz zillow told its pricing experts to stop questioning the algorithms according to people familiar with the process it also raised its bids sometimes bumping the numbers its pricing software spit out by tens of thousands of dollars as part of a process known internally as offer calibration the company embraced auto evaluations effectively allowing customers to inspect their own homes and lowered convenience fees advertisement in the us summer of 2021 when opendoor was charging a flat fee of 5 per cent zillow was charging some customers less than 1 per cent people would be so happy when we showed up at their door says a former employee in the real estate operation i could tell them hey i m going to start a small fire in your yard just to see if it burns well they d be like cool you re paying me us50 000 over the value of my home when staff raised concerns with their superiors management reassured them it was all part of the plan former employees say zillow bought almost 10 000 homes in the third quarter fulfilling barton s desire for hypergrowth but price appreciation was slowing and zillow was having trouble selling many of its homes for what it had paid workers and materials were also in short supply adding to the time it took to resell houses when zillow did bring properties to market they were overpriced to reflect the company s inflated acquisition costs the listings lingered increasing zillow s carrying expenses barton maintains that the unpredictable housing market was the root problem but opendoor and other ibuyers including offerpad solutions and redfin managed to avoid those pitfalls setting themselves up to benefit when home prices started accelerating again in early 2022 rich barton standing next to the water feature in his seattle office bloomberg smile because it happened when i asked barton why his company failed where competitors succeeded he traced a seemingly circular logic zillow needed to grow fast which meant running the business less efficiently that in turn led to losses that convinced barton the business was too risky and not profitable enough to be worth the trouble what if zillow had simply run the business better barton insists that price volatility doomed the experiment the company s operational struggles were absolutely moot he says sometimes bhag is a flat circle zillow home flipping employees were summoned to a meeting after the stock market closed on november 2 right when the press release announcing the end of zillow offers was about to go out barton didn t speak say people who attended the video call the task of breaking the news to employees was left to arik prawer the executive zillow hired to oversee the home flipping operation don t cry because it s over prawer said quoting a line commonly attributed to dr seuss smile because it happened in a call with investors that afternoon barton sketched out his logic it wasn t just that ibuying was riskier than anticipated he told them the market for it was too narrow the company was transacting with only 10 per cent of the serious sellers who asked zillow to make them an offer the bhag he seemed to be saying wasn t bhag enough this was for many tough to swallow barton had spent the previous three years hyping ibuying saying his company was revolutionising a broken housing market with a service that was as appealing as free beer at a college party now it was what kombucha advertisement zillow had been hiring employees for the ibuying business up to the day it pulled the plug according to two former managers it needed to lay off 2000 people in the middle of a pandemic with firings happening on video calls zillow still had 18 000 or so homes to get off its books and it needed the workers it planned to let go to stay long enough to sell them internal surveys unsurprisingly showed employees were less engaged and less confident in their bosses zillow s chief marketing officer aimee johnson left as did its chief economist svenja gudell stan humphries the executive who invented the zestimate told colleagues he planned to retire barton and his deputies sought to break through the malaise by paying bonuses and severance to departing employees and explaining their about face in a series of company wide meetings called zall halls they also argued that the work on zillow offers would serve the company as it shifted focus to something barton had begun to call a housing super app from which buyers could manage every part of a real estate transaction on their terms that would probably include showingtime a feature that helps house hunters schedule home tours without having to take a call from donna lazaritti bidding wars financing was another important piece of the puzzle zillow had acquired a mortgage lender seeking to tap a new revenue stream for the ibuying business after shutting down ibuying zillow began working on a new style of bridge loan that enables buyers to make cash offers before they ve secured a mortgage helping them win bidding wars the company expects the super app will eventually help homeowners sell and let renters find apartments submit applications and pay their landlords it was just a new path barton says the mountaintop that we re trying to summit was the same in february barton laid out some new targets in a call with investors about two thirds of us home buyers search listings on zillow but only 5 per cent are represented by an agent they meet at the site barton wanted to use his super app to increase that number which would let him double the company s non home flipping revenue by 2025 unlike ibuying which depends on generating slim profits on lots of transactions barton promised that the super app would deliver 45 per cent margins is this bhag bigger and hairier than the one that came before it barton thinks so then again real estate brokerages have been trying to consolidate services for decades with little success a field of deep pocketed companies including mortgage lenders brokerages and zillow s old ibuying rival opendoor are still chasing similar goals it s going to be a long time before zillow faces an existential crisis says warburg peters the venture capitalist it s also true that in some ways the industry is moving past them based on zillow s current stock price investors are sceptical of barton s pitch he says he doesn t care setting out longer term goals is always scary he says the most important thing to me is that people at zillow look at that and go that s crazy how are we going to do that with noah buhayar bloomberg businessweek
for a long time netflix insisted it would never interrupt its programming with commercials that was part of the service s appeal the movies were uncut and the tv shows came without breaks the better to binge things for hours upon hours but that was before netflix faced serious competition in the streaming video space mostly from services that do offer cheaper subscriptions for programming that is occasionally broken up by ads netflix also lost 200 000 subscribers in the first quarter of 2022 and it s said it expects to lose 2 million more this quarter which has sent their stock tumbling and so perhaps not surprisingly they are now looking to create a ad supported netflix tier and to do it quickly according to a netflix memo to employees reported by the new york times netflix plans to introduce its cheaper tier with commercial interruptions by the end of the year the move will presumably boost subscriptions and the ads will generate revenue as well there was a period not that long ago when a netflix subscription was one of the best deals in entertainment for a couple bucks a month you got access to an enormous and varied library of movies and shows all available instantly but in the last few years netflix s library has shrunk and a lot of their more recent originals are just not on par with the content they lost plus their subscription prices have continued to rise their standard plan now costs a whopping 15 49 a month that s still cheaper than most cable packages but when you factor in how often you use the service and how many families feel the need to supplement it with other services like hulu or disney or hbo max you start to see why they might have lost a few subscribers recently a cheaper tier with some ads will likely attract some lapsed customers back and if you don t want the ads you can continue to pay more to watch without them but beware according to the times netflix is also planning to crack down on password sharing by the end of the year as well so if you re freeloading off your parents netflix account those days might be numbered netflix s most popular tv shows ever these are the most popular tv shows ever on netflix based on hours viewed in their first 28 days on streaming

cvent holdings corp an events and hospitality software giant in tysons had worked to manage expectations for this first quarter lowering its quarterly revenue estimates earlier this year based on anticipated reduced demand because of the effects of the omicron variant ultimately the company beat that lowered forecast but its revenue still grew slower than originally hoped in the first quarter of 2022 it also saw higher year over year losses for the quarter missing analyst expectations that the company would swing into the black but none of that has knocked aggarwal s confidence when it comes to the long term we see it and hear it every day and we believe that pent up demand for face to face interactions will continue to be a tailwind for our business throughout the rest of the year ceo and founder reggie aggarwal said during cvent s earnings call monday now we believe this pent up demand will help offset macroeconomic pressures that might otherwise dampen a return to in person and hybrid events but one thing the pandemic has taught him he said on the call is to be prepared for any scenario the reason that we re confident in the future is just simple aggarwal said we have gone through some tough times things are coming back to our strength people are feeling more comfortable with all three methodologies or all three formats and we can service all of them he added referring to virtual in person and hybrid events to further drive demand cvent nasdaq cvt introduced a new event marketplace in april through which clients can shop with other vendors whose software is integrated with cvent s including the likes of salesforce google analytics adobe marketo uber for business american express and sap concur the platform aims to streamline the in person event planning and data collection processes the company said though aggarwal cautioned that it will take time to build it s in a beta stage of sorts he said generating some ad revenue before the company can shift to a fees based system we do not expect any material revenue in 2022 from this it takes a while aggarwal told analysts monday for the first quarter revenue totaled 137 4 million up 17 from 117 3 million during the same quarter a year prior cvent also saw 17 year over year growth in first quarter revenue for both its hospitality cloud division which serves hotels and venues to 42 4 million and its event cloud division which serves marketers and meeting planners to 95 million the latter was driven by more in person events and continued virtual events per its securities and exchange commission filings that higher revenue didn t stem the company s net loss from growing however it nearly doubled to 31 3 million this quarter compared with a 16 6 million loss in the first quarter of 2021 cvent said that was driven by an increase in total operating expenses from 80 3 million during the first quarter of 2021 to 108 6 million in the first quarter of 2022 in particular the company saw expenses rise for marketing research and development and general and administrative categories the latter of which cfo billy newman attributed on the call to the costs of being a public company increased headcount and higher average compensation for employees due to wage inflation cvent ended the quarter with 188 1 million in cash and equivalents compared with 126 5 million at the end of last year the company saw its stock price shed more than 16 of its value tuesday the first day of trading after the earnings were disclosed resulting in a closing price of 4 49 per share its lowest since cvent went public last year
here are the reasons behind the shortage and what the fda plans to do about it example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington parents across the u s are scrambling to find baby formula because supply disruptions and a massive safety recall have swept many leading brands off store shelves months of spot shortages at pharmacies and supermarkets have been exacerbated by the recall at abbott which was forced to shutter its largest u s formula manufacturing plant in february due to contamination concerns on monday white house press secretary jenn psaki said the food and drug administration was working around the clock to address any possible shortages on tuesday the fda said it was working with u s manufacturers to increase their output and streamlining paperwork to allow more imports doctors warn against diy formula recipes for now pediatricians and health workers are urging parents who can t find formula to contact food banks or doctor s offices they warn against watering down formula to stretch supplies or using online diy recipes for babies who are not being breastfed this is the only thing they eat said dr steven abrams of the university of texas austin so it has to have all of their nutrition and furthermore it needs to be properly prepared so that it s safe for the smallest infants laura stewart a 52 year old mother of three who lives just north of springfield missouri has been struggling for several weeks to find formula for her 10 month old daughter riley riley normally gets a brand of abbott s similac designed for children with sensitive stomachs last month she instead used four different brands she spits up more she s just more cranky she is typically a very happy girl stewart said when she has the right formula she doesn t spit up she s perfectly fine a small can costs 17 to 18 and lasts three to five days stewart said like many americans stewart relies on wic a federal program similar to food stamps that serves mothers and children to afford formula for her daughter abbott s recall wiped out many wic covered brands though the program is now allowing substitutions how widespread is the shortage trying to keep formula in stock retailers including cvs and walgreens have begun limiting purchases to three containers per customer nationwide about 40 of large retail stores are out of stock up from 31 in mid april according to datasembly a data analytics firm more than half of u s states are seeing out of stock rates between 40 and 50 according to the firm which collects data from 11 000 locations what caused the shortage baby formula is particularly vulnerable to disruptions because just a handful of companies account for almost the entire u s supply industry executives say the constraints began last year as the covid 19 pandemic led to disruptions in ingredients labor and transportation supplies were further squeezed by parents stockpiling during lockdowns then in february abbott recalled several major brands and shut down its sturgis michigan factory when federal officials concluded four babies suffered bacterial infections after consuming formula from the facility two of the infants died when fda inspectors visited the plant in march they found lax safety protocols and traces of the bacteria on several surfaces none of the bacterial strains matched those collected from the infants however and the fda hasn t offered an explanation for how the contamination occurred for its part abbott says its formula is not likely the source of infection though the fda says its investigation continues chicago based abbott said it is increasing production at its other facilities to fill the gap including air shipping formula from a plant in ireland what about specialty formulas the shortages are especially dangerous for infants who require specialty formulas due to food allergies digestive problems and other conditions unfortunately many of those very specialized formulas are only made in the united states at the factory that had the recall and that s caused a huge problem for a relatively small number of infants abrams said after hearing concerns from parents the fda said last month that abbott could begin releasing some specialty formulas not affected by the recalls on a case by case basis the company is providing them free of charge in coordination with physicians and hospitals food safety advocates say the fda made the right call in releasing the formula but that parents should talk to their pediatricians before using it there s still some risk from the formula because we know there are problems at the plant and fda hasn t identified a root cause said sarah sorscher of the center for science in the public interest but it s worth releasing because these infants might die without it what s next it s unclear when the abbott plant might reopen the fda said the company is still working to rectify findings related to the processes procedures and conditions other infant formula makers are meeting or exceeding capacity levels to meet current demand the agency said among other steps the fda said it was waiving enforcement of minor product labeling issues to increase availability of both u s and imported products ___

exchange and anticipated costs associated with the dissolution of the company as it relates to foreign currency exposure in march 2022 the company entered into a forward exchange contract to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in the nzd to usd exchange rate for a portion of the proceeds we expect to receive from the 2degrees sale the foreign exchange contract secures a new zealand dollar foreign exchange rate based on a sliding scale which includes rates of 0 6688 at may 31 2022 and 0 6677 at the june 30 2022 long stop date for 450 million 674 million nzd which approximates the amount of the usd denominated debt related obligations of tisp that will be repaid upon closing of the 2degrees sale the remaining unhedged portion including the previously disclosed initial estimated distribution amount of approximately 125 million along with the proposed retained amount of approximately 35 million which a substantial portion is designated for wind up and specific corporate purposes were based on a foreign currency rate of 0 67 and continues to be subject to foreign currency fluctuations in light of the recent nzd to usd exchange rate movement to approximately 0 63 net cash proceeds to be

both 2degrees and nuevatel have been affected by the covid 19 pandemic the impact to date has varied with differing effects on financial and business results in new zealand and bolivia given the ongoing and changing developments related to the pandemic the full extent of future effects on the company s businesses and financial results cannot be reliably estimated the consequences of covid 19 and related societal restrictions have been more pronounced in bolivia and the impact of the pandemic on the financial results of nuevatel has been more significant than in new zealand over the course of 2020 and 2021 and continuing into the first quarter of 2022 nuevatel experienced a reduction in key financial metrics including revenues segment adjusted ebitda and subscribers as a result of societal and movement restrictions and their continuing effects which significantly affected customer behavior additionally societal and movement restrictions in effect in bolivia during the pandemic resulted in economic uncertainty and it is unclear when customer behavior in bolivia will return to historic norms creating a risk of a continuing adverse impact on the timing and amount of cash collections bad debt expense and revenue trends nuevatel has maintained adequate cash liquidity to date in part due to cash management efforts since the onset of the covid 19 pandemic resulting in 13 8 million of cash cash equivalents and restricted cash at nuevatel as of march 31 2022 as an additional measure to preserve liquidity and support the ability to generate future cash flows nuevatel implemented workforce reductions in the fourth quarter of 2020 although these initiatives have tempered the impact to date the prolonged effect of the covid 19 pandemic has resulted in increased liquidity and cash challenges for nuevatel regarding its ability to meet its financial obligations as they become due specifically forecasted cash resources may not be sufficient to fund certain obligations of nuevatel due in the second quarter of 2022 management continues to seek solutions that will address the issues associated with meeting these obligations these actions are currently underway and include arranging extended payment terms with suppliers further controlling costs and further limiting capital expenditures if these steps prove to be insufficient or the previously

million or 9 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange cost of service increased 5 2 million or 16 primarily due to an increase in transmission expense associated with the growth in fixed

nature this 0 8 million of costs incurred during the quarter were removed from segment adjusted ebitda for additional information see note 2 assets held for sale to the condensed consolidated

compared to the same period in 2021 excluding the impact of foreign currency depreciation amortization and accretion declined 9 0 million or 33 due to a decline in both bolivia and new zealand the decline in bolivia was primarily due to a lower asset base being depreciated during the three months ended march 31 2022 as a result of the impairment charge recognized in the third quarter of 2021 the decline in new zealand was primarily due to the fact that the 2degrees business met the accounting criteria to be classified as held for sale as of march 15 2022 and accordingly recording

portion of the proceeds we expect to receive from the 2degrees sale see note 9 derivative financial instruments to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information managing our

was held by nuevatel and 4 0 million was held at headquarters and others cash cash equivalents and restricted cash as of march 31 2022 increased 0 8 million since december 31 2021 primarily driven by

equipment the company and its operating subsidiaries 2degrees and nuevatel continue to actively monitor the impact of the covid 19 pandemic on the economies of new zealand and bolivia the self isolation and movement restrictions implemented in these countries especially in bolivia continue to affect customer behavior nuevatel has maintained adequate cash liquidity to date in part due to cash management efforts since the onset of the covid 19 pandemic resulting in 13 8 million of cash cash equivalents and restricted cash at nuevatel as of march 31 2022 as an additional measure to preserve liquidity and support the ability to generate future cash flows nuevatel implemented workforce reductions in the fourth quarter of 2020 although these initiatives have tempered the impact to

the end of the second quarter of 2022 on march 15 2022 the 2degrees sale was approved by special resolution in a meeting of our shareholders subsequently all required regulatory approvals were obtained the 2degrees sale is targeted to close by the end of may 2022 and the closing is subject to the receipt of certain third party consents as well as other customary conditions all of which are expected to be satisfied by the end of may 2022 the closing of the nuevatel transaction is subject to bolivian regulatory approval unless such condition is waived by balesia as well as other customary closing conditions the company currently anticipates that regulatory approval and satisfaction of the closing conditions will be obtained and satisfied and that the closing of the nuevatel transaction will occur in the second quarter of 2022 the company will continue to monitor the progress of the closing of the nuevatel transaction and nuevatel s liquidity concerns over future periods there is no certainty that the nuevatel transaction will close or that nuevatel s liquidity concerns will be resolved due to liquidity issues as discussed above nuevatel has taken a number of actions to conserve cash several of these actions could increase nuevatel s exposure to regulatory enforcement actions or claims by contractual counterparties should it be in default in meeting its obligations under relevant lease service and supply agreements specifically nuevatel was obligated to prepay an annual spectrum usage fee of approximately 9 5 million to the att in january 2022 in the first quarter of 2022 nuevatel paid 25 of the amount due advising the att that it would pay the balance in monthly installments over the course of 2022 the att objected to the prorated payment and assessed a 6 interest and a 10 penalty with respect to late payment of the spectrum fee however the att did not indicate that it would bring any enforcement action against nuevatel with respect to delinquent payments in 2022 nuevatel is also obligated to deploy 4g lte services by october 2022 in numerous municipalities where it does not yet have network infrastructure although these commitments have been met to date nuevatel anticipates that it will be delinquent in meeting this obligation in the future and as a result could be fined approximately 0 2 million by the att the att also has the authority to institute license revocation proceedings in connection with a failure to comply with a warning and deadline notification to initiate lte service in those municipalities nuevatel has received no indication regarding the likelihood that the att would pursue a license revocation additionally since november 2021 nuevatel has deferred payments due under other contracts with various suppliers and vendors to date none of the counterparties to these contracts has asserted that nuevatel is in breach of its payment obligations finally should nuevatel need to reduce staff in order to manage ongoing operating expenses it will be required to pay certain retirement severance and accrued leave benefits to employees who are terminated nuevatel has reserved funds to cover these costs in the event that such termination liabilities are incurred nuevatel bond debt in the aggregate outstanding principal amount of 20 1 million the bolivian bond debt as of march 31 2022 is subject to certain financial covenants including a debt service ratio as of march 31 2022 nuevatel was not in compliance with the debt service ratio covenant contained in the bolivian bond debt the debt service ratio covenant is calculated under local accounting standards assessing the trailing twelve month results as of the quarterly measurement date with march 31 2022 being the first of such measurement dates nuevatel has a 90 day grace period in which to remedy the breach or seek a waiver from the bondholders if nuevatel is not able to remedy the breach or obtain a waiver the bondholders have the right to assemble following the 90 day grace period to determine the course of action regarding nuevatel s future obligations under such debt the bolivian bond debt has been presented as a current obligation as of march 31 2022 since a covenant waiver has not been received from the bondholders none of tip inc or its subsidiaries other than nuevatel have any obligations under such debt which is secured by certain sources of nuevatel cash flows in march 2022 the company entered into a forward exchange contract to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in the nzd to usd exchange rate for a portion of the proceeds we expect to receive from the 2degrees sale the forward exchange contract has a notional amount equal to 450 million which approximates the amount of the usd denominated debt related obligations of tisp that will be paid upon closing and a maturity date of june 30 2022 the foreign exchange rate was priced inclusive of a deal contingent feature such that if the 2degrees sale does not close the hedge contract will expire and terminate in order to fund its operations pending the closing of the 2degrees sale the company entered into short term loan agreements in january 2022 with three of its principal shareholders totaling up to 10 million in commitments the bridge loans the bridge loans are unsecured and accrue interest at the rate of 13 5 per annum payable on may 16 2022 november 15 2022 and the maturity date provided that the company may elect not to pay interest on any of such dates prior to the maturity date in which case all accrued but unpaid interest will be added to the outstanding principal amount of the bridge loans the bridge loans mature on the earlier of may 15 2023 or the date of a change of control of the company the closing of the sale of 2degrees to voyage digital would constitute a change of control as defined under the terms of the bridge loans in the first quarter of 2022 10 0 million was received by the company under the terms of the bridge loans 2degrees has a bank loan facility the new zealand 2023 senior facilities agreement with a total outstanding balance of 285 million nzd 197 9 million based on the exchange rate at march 31 2022 the new zealand 2023 senior facilities agreement is scheduled to mature in february 2023 unless it is refinanced or its maturity date is extended and the outstanding balance of 197 9 million is presented as a current obligation as of march 31 2022 in the condensed consolidated balance sheets in the absence of an extension of the maturity date of this obligation and as long as the company continues to hold an ownership interest in 2degrees the significant amounts due under the new zealand 2023 senior facilities agreement relative to the company s available liquid assets would raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern and to satisfy this obligation within one year from the date on which this press release is issued however as further discussed in note 2 assets held for sale to the condensed consolidated financial statements in march 2022 our shareholders approved a definitive agreement to sell the company s equity interest in 2degrees to a third party acquiror upon the closing of the 2degrees sale the company and its retained consolidated subsidiaries would no longer have any obligation related to the new zealand 2023 senior facilities agreement while the transaction is subject to the receipt of certain third party consents as well as other customary conditions the required regulatory approvals have been received and management s plans to complete the 2degrees sale are considered probable to be completed based on the stage and status of the sale process as of the date of issuance of this press release and accordingly alleviates the substantial doubt regarding the company s ability to continue as a going concern operating investing and financing activities three months ended march 31 us dollars in

related to the sales of eip receivables investing activities cash flow used in investing activities increased by 11 1 million for the three months ended march 31 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 due to a 15 1 million increase in capital expenditures and 3 0 million of maturities and sales of short term investments in 2021 with no maturities in the current year partially offset by the license renewal fees of 6 2 million paid in respect of 2degrees 1800 and 2100 mhz spectrum holdings in the first quarter of 2021 with no comparable activity in the current quarter financing activities cash flow provided by financing activities declined by 5 2 million for the three months ended march 31 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 this change was primarily due to a 14 5 million reduction in proceeds from the eip receivables financing obligation partially offset by 10 0 million of proceeds from the bridge loans in the first quarter of 2022 for additional information regarding

washington parents across the u s are scrambling to find baby formula because supply disruptions and a massive safety recall have swept many leading brands off store shelves months of spot shortages at pharmacies and supermarkets have been exacerbated by the recall at abbott which was forced to shutter its largest u s formula manufacturing plant in february due to contamination concerns on monday white house press secretary jen psaki said the food and drug administration was working around the clock to address any possible shortages on tuesday the fda said it was working with u s manufacturers to increase their output and streamlining paperwork to allow more imports for now pediatricians and health workers are urging parents who can t find formula to contact food banks or doctor s offices they warn against watering down formula to stretch supplies or using online diy recipes for babies who are not being breastfed this is the only thing they eat said dr steven abrams of the university of texas austin so it has to have all of their nutrition and furthermore it needs to be properly prepared so that it s safe for the smallest infants laura stewart a mother of three who lives just north of springfield missouri has been struggling for several weeks to find formula for her 10 month old daughter riley riley normally gets a brand of abbott s similac designed for children with sensitive stomachs last month she instead used four different brands she spits up more she s just more cranky she is typically a very happy girl stewart said when she has the right formula she doesn t spit up she s perfectly fine a small can costs 17 to 18 and lasts three to five days stewart said like many americans stewart relies on wic a federal program similar to food stamps that serves mothers and children to afford formula for her daughter abbott s recall wiped out many wic covered brands though the program is now allowing substitutions trying to keep formula in stock retailers including cvs and walgreens have begun limiting purchases to three containers per customer nationwide about 40 of large retail stores are out of stock up from 31 in mid april according to datasembly a data analytics firm more than half of u s states are seeing out of stock rates between 40 and 50 according to the firm which collects data from 11 000 locations baby formula is particularly vulnerable to disruptions because just a handful of companies account for almost the entire u s supply industry executives say the constraints began last year as the covid 19 pandemic led to disruptions in ingredients labor and transportation supplies were further squeezed by parents stockpiling during lockdowns then in february abbott recalled several major brands and shut down its sturgis michigan factory when federal officials concluded four babies suffered bacterial infections after consuming formula from the facility two of the infants died when fda inspectors visited the plant in march they found lax safety protocols and traces of bacteria on several surfaces none of the bacterial strains matched those collected from the infants however and the fda hasn t offered an explanation for how the contamination occurred for its part abbott says its formula is not likely the source of infection though the fda says its investigation continues chicago based abbott said it is increasing production at its other facilities to fill the gap including air shipping formula from a plant in ireland the shortages are especially dangerous for infants who require specialty formulas due to food allergies digestive problems and other conditions unfortunately many of those very specialized formulas are only made in the united states at the factory that had the recall and that s caused a huge problem for a relatively small number of infants abrams said after hearing concerns from parents the fda said last month that abbott could begin releasing some specialty formulas not affected by the recalls on a case by case basis the company is providing them free of charge in coordination with physicians and hospitals food safety advocates say the fda made the right call in releasing the formula but that parents should talk to their pediatricians before using it there s still some risk from the formula because we know there are problems at the plant and fda hasn t identified a root cause said sarah sorscher of the center for science in the public interest but it s worth releasing because these infants might die without it it s unclear when the abbott plant might reopen the fda said the company is still working to rectify findings related to the processes procedures and conditions other infant formula makers are meeting or exceeding capacity levels to meet current demand the agency said among other steps the fda said it was waiving enforcement of minor product labeling issues to increase availability of both u s and imported products
tiger global is having a year according to a new report from financial times the low flying yet seemingly ubiquitous 21 year old outfit has seen losses of about 17 billion during this year s tech stock sell off ft notes that s one of the biggest dollar declines for a hedge fund in history as shocking per ft according to the calculations of a fund of hedge funds run by the edmond de rothschild group tiger global s hedge fund assets have been so hard hit that the outfit has in four months erased about two thirds of its gains since its launch in 2001 ouch the question is whether that trouncing will impact the firm s venture business which like that of many other venture businesses has ballooned rapidly in recent years in 2020 the firm closed its twelfth venture fund with 3 75 billion in capital commitments early last year it closed its thirteenth venture fund titled xiv for superstitious reasons with 6 65 billion before closing its newest fund fund xv with a massive 12 7 billion in capital commitments in march of this year yet even that new fund which reportedly took less than six months to raise and includes 1 5 billion in commitments from tiger global s own employees is almost fully invested already according to a source close to the firm on the one hand it s not entirely astonishing to anyone paying attention that tiger global has put so much money to work already it added 118 unicorn companies to its list of portfolio companies last year according to crunchbase news and it continued to outpace every other investor in the first quarter of this year those rounds at least until earlier this year were not small in december tiger global led a 1 8 billion series b investment into the nuclear fusion startup commonwealth fusion systems it november it led a 600 million series d round for the electric vehicle company nuro the 78 deals it led in the first quarter of this year including a 768 million series e round for getir the istanbul based on demand delivery service a 530 million series d round for the paris based online bank qonto and a 273 million series c round for french wholesale marketplace ankorstore wound up in companies that collectively raised 7 6 billion crunchbase news reported last month still 12 7 billion is a lot of money and it s not even june it s not even mid may the question begged naturally is how much money tiger global can collect for its next fund and by when in all likelihood the firm which declined to comment has soft commitments in place already based on its recent performance according to a letter to investors obtained by techcrunch the firm s private portfolio funds as of the end of the first quarter of this year had generated a 25 net irr since inception in 2003 in the first quarter this year wrote the firm remaining value in the funds decreased by 9 following an increase of 54 in 2021 presumably that value has sunk further in q2 as valuations begin to drop broadly across the startup ecosystem according to that same investor letter tiger global boasts of stakes in 38 companies that went public last year including coinbase freshworks sentinelone and toast and says it distributed 3 7 billion to investors last year either way there could hardly be a worse time to be raising another enormous venture fund almost every institutional investor in the world has seen its stock portfolio hammered and it isn t like venture firms set aside money inside a giant piggy bank they call down committed capital from their investors as they need it that process allows vcs to begin the clock on each investment as soon as a check is written but it also subjects them to extreme market volatility when public shares start to nosedive as now university endowments pension funds and other institutional investors grow loath to fulfill their capital obligations because it means having to sell public company shares that are underwater these same institutions also typically pull back from their new fund commitments because as their public market portfolios shrink they become overweighted by their private market allocations most have targets they re supposed to meet to ensure that they re sufficiently diversified current trends will begin impacting everyone if the market doesn t bounce back but with tiger global s performance so dramatically changed from even four months ago the terrain could prove especially tricky for its team it certainly has a weaker case to make according to ft hedge fund investors who invested at tiger global s 2001 launch have made more than 20 times their initial investment despite its massive new losses but that s just twice the return they would have received by investing in the s p 500 over the same 21 year period and that s not taking into account tiger global s management fees meanwhile tiger global s venture bets could go sideways along with many other firms investments if the market for exits doesn t improve tiger global apparently saw what was coming its team which works as one unit to make both hedge fund and venture bets had already all but abandoned late stage venture deals by early february as the information reported that same month venture capitalist keith rabois whose firm founders fund sometimes competes with hedge funds told the information at the time that some pullback from those giant rounds was inevitable given the plummeting share price of publicly traded tech companies if you have a high burn rate and have raised money at high prices you re going to run into a brick wall very fast he d said of late stage startups there s no free money anymore it s easy to wonder if tiger global s own strategy shift to earlier stage startups has come too late and there are no fast answers on this front unlike with its hedge fund business tiger global has the luxury of some time before its more recent venture bets can be judged the firm has historically enjoyed some big venture wins including bets on facebook linkedin airbnb and peloton in the meantime tiger global which prides itself on its due diligence may be celebrating a separate apparent win right now it passed on the one click checkout company bolt which is currently being sued by its biggest customer for having utterly failed to deliver on the technological capabilities that it held itself out as possessing says the customer as bad bolt s former employees say it had a tendency to overstate its metrics as the new york times wrote today in a piece about bolt after tiger global executives met with the company they weren t convinced the merchants to which bolt pointed them would use bolt beyond a trial and they deemed bolt s revenue projections overly bullish while a lot of heavy hitting firms proceeded to fund bolt including general atlantic westcap and untitled investments a firm founded by a former tiger global investor who left the outfit in 2017 tiger global passed on the deal

staging a counteroffensive foreign minister dmytro kuleba seemed to indicate that the country could go beyond merely pushing russia back to areas it or its allies held on the day of the feb 24 invasion the idea reflected ukraine s ability to stymie a larger better armed russian military which has surprised many who had anticipated a much quicker end to the conflict one of the most dramatic examples of ukraine s ability to prevent easy victories is in mariupol where ukrainian fighters remained holed up at a steel plant denying russia s full control of the city the regiment defending the plant said russian warplanes continued bombarding it striking 34 times in 24 hours in recent days the united nations and the red cross organized a rescue of what some officials said were the last civilians trapped at the plant but two officials said tuesday that about 100 were believed to still be in the complex s underground tunnels donetsk regional gov pavlo kyrylenko said those who remain are people that the russians have not selected for evacuation kyrylenko and petro andryushchenko an adviser to mariupol s mayor did not say how they knew civilians were still in the complex a warren of tunnels and bunkers spread over 11 square kilometers 4 square miles others said their statements were impossible to confirm fighters with the azov regiment released photos of their wounded comrades inside the plant including some with amputated limbs they said the wounded were living in unsanitary conditions with open wounds bandaged with non sterile remnants of bandages without the necessary medication and even food in its statement on telegram the regiment appealed to the u n and red cross to evacuate the wounded servicemen to ukrainian controlled territories the photos could not be independently verified in another example of the grisly toll of the war ukrainian officials said they found the bodies of 44 civilians in the rubble of a building destroyed weeks ago in the northeastern city of izyum new u n figures meanwhile said that 14 million ukrainians were forced from their homes by the end of april including more than 5 9 million who have left the country in washington a top u s intelligence official testified tuesday that eight to 10 russian generals have been killed in the war lt gen scott berrier who leads the defense intelligence agency told a senate committee that because russia lacks a noncommissioned officer corps its generals have to go into combat zones and end up in dangerous positions ukraine said tuesday that russian forces fired seven missiles at odesa a day earlier hitting a shopping center and a warehouse in the country s largest port one person was killed and five wounded the military said images showed a burning building and debris including a tennis shoe in a heap of destruction in the city on the black sea mayor gennady trukhanov later visited the warehouse and said it had nothing in common with military infrastructure or military objects ukraine alleged at least some of the munitions used dated to the soviet era making them unreliable in targeting ukrainian british and u s officials say russia is rapidly using up its stock of precision weapons raising the risk of more imprecise rockets being used as the conflict grinds on since president vladimir putin s forces failed to take kyiv early in the war his focus has shifted to the eastern industrial heartland of the donbas but one general has suggested moscow s aims also include cutting ukraine s maritime access to both the black and azov seas that would also give it a swath of territory linking russia to both the crimean peninsula which it seized in 2014 and transnistria a pro moscow region of moldova even if russia falls short of severing ukraine from the coast and it appears to lack the forces to do so the continuing missile strikes on odesa reflect the city s strategic importance the russian military has repeatedly targeted its airport and claimed it destroyed several batches of western weapons odesa is also a major gateway for grain shipments and its blockade by russia already threatens global food supplies beyond that the city is a cultural jewel dear to ukrainians and russians alike and targeting it carries symbolic significance russian forces have made slow advances in the donbas but there have been multiple setbacks military analysts suggest that hitting odesa might serve to stoke concern about southwestern ukraine thus forcing kyiv to put more forces there that would pull them away from the eastern front as ukraine s military stages counteroffensives near the northeastern city of kharkiv kharkiv and the surrounding area has been under sustained russian attack since the early in the war in recent weeks grisly pictures testified to the horrors of those battles with charred and mangled bodies strewn in one street russian aircraft twice launched unguided missiles tuesday at the sumy area northeast of kharkiv according to the ukrainian border guard service the region s governor said the missiles hit several residential buildings but no one was killed the chernihiv region along the ukrainian border with belarus was hit by mortars fired from russian territory there was no word on casualties but ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy said tuesday that the military was gradually pushing russian troops away from kharkiv the ukrainian military s general staff said its forces drove the russians out of four villages to the northeast of kharkiv as it tries to push them back toward the russian border kuleba the ukrainian foreign minister meanwhile appeared to voice increasing confidence and expanded goals amid russia s stalled offensive he told the financial times that ukraine initially believed victory would be the withdrawal of russian troops to positions they occupied before the feb 24 invasion now if we are strong enough on the military front and we win the battle for donbas which will be crucial for the following dynamics of the war of course the victory for us in this war will be the liberation of the rest of our territories the comments seemed to reflect political ambitions more than battlefield realities many analysts acknowledge that although russia isn t capable of making quick gains the ukrainian military isn t strong enough to drive the russians back zelenskyy used his nightly address to pay tribute to leonid kravchuk the first president of an independent ukraine who died tuesday at 88 zelenskyy said kravchuk showed courage and knew how to get the country to listen to him that was particularly important in crisis moments when the future of the whole country may depend on the courage of one man said zelenskyy whose own communication skills and decision to remain in kyiv when it came under russian attack have helped make him a strong wartime leader in the u s president joe biden signed a bipartisan measure monday to reboot the world war ii era lend lease program which helped defeat nazi germany to bolster kyiv and its allies on tuesday the u s house approved a new 40 billion ukraine aid package for defense and humanitarian programs in ukraine ___

you christina and good morning everyone let s begin today on slide 3 i m pleased to report that telos is off to a sound start for 2022 mark will discuss our financial performance later on this call but at a high level we delivered 50 2 million of revenue in the first quarter above the high end of our guidance range security solutions grew 18 year over year while secure networks was down 29 as expected due to a large program that is coming to a successful completion this year both segments perform slightly better than our first quarter guidance gross margin was also slightly above our guidance range at 37 6 due to margin outperformance in both businesses finally we delivered 1 million in adjusted ebitda above the midpoint of our guidance range and a modest 0 01 adjusted eps loss now let s turn to slide 4 to discuss our recent business highlights and updates this quarter we announced a new product offering that telos advanced cyber analytics solution or telos aca we believe this solution offers unique capabilities and will address critical unmet needs within today s cybersecurity environment more specifically with telos aca customers can in near real time detect malicious activity uncover and identify previously unknown attacks and new malicious behavior enhance network protections and over the near term attribute and geolocate malicious cyber activities and assist in the attribution of events of concern with actionable information we are offering telos aca as a service with sophisticated capabilities and comprehensive analytics with minimal financial and technical barriers to adoption we are very excited about this new offering which we believe will create value for our customers and shareholders alike beyond the telos aca launch we have continued to maintain momentum with key wins and renewals for xacta sales and services including ernst young amazon web services the national security agency as well as the new foreign government customer we continue to focus on the government and commercial space and in particular prioritizing regulated industries within our channel partner program recent developments in the first quarter include the establishment of a partnership with carahsoft to further expand the reach of all of telos security solutions the secure communications business continues to perform at a high level of quality and customer satisfaction achieving a 100 renewal rate for our automated message handling system secure networks is having success with new contract wins including a recent award with the united states air force academy to upgrade and expand their network infrastructure now let me turn to some comments on the industry landscape and the number of recent initiatives in washington d c that present opportunities for telos the biden administration has now submitted its proposed fy 2023 budget to congress which calls for a nearly 11 increase in non defense cybersecurity funding next year much of this is to help agencies meet the priorities outlined in last year s cyber security executive order as noted on our previous earnings call last year s cybersecurity executive order directed federal agencies to accelerate migration to the cloud and make greater use of zero trust architecture both of which are complemented by telos solutions the president s budget specifically emphasizes this continued push for zero trust as well as boosting supply chain security the proposed budget also calls for roughly a 4 increase in defense spending although the department of defense notes this did not include funding to help ukraine or to address the potential russia ukraine war impacts here at home nor dod acknowledged did the proposed budget fully account for the impacts of inflation in recognition of these items most observers anticipate that congress will significantly boost defense spending in real dollar terms well above the levels proposed in the president s budget the russia ukraine war has resulted in increasingly elevated warnings of potential cyberattacks against u s interests including against u s critical infrastructure this continues to highlight the need for the public and private sectors to adopt cybersecurity best practices and ensure their cybersecurity posture is ready and able to meet these new and evolving threats i will now turn the call over to mark bendza who will discuss first quarter 2022 financial results and our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2022 mark mark bendza chief financial officer thank you john and thank you everyone for joining us today let s turn to slide 5 as john mentioned we re off to a sound start to the year with results that met or exceeded our guidance for the first quarter we reported sales and gross margin above the high end of our guidance range over 1 100 basis points of gross margin expansion a 30 increase in gross profit and adjusted ebitda above the midpoint of our guidance range we also delivered a 6 4 million increase in free cash flow turning free cash flow positive for the trailing 12 months period now let s get into a bit more detail starting with sales total sales were 50 2 million security solutions contributed 26 9 million or 54 of total sales and secured networks contributed 23 2 million or 46 of total sales the 54 contribution from security solutions compares favorably to the 41 contribution for the comparable quarter last year when a large order from a secure networks customer pulled forward from the second quarter to the first quarter of 2021 year over year total sales contracted 10 as expected due to the previously mentioned pull forward of the large order last year as well as the ongoing wind down of that same program this year excluding that program total sales grew 19 including 18 growth within security solutions and 20 growth within secured networks turning to profitability and cash flow first quarter gross profit increased to 30 as a result of more than 1 100 basis points of gross margin expansion the gross margin expansion was driven by a more favorable sales mix between security solutions and secured networks as well as gross margin expansion within both reporting segments security solutions gross margin expanded over 1 500 basis points to 55 9 and secured networks gross margin expanded over 80 basis points to 16 4 as a side note much of this gross margin expansion will reverse in the second quarter as expected but net net we expect to deliver gross margin expansion for the first half of the year overall adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps declined slightly due to the ramp in investments in r d and sg a over the course of 2021 free cash flow improved by 6 4 million turning free cash flow positive for the trailing 12 months period the improvement in free cash flow was the result of more favorable working capital dynamics compared to the same period last year let s turn to slide 6 to recap on our gross margin expansion and free cash flow trajectory over the past several quarters since our ipo we have made steady and significant progress on gross margin expansion and free cash flow generation on a trailing 12 month basis gross margins and free cash flows have improved every quarter for the past four quarters gross margins expanded 530 basis points between the trailing 12 month period ending march 31st 2021 and the equivalent period ending march 31st 2022 due to gross margin expansion within both security solutions as well as secured networks similarly free cash flows improved by 19 6 million as a result of improved profitability and working capital dynamics i expect these metrics to have short term ups and downs over time but the overall upward trajectory illustrates our focus on balancing investments in our future with margin and cash flow performance today in particular our positive free cash flow for the trailing 12 months is an important milestone as we become a consistent free cash flow generator over time we will consider various options to deploy our capital that remain consistent with our strategy including a share repurchase program now let s turn to slide 7 to discuss our outlook for the second quarter for the second quarter we forecast sales in a range of 50 million to 54 million and adjusted ebitda of negative 2 million to positive 2 million we forecast security solutions revenues to be down low to high teens primarily due to the completion of the 2020 census program in 2021 lumpiness and perpetual license sales and lower revenues on a single program in secured communications we expect no tsa precheck revenues in the second quarter we expect secured network revenues to be up mid single digits to mid teens primarily due to lower revenues in the comparable period last year as a result of the previously mentioned pull forward of a large order into the first quarter from the second quarter of 2021 gross margin is expected to be down between seven percentage points and nine percentage points as expected primarily due to the year over year change in revenue mix between security solutions and secured networks in addition revenues within each of security solutions and especially secure networks will mix lower in the second quarter but overall for the first half of the year we expect gross margins to be higher year over year below the line expenses excluding stock compensation expense are expected to be approximately 3 5 million higher due to the ramp of sales marketing and g a investment during 2021 and lastly on slide 8 we re making no changes to our full year guidance so far the year is progressing as we expected when we originally set our full year guidance in march with that i ll pass it back to john who will wrap up on slide 9 john wood chief executive officer and chairman well thank you mark in summary we reported substantial gross margin expansion and gross profit growth in the first quarter we generated significant free cash flow improvement in the quarter and free cash flow turn positive for the trailing 12 month period we continue to develop our portfolio of new growth vectors including the launch of our telos advanced cyber analytics offering and we remain focused on striking the right balance between investing in our future and managing costs margins and cash flows today and with that we re happy to take questions mark bendza chief financial officer operator please open the line for q a and we ask the call participants to please be mindful of others in the queue by asking only one question thank you questions answers operator thank you our first question comes from the line of alex henderson with needham your line is open alex henderson needham and company analyst thanks i was hoping you could give us some granularity on the performance of xacta goes to amhs and idtrust with particular focus on xacta and ghost scaling it on growth rates and what s the impact has been of the sales hiring that you did last year as well as the resale opportunity and whether that s kicked in with the key cloud companies microsoft and amazon that s kind of all wrapped up into that same question mark griffin executive vice president of security solutions hello alex this is mark griffin i ll take your question a couple parts so we had expected or we had forecasted that the xacta end ghost sales would be starting to see results from the expansion of sales and marketing efforts in the second half of this year and so that is still tracking we did report that we received a foreign government award for xacta and that resulted in q2 so things are tracking right now based on the forecast that we presented as it relates to xacta end ghost in the second half of the year idtrust is progressing now with the confidential health program and our efforts within our defense manpower data center as well as other programs so right now the progress that we re making in the q1 and we re projecting in q2 are playing out as we expected in the timing of those alex henderson needham and company analyst could you just give us some sense of what the rate of growth is in those product areas that we have lost the baseline john wood chief executive officer and chairman yeah alex we re not giving granularity down to the level below our reporting segments security solutions was up 18 i d say that was primarily driven by our id business comms was a little secure communications which includes amhs and ghost was a lower year over year due to a single program that renewed at a slightly lower level last year so we ll see the impacts there and then on the ia side what i ll say is that software revenues were lower although orders were higher the reason for the difference is that the orders this year were more weighted to subscriptions than to perpetual licenses alex henderson needham and company analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of zach cummins with b riley securities your line is open zach cummins b riley financial analyst yeah good morning thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the solid results here just following up a little bit on alex s question just for the q2 guidance mark can you give some more insight into what are some of the moving parts and the impacts that we re seeing for security solutions to see this down kind of low to high teens i still believe is the guidance here in q2 mark bendza chief financial officer yeah so it s a couple of items i d say on the information assurance side where i d say we re flattish year over year secure comms will be lower year over year due to lower volume on that single program that i just mentioned to alex and then on the id side we did have although census ramped down significantly from 20 to 21 there was still census revenue running through 2021 is running at about 1 5 million or more a quarter and so when you look at that just on a quarterly basis and ascribe that only to security solutions you re going to see a year over year impact there so those were the main items so census overall for total company isn t that big of an impact but what would you start looking at it just for security solutions or in particular just for the id business year over year it s more meaningful zach cummins b riley financial analyst got it that s helpful thanks for taking my question mark bendza chief financial officer sure operator thank you our next question comes from the line of keith bachman with bmo your line is open brad clark bmo capital markets analyst hi this is brad clark on for keith thank you very much for taking my question just wanted to touch in on the tsa program seemingly still waiting for the authority to hop away but it seems like guidance for the programmer means the same from three months ago so i just wanted to check broadly if there is any sort of update that can be helpful for how we should be thinking about the puts and take of the program throughout the year and then even going forward and then another follow up is the johnson controls program for ghost in the second half of 2022 how should we be thinking about that still tracking and potential for maybe some appetite later in the year thank you mark griffin executive vice president of security solutions good morning this is mark griffin the yes we are still engaging daily with tsa and making progress toward an ato positive progress and achievement of these security protocols is happening and we look forward to becoming a tsa precheck provider our focus still is achievement of that this calendar year and so we are making progress on that we every day we meet with them we escalated our concerns up to the highest levels within tsa but every day we are making progress toward that and we are very excited about becoming a tsa precheck provider on the johnson controls we ve reached out obviously as a partner of them on the solution and that s the ghost solution within that program and we re confident based on their forecast and their executive leadership that ghost will become a mainstay in their product later in the second half of the year so we re still very positive that could be upside for the year based on that growth in that area so we look forward to seeing sales on that side as well brad clark bmo capital markets analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of nehal chokshi with northland capital markets your line is open nehal chokshi northland securities analyst yeah thank you just advanced cyber analytics program looks really interesting how long have you been building pipeline for this and how long how big do you think this can be over time say relative to xacta john wood chief executive officer and chairman hey nehal it s john wood so we started doing advanced cyber analytics in the government several years ago and we really fine tune it for the commercial market over the last nine months roughly i think what the use cases for advanced cyber analytics is pretty significant in that most times when people go in and try and figure out what happened it s after the fact what we re trying to do is we re trying to offer a service that s approximately 98 automated that provides near real time information as to anomalies on your network with a very small portion of being service based which means we re able to then take that anomalous data and then we re able to essentially put a fence around it and locate if you will the bad actor from where they actually are operating and so in this particular case the use cases can range from where we started was around things like terrorists and narcotics going after those kind of bad guys in this case it s going after bad guys that are involved in things like ransomware and other things so i think the market is quite significant for us the other thing i think is great about this particular offering is it s not hard for someone to sign up for it and it s basically an annual agreement with a monthly pricing based on the scale of service then the kind of an analysis that s required so we re very excited about it as it relates to the size compared to xacta i d say it s too early to say exactly right now nehal but in terms of the excitement in the marketplace i think its people are quite excited about it nehal chokshi northland securities analyst great thank you john wood chief executive officer and chairman you re welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of rudy kessinger with d a davidson your line is open rudy kessinger d a davidson analyst great thanks for taking my questions i guess following up a bit on that last question just can you give an update on where this commercial stand right now either as a percentage of revenue or the pipeline or growth rate and where do you see getting to over the next six to 12 months and then with 120 million in cash getting the positive free cash on trailing 12 month basis just how do you think going forward how do you prioritize between buybacks you mentioned that but buyback strategic m a reinvesting into the business for accelerated growth how do you kind of prioritize between those three john wood chief executive officer and chairman ok so first on the pipeline a great deal of our pipeline we feel is going to come through the channel going forward we do see direct sales opportunities obviously as a result of us selling as we have been selling all along but i think the vast majority of the growth from our point of view is going to come from large channel partners and so we in terms of percentages i m not sure i can provide that level of detail for you maybe i m going to turn over to mark a little bit here and think what he mark bendza chief financial officer i mean i d say on a revenue basis commercial is still very modest as we would ve expected at this point i d say on a pipeline basis it s more weighted to commercial on a pipeline basis than it is on a revenue basis john wood chief executive officer and chairman yeah agree and then i think the other thing rudy and the rest of the analysts on the call here just to remind you the vast majority of the commercial sales opportunity is going to be in the form of a saas model or a subscription model so you ll see a higher level of order but we ll be reflecting that revenue over a period of time versus the way we ve traditionally done it as a perpetual model in the government in the past where you take it up front with 20 of the licenses over or 20 of the maintenance over time i don t know if that answers that question rudy does it rudy kessinger d a davidson analyst yes it does john wood chief executive officer and chairman ok and this what i apologize what was the second part of your question again rudy kessinger d a davidson analyst yeah just capital allocation john wood chief executive officer and chairman buyback rudy kessinger d a davidson analyst how do you think about capital allocation john wood chief executive officer and chairman got it got it i m going to turn it over to mark to answer that for me mark bendza chief financial officer yeah rudy i d say in terms of prioritization first and foremost our priority is to invest in the business invest in our future and the growth of the company so that s our first priority for free cash flow generation going forward where i would like to get to is to a place where we are a consistent free cash flow generator so that we can start to at some point here put in place potentially a buyback program where we are consistently buying back stock and then i would say a third would be opportunistic m a and the reason why i put it third is that i think that will be a bit more opportunistic and episodic whereas on the buyback side again like to get to a place where we are consistently generating free cash flow and then can similarly consistently be buying back our stock especially at these prices rudy kessinger d a davidson analyst great thanks guys operator thank you there are no further questions in the queue i would now like to turn the call back over to mr john wood for closing remarks john wood chief executive officer and chairman thank you operator first and foremost i just want to thank our shareholders for your ongoing support in these markets we are progressing as expected despite all the turbulence out there and we remain focused on delivering for our customers and our shareholders in 2022 and beyond and so i just want to say thank you very much for your support and thank you for listening and i ll talk to you soon bye bye operator duration 32 minutes call participants christina mouzavires investor relations john wood chief executive

however there is a new area of concern that is causing indigestion among market participants political and corporate agendas content continues below advertisement on april 22 florida governor ron desantis signed a bill dissolving a handful of special taxing districts created prior to 1968 most notably the reedy creek improvement district reedy creek the move was significant since reedy creek allows the walt disney company to exert considerable governmental autonomy over the area within and around its nearly 25 000 acre theme park interestingly enough the legislation was introduced not to provide any sort of societal or economic benefit but to penalize disney for denouncing a controversial gender bill that was signed into law earlier this year while the ability of the special district legislation to withstand legal challenges remains uncertain questions still remain regarding the treatment of nearly 1 billion of municipal bonds issued by reedy creek state law dictates that outstanding bonds from a dissolved special district will be transferred to overlapping municipalities which in this case largely includes orange county fl however whether the county chooses to honor the bonds is unclear potentially creating a larger issue for the state and more importantly for investors more troubling is that this is not the first instance in which politics have collided with the municipal market in 2018 multiple large financial institutions began implementing policies that restricted business relationships with certain firearms manufacturers in response texas governor greg abbott along with the governors of several other states that derive a material amount of economic activity from the firearms industry signed laws that prohibited municipalities from having contractual relationships with companies that discriminate against the firearms industry the texas bill effectively prevented citi group the largest municipal underwriter in the state from doing business with local municipalities both actions caused concern in the capital markets with the former showing the power that major financial institutions can wield to effectively cut off financing to certain sectors of the market and the latter effectively reducing competition amongst municipal underwriters possibly resulting in increased borrowing costs for public finance issuers legislation and corporate actions fueled by political agendas that unnecessarily rile the capital markets represent a policy mistake in our opinion especially when the measures effectively restrict consumer choice investors can abstain from investing in securities that do not meet their investment criteria and issuers have the ability to work with whichever financial institution that they believe will help them best accomplish their objectives however corporate policies and legislation that instead make these choices for the end user generally do more harm than good in that they tend to limit competition push higher costs onto consumers and are typically met with retaliatory measures while it is nearly impossible to predict the next target of a political attack investors should be wary of municipalities with an overreliance on any one specific industry or company potentially leaving them in the crosshairs of political battle between corporate america and state legislatures we do not foresee any related issues with municipal sectors that rely on state appropriations for a significant portion of their funding including k 12 schools and public higher education institutions this is because education related funding cuts are typically politically unpalatable and generally are only utilized in the event of a state budget shortfall nevertheless we view these politically charged disruptions as one off events and municipal bonds remain an excellent option for investors looking for tax exempt income with very limited credit risk for more news information and strategy visit the

welcome to agenus first quarter 2022 financial results conference call my name is james and i ll be your operator for today s call and i d now like to turn the call over to ethan lovell chief external affairs and communications officer mr lovell you may begin ethan lovell chief external affairs and communications officer thank you james and thank you all for joining us today today s call is being webcast and will be available on our website for replay i d like to remind you that this call will contain forward looking statements including statements regarding our clinical development regulatory and commercial plans and timelines as well as timelines for data release and partnership opportunities these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and we refer you to our sec filings for more details on these risks joining me today on the call are dr garo armen chairman and chief executive officer dr steven o day chief medical officer dr dhan chand head of drug discovery christine klaskin vice president of finance and dr 10 stocks we like better than agenus when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and agenus wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of april 7 2022 jennifer buell chief executive officer of mink therapeutics now i d like to turn the call over to garo to highlight our progress and speak to our outlook for the remainder of the year garo garo armen chairman and chief executive officer thank you ethan and thank you all for being with us today as we all have witnessed the biotech sentiment is the most negative we ve seen in decades given the current climate i d like to begin today s call by indicating that we are aware of this reality and are putting on hold the old programs which are not critical for near term value generation while this and importantly we are marching ahead with programs which we believe have the prospects of generating significant near term value overall we expect these steps will result in significant cost reduction for the balance of this year ironically despite recent trends scientific and medical innovation is at an all time peak however it appears that irrational exuberance coupled with recent regulatory uncertainty i m mumbling my words here while even talking about regulatory uncertainty but particularly this is happening in the west of course has made it more difficult for investors to differentiate between the good the bad and the ugly still some companies will continue to innovate and achieve success several like us have already started restructuring their operations and curtailing their ambitions to adjust to current realities while this shifting environment has led to a discouraging financial requirement for biotech we believe companies like agenus with integrated capabilities and importantly platforms which can drive continuous innovation will emerge in the forefront a view we ll be able to build significant value while advancing profoundly effective treatments and cures at agenus we expected our portfolio of innovative discoveries and our steadfast commitment will trump old hurdles and deliver life changing medicines to patients while creating significant value for all stakeholders thus agenus strategy is to continue to drive innovation in today s shifting environment now i will outline our highest priority programs starting with botensilimab our most advanced fully owned program represents the highest potential in our portfolio our this is by the way based on the fact that the compound botensilimab is the most advanced in the clinic among the novel compounds that we have in our portfolio our expectations of botensilimab as a potential blockbuster io agent are supported with additional clinical data which we expect to present at an upcoming cancer conference botensilimab is an activator of both innate and adaptive arms of the immune system data from our proprietary vision platform continues to support its broad and unique activity including responses in patients with so called cold tumors which typically do not respond to immunotherapy we have expanded patient enrollment in our existing clinical trials in specific cohorts of patients which will form the basis of our phase ii studies in colorectal cancer melanoma and pancreatic cancer our efforts to initiate these studies are currently in high gear our clinical development strategy of botensilimab is to demonstrate clear superiority to existing checkpoint immunotherapies and or other standards of care this is based on strong signals we have observed in our phase i study in patients who were heavily pre treated these observations lead to our prioritization of relapse refractory melanoma mss colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer as our target indications for potential approval now for a minute for context colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer related that s in the united states with over 50 000 americans dying each year immunotherapy treatments in colorectal cancer have been largely unsuccessful partly because most colorectal cancers are cold tumors and for those with metastatic disease 5 year survival rates are in the low teens also for context current standards of care for patients which are represented in our trials deliver approximately 2 response rate with significant side effects and minor improvement in survival in contrast botensilimab in combination with our anti pd 1 balstilimab has delivered significantly higher response rates which will be discussed soon botensilimab also holds significant potential in melanoma where despite treatment advances there remains few effective therapies for those who failed frontline regimens particularly with immunotherapies as well in addition to these indications we presented data at last year at sitc demonstrating that botensilimab benefits in several other cold tumors including endometrial cervical and pancreatic cancers over 50 of patients treated with botensilimab had received at least three prior lines of therapy botensilimab produced objective responses in these difficult to treat patient settings hence we re preliminarily exploring development strategies across these indications to bring therapy options to patients who have limited or no options today the unique attributes of botensilimab have been the result of the deliberate efforts of our team who engineered this molecule based on their understanding of tumor biology and the immune system these translated into a unique mechanism of action which results in the activity of botensilimab across a variety of tumors at sitc we presented botensilimab s activity in nine different tumors whilst botensilimab binds to ctla 4 it has a much broader activity by targeting both the adaptive and the innate immune arms of the system we are working closely with scientific and regulatory experts to advance botensilimab in hard to treat cancers which i mentioned include cancer characterized by cold tumor types we re hopeful that the unique attributes of this molecule will lead to life changing outcomes for underserved patients including potential treatments for pediatric cancers while advancing our portfolio with our high priority programs we re also pursuing our business development plans with potential collaborators in addition we are actively looking at innovative financing mechanisms which we have excelled in delivering previously adapting our business model in consideration of the current industry landscape is for us a critical extension of our innovation and strategic thinking agenus has had an impressive track record of varied transactions and innovative financings with more than 800 million raised in just the past six years and potential to realize significant milestone and royalty payments from six different companies involving eight product candidates currently in clinical development as agenus moves with speed and innovation to execute our scientific discovery in clinical research we re committed to taking the steps which will ensure our medical advances will be widely available to patients all over the world investing in integrated discovery development and manufacturing capabilities and emphasizing on international approaches to clinical development and commercialization are critical to achieving our objectives in this regard we re putting these strategies into practice for example with bal zal as we strive to make this combination available in ex u s territories and as we continue to prioritize industry partnerships which allow agenus to retain elements of independence and control over the development of our molecules it is also noteworthy to mention that agenus science has already advanced 16 discoveries into clinical development and with a very exciting cell therapy company represented today by the ceo dr jennifer buell that s mink therapeutics created as a separate company and another saponiqx potentially in the making our ability to discover and innovate best in class molecules and treatments has been the basis for a significant number of productive industry partnerships our company values and the high worth we place on science has been instrumental in industry breakthrough therapies such as gsk s shingrix vaccine with current analyst estimates of approaching 3 billion in annualized revenues this year as i mentioned earlier we re also sharpening our focus around expense management to extend our runway to continue with our discoveries uninterrupted every aspect of this process matters to us we have initiated a comprehensive review to eliminate non discretionary spending and implement highly efficient practices while we believe agenus is in a strong financial position with over 260 million in cash our view is to exercise a conservative fiscal policy particularly in times of uncertainty in financial markets and drug regulation our focus also includes our technology advancements which drive efficiencies in product discovery and innovation this is highlighted by our unique discovery platform vision which is led to among others to our emerging work on myeloid checkpoint targets at aacr in april we presented data on our anti ilt2 antibody agen1571 which represents our first fully owned clinical stage myeloid targeting agents in preclinical studies agen1571 has already demonstrated several important advantages we expect to enroll patients in our phase i studies of agen1571 shortly our plans are to evaluate this agent both as monotherapy and in combination guided by readouts from our vision platform last month we also announced the receipt of a 5 million milestone payment from our partner gilead sciences while this is a tiny amount it denotes the advancement of agen2373 our cd137 agonist which has unique advantages over other molecules cd137 is an important pathway for antitumor immunity due to its ability to enhance t cell and nk cell proliferation cytokine secretion and cellular cytotoxicity importantly agen2373 was designed to mitigate the liver toxicity that has limited the advancement of first generation molecules gilead retains an exclusive option to license agen2373 while agenus has the ability to obtain for a 50 50 profit share and u s co commercialization rights agenus stands to receive up to 570 million in future potential option fees and milestones from this product candidate alone and there ll be of course additional royalty payments depending on the magnitude of a product like this upon successful launch development of agen1777 our fc enhanced tigit bispecific antibody partnered with bms is also advancing in the clinic we continue to believe 1777 represents a best in class antibody with an increasing body or evidence suggesting indicating that fc enhancement is required to achieve optimal results with tigit targeting approach the programs i highlighted today signify agenus unique ability to advance our own pipeline with our own combinations which is also enabled by information and knowledge we gather from our proprietary vision platform among others vision informs upstream target prioritization and downstream biomarker identification as well as trial design it is this ability to work rapidly with independence and integrity driven by science that positions agenus to be a leader in biotech s shift biotech s currently shifting environment so thank you very much and i now turn it over to christine and i ll come back shortly after that christine klaskin vice president finance and chief accounting officer thank you garo we ended our first quarter 2022 with a cash and short term investment balance of 263 million as compared to 307 million on december 31 2021 we recognized revenue of 26 million for the quarter ended march 31 2022 which represents an increase of 14 million from the 12 million reported for the same quarter in 2021 both amounts include revenue related to non cash royalties earned revenue recognized under our collaboration agreements and 2022 milestones received net loss for the quarter ended march 31 2022 with 51 million which includes non cash expenses of 21 million compared to a net loss for the same period of 2021 of 54 million which includes non cash expenses of 20 million per share losses were 0 19 per share in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to per share losses of 0 27 in the first quarter of 2021 cash used in operations for the three months ended march 31 2022 was 52 million up from the 43 million for the quarter ended march 31 2021 as garo mentioned the company has initiated cost containment measures with expected reductions in operating expenses in the coming quarters i now turn the call back to garo garo armen chairman and chief executive officer thank you very much christine to summarize despite the stressful external landscape we continue to make important advances in a field which is in need we have a number of important developments including near term data disclosures initiation of phase ii botensilimab programs we re delivering on our promise of building a company with a diverse pipeline and moving swiftly to address areas of high unmet patient need by the end of 2022 we expect to have initiated several new clinical studies including the three phase ii studies for botensilimab that we spoke about a phase i monotherapy study for agn1571 we also expect to complete enrollment in the relapsed refractory melanoma cohort of our combination study involving botensilimab and agen2373 in addition there s of course a potential of corporate collaborations and additional cash infusions from them during the course of this year thank you again for your attention and we will now open the call for questions questions answers operator our first question comes from mayank mamtani i apologize from riley securities mayank mamtani b riley financial analyst and helpful biotech sector specific commentary there garo so maybe just to kick start things with your recent prioritization of ilt2 as an important target and myeloid checkpoint inhibitor so was just curious what was the rationale for that and sort of your history in that space and also if you could talk to how might sanofi s development and i think some data coming at asco inform your development and sort of the basket of initial solid tumors you might prioritize and then i have a follow up garo armen chairman and chief executive officer let me first turn it to dr dhan chand to address at least a part of this question dhan chand scientific director and head of drug discovery thank you garo mayank thank you for that question as you are aware agenus is well familiar with the lt space in fact we built merck s ilt4 antibody mk 4830 which is progressing in the clinic showing activity in patients that are refractory to pd 1 therapies as by design by agenus with that knowledge and experience that we built in the space we ve also retained ilt2 and progressed ilt2 to the clinic where we have demonstrated as you can see at aacr the potential for ilt2 activity and not only complementary to pd 1 but also extending activity to colder tumors where pd 1 is not active we have also demonstrated broad activity of agen1571 which includes activity that goes beyond just myeloid activation which includes t cell nk and nkt activation you also notice from our poster at aacr that we demonstrate best in class activity compared to other ilt2 targeting agents which includes the most advanced clinical asset the i o asset we have demonstrated in head to head studies that agen1571 has not only monotherapy potential but it s a superior activator of both myeloid activation and t and nk activation garo armen chairman and chief executive officer and then the second part of the question is what tumors will we study and i think maybe dhan could start and dr o day could finish that dhan chand scientific director and head of drug discovery sure and i ll turn it over to dr o day shortly so as you saw from our poster mayank we demonstrated that hla g which is the main ligand for ilt2 are expressed in tumor types that are independent of pd l1 expression so we see this as complementary of course we will be exploring this retrospectively in the clinic we ve also identified as part of our preclinical development potential biomarker of response to agen157 which will also be applied to our trial steven steven oday chief medical officer mayank thank you for the question obviously you can see our excitement around the ilt2 ilt4 field obviously the myeloid space has been a challenge but we really feel this is an important space the ilt2 that we have put forward with the aacr as dhan said has both myeloid as well as lymphoid activation features which may bring it best in class and obviously the ilt4 that our molecule that merck is advancing is looking is showing some early promise so in terms of tumor types i think obviously we re going to do the phase i broadly and look because obviously ovarian cancer other tumors even liver metastasis may very much be myeloid dependent pancreas and others so what s really great about our pipeline right now is botensilimab obviously looks like as the next generation ctla 4 is really broader than ctla 4 in terms of its innate adaptive sort of synapse in the fc enhanced region really we think bringing broader t cell repertoire recognition of weak neoantigens and i think so that innate adaptive space that botensilimab brings and then bringing the myeloid active drug that has lymphoid coverage also may be very exciting so we couldn t be more excited about sort of the areas of the pipeline that we re going to bring forward and then have combinational potential mayank mamtani b riley financial analyst understood and then on botensilimab how might you be thinking of second half or all medical conferences for incremental data disclosures and if you are able to comment relative to what you have said before obviously melanoma landscape very different than pancreatic and with crc you do have a specific trial design in place a competitive study but any incremental thoughts on melanoma and pancreatic for development and registration would be helpful garo armen chairman and chief executive officer so let me just tell you regarding the conference so we have not disclosed the conference that we re going to be presenting at yet but it is an important medical conference cancer conference but stay tuned and that disclosure will make shortly but now let me turn it to dr o day about the trial design one of the reasons our phase ii trials have taken a little bit of time to commence is related to the fact that the regulatory environment has gotten to be somewhat all over the place and we ve had to make sure that we consult with the appropriate parties to design the kinds of trials that are going to be meaningful for the next steps in product registration now with that it s important to note and dr o day will elaborate on this that all of the trials in the phase ii setting particularly given the regulatory environment that we re in right now will be randomized in one way or another ok randomized through either standard of care or randomized within the drug that we re studying so dr o day please take it from here steven oday chief medical officer so what i would say as garo has said we are laser focused on our botensilimab program because the phase i which is now an extended phase i program is showing really remarkable activity in a number of solid tumors and the data continues to be encouraging because of this we see it as a potential foundational partner and the development plan which has taken some time to really be very strategic is really going to ask three fundamental questions one as a single agent is it differentiated and powerful and obviously melanoma is the disease to test that with a clear benchmark for ipilimumab which we think we can beat the second is colorectal where combination therapy with our pd 1 is showing significant activity and so this will be an area where we can see it how botensilimab combines with a pd 1 and then finally a very cold tumor like pancreas given our preclinical data showing very powerful combination potential of botensilimab with chemotherapy in a mouse model and some early signal in the clinic with response to pancreas with botensilimab we think this is an excellent experiment to look at botensilimab in combination with chemotherapy so the three registrational pathways melanoma colorectal and pancreas are really asking three fundamental scientific questions single agent activity combination with chemo and combination with pd 1 and so we look forward to following that data and seeing if it can become a real new asset to the io community in terms of target and most importantly clinical performance in unmet needs garo armen chairman and chief executive officer great and my final question was on the opex savings that you guys are working on obviously very astute and makes a lot of sense in this environment to prioritize as much as you can so are you able to quantify any of that or is that sort of work in progress and maybe also comment on since a majority of the work will be on botensilimab development and potential combination regimens in the tumor types we talked about and beyond how might you be thinking of some of that p l burden that s to come starting next year ok so we haven t quantified the savings yet but let me tell you that it s got on to be 5 or 10 we are talking about significant savings associated with the measures that we re taking and but as i said earlier all these savings are taking place without compromising the delivery of our highest priority programs which includes 1181 so there s no way we re going to compromise the advancements of 1181 because it is the most advanced the most promising potentially blockbuster compound in our portfolio that doesn t mean we re not excited about the rest of the compounds in our portfolio it s just the fact that this is the most advanced makes it much more compelling to support near term and as i talked about some of the other compounds are also advancing for example the expenses associated with 1571 through phase i clinical trials is relatively modest and compounds such as our cd137 are also advancing rapidly with the potential of the option holder exercising the option which will when it happens which will bring in significant additional cash resources into the company and 1777 on the other hand is being advanced entirely with bristol myers support so a lot of these compounds other than 1181 are either representing minor expenditures going forward or are entirely underwritten by our collaborators mayank mamtani b riley financial analyst great operator our next question comes from of jefferies unknown speaker this is at jefferies i m asking questions on behalf of kelly shi i do have two quick questions number one for the phase ii trials for botensilimab i just want to clarify you said the trial were about to launch is that most likely starting q2 or q3 and second is that previously you said in colorectal cancer or cervical cancer the response rate is very low could you maybe give a rough number like what is likely the response rate that would clear the regulatory hurdle that s question number one and for question number two i just want to follow up on the operating cash expenses besides the cost containment is there any other measures you re currently considering that will potentially raise cash or putting it out the way what is the expected milestone payments that you re likely to receive in the next few quarters garo armen chairman and chief executive officer ok so let me start out with the trials timing of the trials all three trials that we spoke about phase ii trials are expected to commence starting in the third quarter of this year starting in the third quarter of this year and as i mentioned one of the reasons it s taken so long is for us to be able to confirm with the appropriate advisors authorities and so on and so forth to make sure that we have considered everything and that s one of the reasons for each trial having multiple arms including randomization in some cases to the standard of care and all of this means that trial design has been finalized so the only hurdle between now and initiation of these trials is simple operations so we are clear on the kinds of trials that are going to be the subject of our phase ii undertakings now with regard to expenses i think your question if i understand it correctly is how did you have a question on the expenses unknown speaker yes i just want to understand besides the cost containment is there any other plans to risk enhancement garo armen chairman and chief executive officer oh i see right so and then you also wanted to know if there are any additional milestones that we will receive this year the answer is yes we expect additional milestones to be received for the balance of this year we haven t disclosed what they are but stay tuned and with regard to additional cash resources as you know we ve been very very resourceful in doing collaborations with companies and other creative transactions we haven t tapped the i mean this is the horrible time to do that we have no plans of any marketed stock issuance if that is the question that you re asking and it s a horrible environment to do that in any way but we ve been very creative in transactions and i don t want to elaborate on what we have in active consideration right now but everything you do is of course has some element of dilution including partnerships because you re giving up part of the upside of your compounds but what we plan on doing is to be as creative as possible including potential royalty transactions that will support our needs in coming years operator our next question comes from matt phipps of william blair matt phipps william blair and company analyst dr o day i was wondering for your phase ii melanoma trial and relapsed refractory melanoma obviously the first line market is changing a bit with the recent approval with pd 1 lag 3 so just wondering if you re going to enroll patients who have just failed the pd 1 failed pd 1 plus lag 3 or would you even enroll patients who failed opdivo yervoy steven oday chief medical officer yes matt yes obviously the frontline setting in melanoma now involves three options single agent pd 1 combinations with ctla 4 ipi nivo and then obviously the new lag 3 pd 1 combination so we will be looking at all of those groups obviously the space is sort of divided between ipi nivo frontline and then pd 1 monotherapy we expected some patients will now be failing we know that we ll be failing the lag 3 combination 2 and we ll be looking at all three of those we think we have a not just a ctla 4 drug but potentially a broader drug with 1181 and we certainly want to understand whether it can rescue any of those scenarios matt phipps william blair and company analyst and then just to help clarify for what to expect in the third quarter is this just a combination is there also additional monotherapy update that what you guys showed at sitc and then is this all tumor types or was it focusing on some of these ones that you re going into phase ii for additional patients beyond what we saw at sitc steven oday chief medical officer sorry matt i guess i don t understand the question matt phipps william blair and company analyst you said some botensilimab updates coming in q3 some additional clinical data you guys now show data at sitc is this just is it the patients across both monotherapy and the combination is it just a combination is it steven oday chief medical officer yes so as garo said we are continuing to expand the phase i trial in a number of different areas particularly around the diseases like melanoma colorectal pancreas that we plan to open phase ii trials and so we will be bringing data forward at important medical conferences later this year and we haven t announced where but the additional data around those diseases will be updated at conferences later this year garo armen chairman and chief executive officer so matt to be clear on that note as you remarked we had done a phase i study with over 100 patients enrolled and then we were getting set up to start our phase ii studies late last year and so for a while these phase i enrollments have slowed down but because of the longer time lines required for our initiation of phase ii studies we made a deliberate effort and executed on it in enrolling patients in specific cohorts that would be the subject of our phase ii studies and since that decision was made earlier this year enrollment in those cohorts that will be the subject of phase ii studies is actually exploded and so we have considerably more patients in those cohorts that have generated data which will be the subject of our

the market is firmly in correction territory but before looking at those losses perhaps it s time to consider the market opportunity brewing right now in case you haven t noticed the market lately it s been a roller coaster ride that has dropped considerably in fact over the course of the past month the market has tanked by over 8 fortunately it s not all bad news if anything there s an opportunity for long term investors to buy great stocks at a discount right now on sale rogers communications rogers communications tsx rci b nyse rci is the first great market opportunity that investors should jump on over the course of the past month rogers has seen its stock dip by over 12 by way of comparison rogers s big telecom peers have only managed to dip half as much what makes rogers a great market opportunity for investors rogers runs a reliable telecom business that generates a recurring revenue stream from multiple segments a deal to acquire one of rogers s smaller competitors is steadily marching towards completion albeit with some concerns from the competition bureau while that does add some volatility into the mix rogers remains a great long term investment that is on sale right now throw in rogers s quarterly dividend and you have a compelling income generator as well trading flat is a good thing for this company canadian utilities tsx cu is one of a handful of companies that isn t in the red just yet that being said the utility company is trading near flat over the past month despite its stellar appeal in short canadian utilities benefits from an incredibly stable business model that allows it to generate a handsome revenue stream that revenue stream also means that canadian utilities can continue to provide investors with a juicy quarterly dividend the yield on that dividend currently works out to 4 58 making it one of the better paying stable options on the market canadian utilities is also the only dividend king in canada a feat the company hit this year when it completed 50 consecutive years of annual dividend increases in short canadian utilities just screams long term potential and the current market opportunity has the stock price barely sitting in the black the market opportunity here is off the charts it would be nearly impossible to generate a list of great investments and not mention at least one of canada s big banks today the bank that investors should be looking closely at is toronto dominion bank tsx td nyse td canada s second largest lender has amassed an impressive domestic portfolio that generates a stable and growing revenue stream in the years following the great recession td expanded heavily into the u s market td s u s segment comprises over 1 200 branches along the east coast stretching from maine to florida impressive without a doubt but td isn t done expanding the bank announced earlier this year a us 14 4 billion deal to acquire tennessee based first horizons the deal is going to add over 400 branches across a dozen states to td s portfolio elevating the bank to one of the top six banks in the u s market going by the incredible growth td saw after its first incursion into the u s market it s hard not to see this as a huge market opportunity if that isn t enough td also offers investors a handsome quarterly dividend that works out to a yield of 3 85 despite all that potential td is trading down near 5 over the past month and down a whopping 13 over the past three month period final thoughts no investment is without risk and that includes investing during times of volatility such as the present fortunately the companies mentioned here are well established market leaders offering solid growth stable revenue and juicy dividends in my opinion one or all the stocks mentioned above should form part of any well diversified portfolio

absenteeism that resulted in lower productivity and production lower fleet mechanical availability due to delays in spare parts supply around europe impacting both mine and plant efficiencies operations shutdown in march 2022 due to an unusually severe nationwide transportation strike in spain that disrupted supply chains across all sectors and regions especially the highly industrialized north where el valle sits regular level of indirect fixed costs that given lower production originated materially higher unit costs higher prices for energy materials supplies and services spain s annual inflation was 6 7 in december 2021 reaching a near 40 year high of 9 8 percent in march 2022 fuel and electricity pricing were at the core of this phenomenon the above mentioned operational issues are temporary and the company expects that they will not affect orovalle s performance in the medium to longer term actions are being taken to return to full operational levels while continuing to manage outstanding risks related to covid 19 the conflict in ukraine is causing significant economic and social effects which are affecting all european countries the spanish government approved in march an economic package to mitigate the impacts of the armed conflict the european union announced late april that it will allow spain and portugal to apply a limit to the gas price used in power generation for a 12 month period with the gas price cap set at eur50 mwh spain s central bank forecasted early april consumer prices to surge 7 5 in 2022 but just 2 in 2023 the company expects that this inflationary scenario is temporary and will not affect orovalle s results in the medium to longer term in a material way the company s strategy for the second half of fiscal 2022 is to manage its

26th distribution increase over the past 29 quarters during which time we have increased the distribution run rate by 51 3 comments from david gladstone president and ceo of gladstone land the results this quarter showed the full impact of about 147 million of acquisitions that occurred during the last quarter of 2021 while we were not active on the acquisition front this past quarter we have been busy replenishing our backlog of potential farm acquisitions given the level of uncertainty surrounding the current economic environment we believe now is a time to be somewhat conservative with our capital and thus have been a bit more selective with our acquisitions recently however we do have few farms that we are hopeful of closing on over the next several months we continue to see appreciation in the value of most of our farms particularly those in the western u s we believe this reflects strongly on our pre acquisition due diligence process which always starts with a comprehensive water analysis we continue to actively monitor the ongoing drought in the western u s and all of our farms continue to have sufficient water at this time we are looking forward to the

association of real estate investment trusts nareit developed ffo as a relative non gaap supplemental measure of operating performance of an equity reit in order to recognize that income producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under gaap ffo as defined by nareit is net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property and impairment losses on property plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures the company believes that ffo per share provides investors with an additional context for evaluating its financial performance and as a supplemental measure to compare it to other reits however comparisons of its ffo to the ffo of other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to potential differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such other reits cffo cffo is ffo adjusted for items that are not indicative of the results provided by the company s operating portfolio and affect the comparability of the company s period over period performance these items include certain non recurring items such as acquisition and disposition related expenses the net incremental impact of operations conducted through our taxable reit subsidiary income tax provisions and property and casualty losses or recoveries although the company s calculation of cffo differs from nareit s definition of ffo and may not be comparable to that of other reits the company believes it is a meaningful supplemental measure of its sustainable operating performance accordingly cffo should be considered a supplement to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance for a full explanation of the adjustments made to arrive at cffo please read the company s form 10 q filed today with the sec affo affo is cffo adjusted for certain non cash items such as the straight lining of

valuation team with oversight from the chief valuation officer provides recommendations of value for our properties to our board of directors who then review and approve the fair values of our properties per our valuation policy our valuations are derived based on either the purchase price of the property values as determined by independent third party appraisers or through an internal valuation process which process is in turn based on values as determined by independent third party appraisers in any case we intend to have each property valued by an independent third party appraiser at least once every three years or more frequently in some instances various methodologies are used both by the appraisers and in our internal valuations to determine the fair value of our real estate including the sales comparison income capitalization or a discounted cash flow analysis and cost approaches of valuation nav is a non gaap supplemental measure of financial position of an equity reit and is calculated as total equity available to common stockholders and non controlling op unitholders adjusted for the increase or decrease in fair value of our real estate assets and

so long as semrush does not have any indication that a customer has canceled or intends to cancel its subscription and semrush continues to generate revenue from them dollar based net revenue retention is defined as a the revenue from our customers during the twelve month period ending one year prior to such period as the denominator and b the revenue from those same customers during the

income loss as gaap income loss excluding stock based compensation expense we believe non gaap net income loss provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past

article parents across the u s are scrambling to find baby formula because supply disruptions and a massive safety recall have swept many leading brands off store shelves months of spot shortages at pharmacies and supermarkets have been exacerbated by the recall at abbott which was forced to shutter its largest u s formula manufacturing plant in february due to contamination concerns on monday white house press secretary jenn psaki said the food and drug administration was working around the clock to address any possible shortages on tuesday the fda said it was working with u s manufacturers to increase their output and streamlining paperwork to allow more imports related baby formula shortage leaves parents scrambling for now pediatricians and health workers are urging parents who can t find formula to contact food banks or doctor s offices they warn against watering down formula to stretch supplies or using online diy recipes for babies who are not being breastfed this is the only thing they eat said dr steven abrams of the university of texas austin so it has to have all of their nutrition and furthermore it needs to be properly prepared so that it s safe for the smallest infants laura stewart a 52 year old mother of three who lives just north of springfield missouri has been struggling for several weeks to find formula for her 10 month old daughter riley riley normally gets a brand of abbott s similac designed for children with sensitive stomachs last month she instead used four different brands related baby formula shortage 40 of major brands sold out across the u s analysts say she spits up more she s just more cranky she is typically a very happy girl stewart said when she has the right formula she doesn t spit up she s perfectly fine a small can costs 17 to 18 and lasts three to five days stewart said like many americans stewart relies on wic a federal program similar to food stamps that serves mothers and children to afford formula for her daughter abbott s recall wiped out many wic covered brands though the program is now allowing substitutions trying to keep formula in stock retailers including cvs and walgreens have begun limiting purchases to three containers per customer nationwide about 40 of large retail stores are out of stock up from 31 in mid april according to datasembly a data analytics firm more than half of u s states are seeing out of stock rates between 40 and 50 according to the firm which collects data from 11 000 locations baby formula is particularly vulnerable to disruptions because just a handful of companies account for almost the entire u s supply industry executives say the constraints began last year as the covid 19 pandemic led to disruptions in ingredients labor and transportation supplies were further squeezed by parents stockpiling during lockdowns then in february abbott recalled several major brands and shut down its sturgis michigan factory when federal officials concluded four babies suffered bacterial infections after consuming formula from the facility two of the infants died when fda inspectors visited the plant in march they found lax safety protocols and traces of the bacteria on several surfaces none of the bacterial strains matched those collected from the infants however and the fda hasn t offered an explanation for how the contamination occurred for its part abbott says its formula is not likely the source of infection though the fda says its investigation continues chicago based abbott said it is increasing production at its other facilities to fill the gap including air shipping formula from a plant in ireland the shortages are especially dangerous for infants who require specialty formulas due to food allergies digestive problems and other conditions unfortunately many of those very specialized formulas are only made in the united states at the factory that had the recall and that s caused a huge problem for a relatively small number of infants abrams said after hearing concerns from parents the fda said last month that abbott could begin releasing some specialty formulas not affected by the recalls on a case by case basis the company is providing them free of charge in coordination with physicians and hospitals food safety advocates say the fda made the right call in releasing the formula but that parents should talk to their pediatricians before using it there s still some risk from the formula because we know there are problems at the plant and fda hasn t identified a root cause said sarah sorscher of the center for science in the public interest but it s worth releasing because these infants might die without it it s unclear when the abbott plant might reopen the fda said the company is still working to rectify findings related to the processes procedures and conditions other infant formula makers are meeting or exceeding capacity levels to meet current demand the agency said among other steps the fda said it was waiving enforcement of minor product labeling issues to increase availability of both u s and imported products ___ hollingsworth reported from kansas city missouri

citizens log may 10 how the fall of human civilization was pulled off through the deliberate destruction of the physical infrastructure that keeps humanity alive today s citizens log podcast formerly known as situation update reveals how globalists achieved the fall of human civilization by dismantling the physical infrastructure that once kept humanity alive citizens log is recorded and preserved for future historians in the hopes they might study the mistakes that lead to the fall of human civilization each episode reports on present day events that are leading to the cultural collapse food collapse economic collapse cognitive collapse and infrastructure collapse all headed toward the grand finale civilization collapse which will end this era of madness and lead to a global reset mass die off we anticipate that at minimum 2 4 billion people will be killed over the next decade due to vaccine damage vaccine induced cancer deaths starvation economic collapse lawless violence and world war iii events which will likely include emp weapons or nuclear weapons if the usa continues to push russia into nuclear escalations that number could easily rise to 4 billion human casualties globalists are trying to exterminate 7 5 billion the climate change excuse to dismantle the infrastructure that feeds the world what s clear is that the criminal cabal currently running the world is meticulously working to exterminate the human race a kind of planetary scale ethnic cleansing the excuse they ve come up with is climate change a delusional fairy tale that claims carbon dioxide kills plants it actually does exactly the opposite and that a colder planet earth would be greener again it s exactly the opposite of reality under the camouflage of climate change the world s western nations have dismantled their energy infrastructure shutting down pipelines halting drilling punishing coal miners and waging economic warfare on the entire energy infrastructure as the collapse accelerates the globalists order people to go green but offer no practical way to actually transition from oil to anything else the go green cheer is really just a virtue signaling way to say go f off and die it was never about going green you see it was always about extermination of the human race and without the energy infrastructure that provides fertilizer farming and food transportation at minimum half the world s population would starve to death this was of course precisely the plan now the world faces engineered mass starvation and economic collapse the deliberate dismantling of the infrastructure that keeps civilization functioning is now leading directly into mass starvation and economic collapse this will only be exacerbated by the currency collapse that s about to be sprung on the world leading to a rapid global collapse of the world s dominant fiat currencies in our estimation the euro will likely collapse in the next year and the yen won t be far behind the us dollar is on its way out and is facing a global repudiation scenario where 100 countries simultaneously denounce and abandon the dollar leading to a near instant wipeout of dollar denominated assets followed by the collapse of the us government empire the collapse of the dollar will lead to widespread civil unrest and violence across america the inability to print new money that has any value will see the entire criminal cabal in washington d c implode unable to keep their fraudulent printing presses running such as the now 40 billion support package designated for ukraine most of which will end up in the pockets of corrupt us officials and their family members on one hand an observer might see the downfall of the criminal cabal in d c as a good thing but as that happens the american people will be facing chaos starvation and violence in their own cities and towns order will slowly be restored as states secede from the union and declare their own local currencies reestablishing trade and transactional infrastructure for commerce see my free downloadable audio book the global reset survival guide to learn how to make it through what s coming the ceo of scottish power warns 10 million

uk households potentially 10 million homes could be in fuel poverty this winter mr anderson explained mr anderson also said more energy companies could collapse if their customers were unable to pay their bills rt com russia today also covered the issue attributing the following quote to anderson â if nothing else happens by october i think we will see a huge increase in pre payment customers in effect self disconnecting â not reloading their pre payment meter because they canâ t afford to do it â â we will also see a massive increase in debt levels for direct debit customers and a massive increase in people being pushed from direct debits to prepayment meters so that companies can recover the debt â he continued â we are heading to a really horrible place where none of us want to be â

so long as semrush does not have any indication that a customer has canceled or intends to cancel its subscription and semrush continues to generate revenue from them dollar based net revenue retention is defined as a the revenue from our customers during the twelve month period ending one year prior to such period as the denominator and b the revenue from those same customers during the twelve months ending as of the end of such period as the numerator this calculation excludes revenue from new customers and any non recurring revenue non gaap net income loss we define non gaap net income loss as gaap income loss excluding stock based compensation expense we believe non gaap net income loss provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past

twitter founder jack dorsey now admits he was wrong to ban trump says it was a bad business decision and agrees with elon musk that the ex president s account should be reinstated elon musk who is set to become the new owner of twitter on tuesday said that he would reverse the company s ban of donald trump jack dorsey who was ceo of twitter at the time of the january 2021 ban said he agrees with musk s decision dorsey stepped down as ceo in november 2021 and tweeted that blocking trump from the platform was a business decision it shouldn t have been he said he believed then and believes now that twitter bans should not be permanent musk said he believes the ban on trump following the january 6 uprising was a morally bad decision and foolish trump has claimed that he would not return to twitter even if he was invited back and launched his own competing service truth social earlier this year twitter co founder jack dorsey has said he agrees with elon musk s decision to reverse a ban on donald trump on the platform despite dorsey being ceo when the decision was made musk who is in the process of completing his 44 billion acquisition of twitter on tuesday revealed he intended to revoke the ban calling it a morally bad decision and foolish in the extreme trump was banned from twitter in january 2021 in response to his supporters storming the us capitol and attempting to block the certification of joe biden s election victory speaking at a london conference on the future of cars musk said i do think it was not correct to ban donald trump the tesla founder said dorsey who was ceo until november 2021 agreed with him i do agree dorsey tweeted pointing out that he supported bans for sharing content such as child sexual exploitation cse but not generally there are exceptions cse illegal behaviour spam or network manipulation etc but generally permanent bans are a failure of ours and don t work which i wrote about here after the event and called for a resilient social media protocol jack dorsey on tuesday said he supports elon musk s decision to reinstate trump on twitter elon musk has revealed that he would reverse twitter s permanent ban on donald trump after completing his acquisition of the social media platform dorsey then linked to his january 13 2021 tweet in which he defended the decision i do not celebrate or feel pride in our having to ban realdonaldtrump from twitter or how we got here dorsey said at the time after a clear warning we d take this action we made a decision with the best information we had based on threats to physical safety both on and off twitter i believe this was the right decision for twitter we faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance forcing us to focus all of our actions on public safety offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real and what drives our policy and enforcement above all dorsey added in his lengthy thread a caveat that the decision would need reevaluating this moment in time might call for this dynamic but over the long term it will be destructive to the noble purpose and ideals of the open internet a company making a business decision to moderate itself is different from a government removing access yet can feel much the same he said on tuesday quizzed about his views by axios s business editor dan primack dorsey said that he now regretted the call donald trump is seen on saturday at the kentucky derby in louisville it was a business decision it shouldn t have been he said and we should always revisit our decisions and evolve as necessary i stated in that thread and still believe that permanent bans of individuals are directionally wrong trump who recently launched his own competing service dubbed truth social has previously claimed that he would not return to twitter even if he was invited back appearing virtually at the ft future of the car conference musk called twitter s ban of trump a mistake it alienated a large part of the country and did not ultimately result in donald trump not having a voice musk said he is now going to be on truth social so i think this may end up being frankly worse than having a single forum where everyone can debate i guess the answer is that i would reverse the permanent ban musk said that he had discussed the subject of permanent bans or permabans with dorsey he and i are of the same mind which is that permanent bans should be extremely rare and really reserved for accounts that are bots or spam scam accounts said musk i would reverse the permaban he said adding obviously i don t own twitter yet so this is not something that will definitely happen trump was banned from twitter in january of 2021 in response to his supporters storming the us capitol trump who recently launched his own competing service dubbed truth social has previously claimed that he would not return to twitter even if he was invited back but my opinion and i want to be clear that jack dorsey shares this opinion is that we should not have permabans said musk in his remarks on tuesday musk also said that his acquisition of twitter which is still subject to a shareholder approval could close well before the october deadline just objectively it is not a done deal he said the best case scenario is that it would perhaps be done in two or three months trump launched his truth social app in february but the service s debut was plagued by technical issues musk previously mocked the twitter clone calling truth social a terrible name and joking that it should be called trumpet instead he has said that truth social only exists because twitter censored free speech trump said that he had no intention of rejoining twitter even if his account was reinstated telling fox news last month that he would instead focus on truth social i am not going on twitter i am going to stay on truth trump told the network i hope elon buys twitter because he ll make improvements to it and he is a good man but i am going to be staying on truth trump s final two tweets which resulted in his ban from twitter are seen above trump was originally banned from twitter for allegedly inciting violence with his unsupported claims that the election had been stolen twitter said at the time that after a review of how trump s tweets are being received and interpreted on and off twitter that it had banned his account due to the risk of further incitement of violence the ban was handed down on january 8 2021 two days after trump loyalists attacked the us capitol his final tweet read to all of those who have asked i will not be going to the inauguration on january 20th twitter said in a statement at the time that they interpreted this remark as a potential call to violence by further calling into question the legitimacy of the election and signaling to supporters that the inauguration would be a safe target for violence many were angered by the ban with piers morgan among those pointing out that twitter s rules appeared inconsistent iran s supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei was able to tweet on october 28 2020 why is it a crime to raise doubts about the holocaust at the same time the new york post was banned from twitter for publishing a story on hunter biden s laptop the post s account was later reinstated and dorsey apologized conservatives who have accused san francisco based twitter of bias against right leaning views have cheered the prospect of trump s return he trump ought to be everywhere he can republican senator rick scott told reporters when asked about musk s comments we ought to have free speech in this country we shouldn t have social media companies that are restricting people s ability to get their message out added scott democrats have said trump s potential reinstatement could constitute a threat to democracy although some hope that a frequently tweeting trump could upset their base and rev up turnout in the november midterm congressional elections earlier on tuesday twitter shares fell to a level that indicated the stock market took the view for the first time that it was unlikely that musk would make the acquisition for 44 billion as he originally agreed minutes after saying that twitter leans strongly left musk followed up with a tweet saying he believed the platform should conform to the speech laws of the country it is being used in musk s comments on undoing the ban comes after he said twitter obviously has a strong left wing bias he later clarified that he believed that speech on twitter should be governed by the laws of the country in which it is being used like i said my preference is to hew close to the laws of countries in which twitter operates if the citizens want something banned then pass a law to do so otherwise it should be allowed earlier he hit back at a liberal reporter calling for violence against anti abortion groups caroline reilly a reporter for rewire news group had shared a new york times story about the burning and attempted bombing of a wisconsin pro life group s office more of this she wrote in a now deleted tweet may these people never know a moment of peace or safety until they rot in the ground reilly was slammed by conservatives on the site in the immediate aftermath and mike cernovich a conspiracy theorist known for his propagation of the baseless pizzagate theory that high ranking democrats were running a pedophilic sex trafficking ring out of a d c pizza shop made sure musk knew about the tweet he tagged the tesla ceo in a tweet accusing the platform of allowing verified accounts to incite violence in the name of liberal causes on sunday evening here you go elonmusk when twitter employees invariably lie to you about enforcement policy maybe they can explain why a verified account is allowed to incite terrorism without any care in the world about being banned advertisement musk later replied to cernovich writing twitter obv has a strong left wing bias
portland ore ktvz the national and oregon gas price averages have skyrocketed to new record highs after the price of oil jumped above 110 per barrel last week and prices in central oregon reflect that as well aaa oregon idaho said tuesday drivers are paying more to fill up in 49 states including oregon for the week the national average for regular soars 17 cents to 4 37 a gallon the oregon average jumps 16 cents to 4 85 the national and oregon averages are both at new record highs eclipsing the record highs set in march the cost of crude oil accounts for more than half of what we pay at the pumps so higher crude oil prices translate into more expensive gas and diesel unfortunately these high pump prices are not likely to ease anytime soon says marie dodds public affairs director for aaa oregon idaho on average about 53 of what we pay for in a gallon of gasoline is for the price of crude oil 12 is refining 21 distribution and marketing and 15 are taxes according to the u s energy information administration about 3 of oil and a total of 8 of oil and refined products used in the u s last year came from russia while about 25 of europe s oil is imported from russia the u s is the largest oil producer in the world other top producers are saudi arabia and russia demand for gasoline in the u s is up slightly from 8 74 million b d to 8 86 million b d total domestic gasoline stocks decreased by 2 2 million bbl to 228 6 million bbl last week according to the u s energy information administration eia increasing gas demand and rising oil prices have pushed pump prices higher pump prices will likely face upward pressure as oil prices remain above 100 per barrel quick stats oregon is one of 49 states and the district of columbia where prices have risen in the last week and 44

continues to have the most expensive pump prices in the nation with all seven states in the top 10 this is typical for the west coast as this region tends to consistently have fairly tight supplies

european union announced a proposal to ban russian oil imports within six months while refined product imports would be prohibited by the end of 2022 the price increases occurred despite continuing covid lockdowns in china weighing down crude demand and eia reporting that total domestic crude inventories increased by 1 3 million bbl to 415 7 million bbl which is approximately 14 percent lower

for a long time netflix insisted it would never interrupt its programming with commercials that was part of the service s appeal the movies were uncut and the tv shows came without breaks the better to binge things for hours upon hours but that was before netflix faced serious competition in the streaming video space mostly from services that do offer cheaper subscriptions for programming that is occasionally broken up by ads netflix also lost 200 000 subscribers in the first quarter of 2022 and it s said it expects to lose 2 million more this quarter which has sent their stock tumbling and so perhaps not surprisingly they are now looking to create a ad supported netflix tier and to do it quickly according to a netflix memo to employees reported by the new york times netflix plans to introduce its cheaper tier with commercial interruptions by the end of the year the move will presumably boost subscriptions and the ads will generate revenue as well netflix there was a period not that long ago when a netflix subscription was one of the best deals in entertainment for a couple bucks a month you got access to an enormous and varied library of movies and shows all available instantly but in the last few years netflix s library has shrunk and a lot of their more recent originals are just not on par with the content they lost plus their subscription prices have continued to rise their standard plan now costs a whopping 15 49 a month that s still cheaper than most cable packages but when you factor in how often you use the service and how many families feel the need to supplement it with other services like hulu or disney or hbo max you start to see why they might have lost a few subscribers recently a cheaper tier with some ads will likely attract some lapsed customers back and if you don t want the ads you can continue to pay more to watch without them but beware according to the times netflix is also planning to crack down on password sharing by the end of the year as well so if you re freeloading off your parents netflix account those days might be numbered netflix s most popular english language tv shows ever these are the most popular tv shows ever on netflix in english based on hours viewed in their first 28 days on streaming

the schedules accompanying this release summarizing welbilt s first quarter performance bill johnson welbilt s president and ceo stated third party net sales from continuing operations and organic net sales from continuing operations grew substantially this quarter compared to last year s first quarter which was materially impacted by the covid 19 pandemic our adjusted operating ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted operating ebitda from continuing operations margin performance were impacted from ongoing inflationary pressures from our supply chain and logistics providers productivity in our manufacturing plants was impacted by parts shortages from our suppliers high levels of covid 19 cases in our americas plants in january and a four week covid related plant shutdown in apac we successfully offset these headwinds with the beneficial impact from increased volume and positive net pricing industry conditions have improved with the rollout of covid 19 vaccines and the lifting of restrictions in some locations although improvements are uneven globally in response to ongoing supply chain challenges we continued to build inventory of critical components to help alleviate manufacturing disruptions and shorten order lead times to support our customers while the investment in higher inventory reduced free cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter we continue to have ample liquidity and strong leverage metrics net sales from continuing operations increased 31 5 percent in the first quarter compared to last year s first quarter excluding the impact from foreign currency translation organic net sales from continuing operations increased 33 4 percent with strong growth coming from general market dealers and distributors large chain customers and kitchencare master parts distributors and factory authorized service dealers over 75 percent of the growth in the first quarter was from higher volume versus increased pricing this growth is compared against last year s weaker first quarter which was highly impacted by the covid 19 pandemic the first quarter adjusted operating ebitda from continuing operations margin of 12 1 percent was 230 basis points higher than last year s first quarter driven by the incremental impact on margins from higher volume and positive net pricing partially offset by higher material and manufacturing costs and increased selling general and administrative expenses net of adjustments to sg a that are included in our adjusted operating ebitda from continuing operations reconciliation net sg a net sg a costs increased primarily due to higher commissions and increased travel expenses related to the sales growth in the quarter liquidity and debt net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations in the first quarter was 49 9 million compared to 20 4 million in last year s first quarter net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations in the first quarter was 3 1 million compared to 4 0 million of net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations in last year s first quarter free cash flow from continuing operations a non gaap measure was a 50 9 million use of cash in the quarter compared to a 24 4 million use of cash in last year s first quarter the decrease in free cash flow from continuing operations in the first quarter versus last year s first quarter reflects an increase in cash used in operating assets and liabilities primarily to support higher inventory levels to help mitigate ongoing supply chain disruptions capital spending in continuing operations was 3 1 million in the first quarter compared to 4 0 million in last year s first quarter during the quarter total debt and finance leases including the current portion increased by 69 8 million as of march 31 2022 our total global liquidity was 342 2 million consisting of 138 9 million of cash and cash equivalents and 203 3 million available for additional borrowing on our revolving credit facility compared to total global liquidity of 407 6 million as of december 31 2021 cash and cash equivalents includes the cash balances and equivalents from our continuing operations of 108 3 million and 91 6 million as of march 31 2022 and december 31 2021 respectively and cash included in discontinued operations of 30 6 million and 42 6 million as of march 31 2022 and december 31 2021 respectively additional management commentary we are pleased with our first quarter results in light of ongoing supply chain and production disruptions and inflationary pressure on materials and logistics costs said bill johnson in the americas sales to general market dealers and distributors increased strongly over last year s weak market conditions sales to strategic qsrs and fast casual operators increased over last year with improved demand for replacement equipment and stronger rollout activity by large chains across many of our brands kitchencare aftermarket sales decreased slightly in the americas due to timing of orders from master parts distributors both emea and apac saw year over year growth from strategic qsrs general market dealers and kitchencare aftermarket customers we believe overall demand will remain strong for the next several quarters as our commercial foodservice end markets continue their gradual recovery the combination of continued aggressive discretionary cost management improved absorption of fixed costs due to higher volumes and improved net pricing allowed us to deliver an adjusted operating ebitda from continuing operations margin of 12 1 percent in the first quarter with the tools we developed as part of our completed transformation program we will focus on continually improving productivity in our plants and working on other initiatives to help offset production disruptions parts shortages and inflation from our supply chain and logistics providers we remain confident that our operational improvements along with our recent and upcoming price increases to help offset inflationary pressures will deliver improved margins in 2022 concluded johnson about welbilt inc welbilt inc provides the world s top chefs premier
