oral presentation at american society of hematology ash annual meeting highlights continued favorable safety and tolerability profile and sustained long term efficacy results for serpinpc 93 reduction in median abr for both all bleeds and spontaneous joint bleeds in highest dose tested no thromboembolic events or treatment related sustained elevations of d dimer observed pivotal program for serpinpc in hemophilia b advancing present 5 observation study to begin in the coming weeks boston and london dec 10 2022 globe newswire centessa pharmaceuticals plc nasdaq cnta today announced new data from an additional 18 months of continued treatment with serpinpc an investigational subcutaneously administered novel inhibitor of activated protein c apc from the open label extension ole of the phase 2a study of serpinpc for hemophilia the ole data were shared today in an oral presentation at the american society of hematology ash annual meeting the ole data show a continued favorable safety and tolerability profile for serpinpc including at a higher dosing regimen as well as sustained long term efficacy results as measured by a reduction in the all bleeds annualized bleed rates abrs consistent with data from the six month repeat dose portion of the phase 2a study there were no thromboembolic events and no treatment related sustained elevations of d dimer observed throughout the 18 month ole period reported on today d dimer is a sensitive measure of excess thrombin generation in addition there were no serpinpc related adverse events during the ole period serpinpc s continued favorable efficacy safety and tolerability profile with subcutaneous dosing throughout the ole period including a dose 2x higher than that previously administered during the initial six month phase 2a study are very encouraging and have the potential to meaningfully differentiate serpinpc from other treatment options and product candidates in development said saurabh saha md phd chief executive officer of centessa we re now advancing the present pivotal program for serpinpc which includes elegantly designed studies focused on bringing this potential therapy to individuals with hemophilia b with and without inhibitors as quickly as possible subject to regulatory approval antoine yver md msc chairman of development of centessa added with a total exposure of over 40 patient years across multiple dosing regimens with serpinpc these encouraging new long term data add further weight to the durability of effect and sustained safety and tolerability observed to date in severe hemophilia we are excited that these data support the potential of serpinpc s new mechanism of action to provide a clinically meaningful subcutaneous therapy to people with hemophilia b who have high unmet need and limited options we would like to extend our sincere thanks to everyone involved in this study including the patients investigators and site coordinators phase 2a study and

one of the most memorable images of retired chinese supreme leader jiang zemin who has died aged 96 was of his dramatic re appearance during celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the people s republic of china in 2009 as the tanks and rocket launchers rolled past chang an avenue jiang s face behind his trademark thick framed glasses was a mask of defiance his dogged ability to battle his way into favour and hold on to influence within the old guard at the top of the party very much characterised the trajectory of his political career jiang played a prominent role in the celebrations even though it was presumed he had been finally cast into the political wilderness after he held on to various positions of power including head of the army which complicated president hu jintao s ascent to the pinnacle of power in the communist party born in the city of yangzhou in jiangsu province he studied in nanjing then graduated from the electrical engineering department of jiaotong university in shanghai before transferring as a trainee in the stalin automobile works in moscow in 1955 he then served his time in the first automobile works in changchun one of the giants of china s engineering sector jiang s wife wang yeping also comes from yangzhou and they have two sons jiang mianheng and jiang miankang well known for his ability to successfully outflank his rivals he proved adept at imposing himself on the bureaucracy and worked his way up to become minister of electronic industries in 1983 and a full member of the all powerful nine man politburo in 1987 in 1985 he became mayor of shanghai and head of the party there and it was from here that he was chosen by then supreme leader deng xiaoping as a replacement for reformer party boss zhao ziyang ousted for sympathising with the democracy movement crushed by the army in beijing in june of that year and prompting an internal power struggle that nearly tore the party apart he always said that the tiananmen square crackdown was essential to maintain stability in china but at the same time the fact that dissent in shanghai on his watch had been dealt with without bloodshed meant he was a less controversial figure than other senior party figures jiang waves to the crowds after he was met by cuba s president fidel castro at havana airport reuters he was expected to be a transitional figure a safe pair of hands as the party steered its way along a path of economic reform but he showed remarkable political nous and held on to power for 12 years and continued to wield influence as chair of the powerful central military commission for several years after he had been expected to cede it to hu under jiang s tutelage china had its longest period of stable economic growth under communist rule entered the world trade organisation and won the right to host the 2008 olympics he marshalled the peaceful handover of hong kong from britain to china as well as that of macau from portugal but kept up the party s firm line on not tolerating any talk of taiwanese independence jiang also orchestrated the crackdown on the falun gong spiritual movement performers travel past tiananmen square next to a float showing jiang during a parade marking the 70th founding anniversary of the people s republic of china in 2019 reuters while no one could ever have called jiang a liberal he did stand out as a modernising element within the party structure particularly on economic matters he was instrumental in reforming china s giant state owned enterprises jiang s three represents political theory which effectively provides a framework to allow capitalism a place within the marxist leninist party ideology has been written into the party constitution alongside the hallowed mao zedong thought and deng xiaoping theory securing jiang a place in china s socialist pantheon legacy is a big factor with former leaders the current leadership is trying to cement its own legacy at a national party congress nine years ago he positioned a grouping of his close allies into the politburo which meant his influence remained strong after he was supposed to have stepped down jiang and queen elizabeth ii pose for a photograph before a state banquet at buckingham palace in 1999 ap many commentators have remarked how the engineer lacked the charisma of the great helmsman mao zedong or economic reformer deng xiaoping but compared with the blue suited leaders hu jintao and wen jiabao who carefully nurture images of functional technocracy he was quite a personality he was also clever at giving himself plenty of profile abroad and he seemed to particularly enjoy his trips to europe and america during his time in power he fostered ties with the united states but he was not averse to a bit of populist sabre rattling such as during the time a us spy plane was forced to make an emergency landing in china after colliding with a chinese fighter jet sent to intercept it and during the furore following the nato bombing of the chinese embassy in belgrade always fond of things american ringing the bell at the new york stock exchange and giving a speech at harvard university jiang reportedly knew the gettysburg address by heart and was fond of john wayne his rendition of elvis presley s love me tender at a meeting in manila with then philippines president fidel ramos is legendary he also rode in a pick up truck through president george w bush s crawford ranch a lover of literature especially poetry jiang was musical playing both the chinese erhu an instrument similar to the violin and the piano however once he stepped down from the leadership of the army his power inevitably waned his traditional power base was in shanghai and jiang was believed to have suffered from the removal and prosecution for corruption of one of his allies in the so called shanghai clique chen liangyu the former party boss of shanghai in 2006 as his last big public outing showed at the bombastic celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of the communist revolution jiang could still pull off the occasional power play he is survived by his wife and two sons jiang zemin former president and communist party chief born 17 august 1926 died 30 november 2022

for hunter while boasting strong ties within the chinese art market a worrisome fact due to the biden family s business schemes in communist china joe biden s potential conflict of interest is not the only issue that comer is investigating comer s committee is also investigating hunter for money laundering one of nine potential violations money laundering in the art world was identified as a major issue by a bipartisan senate investigation last year cnn business reported the senate report details how a pair of russian oligarchs with ties to russian president vladimir putin allegedly seized on the secrecy of the art industry to evade sanctions by making more than 18 million in high value art purchases this is just the tip of the iceberg investigators for the permanent subcommittee on investigations told reporters on a call the art world is considered to be the largest legal unregulated industry in the united states according to the senate investigation the rotenberg example and many other investigation details highlight the fact that unlike selling stock or making routine bank transfers art sales through auction houses are not subject to anti money laundering provisions in the bank secrecy act when art is sold according to the report sellers are not required to confirm the identity of the buyer nor to make sure the artwork isn t being used to launder dirty money secrecy anonymity and a lack of regulation create an environment ripe for laundering money and evading sanctions a 2020 senate subcommittee report found former white house press secretary jen psaki has defended hunter s art scheme with anonymous art buyers as reasonable claiming hunter is not involved in the sale or discussions about the sale of his art and that hunter will not be informed of who is purchasing his art hunter s art dealer has also claimed he would abide by ethical standards and not sell hunter s artwork to anyone who seems suspicious this is an absurd solution breitbart news senior contributor and profiles in corruption author peter schweizer told breitbart news the only way to address these issues is with greater transparency not less he continued their proposed solution is greater secrecy not transparency and they are essentially saying trust us joe and hunter biden s track record on such matters gives us no reason to trust them in 2018 and 2020 breitbart senior contributor and government accountability institute president peter schweizer published secret empires and profiles in corruption each book hit 1 on the new york times bestseller list and exposed how hunter biden and joe biden flew aboard air force two in 2013 to china before hunter s firm inked a 1 5 billion deal with a subsidiary of the chinese government s bank of china less than two weeks after the trip schweizer s work also uncovered the biden family s other vast and lucrative foreign deals and cronyism breitbart political editor emma jo morris s investigative work at the new york post on the hunter biden laptop from hell also captured international headlines when she along with miranda devine revealed that joe biden was intimately involved in hunter s businesses appearing to even have a 10 percent stake in a company the scion formed with officials at the highest levels of the chinese communist party follow wendell husebø on twitter wendellhusebø he is the author of

the long shadows of mortality have swept across the lonely sagebrush flats of california s white mountains claiming the life of a wild and elusive legend for three decades a mustang named campito roamed wild and free in this windswept wilderness range best known as home to the oldest living thing on earth the bristlecone pine advertisement news has come from the u s forest service that this legendary mystery horse now belongs to the ages campito s remains were found by a hiker and confirmed by usfs biologist kary schlict according to lisa cox acting public affairs officer for inyo national forest in bishop it appears the wild horse enjoyed a final summer in the meadows of the white mountains before passing away in august hopefully campito slipped away peacefully in a soft summer meadow in this wild place he chose to live advertisement i had the pleasure of sharing the wilderness solitude of the white mountains with campito several times over the years but only learned some of his story a little over a year ago through social media campito s life is one rich in mystery and lore consistent with any good tale of the wild west the legend only grew as social media allowed the sharing of his sightings this silky black stallion with the white forehead blaze became a summer fixture at nearly 12 000 feet in the sagebrush flats of the white mountains advertisement fortunate visitors might catch a distant glimpse as he grazed in the meadows near his namesake campito mountain no one seems to know where campito spent the harsh winters in many of california s wilderness fringes there are herds of wild horses but campito was not part of a wild horse herd he chose a solitary life occasionally he was seen with a companion but mostly campito was the solitary king of his domain advertisement compared to the eastern sierra just a few miles to the west the white mountains see very few visitors the single dirt road into the area is the highest elevation public road in california and takes visitors to the ancient bristlecone pine forest and visitor center the white mountain wilderness moon like landscape is a photographer s paradise ernie cowan for the san diego union tribune this is a harsh place with storm winds of 100 mph or higher below zero winter temperatures ancient pines twisted by the severe elements and sparse vegetation advertisement the twisted bristlecone pines and trackless moon like landscape at higher elevations are a photographer s paradise the opportunity to see an elusive wild horse was always a bonus my first encounter with this phantom creature was in the late 1990s but over the years i saw him several more times he was tolerant but wary never letting me get very close such a regal sight to see advertisement as the legend of campito began to grow on social media his story further emerged in response to a photo of the horse and an online question asking if anyone know about him it was don chambers a resident of bishop and a board member of the eastern sierra interpretive association that first began to provide information chambers told of a freeze brand that identified campito as being born in 1991 to the buckhorn wild horse herd of lassen county freeze brands instead of traditional fire brands were applied by the federal bureau of land management that manages the wild horses advertisement the buckhorn herd is thought to have originated from spanish stock mixed with escaped ranch animals and u s cavalry horses prior to and during world war i records also showed that campito was captured in 1995 and adopted in 1996 by someone near susanville but information after that is unclear there are vague accounts of campito s history but very little factual information the only sure truth is we know he adopted the white mountain wilderness as home advertisement there are stories and legends about campito from how he made his way to the whites to where he goes in winter i ve not been able to confirm any of these and sometimes legends should remain chambers said i also came across oceanside resident jim summers who developed a relationship with the mustang during several encounters over more than 20 years he provided me with additional information initially campito was wary when summers approached but that changed when he offered an apple advertisement i held it out but he would not come in close to get it so i eventually rolled it to him summers said campito only watched but the apple was gone when summers returned the next day during subsequent trips carrots and more apples were brought by summers and it became apparent the mustang recognized him summers said the horse would come when he called his name and follow him around but continued to stay at least 15 feet away advertisement campito s story got even more intriguing when summers met a california department of fish and wildlife biologist who confirmed some of the stories of the horse s history according to the biologist campito had been part of a high sierra pack string but escaped during a trek into the high country this wild spirit was again free and unbridled advertisement i have admired his solitary life the freedom strength spirit and romance he personified this magnificent creature of the wind had chosen a life without boundaries and survived in a place where even plants are challenged to grow i felt a reverence whenever meeting campito in his harsh wilderness home campito lived 31 years a good long life for a wild horse that generally lives 25 to 30 years advertisement his hoof prints will no longer be found in the dust of campito meadow but his spirit will ride on the winds of the high country campito lived and died in a place he loved and my life is enriched from having met this beautiful mustang my heart aches at his loss advertisement knowing his days were short i had planned a summer trip this year to visit him once again but life got in the way i wish i could have said

seattle for many of the thousands of seattle tech workers who ve been laid off or will be in coming weeks the pain will be short lived they ll update their résumés work their networks and eventually find new jobs in an industry that despite the current slowdown is expected to be short on talent for years to come but for the newly jobless techies who also happen to be foreign nationals those pink slips may pose a much bigger problem laid off employees who have been here as guest workers on temporary work visas may be forced to leave the us if they aren t rehired in 60 days that has left hundreds and possibly thousands of workers scrambling for jobs at a moment when many local tech companies aren t taking their calls it s stressful not only for myself but for my family said a worker who was just cut from amazon under the rules of his visa type he his wife and their children must leave unless he finds a suitable new role at amazon a company that he notes is reportedly planning to cut 10 000 positions there was no point in trying to stay said a european who was laid off from the seattle offices of facebook parent meta and has opted to move home after assessing the job market both workers asked not to be identified to protect future job prospects and severance packages their livelihoods and to a large degree their stability are now totally in flux said kaj pedersen who came to the united states from england on a temporary work visa and is now chief technology officer at astrumu a kirkland based artificial intelligence firm with many foreign staffers in such uncertain times pedersen said you re going damn i ve got to give up everything i ve just worked for and go back and restart it s not yet clear how many of the estimated 18 000 layoffs reported at seattle area tech firms affect employees holding a temporary work visa or waiting for a permanent resident green card washington state doesn t break out job losses by visa status and individual employers don t typically share how many of their foreign employees were laid off but given the large volume of foreign workers who stream into the seattle area tech sector each year under various temporary work programmes the number who ve just lost those jobs could be substantial said tahmina watson a seattle immigration attorney it s unprecedented at this scale said watson who has been fielding calls from newly jobless foreign tech workers the anxiety level is just skyrocketing since 2009 amazon has filed more than 26 000 petitions to hire or rehire foreign workers on h 1b visas the most common work visa which allows skilled foreigners up to six years at jobs requiring a bachelor s degree or higher microsoft has filed more than 18 000 h 1b petitions in that same period another common visa the l 1 lets employers temporarily transfer workers from their foreign operations to their us offices amazon and microsoft declined to comment on the number of foreign workers they ve hired or laid off foreign workers have also played important roles at other firms with seattle headquarters or operations including tech firms such as expedia twitter google facebook and zillow as well as nontech firms with growing digital operations such as nordstrom and starbucks in 2021 nearly 70 of all h 1b visa holders worked in computer related jobs according to federal statistics the most common birth country was india 74 followed by china 12 4 nearly three quarters were male and 55 had a master s degree nationally the average salary for h 1b holders was us 108 000 federal data shows but salaries ranged from around us 120 000 to around us 150 000 at several larger seattle are tech firms according to a commercial site that tracks us visa statistics now as layoffs sweep many of those seattle area tech firms hundreds and possibly thousands of temporary workers may be at risk of losing both their current livelihood and potentially any prospects they had for a longer stay joblessness can also derail efforts to get permanent residence and all that can happen with a single phone call or email from hr workers say you go from my work and my life is in seattle to well i m returning to my home country where i haven t lived in you know years the former meta worker said for many foreign workers such a fate may feel especially undeserved since the 1990s skilled foreign workers helped us tech firms grow rapidly despite a historic shortage of qualified us born applicants said gaurav khanna an assistant professor and expert in immigration labour economics at the university of california san diego in washington state roughly 30 of all stem jobs those centered on science technology engineering or math were filled by foreign born workers the fourth highest percentage in the united states as of 2019 according to the american immigration council much of the us tech boom would really not have existed without the influx of immigrant labour khanna said but foreign tech workers often pay a steep price to participate in the us job market in exchange for high us salaries fat stock options and a potential pathway to us citizenship foreign workers endure an application process that is lengthy and uncertain in 2022 the us government received more than 480 000 applications for just 85 000 h 1b visa slots issued via a lottery indeed despite temporary workers large role in washington s tech sector they account for only a small fraction of the state s roughly 1 1 million foreign born residents once here temporary foreign workers may face exploitation though temporary workers must be paid the prevailing us wage their desire to remain employed and avoid visa complications is so strong they re often willing to work longer hours and do all the other things that are demanded of them khanna said and of course temporary foreign workers who lose their jobs anyway face a daunting bureaucratic gantlet even in a healthy economy 60 days is barely enough time for a temporary worker to land a new job for starters they need to find an employer willing to deal with all the necessary regulations and paperwork watson said their job search may be slowed further by the lack of a strong professional network they haven t necessarily had the time to really build those strong relationships because they re just trying to figure out how do i live in the us day to day taxes and living accommodations and getting to work and doing my job said pedersen the h 1b worker turned chief technical officer at astrumu in a tight labour market all those challenges are magnified jobless temporary workers hoping to stay in the seattle area these days must compete with thousands of others for a much smaller pool of job openings economists and business leaders say what s more in a tight labor market fewer employers will take on the red tape and other complexities of immigration law said scott railton a bellingham based immigration attorney who works with seattle area employers unless a temporary worker has especially in demand skills he said an hr department certainly would go with the us worker jobless foreign workers aren t without options they can try to buy time by for example applying for a visitor s visa while they look for work they can leave the us and restart the visa process once they find a new employer to sponsor them those who stay past 60 days risk penalties including in extreme cases not being allowed back in the us for several years others however may choose to go to other countries such as canada where immigration regulations can be less daunting that possibility worries many us industry officials and economists who argue that us demand for tech talent will likely continue to outstrip the supply of qualified domestic candidates another concern without changes in immigration law doubling the 60 day window for example the problems many foreign workers are facing now in the us may dissuade others from betting on america in the future what if graduates in india and china look at things like this and say well it s not a great idea to go to the us and i d rather work in google s office in mumbai or beijing or work in canada or australia said the university of california s khanna for now though the allure of a us job and the life and opportunities that come with it remain a powerful foghorn for immigrants for areas like silicon valley and seattle pedersen said indeed the draw remains potent even for some workers who may have to leave the us in coming weeks and start the process all over if there s a good opportunity i ll choose the us again said the former amazon worker who appeared not to hold a grudge against an immigration system poised to uproot him and his family if you want to work to the united states he said then you have to follow the rules the seattle times tribune news service

biden s rule paves the way for your 401 k savings to be put into what is called esg funds team biden s 401 k heist could raid your retirement for a woke agenda by betsy mccaughey president biden is threatening the returns of 401 k savings accounts risking millions of workers comfortable retirements if you put money into a 401 k beware until now the law always required fund managers entrusted with your savings to invest the money where it s expected to get the top profit for you period but late last month biden s labor department announced a rule change that goes into effect at the end of january it will allow fund managers to invest your money in the stocks of companies that favor left wing policies even if they earn a lower return it s legalized theft the future earnings on your retirement nest egg are being sacrificed to advance a woke agenda a lower return means you ll have to work more years before retiring or start putting more into your 401 k or settle for a lesser standard of living in the final years of your life biden s rule paves the way for your 401 k savings to be put into what are called esg funds but you can stop it from happening if you re vigilant what is esg e stands for environment s for social justice and g for governance meaning who gets hired or put on the company board esg funds generally invest in companies that oppose fossil fuels support unionization and stress gender and racial diversity over merit from the worker s point of view esg stands for expect slower growth these funds charge higher fees and often produce lower returns especially now when oil company profits and stocks are soaring while the tech companies esg funds tend to favor are doing poorly two aspects of the labor department s rule should cause you to worry both reverse worker safeguards the trump administration adopted first donald trump s labor department stated that fund managers are obliged to put pecuniary considerations above other issues such as politics they could consider non pecuniary issues only as a tie breaker when two companies pose the same risks and opportunities for investors biden s labor department eliminated that standard saying it had a chilling effect on esg sales the biden rule says 401 k managers are not prohibited from selecting the investment or investment course of action based on collateral benefits other than investment returns politics can take priority the regulation cites biden s goal to prioritize both environmental justice and the creation of well paying union jobs the rule blathers on about the vague benefits of unionization but the authors produce zero evidence that unions improve returns for investors only 9 of the us private sector workforce is unionized biden is determined to increase that by making the 6 8 trillion held by 401 k plans more available to union companies than non union ones the second worrisome switch is that biden makes esg funds eligible to be the default fund when a worker doesn t choose one the trump administration banned that biden s rule will push more workers unwittingly into these funds biden s doing an end run around democracy trying to change corporate america without having to pass laws in congress companies need investment capital the more 401 k money is controlled by esg funds the more pressure can be put on companies to adopt the esg agenda climate change diversity and unionization whether they like it or not biden s buddies on wall street will do the financial arm twisting democrats invented ballot harvesting now they re on to 401 k harvesting biden s rule eventually will be challenged in court and probably struck down the labor department characterizes it as a mere clarification of the 1974 law congress enacted the employee retirement income security act that requires 401 k retirement plan sponsors to act solely in the interest of savers in truth the new rule reverses erisa the labor department is trying to do what only congress has the power to do in the meantime employees should avoid getting stuck in an esg plan unless they re willing to sacrifice their retirement to advance a left wing political agenda elon musk nailed it tweeting esg is the devil

karachi banks lending to private sector nosedived as it fell 16 times during the first five months of 2022 23 as compared to the same period last year prevailing political instability rising inflation and a record high interest rate is understood to have put the cork on the flow of liquidity towards the private sector lending to this sector which in most economies is considered the main driving force behind the economic activities during the july nov period this year remained just rs27 5bn against rs470bn in the five months of the previous fiscal bankers believe that lending during this time of growing inflation and in the face of high interest rate could be devastating for their institutions since the default rate could go much higher and could put the financial sector in trouble analysts expect forex reserves to rise significantly by next month they fear that policymakers could go for further increase in the interest rate since they apparently consider it is the only tool available to them to control the bullish inflationary pressure however they seem to be oblivious to the fact that such a policy has not yet worked in pakistan despite very low lending to the private sector the state bank has increased the policy rate by 100 basis points to 16 per cent which slowed down the borrowing by the private sector and consequently further depressed the growth as if it was not enough jp morgan in an analysis it made two days ago said that pakistan needs to increase the interest rate by 400 basis points by the end of the fiscal year fy23 to calm down the inflationary pressure many businesses are concerned at the jp morgan s report that domestic interest rate may reach 20pc said faisal mamsa ceo of tresmark a terminal that tracks live prices of financial markets analysts were of the view that the recent hike introduced by the central bank in the interest rate had been done at the behest of lenders and does not translate into a trend he said they also mentioned that any rate hikes would be in response to how fed reserves of united states steers its dot plot an anticipated slowdown in raising rates by fed will make our regulators less hawkish especially if they are able to control the external deficit and inflation issue mr mamsa said tresmark estimates the country s reserves will dip below the 6bn mark next week on a positive side the terminal also estimates that arrangements being made by the government to improve the situation will materialise in the wake of change of command in the military leadership that took place late last month the government estimates to receive 1 2bn from chinese commercial banks 3bn from saudi arabia around 2 5bn from china 1bn from uae and around 1 5bn from developmental lenders including world bank said mr mamsa adding that this does not include any imf tranche or the deferred oil facility this should take the sbp held reserves to around 12bn by next month said mr mamsa sbp governor jameel ahmed recently said that the country would receive most of the inflows in the second half of the current fiscal year it may be mentioned that only 4bn inflows have been received in the first half of the fiscal so far panic among investors bankers said that a number of domestic investors and traders are trying to move out of the country after disposing of their assets the fear of default was minimised by the state bank with providing the possible inflows data and rollover expectations but the continuing political uncertainty is proving to be nerve breaking for many fearful investors and businessmen said a senior banker he said the us dollar had touched the rs255 mark in the hundi and hawala market which indicates that the demand for greenback is very high unless and until the government comes out with a long term programme showing strong commitment to domestic growth and assurance for no external default many local businesses will be closed and they may leave the country apprehended the banker published in dawn december 11th 2022

market rally was hitting new highs with the s p 500 above its 200 day line for the first time in months but as investors re evaluated the jobs report and fed chief powell s comments the major indexes retreated the s p 500 fell below its 200 day line while the nasdaq tested its 50 day both hit resistance at the 21 day line late in the week the russell 2000 tumbled below its 200 day and 21 day lines and came right down to its 50 day just undercutting its 10 week line the rally leading dow is holding support around its 21 day the s p 500 is basically where it was after nov 10 when a tame october cpi inflation report buoyed stocks the nasdaq and russell 2000 are back to those early november levels but also late october peaks if you had to design a scenario to lure investors in to get roughed up repeatedly this current uptrend might be the blueprint a market rally of a few big one day gains followed by pullbacks over several sessions it s still a confirmed market rally however further losses such as the nasdaq or especially the s p 500 clearly breaking their 50 day lines would be worrisome tuesday s november cpi inflation report and wednesday s fed meeting announcement and powell s comments could provide a catalyst for a sustained market rally or a decisive sell off but they also could spur yet another big market pop that seems decisive only to be followed by yet another pullback time the market with ibd s etf market strategy what to do now investors should be wary of adding exposure until the cpi inflation report and fed meeting are in the rearview mirror even if markets jump on the inflation data and fed chief powell s comments investors should be selective about new buys in case the major indexes simply fall back over the next several sessions at some point

the real goal of fed policy breaking inflation the middle class or the bubble economy there is no sense that inflation is coming down said federal reserve chairman jerome powell at a november 2 press conference this despite eight months of aggressive interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening on november 30 the stock market rallied when he said smaller interest rate increases are likely ahead and could start in december but rates will still be increased not cut by any standard inflation remains much too high powell said we will stay the course until the job is done the fed is doubling down on what appears to be a failed policy driving the economy to the brink of recession without bringing prices down appreciably inflation results from too much money chasing too few goods and the fed has control over only the money the demand side of the equation energy and food are the key inflation drivers and they are on the supply side as noted by bloomberg columnist ramesh ponnuru in the washington post in march fixing supply chains is of course beyond any central bank s power what the fed can do is reduce spending levels which would in turn exert downward pressure on prices but this would be a mistaken response to shortages it would answer a scarcity of goods by bringing about a scarcity of money the effect would be to compound the hit to living standards that supply shocks already caused so why is the fed forging ahead some pundits think chairman powell has something else up his sleeve the problem with demand destruction first a closer look at the problem shrinking demand by reducing the money supply the money available for people to spend is considered the fed s only tool for fighting inflation the theory behind raising interest rates is that it will reduce the willingness and ability of people and businesses to borrow the result will be to shrink the money supply most of which is created by banks when they make loans the problem is that shrinking demand means shrinking the economy laying off workers cutting productivity and creating new shortages driving the economy into recession demand has indeed been shrinking as evidenced in a november 27 article on zerohedge titled the consumer economy has completely collapsed it s a ghost town for holiday shopping everywhere but retailers have cut their prices about as far as they can go while the rate of increase in producer costs is slowing those costs are still rising and retailers have to cover their costs to stay in business whether or not they have customers at their doors rather than lowering their prices further they will be laying off workers or closing up shop layoffs are on the rise and data reported on december 1 showed that u s factory activity is contracting for the first time since the lockdowns of the covid 19 pandemic it is not just activity in shopping malls and factories that has taken a hit the housing market has fallen sharply with pending home sales dropping 32 year over year in october the stock market is also sinking and the cryptocurrency market has fallen off a cliff worse interest on the federal debt is shooting up for years the government has been able to borrow nearly for free by 2025 or 2026 according to moody s analytics interest payments could exceed the country s entire defense budget which hit 767 billion in fiscal 2022 that means major cuts will be needed to some federal programs breaking the fed put in the face of all this economic strife why is the fed not reversing its aggressive interest rate hikes as investors have come to expect former british diplomat and eu foreign policy advisor alastair crooke suggests that the fed s goal is something else the fed may be attempting to implement a contrarian controlled demolition of the u s bubble economy through interest rate increases the rate rises will not slay the inflation dragon they would need to be much higher to do that the purpose is to break a generalized dependency habit on free money danielle dimartino booth former advisor to dallas federal reserve president richard fisher agrees she stated in an interview with financial journalist and podcaster julia laroche maybe jay powell is trying to kill the fed put maybe he s trying to break the back of speculation once and for all so that it s the fed truly an independent apolitical entity that is making monetary policy and not speculators making monetary policy for the fed the fed put is the general idea that the federal reserve is willing and able to adjust monetary policy in a way that is bullish for the stock market as explained in a fortune magazine article titled the stock market is freaking out because of the end of free money it all has to do with something called the fed put for decades the way the fed enacted policy was like a put option contract stepping in to prevent disaster when markets experienced serious turbulence by cutting interest rates and printing money through qe since the beginning of the pandemic the fed had supported markets with ultra accommodative monetary policy in the form of near zero interest rates and quantitative easing qe stocks thrived under these loose monetary policies as long as the central bank was injecting liquidity into the economy as an emergency lending measure the safety net was laid out for investors chasing all kinds of risk assets the idea that the fed will come to stocks aid in a downturn began under fed chair alan greenspan what is now the fed put was once the greenspan put a term coined after the 1987 stock market crash when greenspan lowered interest rates to help companies recover setting a precedent that the fed would step in during uncertain times but the free money era seems to be over the regime change has left markets effectively on their own and led risk assets including stocks and cryptocurrencies to crater as investors grapple with the new norm it s also left many wondering whether the era of the so called fed put is over killing the parasite that is killing the host the fed put favors the rich investors in the stock market the speculative real estate market the multi trillion dollar derivatives market it favors what economist michael hudson calls the financialized or rentier economy money making money formerly called unearned income which drives up prices without adding productive value to the real economy hudson calls it a parasite which is sucking out profits that should be going toward building more factories and other economic development by backstopping the financialized economy the fed has been instrumental in widening the income gap of the last two decades pushing housing prices to heights that are unaffordable for first time homebuyers driving up rents and educational costs and crushing entrepreneurs dimartino booth explains fed policy feeds passive investing because you don t have to carefully allocate your resources you simply have to be long the nasdaq and sit there with your money what does that feed it feeds the monopolization of america the largest companies the companies such as google and microsoft if there is a competitor in their world they simply absorb them they acquire them which quashes the entrepreneurial spirit that made this country so great if the fed succeeds main street will be the main winner he trick here is for the fed to not break anything big and that s the delicate balancing act if they can slowly methodically take the rot out of the system without breaking anything big that forces them to pull back the rot in the system is particularly evident in the housing market since the financial crisis there s been a lot of private equity that s entered the space and snapped up all these homes and they re renting them it s definitely exacerbated this housing cycle it s added an element of speculation because so many of them are all cash buyers don t get me wrong they re levered it is borrowed money but they re coming in as all cash buyers and that i think created a lot of these massive bidding wars dimartino booth discusses the risk of derivatives contagion using the example of aig a giant insurance company brought down by derivatives exposure in 2008 during the financial crisis we rescued aig because we didn t want to actually see what it looked like on the other side of that cliff had derivatives actually been unwound and what that contagion might have looked like we never tested the derivatives market so that risk continues to lurk out there i m not a cheerleader for there being some kind of a systemic risk event and i do hope again that the fed succeeds in managing this unwind in seeing risk pulled out of the system but one company at a time not something that makes the global financial system implode financial blogger tom luongo takes this argument further he maintains that fed chair powell is out to break the offshore eurodollar market the speculative unregulated offshore money market where the world economic forum and old european money including mega funds blackrock and vanguard get the cheap credit funding their massive spending power that is a complicated subject which will have to wait for another article but the principle is the same without the backstop of the fed s virtually free dollars to satisfy a surge in demand for them these highly leveraged dollar investments will collapse leverage is an investment strategy that uses borrowed capital to increase potential returns the risk is that if the investment sours losses are also increased pushing until something breaks whether or not popping these raging speculative bubbles is the goal the fed s interest rate hikes are having that effect according to a november 25 2022 article on cnbc com interest rate hikes have choked off access to easy capital as a result investors have lost roughly 7 4 trillion based on the 12 month drop in the nasdaq house prices are also tumbling the third quarter of 2022 saw the biggest home equity drop 1 3 trillion ever recorded fortune magazine quotes moody s analystics before prices began to decline we were overvalued by around 25 now this means prices will normalize affordability will be restored in 2021 25 of all real estate purchases were being made by institutional investors in the third quarter of 2022 investor buying of homes tumbled 30 blackstone a real estate income trust notorious for buying up homes and turning them into rentals was reported on december 2 to be limiting withdrawals from its 125 billion property fund as investors rush for the exits george cipolloni portfolio manager at penn mutual asset management said the u s federal reserve s sharp interest rate increases have not worked all the way through the economy yet and that he expects to see more blackstone type news events coming forward in the next year in may 2022 blackrock stock blk was down 30 for the year and by november the cryptocurrency market cap had plummeted from 3 trillion to 900 billion with bitcoin its largest component down 77 year over year currently featured in the news is the crypto exchange ftx and its 30 year old billionaire owner sam bankman fried ftx was exposed as a ponzi scheme by the receding tide of dollar liquidity catching bankman fried and team swimming naked when the tide went out according to swiss bank ubs chief of investment ftx s collapse shows federal reserve tightening is crushing speculative assets outing ftx is thought to be only the beginning of a succession of exposures of financial frauds to come the delicate balancing act looked at in that light breaking the fed put sounds like a good idea but can it be done without breaking the whole economy more reputable establishments than ftx are at risk rate hikes seriously impact local retailers and wholesalers in september risky leveraged bets brought uk pension funds near to collapse forcing the bank of england to reverse course and lower its interest rates and there is the stress in the u s treasury which is dealing with an enormous interest tab on its debt other disturbing outcomes are being envisioned one podcaster posits that the economy is intentionally being driven to collapse at which point the government will declare a bank holiday as pres roosevelt did in 1933 when the banks reopen he says we will have a currency reset in the form of a central bank digital currency cbdc the concern is that it will be a programmable currency one that can be regulated or turned off altogether based on the user s social credit score as is already happening in china alarmed observers note that the new york fed recently embarked on a pilot project for a cbdc central bank digital currency but defenders point out that it is a wholesale cbdc used just for transfers between banks particularly overseas transfers settlement times of foreign exchange transactions typically take two days project cedar the new york innovation center s pilot project found that settlement for foreign exchange transactions using distributed ledger technology can happen in 10 seconds or less significantly reducing risks whether that technology will be developed and used by the fed has not yet been determined dimartino booth observes that powell and other fed officials have frequently questioned the need for a retail cbdc in which fed accounts would be opened directly with the public in a substack article titled a grand unified theory of the ftx disaster author and educator matthew crawford lays out a darker possibility that the end goal of the powerful network of players behind the ftx scheme is not just a u s cbdc but a global digital central bank run by international powerbrokers whether or not the federal reserve intended it aggressive interest rate hikes could expose this sort of parasitic corruption and remove the money machine that is its power source rising from the ashes meanwhile the supply side issues inflating the prices of food energy and other key resources need to be addressed those are matters for federal and state legislatures not the fed in the 1930s a federal financial institution called the reconstruction finance corporation pulled the economy out of the great depression put people back to work and crisscrossed the country with new infrastructure including the dams and power lines that brought electricity to rural america see my earlier article here the government acted quickly and decisively because times were desperate a bill for a national infrastructure bank modeled on the reconstruction finance corporation is now before congress h r 3339 for a local government bank a viable model is the publicly owned bank of north dakota which pulled that state out of a regional agricultural depression in the 1920s see here as an iconic depression era poster declared we can do it we just need to roll up our sleeves and get to work this article was first posted on scheerpost

damaged by shells and fire zelenskyy said in his nightly video address on friday naming cities hardest hit if russian forces capture bakhmut they could cut ukraine s supply lines and open a route to kramatorsk and sloviansk key ukrainian strongholds in donetsk according to the associated press russia has battered bakhmut with rockets for more than half of the year and shifted troops there for a ground assault after ukraine drove them from luhansk in july moscow has actually destroyed bakhmut another donbas city that the russian army turned into burnt ruins zelenskyy added in his friday night address attacks on infrastructure since october moscow has been targeting ukraine s power grid kyiv acknowledged friday that every thermal and hydroelectric power plant in the country had been damaged

of communications open in case an opportunity arises to end the war we are of completely different opinions nonetheless i will keep speaking with him because i want to experience the moment where it is possible to get out of this situation and that s not possible without speaking with one another he said according to reuters we have seen the brutality the russian president is capable of in chechnya where he basically eradicated the whole country or in syria there is no restraint there it s as simple as that scholz said scholz also defended his government s aim to raise defense spending to nato s goal of 2 of gross domestic output he said nato countries needed to be strong enough that nobody would dare to attack them russia iran military partnership iran has become one of russia s top military backers since the invasion of ukraine according to the british defense ministry intelligence update posted on twitter saturday iran s support of russia is likely to grow the ministry said because russia is attempting to obtain more weapons including hundreds of ballistic missiles in return russia is highly likely offering iran an unprecedented level of military and technical support that is transforming their relationship russia has highly likely expended a large proportion of its stock of its own ss 26 islander short range ballistic missiles which carry a 500kg warhead up to 500km the ministry said if russia succeeds in bringing a large number of iranian ballistic missiles into service it will likely use them to continue and expand its campaign of strikes against ukraine

american jobs increase pollution es pecially along the us mexico border and encourage u s companies to move to mexico to take advantage of cheaper labor opposition to the nafta is based not only on labor and environmental concerns but on accusations regarding political security and hum an rights conditions in mexico 1 for more information on environmental and labor issues relating to the nafta

pact the jouml of commerce march 1 1993 2 these include mexicos purported lack of democracy its poor human rights record ram pant corruption and a flourishing drug trade some who hav e made these charges are senators tom harkin of iowa and jesse helms of north carolina as well as representa tive charles range1 of new york these and other members of congress are not the only ones linking the cause of human rights to the nalta during his confirmation hearings before the senate foreign relationscommittee last january secretq of state warren christopher asserted that human rights and democracy will be the cornerstones of americas foreign policy in response to the criticism by najta op ponents the clinton administration is quietly urging mexican president carlos salinas de gortari to hasten the pace of political law enforcement and human rights reform in mexico salinas however already is making such reform a top priority his democr atic re forms have liberalized the mexican political system salinas also has imprisoned many federal police officials involved in drug trafficking and appointed as attorney general jorge carpizo former director of mexicos human rights commission and a s t aunch supporter of anti narcotics and anti corruption initiatives within the government more over he has waged an effective campaign against drug cultivation and traffkking inside mexico method of attacking these problem at their roots is by bringing me x ico closer to the u s and canada which the nafta will do better economic ties with its northern neighbors will help modernize mexican society thereby producing the stable democratic and pros perous country which nafta critics purportedly want the na l ta is a key element in pssident salinass modernization program and the pacts repudiation would be a seri ous setback for the causes of democracy and human rights in mexico a defeat of the nafta would embolden mexicos authoritarian opponents of political and economic re form it also could trigger an increase in the flow of drugs and illegal immigrants across the rio grande into the u s as mexicans turned to illegal drug trafficking and immigra tion as unemployment grew and as border cooperation between the two countries deteri orated while human rights security and political problems do exist in mexico the best correcting the record answering nafta critics political reform security issues and human rights unless they are answered satisfacto rily the nafta could go down to defeat in congress q how successful are salinass efforts to promote democratic and electoral reform critics of the nalta have raised a number of questions regarding mexicos record on in mexico a salinas is well known for his f r ee market revolution less well known however are his democratic reforms for example after taking office in 1988 in what critics charge were fraudulent elections salinas orchestrated the july 1990 passage of a new electoral law known as the federal c ode of electoral institutions and procedures cofipe this made possible the creation of a non partisan federal electoral institute ife to oversee elections and a multiparty federal electoral tribunal to settle election dis 2 putes salinas also mandate d preparation of a new voter registration list the issuance of new voter credentials and multiparty observation of polling stations on election days salinas executed other reforms as well last november for example he called for greater disclosure of campaign financing limits on election expenditures by his own institutional revolutionary party pri and equal access to the media for all political groups mexico s two main opposition parties cthe center right national action party pan and the leftis t party of the democratic revolution prd however argue that these reforms are inadequate they maintain that the pri uses state funds to promote its candidates and that its strong control over the mexican press gives it an unfair ad vantage while elec tion rigging still occurs in mexico the organization of american states and other outside observers concur that incidents of it are increasingly isolated and are not supported by the mexican government many of salinas s political reforms are paying off for mexico s ooposition parties the pan which often has supported much of salinas s free market and political re form program today controls three of the 3 1 state governorships baja california norte guanajuato and chihuahua only four years ago pri members occupied all the governors offices the july 1992 election of pan candidate francisco barrioter raza as governor of the northern border state of chihuahua has become a symbol of the salinas adm i nistration s efforts to democratize mexico s electoral system barrio terraza s election was not tainted by the usual fraud and intimidation that had plagued previous elections in the state of chihuahua reaching out to the opposition gubernatorial electi o ns held that same month in the prd stronghold of michoacan the home of former prd president cuauhtemoc cardenas were called free and fair by a team of impartial election observers that in cluded u s embassy officials and specialists from mexican and u s universities fol lowing months of protests however pri gubernatorial candidate eduardo villasenor who had defeated prd candidate cristobal arias in the election by a margin of two to one was forced to step aside only three weeks after he was sworn in to office the im petus for villasenor s ouster came from salinas himself the mexican president had sacrificed a pri governorship to prevent further chaos and violence and to reach out to the political opposition negotiations are underway between the pr i and the major opposition parties to launch a new round of electoral reform in mexico the new electoral law is likely to in corporate high priority opposition demands including electoral college reform and the addition of a third senatorial seat from e a ch state for minority parties in exchange pan and prd leaders will pledge to end all future post electoral protests this is the first time since salinas was elected in 1988 that the prd actually is participating in the political reform process if the g o vernment and opposition parties succeed in brokering a new electoral code it will be a major victory for mexican democracy 3 3 the office of the president of the republic of mexico the mexican agenda 1 lth edition april 1991 pp 69 75 3 q why is sal i nas promoting democratic reform a president salinas has pledged to transform mexico from a backward socialist and iso lated nation into a modem country fully integrated into the global economy salinas knows that mexico cannot escape the democratic and free market revolutions that have swept the globe especially in latin america salinas understands that in order to sus tain economic growth he has to liberalizethe mexican political system he also be lieves that only a strong executive branch of govern m ent can implement the many diffi cult free market reforms needed to modernize the mexican economy as the wall street journal noted last june 15 the government strategy is somewhat paradoxical mr salinas is using the sweeping powers of the mex ican chief executive to diminish the power of his successors salinas understandsthat political reform in mexico depends on the implementation of the nalta he is counting on the nafta to bring mexico the investment and trade it needs to continue growing e conomically for salinas the free trade pact will institutionalize his free market program and bind the hands of his successors who oth erwise might attempt to undo many of his accomplishments this being the case the best means to ensure that mexico s tays on course toward democratic reform is through closer ties to the u s if the u s congress defeats the free trade pact and isolates mexico it will inevitably weaken salinas who has staked his reputation on the agreement a defeat of the nalta also c o uld divert foreign in vestment from mexico and trigger a return to protectionist trade policies damaging mexicos economy if mexico remains a poor country its chances for genuine demo cratic development will be reduced greatly q what is salinas doing ab o ut human rights abuses in mexico a human rights violations have long been a problem in mexico since the mexican rev olution early this century the country has been ruled by a single party what is now known as the pri the pri has maintained political s tability through a mixture of polit ical patronage corruption and intimidation and repression of opposition groups the salinas administration has addressed human rights conditions directly the most important step to advance the cause of human rights in mexico was the june 6 1990 creation of the national commission for human rights cndh the cndh though linked administratively to the mexican secretariat of interior is financially and politically autonomous from the government it is tasked with invest i gating and issu ing recommendations on human rights complaints human rights issues and has sponsored approximately 350 training courses and semi nars on the need for safeguarding human rights the work of the commission has been supported and applauded b y international human rights groups including amnesty in ternational and is being modeled at the state level in mexico although human rights violations have not been eradicated there is some indication that measurable progress is being made according to the bureau of human rights and humanitarian affairs at the u s state department 588 police and other govem since its inception the cndh has published some 180 reports and studies on 4 ment employees in mexico have been disciplined for human rights c o mplaints since the cndh was founded of these criminal charges were brought against 246 state em ployees and investigations are still pending in 141 cases the cndh also was respon sible for the release last year of some 500 prisoners that it determined had been de tained illegally another measure taken by the salinas government to protect human rights was the creation of the so called pluralistic committee of citizens on march 12 19 92 this nine member citizens group represents various political par ties it was established by the office of the attorney general to review the daily activities of federal prosecutors and the federal judicial police its task is to ensure that human and constitutional rights are observed and respected by mexican law enfo r cement officials like the cndh the committee acts independently of the mexican government its responsibili ties include supervising conditions in mexicos federal prison system verifying that all detentions are carried out in a lawful manner reviewing the selection and promo tion procedures within the attorney generals office and the federal judicial police and developing new methods of reporting and reviewing complaints against public of ficials q how bad is mexican corruption and how will it affect t he nafta a allegations of corruption in mexico most recently made headlines when a british citi zen a broker for international business machines ibm in mexico charged that three government officials solicited over 1 million in exchange for their hel p in securing a government contract the contract was to supply the mexican communications and transportation secretariat with a new nationwide air traffic control and radar system this allegation represents a common but increasingly rare form of mexican c o nuption in which government officials seek bribes in return for contracts licenses or conces sions from the government a hard line against corruption in january 1989 he arrested joaquin la quina hernandez galicia head of the notoriously corrupt and pow e rful oil workers union on arms smuggling tax evasion and murder charges la quina had been considered untouchable by mexican officials soon thereafter salinas placed eduardo legorreta one of the pris most powerful leaders and the head of mexicos large s t brokerage firm behind bars for massive stock fraud the salinas administration also arrested mi guel angel felix gallardo and rafael car0 quintero drug kingpins linked to the tor ture and murder of u s drug enforcement administration dea agent enri que camarena salazar in 19 85 these attacks on crime and corruption were unprecedented for a mexican president and reflect a new attitude in mexico toward law

commerce caused by nafta will provide new opportun ities for drug traffickers to smuggle cocaine mari juana and heroin into the u s the s alinas administration understanding that such security related problems re quire strong action has sent a clear signal to the drug cartels in addition to the arrest of 86 000 individuals on drug related charges over the past four years mexican fed er a l police

drug traffickers 1 salinas has done more to fight the international drug problem than any of his prede cessors in 1992 the government of mexico seized nearly 40 metric tons of cocaine 213 pounds of he r oin and 405 metric tons of marijuana mexican anti narcotics author ities also destroyed some 16 944 acres of opium producing poppy plants and an esti mated 29 887 acres of marijuana under salinas the eradication of drug cultivation fields has increased by 30 percent annually to reach a total destruction of 21 1 624 acres of marijuana and poppy this means that 38 950 metric tons of marijuana and 37 metric tons of heroin never found their way to american streets moreover in 1992 alone mexican law enf o rcement officials arrested 27 577 individuals on drug related crimes formidable anti drug air fleet the salinas administration is placing special em phasis on the eradication of drug farming fields the efforts made to destroy drug crops in mexico have n o precedent anywhere in the

transpor tation and aerial phot o graphy mexican counternarcotics officials operate more than 150 aircraft including reconnaissance and spray helicopters as well as fuced wing air planes this makes it the largest anti drug air fleet in the developing world the num ber of personnel ass i gned to these missions is increased significantly during the peak growing season in the spring and early summer the result has been the destruction of 75 percent of the total estimated drug crop in mexico mexico s drug field eradication activities were especially successful in the first two months of this year compared to the previous year eradication of marijuana and poppy fields increased 88 percent and 34 percent respectively mexico s vigorous campaign against illegal drugs was highlighted in july 1992 when the government announced that it was taking over all of the costs of its coun ternarcotics programs these had been funded previously by the u s which appropri ated some 26 million in anti narcotics assistance for mexico in 19 92 under the new plan the salinas government will fund its own anti drug program by selling automo biles airplanes homes property and other assets seized from

dedicated to fighting international criminal activity might be channeled elsewhere moreover if investment in mexico is curtailed and exports to the u s limited in the wake of a nafta defeat mexican un employment will rise with increasing levels of unemployment and poverty more mexican s would turn to drug cultivation or trafficking to em a living this could in crease the amount of drugs being grown in mexico and sent to the u s a rejection of nalta also would hurt mexico economically hobbling the mexican q how will the nafta affect t h e problem of legal and illegal immigration a the u s a nation of immigrants continues to admit more foreign nationals than any other country in the world for many years large numbers of mexican workers have been coming to the u s legally or illegally in search of higher wages and a better life in 1990 for example there were approximately 4 5 million mexican born resi dents living in the u s this number which does not count all illegal aliens represents about 21 percent of all foreign born resident s germans with 1 2 million residents or 5 4 percent of total foreign born residents in the u s make up the second largest group 13 moreover in 1992 alone the u s border patrol arrested 1 2 millionpeople attempting to cross illegally into the u s from mexico 14 some such as california re publican representative duncan hunter and ralph naders public citizen lobbying group argue that the nafta will only invite more mexican immigration into the u s the naftas critics however are mistaken as economic growth in mexico leads to gal gains in wages and living standards some of the pressure to emigrate will sub side the nafta will mark the beginning of an unprecedented experiment in eco nomic integration the free trade pact will help raise mexican livin g standards through sustained economic growth the increase in foreign direct investment in mexico under a nafta is expected to be in the 25 billion to 52 billion range from 1992 to 2000 l5 according to the washington based institute for international eco n omics eco 13 u s mexico trade pulling together or pulling apart u s congress office of technology assessment january 1993 pp 1161 17 14 mexico respect restored the economist february 13 1993 p 4 8 nomic growth rates in mexico under the free t rade pact could reach as high as 6 per cent a year over the next decade this economic surge will produce an estimated 609 000 new jobs south of the border over the next ten years l6 many of the new jobs will be in rural areas and smaller cities this wi l l shift control from the bureaucrats in mexico city to entrepreneurs in the regions indeed one of the reasons mexico city is so large its population is around 20 million is because over centralization of the economy has led tormass migration from the co u ntryside to mex ico city once they are concentrated in mexico city the next step for mexico s poor is to look for a job in the u s according to marshall breger senior fellow and labor expert at the heritage foundation once mexican workers are uprooted from their homes in the search of better employment they are then more likely to continue mov ing northward looking for new sources of income decentralization of the mexican economy will stop this trend further once the nafi a is in place wages in mex i co are expected to grow by as much as 16 percent over the next several years 17 the al lure of higher paying and better quality jobs in mexico will convince many mexicans to stay at home and contribute to their own economy q what will be the long range p o litical consequences of a nafta defeat a the u s has a tremendous stake in the success of salinas and the nafta not only does the u s share a 2 000 mile porous border with its southern neighbor but mexico is a rapidly growing country with some 85 mil lion citizens at present growth rates mexico s population will increase to 100 million by the year 20 00 prolonged political and economic crises in mexico could cause an upheaval which according to some of cial estimates could result in as many as 10 m illion refugees fleeing to the u s this 18 would create enormous economic and social problems for american border states this dangerous scenario need not happen two nations that once were referred to as distant neighbors have developed over the past f our years into economic and politi cal partners relations are better today than at any time in history salinas and other mexican leaders will view a defeat of the nafta as a direct rejection of mexico by the u s government the increasingly cooperative ties developing between washing ton and mexico city may be damaged irreparably 15 investment trade and u s gains in the nafta u s council of the mexico u s business committee the council of the americas 1992 p 12 16 gary clyde hufbauer and jeffrey j schott nafta an assessmnr washington d c the institute for international economics february 1w3 17 for more information on the impact of the nafta on the mexican economy see potential impact on the u s economy and selected industries of the north american freetrade agreement us international trade commission january 1993 p viii 18 see michael g wilson the security component of us mexico relations heritage foundation buckgrounder no 688 january 26 1989 p 2 9 q how will the nafta help sp r ead economic prosperity and political stability throughout the americas a latin america is experiencing a free market revolution unparalleled almost anywhere in the world statist and populist regimes from mexico to argentina have given way to government s committed to free trade the privatization of state owned industry lower taxes and the free market deregulation of theeconomy latin america also is the fast est growing export market for the u s in the world u s exports to the region in creased 19 5 percent from 1991 to 1992 compared with 4 4 percent growth to the rest of the world with u s sales jumping in 1992 latin america and the caribbean was the only region where the u s had a trade surplus estimated at 886 million last year onein seve n dollars in u s exports now goes to latin america and the carib bean and u s businesses are extremely competitive in the region this trend has been accompanied by improvements in human rights conditions and a strengthening of re gional democracy toda y the only remaining dictatorship in this hemisphere is in cuba the spread of free trade policies in latin america and the caribbean began in ear nest following the 1990 decision by bush and salinas to launch free trade talks this trend was reinforced f ollowing bushs june 27 1990 declaration of his enterprise for the americas initiative eai under the leadership of the bush administration the u s proceeded to sign free trade framework agreements with every major country in the hemisphere except cu b a l9 if the nma is successful then other countries in the hemisphere will be eager to build upon these accomplishments and remain on the course toward economic reform regional leaders are confident that free trade agree ments with the u s will attract badly needed foreign investment and boost exports to the us these countries also see freer trade and economic integration as a way to resolve many of the regions other problems including drug trafficking terrorism environ mental degradation and milita r y unrest such leaders as carlos menem in argentina and patricio aylwin in chile have said that free market policies and ftas with the u s will help their countries sustain the economic growth needed to generate new jobs and raise living standards this they believe will ease many of the social tensions caused by poverty poor education inadequate health care and unemployment q what would a rejection of the nafta by washington do to its ties with the rest of the hemisphere a the nafta clearly is the driving force behind washingtons latin america and car ibbean policy if the nafia is defeated not only u s mexico relations would suffer so too would u s relations with the rest of latin america many governments in the 19 these agreements establish formal bilateral councils that monitor and analyze trade and investment patterns they also develop policy suggestions on how to further open markets between the two countries and negotiate agreements on such issues as intellectual property rights in ess e nce these framework agreements are an important means of paving the way toward free trade agreements 10 region will see a rejection of the nalta as a signal that the u s does not care about latin america and is unwilling or unable to follow through on its commitments such a move also will indicate that washington prefers protectionism to free trade latin american and caribbean leaders declare that regardless of what the u s does they will continue their historic process of free trade and economic int egration they also stress that they will turn to asian countries like japan south korea and taiwan for free trade agreements the result could be that the u s would become isolated from its natural and fastest growing export market u s exports thus w ould diminish job growth at home would be lost and america would become less competitive in the global marketplace conclusion the united states mexico and canada are on the brink of a new era with the nafta the three countries are poised to greatly e x pand their commercial and economic ties and to create a more prosperous and competitive north american economic commu nity the nafta promises to build the worlds largest and wealthiest market with some 360 million people and an economic output of over 6 trillion once approved the free trade pact also will help sustain progress in other vital areas of cooperation including anti narcotics efforts environmental protection immigration and human rights the u s has a choice by ratifying the nafta th e u s congress will not only keep us mexico relations firmly on track but help launch a free trade and free market revo lution throughout the rest of the americas if it is defeated us mexico relations almost certainly will sour and protectionism coul d once again emerge in the americas the re sult will be lost markets and jobs for the united states the free trade pact with the u s and canada will consolidate democracy and greater respect for human rights in mexico a defeat will remove one of mexicos principal in centives for reform linking internal reforms to external free trade policies under the best of circumstances the loss of nafta will strain bilateral relations and curtail coop eration in a wide variety of areas in the worst case a rejecti on of the free trade pact could trigger anti american hostility in mexico and even unleash political and economic instability south of the border either way not only the u s but all of latin america will be the loser michael g wilson senior policy analyst 11
berlin when amsterdam pioneered coffee shops in the 1970s the european capital was one of very few places where you could openly buy and smoke weed and it quickly became a global mecca for marijuana enthusiasts but over the last decade the grass has grown greener on the other side of the atlantic with colorado and washington state legalizing recreational cannabis use in 2012 and uruguay becoming the first country to legalize it the next year followed by canada in 2018 europe has fallen behind with the focus on decriminalization rather than full legalization but now germany is trying to become the first european union member to legalize cannabis its neighbors are watching closely in both curiosity and disapproval while the global marijuana industry eyes a new market of 80 million potential customers german health minister karl lauterbach has announced the outline of a possible cannabis law that roughly follows the canadian model declassifying marijuana as a narcotic creating a state licenced production delivery and sales system allowing adults to have 20 30 grams for personal use and creating a federal cannabis tax lauterbach set 2024 as a possible date for passing legislation the proposed law is a reflection of the ruling red yellow green traffic light coalition made up of the social democrats who see legalization as a way to free up law enforcement the free democrats fdp who see legalization as the key to unlocking more than 1 billion euros per year in taxes and the greens who want to undercut the illegal market the opposition parties are opposed to legislation with the bavarian health minister klaus holetscheck publicly seeking a veto from the european commission the one thing all sides agree on getting rid of the illegal marijuana market advertisement

do this is the type of operation both sides of the debate would like to see disappear but whether it can be done through legal competition or tougher police crack downs depends on whether or not the eu can reconcile germany s law with superseding european law and that s where it gets complicated the european union s drug policies are based on the 1961 united nations convention on narcotic drugs which compels members to take any measures necessary to restrict cannabis cultivation importation sale and consumption to strictly medical and scientific purposes germany s legal argument hinges upon not importing cannabis it hopes to use a 1988 un convention which allows for the decriminalization of personal use and cultivation for personal use in conjunction with a 1994 german constitutional court ruling that says states cannot interfere with personal drug use as long as it doesn t hurt anyone according to international drug policy expert martin jelsma of the transnational institute an international research and advocacy group that works with international lawyers to create paths for legalization the difference between enforcement tactics of the un and the eu is why marijuana legalization has yet to be seen in europe advertisement advertisement the un treaties do not themselves have a strong procedure to pressure governments into compliance jelsma says that is why uruguay

14 in the last week breaking a breakout from a cup base with a buy point of 358 72 before edging slightly above it a solid recovery from here could provide fresh entry especially if the 50 day or 10 week moving average catches up on a weekly chart gs stock has a 13 month cup with henkel basis with a buy point of 389 68 according to marketsmith analysis the past week has now created more depth on this hold which could also become a flat base in a week s time sanmina shares fell 7 3 to 62 48 last week sanm stock had firmly consolidated in the profit taking zone after a breakout in october from

averages with the 2nd december high of 957 as a trigger while mercadolibre stock is trending lower the weekly losses are on lower volume with some relatively strong positive closes analysis of the market rally a week ago the stock market rally hit new highs with the s p 500 breaking above its 200 day moving average for the first time in months but as investors reassessed fed chair powell s jobs report and comments major indices fell the s p 500 fell below its 200 day moving average while the nasdaq tested its 50 day moving average both met resistance at the 21 day moving average at the end of the week the russell 2000 plunged below its 200 day and 21 day moving average and came straight onto its 50 day moving average just undercutting its 10 week moving average the rally leading dow holds support for its 21st day the s p 500 is basically where it was after nov 10 when a weak october cpi inflation report boosted stocks nasdaq and russell 2000 are back to early november levels but also to late october highs if you had to come up with a scenario to entice investors to repeatedly overspend this current uptrend could be the blueprint a market rally with a few big daily gains followed by multiple session pullbacks it s still a confirmed market rally however further price losses would be worrying if for example the nasdaq or in particular the s p 500 were to break through its 50 day moving average tuesday s november cpi inflation report and wednesday s fed meeting announcement and powell s comments could provide a catalyst for a sustained market rally or decisive sell off but they could also trigger another major market bang that seems crucial only to be followed by another pullback time the market with ibd s etf market strategy what now investors should be wary of adding exposure until the cpi inflation report and fed meeting are in the rearview mirror even as markets jump on inflation data and fed chair powell s comments investors should be selective about fresh buying if major indices simply fall back in the next few sessions at some point a sustained steady market rally will begin when that happens buying opportunities will abound so get your shopping

the colorado plastic pollution reduction act takes effect jan 1 and will ban all plastic bags across the state chris dillmann vail daily archive starting january 1 2023 the town of vail will implement a new 25 cent bag fee for plastic bags in all grocery and retail stores the increased fee alongside other changes is part of a new ordinance passed on first reading by the town council to align the town s plastic bag regulations with colorado s plastic pollution reduction act in 2015 vail started a kick the bag habit program implementing with it a ban on plastic bags and a 10 cent fee on disposable paper bags at grocers over 4 000 square feet according to beth markham the town s environmental sustainability manager before the 2015 code change the two largest grocery stores in vail distributed around 4 5 million bags per year with the 2015 fee and ban the number of paper bags dropped to around 315 000 in 2020 and just over 430 000 in 2021 now with the july 2021 passage of the plastic pollution reduction act all municipalities in the state are being required to implement disposable bag bans and fees starting jan 1 2023 and rolling out through 2024 the act has four main components a required 10 cent plastic and paper bag fee starting jan 1 2023 for large grocery and retail stores a plastic bag ban for large groceries and retail stores starting jan 1 2024 stores will be allowed to use remaining plastic bag stock through june 1 2024 as long as the bags were purchased before jan 1 2024 a ban on polystyrene food containers and cups for restaurants and schools starting jan 1 2024 polystyrene containers purchased by jan 1 2024 may be used until gone starting july 1 2024 the state s ban on what local governments can regulate will be lifted meaning municipalities and counties can enact implement and enforce more stringent laws around plastic materials containers packaging and labeling it will be up to municipalities to enforce these fees and regulations support local journalism donate while the ordinance passed on first reading on tuesday by vail s town council is meant to repeal its current code and replace it with a new code that abides by the plastic pollution reduction act there are a few key changes between vail s new ordinance and what the state law requires the first is the fee itself while the law requires a 10 cent fee on paper and plastic bags municipalities are allowed to implement higher fees that said vail will be charging 25 cents per bag the idea with the increased fee is hopefully that would increase the behavior modification as well and really incentivize that behavior change markham said the second difference is in how the money from the fee will be allocated the state law indicates the split should be 60 to the municipality and 40 to the business however vail is reversing this split with 40 going to the municipality and 60 to the business currently the town is keeping 100 of the fees so under this split it will be receiving the same funding 10 cent per bag the businesses markham said will be able to use their 15 cent per bag split of the fee to help implement the program and offset the costs that might be related to that the town uses these funds for waste diversion programs and efforts including town cleanup days hard to recycle events and education programming the third and final difference is around which businesses will be required to implement the 2024 plastic bag ban and the 2023 imposed disposable bag fee the state law has exemptions for restaurants and small stores defined as those will three or fewer locations however as markham put it the town intends to only exempt restaurants at this time markham said that this decision came as a result of conversations with the business community and stakeholders so that the town closes the loophole on the small stores and that the ordinance is applied equitably across all retailers restaurants markham added expressed needing more time to be affected by the regulations the restaurants would greatly appreciate us giving them more time if we want to implement this in the future with them they were pretty vocal about not being included for the time being and maintaining the exemption she said while the majority of the town council approved this new ordinance with council member kevin foley dissenting and mayor kim langmaid absent from the meeting some council members did express frustration and concern over how the new regulations and fees would be received one frustration which stemmed from a concern the town has heard from local businesses according to markham was that businesses cannot cover the bag fee rather than charging customers the fee must be a line item on the receipt regardless of the purchase based on state regulation i feel like our hands are tied to do what the state has told us but i feel like it s at the expense of our guest and of our local business i don t like it i understand we have to do it said council member barry davis i m just not pleased with the limited options we have this ordinance will return before the council on tuesday dec 20 for its second reading after which the first changes will be rolled out on jan 1 2023 this is a pretty big step for the state as a whole markham said vail has been a leader in plastic bag reduction and waste diversion initiatives and we can continue to do so

a conceptual drawing of how a new field house fitness center hockey rink complex could be located on williams college s campus part of an ambitious plan for williams college s campus involves relocating some dorm beds and redoing one of the school s residence hall complexes previousnext williams college lays out concepts for potential campus changes williamstown mass williams college would see a reconfiguration of its dorms and radical changes to its athletic infrastructure if it follows the path laid out by an ambitious campus plan that grew out of a multi year strategic planning process a project manager from the college and an associate planner from boston design firm sasaki associates gave a presentation on tuesday to the town s comprehensive plan steering committee for the last year and a half or so we have been hard at work on our own campus framework planning effort which is the first large scale consolidated planning at a campus level that the college has endeavored in its long standing history williams keenan chenail told the committee this is a project that came up directly out of the strategic plan from the work of the built environment working group which identified a need for the college to have a little bit better idea of the strategic alignment of our overall capital dollars toward basically our physical infrastructure and how do we align the dollars we re putting to work in the buildings we have on campus with the aspirations of the institution as a whole chenail and sasaki s dorothy macausland stressed that the capital plan they presented is conceptual and by no means near the stage where the college will be seeking permits or breaking ground any time soon they also did not identify a timetable to implement any of the ambitious goals laid out in the plan our goal is to provide a guide book an outline for the college to design how to plan rather than a definitive list of projects macausland said these are what we consider potential projects she added at one point they are not approved by the college there is not funding allocated toward them we have just identified these projects as potential ways to address multiple needs the planning team s guide book is guided by a number of principles including sustainability which factors prominently in the proposal to take off line some of the school s oldest least efficient and smallest residence halls and move those beds into updated facilities one of the most noticeable changes on the conceptual designs is the elimination of prospect house a four story 104 bed residence hall near the college s lansing chapman rink we have heard that student housing has a long way to go in terms of accessibility macausland said we re working closely with the team working on energy and the carbon master plan thinking very carefully about sustainability of some of the smaller residence halls and whether they are operationally efficient a new opportunity would be to locate at dodd circle which we think would bring new life to that part of campus dodd circle is a cluster of dorms around dodd house a three story 76 bed dorm on mission park drive off southworth street on the north side of campus the planners recommend redoing the circle by renovating dodd tearing down two of the smaller dorms in the circle reusing two other small dorms for faculty offices and building an up to date 60 bed dorm and 111 bed dorm on the site we also took a look at the building stock we have chenail said you see a lot of big ticket items on this plan but core to this in principle is what is the best fit for the building stock we have we have over 160 buildings on campus and they re in varying states of the spectrum from repair to disrepair much more of the latter than the former and we don t need to get into that but understanding what a building is meant to do and where it can perform is really critical to the plan and to the success of not only this plan but the energy and carbon master plan the college is envisioning as well another big change in the life of the college s resident student population under the plan pitched on tuesday consolidating full service dining halls from their current three locations down to two a new cafeteria on the south side of campus to replace the nearby driscoll dining hall and expanded dining services at the paresky center in the middle of campus both of the new dining hall concepts entail changes that would be noticeable to the non resident population expanding dining services at paresky would mean an addition on the park street side of the building to increase the kitchen s footprint the planners concept for a new dining hall at the current site of prospect house is a three story structure with an elevator to accommodate pedestrians who need help navigating the grade change at that end of campus perhaps the most noticeable change for non students in the plan laid out on tuesday would affect one of the college s most public facing features its intercollegiate athletic program one of the big ticket changes in the plan is a replacement of the school s current field house and hockey rink building over the current parking lot alongside the current field house and creating parking below the new field house rink and fitness facilities the proposal is part of a health and wellness strategy that also would move the college s infirmary and counseling services from the thompson medical center and pond house off hoxsey street to the current lasell gym at the top of spring street lasell gymnasium does not function well for recreational programming and hosting athletic events macausland said we ve heard it s difficult to navigate and requires a lot of renovation and it s not accessible so what we re proposing doing in this district is moving integrated wellness services and medical services to a renovated lasell that really showcases williams commitment to the whole student and the well being of the student as well as members of the community the proposed field house fitness center rink complex would involve taking over land that currently houses the college s facilities department located across the parking lot from the current field house planning board member stephanie boyd asked the college s team where they saw the facilities shop relocating chenail said there were no solutions for that question that could be shared publicly williams is looking at its holdings and assets and looking at locations proximate to campus just not central to campus he said at another point select board member randy fippinger asked from the floor of tuesday s meeting whether the college had any plans to increase its footprint in the town through land acquisition i think the college is always interested in strategically acquiring properties in town that fit the mission of the college chenail said sarah gardner a member of the town s comprehensive plan committee and a professor of environmental studies at the college asked whether the developers of what is titled campus plan concepts did an analysis of whether their proposals added or subtracted from the current building inventory s square footage the planners said the concepts are not developed to that point but reiterated that principles of sustainability drive their effort we understand the tenet of no new net and we re working creatively to get there chenail told gardner the campus plan concepts presentation was framed around nine strategies labeled as its big ideas areas like establish a mixed use wellness district and foster a cohesive dining network idea no 2 on the list was reimagine route 2 as a cultural corridor amplifying the visibility and connectivity of arts culture and the institutional on both sides of macausland said so thinking of route 2 as a zipper rather than a divider the presentation gave no details on how that zipping could be accomplished other than referencing a previously announced plan to move the college s art museum from one section of main street lawrence hall to another the former site of the williams inn committee member don dubendorf said the college s plan to rethink the route 2 corridor is relevant to the town s development of a master plan i ve been around since 1970 and has been at once deeply appreciated and enjoyed and at the same time ignored by the town and the college almost intentionally ignored even as it is a celebrated feature of our town dubendorf said neither institution has been intentional about it sometimes we build buildings in the public right of way sometimes we plant trees without talking to each other and so on and so forth it should be a treasure the notion that we would take that more seriously is very powerful and i think it s something this committee should spend some time thinking about with the college we can t afford to ignore its potential as we have and take it for granted it s a shame we ve done it for so long tuesday s presentation to the comprehensive plan steering committee was still a work in progress but the team said a nearly completed work we are going to be presenting the campus plan to the board of trustees in january macausland said this will be close to the final plan and we ll present with the goal of having it approved at subsequent meeting in april

january and april she said i expect to obviously for it to be not as busy just with the weather in michigan and things like that and there s a lot of people around here that go to florida or somewhere else for the winter the november jobs report came back stronger than some predicted overall though don grimes a senior research and regional economic specialist at the university of michigan said it was in line with what labor analysts expected he thinks things will remain relatively strong through the first quarter of 2023 with a static jobless rate and positive employment gains however that may not last long of course that also probably means that inflation will remain relatively high and the federal reserve will probably continue to increase interest rates for the first quarter of next year then starting in the second and third quarter of next year we think things are going to slow down and in fact we actually think we ll get a mild recession in the second and third quarter uncertainty showing up in different ways in the thumb other signs of preparing for a recession were more difficult to spot some businesses continued to support local events but bryan ulatowski president of the st clair chamber of commerce said they saw a total decline in sponsorships of 10 to 12 people are worried or their business isn t going to maintain what it has been he said so they re looking at it like it could be a little bit slower than what they were accustomed to but i still think it s going to be a good year for everybody for the region at large thelma castillo president of the blue water area chamber of commerce said they re still trying to get a grasp on how businesses are preparing for next year she credited a conversation in late november with port huron city manager james freed for requesting a survey to the chamber s members she said there are about 635 to find out she said they hoped to get it out to get the pulse this month questions i m asking is like are you planning to continue to hire do you believe that there ll be a recession are you deferring capital outlay expenditures freed said like if you re going to expand or buy equipment are you delaying that i want to know these basic things street said her small town boutique hasn t made any huge changes to stock for next year though laura merchant president of the marine city area chamber of commerce said other have erring on the side of being conservative just in case we ve had to look at our inventory said merchant who also owns the mariner in downtown marine city and first of all there s limitations on some stuff that comes in and when it comes in so we are still having problems with items being available availability is an issue that hasn t changed but i think that we re being more selective of what we have and maybe not having such a large quantity as we may have carried before i don t find that just with our retail i think it s pretty much a lot of people i ve spoken to in the industry a lot of unknowns at kean s store co in downtown mason south of lansing the 94 year old business which sells everything from gifts and candy to clothing and jewelry was busy all of 2022 so much so owner teresa wren said it was challenging for staff to keep popular items including candy toys and other gifts in stock we ve had to order heavily wren said i feel like we can t keep up which is telling me we re selling a lot and that goes through january until now there sure are a lot of people coming into our store wren attributes some of that success to a change in how much emphasis her staff put on hosting special events this year the pandemic convinced wren it was time to minimize those efforts and focus on the basics keeping in stock what customers are buying and while having a lot of inventory always makes her nervous customers are buying what the staff is stocking she said despite inflation the sales have made wren optimistic for sales in 2023 at kean s i think things will be good she said i really do still bitely said plenty of retailers are currently focused on getting back into the black selling as much as they can before 2023 s first quarter and figuring out what stocks will look like long term rosy s boutique owner kim schaffer said her brighton business had a good year last year but this year has been slower last year was great it was a good year but i think it was because they had all that extra money people had last year they were spending it and now this year they don t have it so i just think that s it because this year has been super slow she said schaffer said she thinks slower traffic in stores is partially because people have shifted to online shopping because of the pandemic people started buying on amazon they are all buying online she said i think it s easy to stay at home in front of your fireplace and order and i think that stinks for the small businesses small business saturday was nice though we had a great day that day they really supported so that was wonderful street said she believes the lazy llama and other stores won t see any challenges until summer adding i don t think either way it s going to affect us much going forward i mean we have to move forward so far their only change is not in how much stock they have but the way they re buying it for consumers we do go on buying trips every year just for the industry just for retail and we didn t go more recently because what happened with the shipping last year street said we spent all this money going to these shows and ordering all this stuff and we got back and we re calling our vendors going where s our stuff so it was very difficult to get our inventory late this year we got it but we got it late so i feel like i really don t want to spend that money to go to shows when we can do what we need to do from here bitely admitted there are still a lot of unknowns but she said there are other signs of hope pointing to the federal bill signed by president joe biden preventing a massive rail strike that loomed over retailers there was a little bit of a sigh of relief this morning with that strike being taken off the table she said dec 2 it was really freaking retailers out that means no shipping of goods by rail which is huge so many of our products especially grocery products are being transported by rail because it s the most economical way to

with yusuf khan back in mumbai and his pune sojourn over his major goal was to get gainfully employed or target new avenues of earning to share the family burden he was blissfully unaware that lady luck was about to smile on him the turn of events propitiously sequenced by providence was to catapult young yusuf khan into dilip kumar the megastar of the then bombay film industry now dubbed as bollywood there are many versions of dilip kumar s entry in the film industry but we shall recount here only the version we believe is the most authentic yusuf commenced his endeavours in the city by helping his agha ji in his fruits business his ageing father was becoming rather frail so yusuf started travelling to the orchards in the hilly regions of dehradun and nainital in north india little did the young man know that one of these trips would be his springboard to filmdom and that too with the iconic bombay talkies studios of mumbai this was circa 1943 bombay talkies was among the three legendary film studios of the country in that era prabhat studios in pune and new theatres studios kolkata then calcutta were the other two bombay talkies was founded by the scion of a wealthy bengali family and london trained lawyer himanshu rai around the mid 1930s the studio employed well trained british german and indian technicians and churned out highly successful and path breaking films like achhut kanya 1936 kangan 1939 bandhan 1940 jhoola 1941 basant 1942 kismet 1943 etc devika rani daughter of the surgeon general of chennai then madras colonel m n chowdhury and a niece of rabindranath tagore was a student of the royal academy of dramatic arts london where she met himanshu rai who invited her to work in his films devika rani thus became the first lady of the indian screen the two later got married she acted in his films and together they founded the studio in 1935 as a joint stock company with a then huge capital base of rs25lakh it was established on the site of f e dinshaw s sprawling summer mansion in the then far flung mumbai suburb of malad the studio was designed and equipped on modern lines complete with sound and echo proof stages automated laboratory editing rooms preview theatre a carpentry workshop and plenty of facilities for artists and the administrative staff the german technicians who had worked with rai on light of asia shiraz and a throw of dice were brought together to supervise production and to train local talent franz osten directed all the early bombay talkies films while hartley from britain was the sound technician and zollee the laboratory technician equipped with the latest machinery and manned by a highly skilled staff bombay talkies set a standard in technical excellence unsurpassed by any other studio at that time unfortunately himanshu rai died of a nervous breakdown at the age of 48 in 1940 the studio s reins then shifted to devika rani and by 1943 when dilip kumar was discovered she was the boss incidentally bombay talkies became the grooming ground of the greatest names of filmdom including actors ashok kumar dilip kumar raj kapoor dev anand kishore sahu filmmakers shashdhar s mukerji amiya chakrabarty nitin bose gyan mukherjee n r acharya writers babu bhagwati charan varma niranjan pal saadat hasan manto pt narendra sharma krishan chandar and music directors saraswati devi ramchandra pal anil biswas and s n tripathi just to name a few it so happened that by a quirk of fate while devika rani and director amiya chakrabarty were location hunting in nainital yusuf also was in the same hill station for a business deal he had a chance meeting with devika rani and amiya chakrabarty and the lady liked his tall handsome pathani looks as did chakrabarty yusuf was shocked that superstar devika rani was taking an interest in him she gave him her card saying do call on me when you return to bombay as i wish to discuss something with you back in mumbai yusuf was advised by his father to seek advice from one dr masani a close family friend yusuf in the course of his conversation with dr masani casually mentioned his meeting with devika rani in nainital dr masani who was the personal physician of devika rani and her late husband as well as a family friend advised yusuf to meet her and offered to take him to bombay talkies to cut a long story short devika rani and amiya chakrabarty took yusuf s screen test and subsequently signed him up for jwar bhata 1944 at a then astronomical monthly salary of rs 1 000 plus rs 200 as war allowance rest as they say is history incidentally yusuf s close friend and legendary actor director raj kapoor was also then employed with bombay talkies as an apprentice at a meagre monthly salary of rs140 only and he even played a bit role in jwar bhata dilip saheb reminisces bombay talkies was the best thing that happened to me at that juncture in my life i couldn t have found a better job than the one offered to me by devika rani one of the first bombay talkies employees to whom yusuf was introduced was the production manager hitendra chowdhury who later had a lifetime friendship with the megastar once yusuf was formally inducted into the bombay talkies the studio think tank emphasised that he be given a different and more appropriate screen name this pleased yusuf as the new name would keep his joining films under wraps and aghaji who disliked filmi people would not discover his son s real profession the celebrated littã rateur bhagwati charan varma suggested three alternative names jehangir vasudev and dilip kumar almost intuitively and instantly yusuf opted for the now famous screen name of dilip kumar devika rani saw to it that young dilip got the right grooming within the bombay talkies studios under the tutelage of its exceedingly talented experts who were the best in the industry strict discipline was enforced in the studio in terms of punctuality and adherence to the curriculum of training and work execution dilip kumar was exposed to all elements of movie production which became invaluable for him he rubbed shoulders with legends like ashok kumar s mukerji gyan mukerjee frank austen and his first director amiya chakrabarty dilip saheb recalls in his autobiography that the best and most useful acting tip he received was from ashok bhaiyya as he addressed ashok kumar you are a handsome man and i can see that you are eager to learn it is very simple you just do what you would do in the situation if you are actually in it if you act it will be acting and it will look very silly on his rapport with the great ashok kumar dilip saheb adds i met him every day and he treated me like a younger brother who had to be led and protected my shyness and reticence began to recede in his company and his friendliness and affection for me were a fillip for me to be on the sets while the shooting of kismet was going on young dilip got an opportunity to watch ashok kumar perform on the sets of the then under production film kismet and it was a great education for him the best talents were employed by the studio each a master of his or her own field they would all sit together and share their thoughts and exchange views on the songs dialogue music filmmaking camera handling editing direction lighting etc it was a stimulating experience for young dilip who got to learn about filmmaking in all its varied facets including of course acting ashok kumar introduced dilip kumar to his brother in â law s mukerji a doyen of filmmaking who later founded the iconic studios filmistan and filmalaya and made innumerable box office hits dilip saheb s proficiency in the urdu language came handy in impressing mukerji an intelligent well read and polished gentleman who taught him finer nuances of filmmaking dilip saheb regaled ashok kumar and s mukerji with urdu as well as farsi persian verses after pack up a deeply impressed s mukerji then insisted on dilip participating in the story dialogue sessions of the studio with legends like amiya chakrabarty gyan mukherjee krishan chandar and others this experience was very enriching for the young dilip he got the mool mantra basic principles of emoting effectively which was that he would have to arrive at the business of simulating feelings and conveying emotions on his own seeds of the evolution of the later much eulogised dilipian brand of histrionics were sown surprisingly until this point in time dilip kumar had not seen a single full length hindi feature film at the advice of s mukerji he started viewing movies particularly those made in hollywood he especially liked the performances of legendary actors and actresses like paul muni clark gable ingrid bergman jimmy stewart charles laughton etc studying their acting styles by minute observation dilip kumar got ample exposure to the different approaches of the pastmasters of the craft and began shaping his own acting methods after this protracted training stint dilip kumar finally donned make up for the first time and started shooting for his debut film jwar bhata in may 1943 under the expert watchful eyes of director amiya chakrabarty the evolution of the actor dilip kumar had commenced in a candid interview published by filmfare on january 17 1969 dilip saheb went on to state the following regarding the evolutionary phase of his career in bombay talkies where i started my career we had to do much more than just don make up and report for work we had to frequently and often repeatedly see good films discuss the work of other artistes read books on acting drama criticism we were all a very close knit family writers directors producers technicians and artistes often there would be a lively debate and we could always take our problems to our more experienced seniors those institutions are alas no more filmmaking today has become the forte of dealmakers younger artistes are being nurtured in a highly mercenary and ruthless climate they are relatively smarter and shrewder than we were but their efforts are stunted and they fail to set new standards of their own the number of assignments is today considered an actor s prestige symbol

tulips and bitcoin have both been associated with financial bubbles in their time but in a giant greenhouse near amsterdam the dutch are trying to make them work together engineer bert de groot inspects the six bitcoin miners as they perform complex sums to earn cryptocurrency filling the air with a noisy whine along with a blast of warmth that warmth is now heating the hothouse where rows of tulips grow cutting the farmers reliance on gas whose price has soared since russia s invasion of ukraine the servers in turn are powered by solar energy from the roof reducing the normally huge electricity costs for mining and cutting the impact on the environment meanwhile both the farmers and de groot s company bitcoin brabant are earning crypto which is still attracting investors despite a recent crash in the market we think with this way of heating our greenhouse but also earning some bitcoin we have a win win situation flower farmer danielle koning 37 told afp the netherlands love of tulips caused the first stock market crash in the 17th century when speculation bulb prices caused prices to soar only to later collapse now the netherlands is the world s biggest tulip producer and also the second biggest agricultural exporter overall after the united states with much grown in greenhouses improving the environment but the low lying country is keenly aware of the effect of the agricultural industry on climate change while farmers are struggling with high energy prices mining for cryptocurrency meanwhile requires huge amounts of electricity to power computers leading to an environmental impact amid global efforts to tackle climate change de groot 35 who only started his business earlier this year and now has 17 clients including restaurants and warehouses says this makes bitcoin and tulips a perfect fit this operation is actually carbon negative as are all the operations i basically build says the long haired de groot sporting an orange polo shirt with his firm s logo we re actually improving the environment he is also selling tulips online for bitcoin via a business called bitcoinbloem the collaboration started when koning saw a twitter video de groot had made about bitcoin mining and called him up now there are six servers at their hothouse whose exact location koning asked to keep secret to avoid thieves targeting the 15 000 euro machines koning s company owns half of them and keeps the bitcoin they produce while de groot is allowed to keep his three servers there in exchange for monthly visits to clean dust and insects out of the servers fans with a 20 degree celsius difference between the air entering the machine and leaving them this provides the heat needed to grow the tulips and to dry the bulbs that produce them no worries the most important thing we get out of it is we save on natural gas says koning secondly well we earn bitcoin by running them in the greenhouse huge energy costs have driven some dutch agricultural firms that often rely on greenhouses to stop growing this year while others have even gone bankrupt says koning meanwhile the philosopher nassim nicholas taleb who developed the idea of the unpredictable but historic black swan event has compared bitcoin to the tulipmania that engulfed the netherlands nearly 400 years ago this saw prices for a single bulb rise to more than 100 times the average annual income at the time before the bubble burst in 1637 causing banks to fail and people to lose their life savings the cryptocurrency sector is currently reeling from the collapse of a major exchange with bitcoin currently worth around 16 300 per unit down from a high of 68 000 in november 2021 but de groot isn t worried i have absolutely no worries about the long term value proposition of an immutable monetary system he says

the haven 7 study was designed to further confirm the benefit of preventative treatment prophylaxis with hemlibra from birth in previously untreated or minimally treated infants with severe haemophilia a without inhibitors in the study 77 8 of participants had no bleeding episodes that required treatment 1 in addition real world efficacy and safety data from the euhass database and athn 7 study were also presented 2 3 basel 11 december 2022 roche six ro rog otcqx rhhby today announced interim results from the phase iii haven 7 study the study shows hemlibra emicizumab achieved meaningful bleed control with a favourable safety profile in infants up to 12 months with severe haemophilia a without factor viii inhibitors 77 8 of participants did not have any bleeds that required treatment and 42 6 did not have any treated or untreated bleeds at all 1 these results help support the use of hemlibra in this population in which it is already approved in many countries around the world the new data were presented at the 64th american society of hematology ash annual meeting and exposition taking place in new orleans from 10 13 december 2022 the burden of severe haemophilia a in infants and on their parents and caregivers is significant the world federation of haemophilia treatment guidelines consider the standard of care in haemophilia to be regular prophylaxis initiated at a young age as studies have shown that early prophylaxis improves long term outcomes while reducing the risk of intracranial haemorrhage 4 6 however for many infants with haemophilia a prophylaxis is not started until after the first year of life because of the high treatment burden 7 11 hemlibra provides a flexible treatment option that can be administered subcutaneously from birth at different dosing frequencies these initial results support the benefit of starting hemlibra from birth given that early preventative treatment is essential in infants said levi garraway m d ph d roche s chief medical officer and head of global product development haemophilia can substantially reduce quality of life for those affected starting at infancy which is especially distressing for parents and caregivers we continue to explore hemlibra s potential benefits to a broad range of people with haemophilia a haven 7 is a phase iii multi centre open label study evaluating the efficacy safety pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of hemlibra in infants with severe haemophilia a without factor viii inhibitors the results of this interim analysis which included data from 54 participants showed that 77 8 of participants n 42 did not have any bleeds which required treatment while 42 6 n 23 did not have any treated or untreated bleeds at all there were no treated spontaneous bleeds in any participants and all treated bleeds were traumatic a total of 77 bleeds occurred in 31 participants 57 4 88 3 were traumatic mean model based annualised bleeding rate abr 95 ci at the time of interim analysis was 0 4 0 23 0 65 for treated bleeds 1 hemlibra s safety profile was consistent with previous studies with no new safety signals observed nine people 16 7 reported a hemlibra related adverse event ae all of which were local injection site reactions eight participants 14 8 reported 12 serious aes unrelated to hemlibra there were no deaths thromboembolic events or cases of thrombotic microangiopathy reinforcing hemlibra s favourable safety profile no intracranial haemorrhages occurred 1 primary analysis will be conducted at 52 weeks the study also has an additional seven year follow up period to collect long term data such as safety and joint health outcomes further building upon our understanding of the benefit of hemlibra in this population euhass database and athn 7 study roche also presented data from the european haemophilia safety surveillance euhass database and the prospective observational athn 7 study at ash 2022 data from euhass which collects real world safety data on treatments for inherited disorders showed the safety profile of hemlibra in people with haemophilia a was favourable and consistent with clinical trial data 2 data from athn 7 exploring the efficacy of hemlibra in women with haemophilia a showed two of the three female participants had no bleeds the third had one treated bleed associated with a dental procedure and one untreated bleed associated with menses ongoing evaluation is vital to further understand the safety and efficacy profile of hemlibra in this rare and under represented population 3 hemlibra is approved as a treatment for people with haemophilia a with factor viii inhibitors in more than 110 countries worldwide and for people without factor viii inhibitors in more than 100 countries worldwide it has been studied in one of the largest clinical trial programmes in people with haemophilia a with and without factor viii inhibitors including eight phase iii studies about hemlibra emicizumab hemlibra is a bispecific factor ixa and factor x directed antibody it is designed to bring together factor ixa and factor x proteins involved in the natural coagulation cascade and restore the blood clotting process for people with haemophilia a hemlibra is a prophylactic preventative treatment that can be administered by an injection of a ready to use solution under the skin subcutaneously once weekly every two weeks or every four weeks after an initial once weekly dose for the first four weeks hemlibra was created by chugai pharmaceutical co ltd and is being co developed globally by chugai roche and genentech it is marketed in the united states by genentech as hemlibra emicizumab kxwh with kxwh as the suffix designated in accordance with nonproprietary naming of biological products guidance for industry issued by the u s food and drug administration about haemophilia a haemophilia a is an inherited serious disorder in which a person s blood does not clot properly leading to uncontrolled and often spontaneous bleeding haemophilia a affects around 900 000 people worldwide 4 12 approximately 14 and 48 of whom have a moderate or mild form of the disorder 13 respectively however the severity of haemophilia a is not always reflective of bleeding behaviour as some people with non severe haemophilia may experience symptoms similar to those with severe haemophilia and warrant prophylaxis 14 all severities of haemophilia a can significantly reduce the quality of life for people affected as well as their family and caregivers people with haemophilia a either lack or do not have enough of a clotting protein called factor viii in a healthy person when a bleed occurs factor viii brings together the clotting factors ixa and x which is a critical step in the formation of a blood clot to help stop bleeding depending on the severity of their symptoms people with haemophilia a can bleed frequently especially into their joints or muscles 13 these bleeds can present a significant health concern as they often cause pain and can lead to chronic swelling deformity reduced mobility and long term joint damage 15 a serious complication of treatment is the development of inhibitors to factor viii replacement therapies inhibitors are antibodies developed by the body s immune system that bind to and block the efficacy of replacement factor viii making it difficult if not impossible to obtain a level of factor viii sufficient to control bleeding 4 about roche in haematology roche has been developing medicines for people with malignant and non

maine s lobster industry goes into effect the council called whale entanglement a serious and tragic situation they re really susceptible much more so than other whales says philip hoare author of leviathan and it s pretty sad and kind of crazy that this happening off the shores of the richest democracy on earth but as the ocean warms they are moving north from their typical winter feeding area

lobster lines can then tighten around their caudal peduncle the tail stock causing it to necrotise it is he adds a horrible slow death according to moore the issue comes down to consumerism at one time whales were hunted for oil and baleen now they are harmed by our demand for goods it s all driven by climate change and the direct impact of the things we do to extract the resources and things we want but no one as the white house attested is discounting the power of that demand as an economic driver and political force it s a glorious mismatch that comes down to what we really care about moore says in some ways the right whale is a totem for all the different pieces of biodiversity collapse we re seeing within this is the wonder of the whale itself often called the urban whale because it lives so close to shore these are huge very strange animals hoare says known for among other things very long sessions of foreplay of three or four hours view image in fullscreen a north atlantic

they seem so caught up in the moment for the right whale getting mixed up in human affairs has never been good but there is perhaps a glimmer of hope if the lobster industry adopts ropeless lobster pots that can be triggered by acoustic signals to rise to the surface until that happens the situation for the right whale looks bleak you can t protect the whale and have lobstering hoare says it s as simple as that and it s freaking out the lobstering industry they can see it coming

of our newsletters see all defend the facts support independent journalism by donating to propublica donate now state officials made tweaks and settled the lawsuit but they never changed a core part of the formula that determined how much homeowners received now a groundbreaking analysis of nearly 92 000 rebuilding grants statewide shows critics were right all along road home shortchanged people in poor neighborhoods while giving those in wealthy neighborhoods more of what they needed people in the most impoverished areas in new orleans those with a median income of 15 000 or less had to cover 30 of their rebuilding costs after road home grants federal emergency management agency aid and insurance in areas where the median income was more than 75 000 the shortfall was 20 according to the analysis by propublica the times picayune the advocate and wwl tv lower income homeowners in new orleans had less of their hurricane damage covered by road home grants median household income damage left uncovered for all properties in each income group 30 75k 20 credit source louisiana office of community development note median household income calculated based on the census block group of grant recipients poverty tracks closely with race in new orleans so the shortfalls in the city disproportionately hurt black people road home also underpaid residents of st bernard parish a mostly white working class community devastated by the hurricane had properties in the lowest income parts of new orleans been covered at the same rate as the wealthiest each of those households would have received about 18 000 more on average across the city covering all homeowners repair costs at the rate of the highest earners would have resulted in another 349 million for rebuilding the road home program was hugely consequential for louisiana and much more so for its largest city most of which flooded after katrina s storm surge overwhelmed its levees most homeowners didn t have adequate insurance facing the possibility of a mass exodus state leaders devised road home to cover the gap and encourage people to rebuild credit jennifer zdon the times picayune top a woman walks by a growing pile of debris dumped at the approved katrina dump site on the neutral ground between west end boulevard and pontchartrain boulevard on oct 10 2005 bottom the lakeview neighborhood is underwater on sept 9 2005 credit kathy anderson the times picayune road home also allowed homeowners to sell their property to the state and move elsewhere though housing was scarce in the region if homeowners didn t stay in louisiana they forfeited 40 of their home s value new orleans was the biggest beneficiary of rebuilding grants and half of all owner occupied homes in new orleans received rebuilding grants with 3 3 billion awarded citywide some neighborhoods rebounded quickly others languished housing advocates say that s due to the original sin of the road home program it calculated each grant based on a home s value before the hurricane or on the cost of repairs whichever was less the value of most homes in poor areas was lower than the cost of rebuilding them so the resulting grants didn t cover all repairs but for most people in affluent areas the rebuilding cost was lower than the value of their homes they got grants that came closer to covering their needs the practical effects of how this program shaped the city can still be seen today said davida finger an attorney who testified to congress in 2009 about unfairness in the road home program poor new orleanians had a much harder time covering the costs for a homeowner in the lowest income areas it would have taken more than 43 months at the average annual salary to pay the cost of repairs not covered by road home fema and insurance the news outlets found in the highest income areas it would have taken less than eight months the shortcomings in the road home program are part of a broader tapestry of failures in the ways america helps people affected by catastrophes a yearlong investigation by propublica the times picayune the advocate and wwl tv has found that disaster programs often shortchange the people who need it most worsening inequities in the wake of disaster finger said the news organizations findings were shocking but not surprising what black homeowners what lawyers what advocates what community organizers what reporters were telling the program designers all along was completely accurate finger said they simply didn t want to hear it the state office of community development took issue with the analysis but none of the points it raised affected the news organizations findings two officials who were in charge of the recovery told the news outlets that the findings were troubling andy kopplin the first executive director of the louisiana recovery authority stressed that state officials took pains to steer more money to poorer homeowners through a second grant program but kopplin acknowledged in a written statement that the findings show that low and middle income households should ve received more that s upsetting to those of us who were working to create more equitable outcomes and especially to those families who needed and deserved more resources for their recovery he wrote walter leger who was a key board member of the lra said the findings should spur the state to seek more federal aid from congress to fill the gaps de marcus finnell deputy press secretary for the u s department of housing and urban development declined to address the findings directly but in a statement he said hud s experience after katrina led it to favor programs that guide homeowners through rebuilding rather than giving homeowners money and letting them manage the recovery process on their own andrew kopplin then executive director of the louisiana recovery authority speaks to walter leger then chair of the lra s housing and redevelopment task force as department of housing and urban development official pamela patenaude testifies on jan 29 2007 credit ellis lucia the times picayune in fact federal rules no longer allow homeowners to be compensated for losses after a disaster and leger said using property values to determine aid after katrina now appears to have been a misstep the plan was to help the homeowner repair his home or her home and get back in the home leger said the news organizations analysis shows there were disparities he said and that s something that should have been and maybe should be addressed one city two recoveries before katrina the neighborhoods of lakeview and gentilly woods had a lot in common both sat below sea level on reclaimed swampland near lake pontchartrain they boasted similar post world war ii housing stock lakeview was almost entirely white and gentilly woods was more than two thirds black lakeview residents had higher incomes and their homes commanded higher prices both neighborhoods were swamped when the floodwalls along new orleans drainage canals buckled after katrina water reached the eaves of many homes road home appraised the average lakeview home at 326 000 and the average repair cost at 286 000 with a grant based on the repair cost the average homeowner received 83 of what was needed to rebuild according to the news organizations analysis in gentilly woods the average property was valued at 121 000 with 203 000 in rebuilding costs with a grant based on the home s value the average homeowner ended up with just 73 of what was needed to rebuild among those served well by road home was lakeview retiree rita legrand 86 she had to gut her modest ranch home but she was determined to rebuild rita legrand lives on louis xiv street in the lakeview area of new orleans credit hris granger the times picayune the new orleans advocate with 53 000 from insurance in hand legrand applied for a road home grant in fall 2006 road home estimated her home s value at 320 000 and her repair costs at 188 000 her grant based on repair costs minus what she d already gotten from insurance was 135 000 the grant and insurance proceeds covered her entire loss as it was supposed to and by april 2007 she had completely rebuilt the program worked great for me she said the experience was quite different for cynthia and charles heisser of gentilly woods like legrand the heissers had a small ranch house and they had a similar repair estimate 190 000 but their initial grant was just 32 000 charles heisser a 90 year old korean war veteran still has the documents explaining how road home arrived at that figure program officials estimated the pre storm value of their home at 83 000 the state subtracted 40 000 in insurance proceeds which their lender had made them use to pay off their mortgage and 10 500 in fema aid they had received for living expenses charles heisser appealed arguing road home had failed to factor in tens of thousands of dollars in improvements they had made before the storm their home was reappraised for 135 000 that increased their grant to about 83 500 even then their total compensation including insurance and fema grants was 135 000 just 70 of road home s original estimate of what it would take to make their home livable the heissers spent some of the road home grant to convert their garage into living quarters so they could move out of the fema trailer in their front yard for most of the next 10 years the house sat with a new roof and an unfinished interior where they hung laundry cynthia heisser couldn t help but notice how differently things went in mostly white parts of new orleans it was unjust more unjust to the blacks than it was to the whites she said people used to ask her she recalled oh you don t have your house yet or you re not in your home yet and we d say it isn t because we re not fighting for it we are a nonprofit called rebuilding together new orleans eventually provided labor and materials to help finish repairs the heissers finally moved back into their house in 2018 13 years after the storm victims of hurricane katrina were being victimized again from the beginning road home had a problem on the one hand thousands of residents desperately needed rebuilding aid on the other road home like many disaster aid programs had guardrails to make sure people didn t end up better off than before the storm charles and cynthia heisser stand in their dining room next to family photos that they framed in a window that was removed from their flooded house after hurricane katrina the gentilly woods homeowners didn t receive enough from road home to cover all of their hurricane katrina damage costs but their house has been restored thanks in part to the work of rebuilding together new orleans credit chris granger the times picayune the new orleans advocate the idea was that it would be illegitimate for somebody whose house only had a market value of 100 000 to get 120 000 even if that was how much it would cost to repair said andy horowitz a history professor at the university of connecticut and author of katrina a history 1915 2015 when people complained that using home values to calculate grants would help some people more than others officials argued that pre storm value had been part of the formula from the start besides leger said at the time it was required by the federal government and there wasn t enough time or money to change the rules in a june 2006 interview shortly after the program was approved louisiana recovery authority chair norman francis dismissed the very problem many poor homeowners would soon face that the cost of rebuilding could far exceed the value of their homes that money is going to cover the difference between your damages and how much insurance you got francis said now if you had a 50 000 home not likely that you had 200 000 worth of damage so the formula has to take into consideration your home value a family member said francis now 91 was unavailable to comment for this story melanie ehrlich who lived in baltimore while her gentilly home was rebuilt said she quickly saw the problem with the formula she founded a grassroots organization the citizens road home action team and became a thorn in the side of road home officials melanie ehrlich stands in her yard in the gentilly neighborhood of new orleans credit chris granger the times picayune the new orleans advocate it was crystal clear how very unfair the program was in its design said ehrlich a tulane university genetics professor what i saw is that the victims of hurricane katrina were being victimized again in october 2006 shortly after road home was launched ehrlich met with officials in charge of the recovery and argued their formula for calculating grants was unfair she followed up with examples basing grants on the pre storm value of homes she wrote would justifiably anger the middle and lower economic classes or more specifically everyone who does not have an expensive house or lot as homeowners received their grant letters over the course of 2007 hundreds showed up at finger s low income law clinic at loyola university she attended dozens of public meetings in baton rouge new orleans and washington to ask officials to fix the inequity baked into the calculations in august 2009 finger told a congressional committee that the formula disproportionately hurt black residents because their homes tended to be valued for less road home s grant formula design assured that some homeowners would not receive sufficient rebuilding funds she said six state officials involved with the recovery effort said they didn t ignore these complaints but they noted that they were building a program of unprecedented scope and dealing with unforeseen problems all while under intense pressure to get money to homeowners quickly birds fly off a rebuilt section of the 17th street canal floodwall in the lakeview neighborhood of new orleans the wall collapsed here during hurricane katrina homes stood in the green space before the storm credit chris granger the times picayune the new orleans advocate leger said he took ehrlich s complaint about pre storm value to hud officials and asked to use higher repair estimates instead we were told no he said soon after the program launched state officials said they made changes that increased grants for all applicants factoring land value into appraisals using the highest of several appraisal methods and increasing rates for repair estimates they originally envisioned an affordable loan program to fill any gaps between grants and the actual costs of rebuilding but it never got off the ground in 2007 they created another grant for less affluent homeowners whose initial grants didn t meet their damage estimates that enabled the state to meet a hud requirement to pay at least half of grant money to low and moderate income households three years later after black homeowners sued the head of the lra and hud alleging the program was discriminatory francis said that did not pass on my radar screen if it had i would have questioned why the program wasn t treating people equitably francis was a revered civil rights leader and longtime president of xavier university a historically black school and finger said she does not believe he and the other architects of road home intended it to be discriminatory nonetheless finger said it is very difficult to look at a system that s trying to roll out that much money as quickly as possible and to not do it in a way that replicates historic systemic inequities 297 000 in damage 3 468 in aid the plaintiffs in the suit included almarie ford who said the hurricane shutters that adorn her new orleans east home are all she ever got from road home a month after katrina ford returned to find her kingswood subdivision in ruins the now 73 year old social worker recalled walking into her house and gagging on the smell of black mold she turned around locked the front door and left unsure what to do next like many homeowners she expected significant government assistance but it never came road home officials assessed her damage at about 297 000 but based her grant on her home s value 150 000 they gave her just 3 468 after subtracting about 146 500 in insurance payments almarie ford at her home in new orleans east credit chris granger the times picayune the new orleans advocate if the grant had been based on rebuilding costs she would have received the maximum road home grant of 150 000 instead ford took out a loan and exhausted her savings i was shocked ford said of the size of her grant but what could you do you could complain that you only got 3 500 but they said well those are the rules she wasn t willing to accept what she described as an injustice without a fight so she went to the greater new orleans fair housing action center in 2008 the housing center had joined with policylink a california nonprofit to collect examples that showed road home s formula disproportionately hurt poor communities and people of color ironically policylink had teamed with the lra two years earlier to present the state s initial recovery plan in a sign of just how unexpected the inequities were a policylink representative spoke at an lra board meeting in april 2006 and applauded the board for the design of the housing action plan according to meeting minutes james perry the head of the housing center said his organization examined two nearly identical homes four bedrooms two bathrooms brick construction each had flooded with 6 feet of water and had damages estimated at more than 200 000 but one house was in a white neighborhood and the other in a black neighborhood each homeowner received a grant based on their home value perry said the white homeowner got 150 000 the black homeowner 90 000 perry said his organization gave that information to road home and hud but neither took immediate action perry said he was shocked by what he perceived to be their lack of interest it wasn t easy to remedy but it seemed to me they would want to in the resulting lawsuit attorneys cited 2000 census data to prove their case about 93 of black owned homes in new orleans were valued at less than 150 000 compared to 55 of white owned homes the homeowners secured an important victory before a federal district judge in 2010 the next year the u s court of appeals for the d c circuit overturned that ruling and sent the case back to district court rejecting claims the grant formula was discriminatory the appeals court ruled that any gap in grants for black families had been eliminated when after the lawsuit had been filed the state removed a 50 000 cap on the additional grant for low income homeowners but the news outlets analysis shows the appeals court s assessment was wrong the additional grants did help homeowners in lower income nonwhite areas in new orleans most of which are majority black thanks in part to the program the average grant to a black homeowner in louisiana was slightly larger than the average grant overall according to state records but in the end the additional grants merely boosted the average share of damage covered by grants and insurance from about 51 to about 70 in those parts of new orleans that meant poor nonwhite areas ultimately fared about the same as middle income nonwhite areas but not as well as even the poorest white ones the analysis backs up what u s district court judge henry kennedy wrote in 2010 in a preliminary ruling

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video a groundbreaking analysis of nearly 92 000 rebuilding grants statewide shows critics were right all along road home shortchanged people in poor neighborhoods had properties in the lowest income parts of new orleans been covered at the same rate as the wealthiest each of those households would have received about 18 000 more on average across the city covering all homeowners repair costs at the rate of the highest earners would have resulted in another 349 million for rebuilding poverty tracks closely with race in new orleans so the shortfalls in the city disproportionately hurt black people road home also underpaid residents of st bernard parish a mostly white working class community devastated by the hurricane people in the most impoverished areas in new orleans those with a median income of 15 000 or less had to cover 30 of their rebuilding costs after road home grants federal emergency management agency aid and insurance in areas where the median income was more than 75 000 the shortfall was 20 according to the analysis by propublica the times picayune the advocate and wwl tv now a groundbreaking analysis of nearly 92 000 rebuilding grants statewide shows critics were right all along road home shortchanged people in poor neighborhoods while giving those in wealthy neighborhoods more of what they needed state officials made tweaks and settled the lawsuit but they never changed a core part of the formula that determined how much homeowners received activists and real estate experts spoke out at meetings of the louisiana recovery authority which designed and ran the road home program an attorney representing poor homeowners testified before congress a fair housing group sued the state and federal governments the complaints started as soon as louisiana launched its massive program to help homeowners rebuild after hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 community leaders said the largest rebuilding program in u s history would be unfair to the state s poorest residents the plan was to help the homeowner repair his home or her home and get back in the home leger said the news organizations analysis shows there were disparities he said and that s something that should have been and maybe should be addressed in fact federal rules no longer allow homeowners to be compensated for losses after a disaster and leger said using property values to determine aid after katrina now appears to have been a misstep de marcus finnell deputy press secretary for the u s department of housing and urban development declined to address the findings directly but in a statement he said hud s experience after katrina led it to favor programs that guide homeowners through rebuilding rather than giving homeowners money and letting them manage the recovery process on their own walter leger who was a key board member of the lra said the findings should spur the state to seek more federal aid from congress to fill the gaps that s upsetting to those of us who were working to create more equitable outcomes and especially to those families who needed and deserved more resources for their recovery he wrote andy kopplin the first executive director of the louisiana recovery authority stressed that state officials took pains to steer more money to poorer homeowners through a second grant program but kopplin acknowledged in a written statement that the findings show that low and middle income households should ve received more two officials who were in charge of the recovery told the news outlets that the findings were troubling the state office of community development took issue with the analysis but none of the points it raised affected the news organizations findings what black homeowners what lawyers what advocates what community organizers what reporters were telling the program designers all along was completely accurate finger said they simply didn t want to hear it the shortcomings in the road home program are part of a broader tapestry of failures in the ways america helps people affected by catastrophes a yearlong investigation by propublica the times picayune the advocate and wwl tv has found that disaster programs often shortchange the people who need it most worsening inequities in the wake of disaster poor new orleanians had a much harder time covering the costs for a homeowner in the lowest income areas it would have taken more than 43 months at the average annual salary to pay the cost of repairs not covered by road home fema and insurance the news outlets found in the highest income areas it would have taken less than eight months the practical effects of how this program shaped the city can still be seen today said davida finger an attorney who testified to congress in 2009 about unfairness in the road home program the value of most homes in poor areas was lower than the cost of rebuilding them so the resulting grants didn t cover all repairs but for most people in affluent areas the rebuilding cost was lower than the value of their homes they got grants that came closer to covering their needs housing advocates say that s due to the original sin of the road home program it calculated each grant based on a home s value before the hurricane or on the cost of repairs whichever was less new orleans was the biggest beneficiary of rebuilding grants and half of all owner occupied homes in new orleans received rebuilding grants with 3 3 billion awarded citywide some neighborhoods rebounded quickly others languished road home also allowed homeowners to sell their property to the state and move elsewhere though housing was scarce in the region if homeowners didn t stay in louisiana they forfeited 40 of their home s value the road home program was hugely consequential for louisiana and much more so for its largest city most of which flooded after katrina s storm surge overwhelmed its levees most homeowners didn t have adequate insurance facing the possibility of a mass exodus state leaders devised road home to cover the gap and encourage people to rebuild a nonprofit called rebuilding together new orleans eventually provided labor and materials to help finish repairs the heissers finally moved back into their house in 2018 13 years after the storm it was unjust more unjust to the blacks than it was to the whites she said people used to ask her she recalled oh you don t have your house yet or you re not in your home yet and we d say it isn t because we re not fighting for it we are cynthia heisser couldn t help but notice how differently things went in mostly white parts of new orleans the heissers spent some of the road home grant to convert their garage into living quarters so they could move out of the fema trailer in their front yard for most of the next 10 years the house sat with a new roof and an unfinished interior where they hung laundry that increased their grant to about 83 500 even then their total compensation including insurance and fema grants was 135 000 just 70 of road home s original estimate of what it would take to make their home livable charles heisser appealed arguing road home had failed to factor in tens of thousands of dollars in improvements they had made before the storm their home was reappraised for 135 000 program officials estimated the pre storm value of their home at 83 000 the state subtracted 40 000 in insurance proceeds which their lender had made them use to pay off their mortgage and 10 500 in fema aid they had received for living expenses charles heisser a 90 year old korean war veteran still has the documents explaining how road home arrived at that figure the experience was quite different for cynthia and charles heisser of gentilly woods like legrand the heissers had a small ranch house and they had a similar repair estimate 190 000 but their initial grant was just 32 000 the grant and insurance proceeds covered her entire loss as it was supposed to and by april 2007 she had completely rebuilt the program worked great for me she said with 53 000 from insurance in hand legrand applied for a road home grant in fall 2006 road home estimated her home s value at 320 000 and her repair costs at 188 000 her grant based on repair costs minus what she d already gotten from insurance was 135 000 among those served well by road home was lakeview retiree rita legrand 86 she had to gut her modest ranch home but she was determined to rebuild in gentilly woods the average property was valued at 121 000 with 203 000 in rebuilding costs with a grant based on the home s value the average homeowner ended up with just 73 of what was needed to rebuild road home appraised the average lakeview home at 326 000 and the average repair cost at 286 000 with a grant based on the repair cost the average homeowner received 83 of what was needed to rebuild according to the news organizations analysis both neighborhoods were swamped when the floodwalls along new orleans drainage canals buckled after katrina water reached the eaves of many homes lakeview was almost entirely white and gentilly woods was more than two thirds black lakeview residents had higher incomes and their homes commanded higher prices before katrina the neighborhoods of lakeview and gentilly woods had a lot in common both sat below sea level on reclaimed swampland near lake pontchartrain they boasted similar post world war ii housing stock nonetheless finger said it is very difficult to look at a system that s trying to roll out that much money as quickly as possible and to not do it in a way that replicates historic systemic inequities francis was a revered civil rights leader and longtime president of xavier university a historically black school and finger said she does not believe he and the other architects of road home intended it to be discriminatory three years later after black homeowners sued the head of the lra and hud alleging the program was discriminatory francis said that did not pass on my radar screen if it had i would have questioned why the program wasn t treating people equitably in 2007 they created another grant for less affluent homeowners whose initial grants didn t meet their damage estimates that enabled the state to meet a hud requirement to pay at least half of grant money to low and moderate income households they originally envisioned an affordable loan program to fill any gaps between grants and the actual costs of rebuilding but it never got off the ground soon after the program launched state officials said they made changes that increased grants for all applicants factoring land value into appraisals using the highest of several appraisal methods and increasing rates for repair estimates leger said he took ehrlich s complaint about pre storm value to hud officials and asked to use higher repair estimates instead we were told no he said six state officials involved with the recovery effort said they didn t ignore these complaints but they noted that they were building a program of unprecedented scope and dealing with unforeseen problems all while under intense pressure to get money to homeowners quickly in august 2009 finger told a congressional committee that the formula disproportionately hurt black residents because their homes tended to be valued for less road home s grant formula design assured that some homeowners would not receive sufficient rebuilding funds she said as homeowners received their grant letters over the course of 2007 hundreds showed up at finger s low income law clinic at loyola university she attended dozens of public meetings in baton rouge new orleans and washington to ask officials to fix the inequity baked into the calculations in october 2006 shortly after road home was launched ehrlich met with officials in charge of the recovery and argued their formula for calculating grants was unfair she followed up with examples basing grants on the pre storm value of homes she wrote would justifiably anger the middle and lower economic classes or more specifically everyone who does not have an expensive house or lot it was crystal clear how very unfair the program was in its design said ehrlich a tulane university genetics professor what i saw is that the victims of hurricane katrina were being victimized again melanie ehrlich who lived in baltimore while her gentilly home was rebuilt said she quickly saw the problem with the formula she founded a grassroots organization the citizens road home action team and became a thorn in the side of road home officials a family member said francis now 91 was unavailable to comment for this story that money is going to cover the difference between your damages and how much insurance you got francis said now if you had a 50 000 home not likely that you had 200 000 worth of damage so the formula has to take into consideration your home value in a june 2006 interview shortly after the program was approved louisiana recovery authority chair norman francis dismissed the very problem many poor homeowners would soon face that the cost of rebuilding could far exceed the value of their homes when people complained that using home values to calculate grants would help some people more than others officials argued that pre storm value had been part of the formula from the start besides leger said at the time it was required by the federal government and there wasn t enough time or money to change the rules the idea was that it would be illegitimate for somebody whose house only had a market value of 100 000 to get 120 000 even if that was how much it would cost to repair said andy horowitz a history professor at the university of connecticut and author of katrina a history 1915 2015 from the beginning road home had a problem on the one hand thousands of residents desperately needed rebuilding aid on the other road home like many disaster aid programs had guardrails to make sure people didn t end up better off than before the storm 297 000 in damage 3 468 in aid the plaintiffs in the suit included almarie ford who said the hurricane shutters that adorn her new orleans east home are all she ever got from road home a month after katrina ford returned to find her kingswood subdivision in ruins the now 73 year old social worker recalled walking into her house and gagging on the smell of black mold she turned around locked the front door and left unsure what to do next like many homeowners she expected significant government assistance but it never came road home officials assessed her damage at about 297 000 but based her grant on her home s value 150 000 they gave her just 3 468 after subtracting about 146 500 in insurance payments if the grant had been based on rebuilding costs she would have received the maximum road home grant of 150 000 instead ford took out a loan and exhausted her savings i was shocked ford said of the size of her grant but what could you do you could complain that you only got 3 500 but they said well those are the rules she wasn t willing to accept what she described as an injustice without a fight so she went to the greater new orleans fair housing action center in 2008 the housing center had joined with policylink a california nonprofit to collect examples that showed road home s formula disproportionately hurt poor communities and people of color ironically policylink had teamed with the lra two years earlier to present the state s initial recovery plan in a sign of just how unexpected the inequities were a policylink representative spoke at an lra board meeting in april 2006 and applauded the board for the design of the housing action plan according to meeting minutes james perry the head of the housing center said his organization examined two nearly identical homes four bedrooms two bathrooms brick construction each had flooded with 6 feet of water and had damages estimated at more than 200 000 but one house was in a white neighborhood and the other in a black neighborhood each homeowner received a grant based on their home value perry said the white homeowner got 150 000 the black homeowner 90 000 perry said his organization gave that information to road home and hud but neither took immediate action perry said he was shocked by what he perceived to be their lack of interest it wasn t easy to remedy but it seemed to me they would want to in the resulting lawsuit attorneys cited 2000 census data to prove their case about 93 of black owned homes in new orleans were valued at less than 150 000 compared to 55 of white owned homes the homeowners secured an important victory before a federal district judge in 2010 the next year the u s court of appeals for the d c circuit overturned that ruling and sent the case back to district court rejecting claims the grant formula was discriminatory the appeals court ruled that any gap in grants for black families had been eliminated when after the lawsuit had been filed the state removed a 50 000 cap on the additional grant for low income homeowners but the news outlets analysis shows the appeals court s assessment was wrong the additional grants did help homeowners in lower income nonwhite areas in new orleans most of which are majority black thanks in part to the program the average grant to a black homeowner in louisiana was slightly larger than the average grant overall according to state records but in the end the additional grants merely boosted the average share of damage covered by grants and insurance from about 51 to about 70 in those parts of new orleans that meant poor nonwhite areas ultimately fared about the same as middle income nonwhite areas but not as well as even the poorest white ones the analysis backs up what u s district court judge henry kennedy wrote in 2010 in a preliminary ruling the court does not take lightly that some african american homeowners received lower awards than they would have if their homes were in predominantly white neighborhoods louisiana and hud offered no legitimate reason for taking pre storm home values into account when calculating grants he wrote while the appeals court accused plaintiffs of cherry picking their data by focusing on majority black new orleans the news outlets analysis shows the disparity between wealthy and poor neighborhoods statewide was similar to that in new orleans three months after the appeals court ruling louisiana and

after several years of what seemed like unfettered growth central ohio s young technology companies are finding they need to act like their more established brethren as a potential recession puts more pressure on them to control costs in july health technology company olive cut 450 jobs and last month root cut 20 of its staff or 137 jobs in the second round of cuts this year for the young auto insurance company mortgage lender lower com which bought the naming rights to the new crew stadium cut an unknown number of workers this summer blaming rising interest rates according to media reports likewise financial technology company upstart reduced the number of workers who help process loan applications by 140 some of those jobs were in columbus which the lender has designated as its second headquarters what companies are experiencing locally is being felt elsewhere around the country as tech firms ranging from facebook parent meta to amazon to twitter have been cutting tens of thousands of jobs this year we go through cycles we ve been fortunate we haven t gone through this in a long time said max brickman founder and managing director of heartland ventures a venture capital firm based at easton it s not time to panic young companies typically lose money and need cash as they grow sometimes having to double their head count in a matter of months and then having to double again in a year or so after that he said that cash becomes more costly as interest rates rise putting more pressure on the founder to use capital more efficiently he said 2021 was like an open bar brickman said of the money that was available to young companies this is more like a hangover interest rates inflation and rising costs of everything uncertainty slowing economy and employee compensation for highly competitive skilled technical talent has spiked in recent years said matt armstead who has started several companies has invested in startups and is a partner at columbus based horizon two labs which helps get companies off the ground it s a culmination of these things and market expectations of these companies having raised so much or being valued so highly we are simply at a point where those things have to get realigned young companies tough decisions founders and ceos of these companies say making cuts is the most difficult task they ve had to further improve cash flow we are prioritizing resources that support root s go forward strategy root ceo and cofounder alex timm said in a letter to shareholders as part of the company s release of its third quarter financial results last month as a result we have made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by roughly 20 this is the most difficult decision i ve had to make as ceo said sean lane who founded olive in 2012 but i make it knowing this is the right strategy for us to deliver on olive s mission i m inspired by what we have done and will continue to do to ensure olive s transformative impact for many years to come armstead said the cuts reflect a balancing act for fledgling companies that have to control costs to weather uncertain times ahead while scaling up on what s working our startup ecosystem is maturing that s the reality and it s important to recognize and appreciate what s happening he said we are on par with some of the more established startup scenes like silicon valley boston and new york the focus is no longer grow at all costs but rather focus on fundamentals and get better aligned towards profitability jobs still plentiful amid recession concerns but despite the cuts there is no sign of slowing demand for workers in ohio for now even though some tech companies in greater columbus are cutting jobs the region overall has added a solid 25 500 jobs over the past year according to state jobs data statewide there were 305 415 openings as of oct 13 the most recent data available according to ohiomeansjobs com the state s jobs website that s the most in data going back four years and an increase of 28 767 job postings from the reporting period in the prior month regional postings have been climbing this year too hitting fresh highs for several metro areas in 2022 on that most recent report there were 69 433 jobs openings for the columbus area 52 840 for the cincinnati area and 100 712 for the cleveland area even as job listings continue to climb employers indicate they struggle to find applicants for the positions they need to fill and that includes the startup companies it s still hard to find people in every space startups are not an exception brickman said there s a mismatch in the labor market between what skills and background that employers are looking for and the skills and background of the worker that are available nationwide senior economist ben ayers said while demand for labor remains strong for now he expects that to ease in 2023 as the federal reserve continues to raise interest rates to fight decades high inflation he said we would expect all of the key labor market data to slow heading into 2023 he said the current pace of job gains and employer demand is unsustainable especially given the sharp fed tightening cycle and signs of slowing demand across the economy nationwide is forecasting a recession next year but doesn t expect it to be as deep as the brief but powerful recession during the early days of the pandemic and the brutal great recession of 2007 to 2009 there will be some pain but it will be short lived resembling what would be considered a more typical kind of recession the american economy has experienced in the past ayers said the unemployment rate likely will increase by 2 to 3 percentage points the u s rate was 3 7 in november and the ohio rate was 4 2 in october ohio s unemployment report for november is due dec 16 with the rate peaking late next year or early 2024 he said the consensus is that we re going to slow down the common fear is that the fed is going to overreact said mark partridge the c william swank chair in rural urban policy at ohio state university they re going to be pushing so hard they re going to overreach beyond the federal reserve raising rates so much uncertainty right now could affect the economy whether it s a change in the war in ukraine or fuel prices that spiked earlier in the year he said but any slowdown or recession doesn t figure to change the long term track of the economy in the state s metro areas he said columbus population and economic growth for example should continue to shine coming out of any slowdown compared with other metros in the state as has been the case for the past several decades he said what we have today is what we re going to have in the future he said did valuations of startups get too high before going public two years ago various reports pegged the valuation of root at roughly 6 billion but once public the stock has tanked reflecting a company now worth about 100 million as it tries to strengthen its financial situation while some of the valuations of these young companies might seem high bricker said it s because they provide a savings and value to other businesses and consumers armstead said a company like root is more visible to the pressure and difficult decisions it has to make because it is public olive which is still private is making some of the same decisions but it isn t in the public eye both companies have investors and boards and they are pushing for controlling costs and a focus on profitability just like the much more established tech companies amazon or meta he said even companies in earlier stages of development have to show signs that they are getting their finances in order if they want to get the next stage of funding he said
after several years of what seemed like unfettered growth central ohio s young technology companies are finding they need to act like their more established brethren as a potential recession puts more pressure on them to control costs in july health technology company olive cut 450 jobs and last month root cut 20 of its staff or 137 jobs in the second round of cuts this year for the young auto insurance company mortgage lender lower com which bought the naming rights to the new crew stadium cut an unknown number of workers this summer blaming rising interest rates according to media reports likewise financial technology company upstart reduced the number of workers who help process loan applications by 140 some of those jobs were in columbus which the lender has designated as its second headquarters what companies are experiencing locally is being felt elsewhere around the country as tech firms ranging from facebook parent meta to amazon to twitter have been cutting tens of thousands of jobs this year we go through cycles we ve been fortunate we haven t gone through this in a long time said max brickman founder and managing director of heartland ventures a venture capital firm based at easton it s not time to panic young companies typically lose money and need cash as they grow sometimes having to double their head count in a matter of months and then having to double again in a year or so after that he said that cash becomes more costly as interest rates rise putting more pressure on the founder to use capital more efficiently he said 2021 was like an open bar brickman said of the money that was available to young companies this is more like a hangover interest rates inflation and rising costs of everything uncertainty slowing economy and employee compensation for highly competitive skilled technical talent has spiked in recent years said matt armstead who has started several companies has invested in startups and is a partner at columbus based horizon two labs which helps get companies off the ground it s a culmination of these things and market expectations of these companies having raised so much or being valued so highly we are simply at a point where those things have to get realigned young companies tough decisions founders and ceos of these companies say making cuts is the most difficult task they ve had to further improve cash flow we are prioritizing resources that support root s go forward strategy root ceo and cofounder alex timm said in a letter to shareholders as part of the company s release of its third quarter financial results last month as a result we have made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by roughly 20 this is the most difficult decision i ve had to make as ceo said sean lane who founded olive in 2012 but i make it knowing this is the right strategy for us to deliver on olive s mission i m inspired by what we have done and will continue to do to ensure olive s transformative impact for many years to come armstead said the cuts reflect a balancing act for fledgling companies that have to control costs to weather uncertain times ahead while scaling up on what s working our startup ecosystem is maturing that s the reality and it s important to recognize and appreciate what s happening he said we are on par with some of the more established startup scenes like silicon valley boston and new york the focus is no longer grow at all costs but rather focus on fundamentals and get better aligned towards profitability jobs still plentiful amid recession concerns but despite the cuts there is no sign of slowing demand for workers in ohio for now even though some tech companies in greater columbus are cutting jobs the region overall has added a solid 25 500 jobs over the past year according to state jobs data statewide there were 305 415 openings as of oct 13 the most recent data available according to ohiomeansjobs com the state s jobs website that s the most in data going back four years and an increase of 28 767 job postings from the reporting period in the prior month regional postings have been climbing this year too hitting fresh highs for several metro areas in 2022 on that most recent report there were 69 433 jobs openings for the columbus area 52 840 for the cincinnati area and 100 712 for the cleveland area even as job listings continue to climb employers indicate they struggle to find applicants for the positions they need to fill and that includes the startup companies it s still hard to find people in every space startups are not an exception brickman said there s a mismatch in the labor market between what skills and background that employers are looking for and the skills and background of the worker that are available nationwide senior economist ben ayers said while demand for labor remains strong for now he expects that to ease in 2023 as the federal reserve continues to raise interest rates to fight decades high inflation he said we would expect all of the key labor market data to slow heading into 2023 he said the current pace of job gains and employer demand is unsustainable especially given the sharp fed tightening cycle and signs of slowing demand across the economy nationwide is forecasting a recession next year but doesn t expect it to be as deep as the brief but powerful recession during the early days of the pandemic and the brutal great recession of 2007 to 2009 there will be some pain but it will be short lived resembling what would be considered a more typical kind of recession the american economy has experienced

less than 15 years later the university of california graduate would control around 50 percent of the market for pc software in japan the following decade would bring even more impressive growth as softbank tyo 9984 became the world s largest tech investor in 2021 softbank s record net profit of 45 88 billion topped that of warren buffet s berkshire hathaway in the same period 42 5 billion son through softbank s funds invested feaverishly as the technology sector soared during japan s lockdowns in 2020 2021 he reportedly made 60 investments from his tokyo mansion in just three months as softbank s total investments reached almost 100 billion between 2016 and 2021 some of the japanese giant s investee companies include the likes of uber wework bytedance owner of tiktok ola cabs didi

million this compares to a profit of around us 2 billion in the corresponding six month period in 2021 analysts are now tipping softbank s losses will continue widening in the second half of the japanese financial year and what about the valuations of its investments for the july to september quarter the valuation of its investments in its two vision funds and its latin america focussed start up fund fell by close to us 10 billion this 10 billion loss on investments in just three months included an approximately 100 million write down on its investment in failed crypto exchange ftx masayoshi son s hail mary the technology rout and the devaluation of softbank s investments in unprofitable tech haven t just led to the demise of softbank s balance sheet and share price the personal finances of masayoshi son are also under fire in november the financial times revealed son personally owes softbank us 4 7 billion which he borrowed from the company to use to invest in the firm s funds at the height of the tech bubble here s an excerpt from the ft the billionaire s ballooning personal liabilities discovered through a financial times analysis of softbank s recent filings comes as the world s biggest tech investor was hammered by plunging tech stocks and valuations in private companies over the past year the widening losses in softbank s various investment vehicles have also added billions of dollars to the tab that son owes the group in relation to its technology bets this is because softbank fronted him the money to invest in its technology related funds which he is under no obligation to repay for many years but it now appears son sees one way out of this potentially catastrophic softbank collapse the only way most vc s know an ipo in recent weeks son announced he s stepping back from the day to day operations of softbank to focus on taking the company s semiconductor chip designer subsidiary arm limited public arm s field of activity will expand explosively son declared in a briefing for softbank s q2 2022 results the current climate is such that the companies those listed or unlisted that we have invested are being hit so hard that their results have almost been wiped out this has given us a lot to consider the question is what path should softbank group take now i will concentrate on arm and the fields surrounding it this is the most useful thing we can do for shareholders of softbank group this will be my last message for the time being at an earnings results meeting softbank acquired uk based arm limited for us 32 billion in 2016 arm s chips are widely used in smartphones including the apple iphone masayoshi son at softbank s q2 2022 earnings results briefing in november 2022 where he revealed he d be stepping back from softbank to focus on the ipo of the group s chip design business arm limited softbank is said to be seeking a valuation of us 60 billion almost double the original purchase price when arm ipo s in london in 2023 but son will have his work cut out plans to ipo have reportedly been delayed to due to global economic and market volatility particularly in europe where arm is based while in february 2022 a us40 billion proposed acquisition of arm by chip giant nvidia was terminated due to significant regulatory challenges if the arm ipo fails softbank will bring down the venture capital house hedge fund management veteran chris macintosh has been warning of softbank s demise since 2019 i think softbank is potentially the lehman of venture capital not in the too big to fail bracket but in the bring down the house bracket he says that has ramifications not just in vc but across a broad set of asset classes so it cannot be ignored by investors macintosh compares the state of the venture capital industry today to that of the us housing market just prior to the 2008 financial crisis we all know about the global financial crisis which was an excess in the housing market that was a 2008 affair purely from a timescale perspective we re due around about now we sure as hell are pretty damn pregnant take a look around yourself today and tell me what s crazier than wework uber lyft alibaba tesla and yes softbank i m 100 certain that this time around it s going to be vc a classic ponzi scheme if son can pull off a liquidity windfall through the arm ipo and save softbank macintosh says it will be like making love with a crocodile it d be a heck of a story to tell but only because the odds of coming out alive are so slim it s the classic ponzi scheme you always need fresh new capital to pay off the old capital in order for the scheme to continue when there is no fresh new money everything reverses and folks quickly realise the value of positive cash flow softbank accounts for half the outstanding japanese corporate bonds it is by far the biggest issuer of retail bonds now if this wasn t bad enough consider that this is a company as opaque as casper what we ve got here is a gigantic entity with questionable financing arrangements that hold an isht ton of negative cash flowing assets and is loaded to the eyeballs in debt more than 40 years on from starting softbank with quote no money experience or talent today son has it all but never has it looked more vulnerable in the coming months we ll see if that money experience and talent can prevent the lehman moment of vc stay

this relatively small social media platform is eating its competitors lunches if you ve been paying attention 2022 has been a lousy year for digital advertisers during the second quarter and again in the third meta platforms parent of facebook and instagram reported declining ad revenue for the first time since its initial public offering the drama at facebook s parent company was minor compared to snap a difficult time adapting to new privacy rules that make it harder for social media apps to track their members behaviors recently caused average revenue per user to fall by a double digit percentage with all the trouble facing social media stocks lately you might be surprised to learn that one of the best growth stocks you can buy right now belongs to doximity docs 1 42 a company that operates a social media platform here s how it separated itself from the pack to become an unbeatable destination for advertisers with very deep pockets gaining market share doximity s main operation is a social media platform that counts around 80 of u s physicians as members doximity s curated social media feed doesn t let members post their own content but does help them stay informed about their specialties with the vast majority of practicing clinicians already plugged in doximity s productivity tools are enormously useful in addition to allowing doctors to discuss patients together in a professional setting doximity has telehealth features that a record 370 000 physicians used in the third quarter a curated news feed isn t terribly interesting on a personal level but it means advertisers can rest assured that their brands aren t seen in proximity to problematic content both brand protection and a qualified audience are powerful selling points that have advertisers opening their wallets further for doximity in the third quarter average revenue per existing marketing partner rose 25 year over year room to grow doximity reported that third quarter revenue grew 29 year over year to 102 million that s just a sliver of a total addressable market doximity measures at 18 5 billion doximity s total addressable market estimate is enormous but hardly an exaggeration americans spend more than 3 5 trillion on healthcare annually and doctors decide 73 of that spending in addition to advertising doximity has a growing hiring solutions business and premium productivity tool features that hospital systems are increasingly eager to pay for know the risks doximity is the only big social network geared specifically toward u s healthcare professionals it s tremendously profitable now and without any serious competitors on the horizon rapid growth for many years seems likely shares of doximity are around 65 below their all time high but a lot of the company s growth potential is already baked into its price the stock currently trades at around 51 5 times forward looking earnings expectations at this high valuation any hint of a slowdown over the next few years could lead to a severe stock market beating i think doximity s powerful network effect will keep potential competitors at bay and allow it to continue growing by leaps and bounds that said my doximity position is a relatively small part of a diversified portfolio if you re going to take a chance on this stock it s a good idea to do the same
the right strategy can maximize your earnings during a bull market this year has been a rocky one for the stock market and if you re feeling discouraged about investing you re not alone the good news though is that a bull market is on the way while nobody knows exactly when stocks will rebound every single bear market has eventually given way to a bull market right now is the time to start preparing for the inevitable upswing and there are a few warren buffett approved strategies to make the most of it 1 maintain a long term outlook when we re in the thick of a downturn it can be tough to stay optimistic but one of the best ways to build wealth in the stock market is to invest during the low points and simply wait for the market to recover in 2008 during the height of the great recession warren buffett wrote an opinion piece for the new york times ear is now widespread gripping even seasoned investors he writes but fears regarding the long term prosperity of the nation s many sound companies make no sense these businesses will indeed suffer earnings hiccups as they always have but most major companies will be setting new profit records five 10 and 20 years from now as you re preparing for a bull market a long term outlook is key try to avoid getting caught up in the short term market movements and instead stay focused on your investments long term potential 2 focus on businesses over stocks the stocks you choose can make or break your portfolio particularly during periods of volatility if you choose the right investments you could see substantial gains when the market starts to rebound choosing high quality stocks comes down to picking the right companies businesses with solid fundamentals are more likely to survive a market downturn or recession even if they take a hit in the short term they have a much better chance of thriving over the long run buffett makes a point to only invest in the strongest companies in berkshire hathaway s 2021 letter to shareholders he explains that he and business partner charlie munger own stocks based upon our expectations about their long term business performance and not because we view them as vehicles for timely market moves that point is crucial he continues charlie and i are not stock pickers we are business pickers 3 invest now before prices rebound when stock prices are down across the board it may not seem like the best time to buy however right now is one of the best investing opportunities of the year not only can you snag quality stocks at a discount but by investing during the market s slumps you could see significant returns when the market eventually rebounds for instance between 1999 and 2001 amazon lost nearly 95 of its value amid the dot com bubble burst but if you had invested at its lowest point and simply waited it out you would have seen returns of more than 700 over the next two years alone market downturns can be incredible buying opportunities but if you wait too long to invest you could miss out on some of those earnings let me be clear on one point i can t predict the short term movements of the stock market buffett explains in the times article what is likely however is that the market will move higher perhaps substantially so well before either sentiment or the economy turns up so if you wait for the robins spring will be over we may not know exactly when the next bull market will begin but by investing now when prices are lower and then holding those investments for the long term you can take full advantage of the inevitable upswing
many people who work in addiction treatment have a personal story to tell of how it relates to their life in my case i had a brother who was a chronic alcoholic for most of his adult life he was involved in drinking it was very sad to see his life how it evolved and how it ended up he died early in his life in his mid 50s and it was a lonely death that affected me as i was close to him but there s not much i could have done for him because he chose not to get help over the course of my 42 year career i have developed outpatient alcohol substance abuse centers inpatient centers and worked in rehabilitation centers i do a lot of alcohol evaluations for drunk driving which i take very seriously because i don t want to read that one day one of my patients that i said was fine kills somebody in a car accident i have a community obligation stock image alcoholism and addiction can tear families apart inset dr shafer zysman an oasas counselor with a private practice in new york stock image alcoholism and addiction can tear families apart inset dr shafer zysman an oasas counselor with a private practice in new york istock getty dr shafer zysman i treat patients that are dealing with alcoholism predominantly i treat them through talking therapy and getting them involved in self help groups although in some cases they will also require medical intervention the tendency to relapse is very great even after outpatient or inpatient care i m limited in terms of what i can do that s why the patient s involvement in some kind of support system like alcoholics anonymous aa is critical to their ongoing recovery i was involved in the early development of outpatient treatment for alcohol and drugs i also worked in inpatient treatment for many years most of the stays were less than a month they d do psychoeducational training in learning about the disease of alcoholism group therapy individual therapy and counseling sessions with their family it s a very powerful intervention there s no set age group for my patients you have adolescent groups middle aged and elderly people there s no distinction in socioeconomic groups either because the ceo of a corporation is no different from the guy that s the blue collar worker in that corporation in terms of addiction issues in the old days in white collar professions you had cocktail lunches and people went out for business lunches in those areas drinking on the job was accepted until it becomes dysfunctional and your productivity diminishes i saw many patients involved with the stock exchange who were addicted to cocaine and were functional alcoholics but they were not an exclusive group i have seen patients from every socio economic level construction workers politicians pilots athletes and even clergy no group is excluded or immune from this disease the greatest consequence is the loss of family where the wife kicks out the husband or vice versa it s not a gender issue and they re basically homeless i ve seen very successful people go from rags to riches from riches to rags they blew everything and lost everything about them their self esteem their sense of identity their job and so forth the following however are the patients that stand out most clearly to me the man who stayed in denial i had a patient who was a very successful businessman an entrepreneur in his mid 40s who had had years of drinking but had disguised it very well saying he was just entertaining his clients but the drinking became more severe he became violent with his family especially his wife he didn t really care what happened he ran around having affairs and so on he was blowing money left and right and they were on the verge of losing their home he lost his business as his clients began to go elsewhere his wife left him and his kids wanted very little to do with him it was at this point that he came to me he was there because his family made him go he wasn t all that motivated and his behavior was not consistent with his promises to his family he would be good for a couple of weeks maybe a month and then go back to drinking at some point he phased out he decided he was just going to live his life and he didn t really recognize that this was a major issue even though all these things collapsed there was always a rationale for it it was his wife s fault it was this and that it was everyone s fault but his own which is part of their denial system his wife ended up divorcing him and now he lives alone in a little studio this is not an atypical situation in my experience relapse is more predominant than success stories that s without a doubt the most challenging part of my job stock image in this essay dr shafer zysman shares his experiences of working with people who have an alcohol addiction stock image in this essay dr shafer zysman shares his experiences of working with people who have an alcohol addiction istock the woman who lost her son i recently saw a lady who had a history of alcoholism and was trying to reconnect with her son her son is now in his 30s and has his own child in sessions he would always mention that he d had to deal with his mother s alcoholism over the years and how as an only child he had had to mature way beyond his age he talked about the pain of that and having to watch out for his mother and make sure she didn t drink she would have sustained periods of abstinence and then following an emotional event or situation she would go back to drinking and he would have to intervene it was sad following this dynamic between the two of them i saw them for several years and i thought that we were doing pretty well in establishing a good relationship between the two of them they d come together once a week take walks do all that and then it collapsed more recently his mother had a long period of abstinence again and she was involved in meetings and so on with aa but even so he always feared that she would come into the house where he lived with his wife and child and that she would drink and disrupt his lifestyle so not too long ago he cut her out he said i m not dealing with you anymore and that devastated her she just lost him and lost her access to her grandchild it was very sad to see i ve seen a lot of that a lot of those stories the ones who make a full recovery i ve seen thousands and thousands of patients so i ve seen many who have done well in their lives and continued to do so there was a police officer for instance who was again a chronic alcoholic he had his ups and downs again always revolving around family and sometimes the job but he was able to accept the fact that he had a drinking problem which was a triumph in itself because in my experience people in blue tend to be somewhat guarded about their personal lives given the nature of their work but his wife again had threatened to divorce him and sell the house which was a wake up call he began to accept the fact that his drinking was affecting him as a person and his family life he worked at it and did well it s now been two years and he has not gone back to drinking being in recovery is about more than not drinking as you can abstain from drinking but still have what we call alcoholic attitude where the other behaviors are the same but you just don t drink i would say that a recovered person or someone in recovery is someone who is trying to deal with their drinking as well as their behavioral issues to make them more understanding of the people around them dr shafer zysman is a credentialed oasas practitioner he

economists are starting to worry about the sustainability of high levels of debt as global interest rates rise sharply a credit crunch could fuel the mother of all economic crises nouriel roubini warned last week some experts have compared the current situation to the structural issues that triggered the 2008 financial crash new look sign up to get the inside scoop on today s biggest stories in markets tech and business delivered daily read preview thanks for signing up access your favorite topics in a personalized feed while you re on the go download the app email address sign up by clicking sign up you accept our terms of service and privacy policy you can opt out at any time advertisement as global interest rates rise at a staggering pace economists are starting to worry about the mountain of debt built up over the years when borrowing costs languished near zero nouriel roubini raised the alarm last week warning that the steep rise in rates could erode the ability of households and companies to meet their loan repayment commitments he said that could trigger the mother of all economic crises roubini echoed organizations like the international monetary fund and the world bank whose chiefs have warned that the rising debt burden puts the global economy at risk of slipping into a severe recession concerns have grown as to whether the high levels of debt in the us economy are sustainable after the federal reserve boosted its benchmark rate to 4 from a range between zero and 0 25 as recently as march other central banks across the world also have lifted rates sharply to combat soaring prices advertisement here s why economists have started fretting about the risk of a debt crunch and why such an eventuality could lead to a stock market crash why has global debt risen in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis central banks flooded markets with cheap money by slashing interest rates to record lows and using a policy known as quantitative easing qe to buy trillions of dollars in financial assets the fall in borrowing costs made it easier for companies governments and ordinary americans to take out loans and fueled the rise of what roubini calls zombies people and businesses propped up by cheap debt rather than sound financials and as interest rates have rebounded sharply this year it s getting harder for those borrowers to repay their loans advertisement what s happening with interest rates the fed is raising interest rates in a bid to tame inflation which is running close to forty year highs that monetary tightening campaign is aimed at bringing down consumer spending which would help to curb price rises but it also raises the cost of borrowing making it more expensive for individuals to take out a loan to buy a house for companies to invest in their business and for governments to spend on education or healthcare it also makes it harder for debt laden zombies to secure financing advertisement what could happen next roubini has warned that a combination of mounting debt high inflation and low growth will trigger a global economic crash and that stocks could fall another 25 central banks like the fed won t be able to prevent an economic downturn because consumer prices would increase faster if policy makers eased up on tightening he said the mother of all stagflationary debt crises can be postponed not avoided roubini wrote in a project syndicate op ed last week the imf and the world bank have linked the runup in debt to heightened instability with the threat of a crisis potentially injecting further volatility into markets next year advertisement how would that compare to 2008 it s natural for economists to draw comparisons between the current situation and the last major financial crisis in 2008 cheap credit and lenient lending standards helped to fuel a housing bubble and when that popped prices plummeted and exposed banks went bust roubini has drawn comparisons between the build up in debt that s causing economists to fret right now and that global financial crisis when stock markets rapidly lost around half their value so while war in ukraine rising interest rates and a looming recession are the stories dominating markets a potential debt crisis could quickly rocket up investors long list of concerns for 2023

the s p 500 is likely to bounce back from its current low as the index has not recorded a back to back annual slump since 2002 dear readers welcome to another episode of the coinspeaker advent calendar today we will explore the last of the three major united states market indexes the s p 500 index in 2023 thus far in this advent calendar we have been able to bring some cryptocurrencies commodities and indices that are either worth investing in in the new year or which investors need to steer clear of the reality is that the coming year may have some spillover economic turmoil from what was experienced this year as an investment to place a bet on the s p 500 is a relatively robust index that tracks the performance of the 500 largest stocks trading either on the new york stock exchange nyse or the nasdaq global select market examples of companies featured in the s p 500 include american airlines group inc nasdaq aal arch capital group ltd nasdaq acgl berkshire hathaway inc nyse brk a and eli lilly and co nyse lly amongst others investing in the s p 500 is like betting on all of the stocks and this can create a bearish or bullish contagion depending on the overall trend in the economy and the response of the constituent stocks at a time the s p 500 in 2023 growth record and future potentials the s p 500 has been used to track the performance of its constituent stocks for decades a time that comes off with positive and negative growth tracks looking at the historic price trend of the s p 500 there has been an annual positive growth trend since 2009 although the 2018 fiscal year ended with a 4 38 slump the impressive performance of the index which closed upward at 18 40 and 28 71 in 2020 and 2021 one of the most economically distressing years this decade shows the resilience of the index and how good of an investment opportunity it can chart for investors however there seems to be a very bearish capitulation at the moment with the s p 500 set to close this year with a 17 slump its first double digital slump since 2008 the consistent interest rate hikes from the us federal reserve a move that was precipitated by growing inflation have negatively impacted growth stocks and their associated indices the increased interest rates will however help stocks in general from next year and the chances that inflation will be tapered down are high which is good for the s p 500 bottom line as a whole that being said the s p 500 is also likely to bounce back from its current low as the index has not recorded a back to back annual slump since 2002 chances are that repeating that bearish stride is unlikely and despite the economic headwinds that may be experienced next year the s p 500 is bound to close the year on a positive note the s p 500 has a bigger stock cushion than the dow jones industrial average indexdjx dji and the nasdaq composite indexnasdaq ixic and as such offers a better safety option for investors to our readers who may want to inject capital into the index funds tracking the s p 500 in depth research and an appropriate risk management measure are advocated here is the wrap for today s episode stay tuned as we bring you another informative content tomorrow

in this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of abbvie inc nyse abbv by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today s value we will take advantage of the discounted cash flow dcf model for this purpose believe it or not it s not too difficult to follow as you ll see from our example remember though that there are many ways to estimate a company s value and a dcf is just one method anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the simply wall st analysis model view our latest analysis for abbvie the model we use what is known as a 2 stage model which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company s cash flows generally the first stage is higher growth and the second stage is a lower growth phase to start off with we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows where possible we use analyst estimates but when these aren t available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow fcf from the last estimate or reported value we assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow over this period we do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years advertisement advertisement a dcf is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today s value 10 year free cash flow fcf estimate 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 levered fcf millions us 21 4b us 21 4b us 24 6b us 27 0b us 28 7b us 30 2b us 31 5b us 32 6b us 33 6b us 34 5b growth rate estimate source analyst x7 analyst x7

5k est fcf growth rate estimated by simply wall st present value of 10 year cash flow pvcf us 194b advertisement advertisement after calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10 year period we need to calculate the terminal value which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage for a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country s gdp growth in this case we have used the 5 year average of the 10 year government bond yield 2 0 to estimate future growth in the same way as with the 10 year growth period we discount future cash flows to today s value using a cost of equity of 7 0 terminal value tv fcf 2032 1 g r g us 35b 1 2 0 7 0 2 0 us 695b present value of terminal value pvtv tv 1 r 10 us 695b 1 7 0 10 us 352b the total value or equity value is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows which in this case is us 546b in the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding compared to the current share price of us 163 the company appears quite good value at a 47 discount to where the stock price trades currently valuations are imprecise instruments though rather like a telescope move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy do keep this in mind dcf the assumptions now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company s future performance so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions the dcf also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry or a company s future capital requirements so it does not give a full picture of a company s potential performance given that we are looking at abbvie as potential shareholders the cost of equity is used as the discount rate rather than the cost of capital or weighted average cost of capital wacc which accounts for debt in this calculation we ve used 7 0 which is based on a levered beta of 0 909 beta is a measure of a stock s volatility compared to the market as a whole we get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies with an imposed limit between 0 8 and 2 0 which is a reasonable range for a stable business looking ahead although the valuation of a company is important it ideally won t be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company it s not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a dcf model rather it should be seen as a guide to what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under overvalued for instance if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly it can dramatically alter the overall result what is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value for abbvie we ve compiled three essential factors you should look at advertisement advertisement risks for example we ve discovered 2 warning signs for abbvie that you should

in 2015 state farm s ceo earned 13 3 million overseeing america s largest property insurance company that same year at tampa based heritage insurance holdings one of numerous small florida based homeowners insurance companies its ceo made 27 3 million despite overseeing 0 3 of the number of policies and accounts of state farm florida based insurance companies have been going out of business the last few years or raising rates by double digits industry groups and gov ron desantis have blamed excessive litigation and republican legislators are poised this week to limit the incentives to sue insurers but state lawmakers have largely ignored an issue that has been directly blamed for numerous past company failures and allowed some executives to make eye popping sums of money over the last decade when companies were wildly profitable thanks to years without a storm between 2014 and 2018 the ceo for fort lauderdale based universal insurance holdings made between 14 million and 25 million each year corporate filings show the company has reduced its policies in florida over the last year at st petersburg based united insurance holdings whose insurance arm fell under state supervision last week the company awarded millions of dollars in stock dividends most of which went to company officers and directors even while its profits shrank according to corporate filings the payouts are legal under florida law and necessary some say while insurance companies in florida are closely regulated with caps on payouts and profits their parent and sister companies are largely unregulated that makes the small domestic companies that dominate florida s market more lucrative to investors state regulators have long been aware of the dangers of out sized arrangements between insurers and their sister and parent companies large payouts to executives were at the heart of the biggest insurer collapse in the state s history the 2008 failure of the tampa based poe insurance group which left floridians on the hook paying roughly 850 million in outstanding claims from the 2004 and 2005 storms the state sued to recoup 143 5 million in dividends the company paid to owners and their family members between 2004 and 2005 since then excessive payouts have been a consistent theme among the graveyard of companies that have failed financial autopsies on companies that went insolvent between 2011 and 2018 have repeatedly blamed high salaries and fees to affiliated companies in one case the autopsy said one insurer s officers were stripping company of cash how much such payouts could be to blame for the current wave of failures seven companies in the last year is unknown in 2020 when florida s insurance industry began deteriorating after 12 years without a named hurricane hitting the state the office of insurance regulation launched a review of dozens of domestic insurers and their affiliates the office has not released the results because the review is ongoing and the responses are confidential under state law an office spokesperson said state lawmakers are considering this week expanding regulators ability to examine affiliate companies but only after hurricanes legislators special session begins monday doug quinn executive director of the watchdog american policyholder association said his group has done its own research on executive compensation florida s history of failures indicates the state s current policies aren t working he said if i pick a state and i say we re going to allow you to come in and start a business and bilk people out of premiums yes you ll attract a lot of people to start insurance companies he said lessons from poe between 2004 and 2005 florida was struck by eight hurricanes the worst stretch in modern history florida s insurance market was devastated since 1992 s hurricane andrew the state has relied on dozens of small florida based insurance companies to insure most homes at the time the largest was the poe insurance group created by former tampa mayor bill poe which oversaw three different insurers and about 320 000 homeowners policies the 2004 and 2005 storms were devastating to the bottom lines of these firms which saw 2 5 billion in losses by 2006 all three companies were insolvent and the state levied a 2 assessment on every floridian s insurance policy to pay out the companies 850 million in outstanding claims when state regulators took over the companies they discovered that each one had entered into an agreement with a sister company in january 2004 the sister company called poe insurance managers provided policy issuance and underwriting services for the three insurance companies in exchange for fees of anywhere between 22 5 to 26 5 of the insurers gross written premiums the profits of poe insurance managers were then distributed to shareholders through dividends and they were considerable between 2004 and 2005 it paid 143 5 million to company shareholders even though the company was in dire financial condition poe himself collected 25 million once the money moves from the insurance company to the affiliate it s no longer available to pay claims in 2008 the state sued to recoup the money claiming it was an intentional and financially reckless scheme to drain and divert the assets of the insolvent insurers for the sole purpose of eliminating their own potential financial exposure and increasing their personal wealth poe denied the claims and said the family put in over 70 million to try to save the companies although poe s collapse was the largest insurance company failure in florida history state lawmakers did not enhance their scrutiny of companies affiliated with insurers these affiliates can still charge the insurance company up to 25 per policy as well as a percentage fee for providing services to the insurer that fee commonly between 20 and 30 and approved by regulators is often tied to policyholder rates when rates go up so does the fee large insurers usually have their own in house employees write policies and provide underwriting others might pay an independent third party company for the services florida s market is instead dominated by insurance companies that pay their affiliated companies for the work said jack nicholson who led florida s hurricane catastrophe fund for decades experts also say there s a reason why many florida insurance companies are set up like this after hurricane andrew national insurance companies dramatically reduced their risk in florida especially along the coast state regulators and lawmakers encouraged new florida based insurance companies to operate but those companies needed to raise tens of millions of dollars to get off the ground how do you incentivize investors to do something like that said florida state university college of business professor chuck nyce that s why you see that structure in florida a long running trend an insurance company s relationship with its affiliated companies can turn a loss into a profit the sarasota herald tribune found during its 2011 pulitzer prize winning series on florida s insurance market homeowners choice inc reported 2009 losses of 650 000 for the regulated insurance company and a 2009 profit of 11 million profit for the holding company the newspaper found that was in part because the insurance company paid an affiliated management firm 24 million for management services that cost 15 4 million in 2008 alone investors and executives moved a collective 1 9 billion in policyholder money out of florida insurers to their affiliated companies the newspaper found since poe s collapse state regulators have repeatedly tied insurance company failures to excessive or unusual payouts to affiliated companies state reports show after the 2009 failure of first commercial insurance co and one of its affiliates auditors wrote that its officers appear to have been stripping the company of cash magnolia insurance co existed for two years and still managed to pay out more than 1 million in dividends to its investors which included current and former officers of the company auditors wrote at seminole casualty insurance co which mostly offered automobile coverage auditors cited excessive and unreasonable fees paid to related parties for its 2011 demise after the 2011 failure of aequicap insurance co auditors noted the company paid commissions claims servicing and management fees to various related parties but the company didn t keep enough records for auditors to know if the agreements should have been approved by state regulators after homewise insurance co and one of its affiliates went insolvent in 2011 auditors wrote that in both cases the fault appears to be the result of an excessive outflow of cash from the company to homewise management company its parent company during the final years at workers compensation underwriter insurance company of the americas the company funded questionable payments to other companies auditors wrote it folded in 2018 at sunshine state insurance co auditors found the company was paying affiliates for overlapping services including some that were not approved by state regulators before its 2014 collapse under state law the department of financial services is required to report the causes behind each insurance company s insolvency none of these reports about the seven companies that have gone insolvent for the last two years have been released when an insurance company fails it falls into receivership with the department agency spokesperson devin galetta said that under state law the department can t release an insolvency report until the end of the lifetime of the estate the estates can last five to seven years he said of the reports for the companies that have gone insolvent between 2008 and 2018 none cite litigation as a reason for the companies demise big paydays some of the companies that are now struggling awarded big payouts to their ceos during florida s storm free years when heritage insurance cos was starting up in 2013 the state run citizens property insurance board of governors made the unusual decision to pay the company up to 52 million to take out policies republican lawmakers raised concerns about the deal and questions revolved around the 110 000 the company donated to then gov rick scott s campaign account the palm beach post reported at the time the company became highly profitable in 2015 the ceo of heritage s parent company bruce lucas was awarded more than 11 million in cash and another 16 million in stock that same year heritage s insurance company asked florida regulators for permission to raise rates on some customers by up to 25 the palm beach post reported in 2015 he sold nearly 19 million in stock according to federal filings lucas wife who was also a director of heritage s insurance company with a 150 000 salary was also paid as a 400 per hour consultant in 2017 earning an additional 440 000 that year corporate filings show since lucas left the company has reported steady losses and is limiting its exposure in florida in 2017 universal s ceo sean downes was the highest paid property and casualty insurance company executive in the nation according to an analysis by s p global market intelligence at 19 3 million downes was paid more than the ceos of allstate 17 1 million travelers 14 8 million and progressive 9 3 million between 2013 and 2019 downes earned between 9 million and 25 million each year federal filings show universal florida s largest domestic insurer with about 872 000 policies has shed about 100 000 policies in the state over the last year although it remains healthier than most other domestic insurers since 2019 the company s executive compensation has changed considerably chief strategy officer arash soleimani said in a statement since that time we have meaningfully restructured and reduced executive compensation including major reductions to salaries cash bonuses and equity grants soleimani said adding that over 90 of its shareholders voted in favor of the compensation plan at its most recent meeting ceos at other domestic companies routinely made over 1 million and family members also benefited public filings show at united insurance holdings the parent company of united property casualty which fell under state supervision last week after heavy losses ceo daniel peed regularly earned more than 4 million a year in stock dividends the quarterly dividend payments ended in this year s second quarter the executive compensation at the companies has fallen sharply in the last few years and executives who didn t sell their company stock have lost millions of dollars in net worth noted paul handerhan president of the consumer oriented federal association for insurance reform based in fort lauderdale the current ceo of universal for example reported 3 5 million in compensation last year when we had no storms all the insurance companies were making money and they were all making great income handerhan said from 2017 on all their executive compensation has taken a nosedive last year state lawmakers at the urging of regulators allowed for more oversight of sister and parent companies of insurance providers the office of insurance regulation said that it routinely reviews the agreements between insurers and affiliates in 2010 the office ordered southern oak insurance to reduce the commissions it was paying to one of its affiliates in its 2020 request for information to insurance companies the agency asked them to disclose how much money their affiliates made from providing their services about any physical office space insurers gave to their affiliates without charge and about any loans the insurers received and from whom legislation introduced for this week s special session would allow state regulators to examine insurers after hurricanes if they have made significant payments to their affiliate companies in the

vancouver the effects of climate change are taking a toll on christmas tree farms across canada with one forestry expert and the head of the canadian christmas tree association saying the sector that s already undergoing shifts will need to adapt vancouver the effects of climate change are taking a toll on christmas tree farms across canada with one forestry expert and the head of the canadian christmas tree association saying the sector that s already undergoing shifts will need to adapt the festive trees take eight to 12 years to reach the size most people look for and young seedlings are particularly vulnerable to climate risks said richard hamelin head of the forest conservation sciences department at the university of b c much of the province has experienced prolonged drought and extreme heat over the last two summers and the seedlings have shallow root systems that don t reach beyond the very dry layers of soil near the surface hamelin explained meanwhile their older counterparts may survive but lose their needles or turn brown as a result of extreme heat and drought he said in an interview seedlings and their shallow roots are also at risk of being inundated during flooding while wet cool soils increase the risk of root diseases hamelin noted record breaking atmospheric rivers of rain caused extensive flooding throughout southwestern b c in november 2021 but shirley brennan the executive director of the canadian christmas trees association said farmers in the province reported their seedlings mostly appeared fine and the extreme heat had been much harder on the trees the effects of flooding however may become clearer over time right now the seedlings look ok but it s whether or not the root system is strong enough to grow into that tree and that s what we don t know brennan said quebec ontario and nova scotia lead the country when it comes to producing christmas trees and brennan said farmers in those provinces have also been grappling with the effects of increasingly extreme unseasonable weather brennan said she has spoken with tree farmers from across southwestern ontario and the greater toronto area some of whom told her they lost upwards of 40 per cent of their crops as they didn t receive rain between may and august this year christmas tree farmers are no strangers to drought brennan added drought is part of farming she said mother nature is a silent partner in any farming commodity whether it s christmas trees or whether it is corn the difference brennan said is the extreme unseasonable nature of recent droughts and other climate related events including intense late spring frosts in nova scotia in 2018 followed by eastern ontario and western quebec in 2020 brennan said she expects more tree farmers will start planting seedlings in both spring and fall when they would normally favour planting in one season hamelin noted climate change is also causing warmer weather that fuels activity among pests which can plague trees already weakened by drought or disease just like humans when we are stressed or when we re more tired we re more susceptible to diseases well trees are the same way he said all this added stress from all this heat and flooding make the trees more susceptible to pests and pathogens climate change is not the only factor challenging farmers and threatening canada s stock of real christmas trees which has been declining for several years since the trees take about a decade to reach the desired size the closure of tree farms in canada and the united states during the 2008 recession is now being felt the closures have continued since then data from statistics canada shows the total area of christmas tree farms shrunk by nearly 20 000 acres between 2011 and 2021 the average age of a tree farmer is between 65 and 85 years old and younger generations aren t entering the sector as longtime farmers retire brennan noted hamelin said the high cost of land and competition with crops that yield revenue more quickly than festive trees may also be inhibiting factors for the sector in b c he pointed to some options that could help christmas tree farmers weather the effects of climate change including genetically selecting and breeding the strongest trees among classic canadian speciesor importing different species from parts of the world where fir trees are better adapted to sweltering heat such as turkey the plantation like approach to christmas tree farming is also completely unnatural leaving seedlings and young trees exposed to the sun he said christmas tree farmers could consider letting some trees grow taller or planting seedlings in areas where more mature trees could provide some shade he said i think there are some solutions we just need to scratch our head and realize that things are different and in the future we just need to change the way we do things this report by the canadian press was first published dec 11 2022 brenna owen the canadian press

these oil stocks are well positioned heading into the new year this past year has been a fascinating one for the oil market crude prices rocketed into the triple digits following russia s invasion of ukraine however they ve since given back most of those gains on concerns that rising interest rates to combat inflation will drive the economy into a recession next year denting oil demand despite all that volatility most oil stocks have surged this year as investors realize that fossil fuels remain vital to fueling the economy given that backdrop it s difficult to know what will happen in the oil patch in 2023 however a few fool com contributors believe that some oil stocks stand out as great buys heading into the new year here s why they think investors should scoop up shares of kinder morgan kmi 1 56 phillips 66 psx 1 83 and chevron cvx 0 83 before the end of this year regaining trust in the income story reuben gregg brewer kinder morgan it is completely understandable if conservative income investors chose not to buy kinder morgan after its 2016 dividend cut the big issue was that just a couple of months prior to the cut management was talking about dividend increases in 2016 there s a legitimate trust issue there however since that point kinder morgan has been working hard to regain investor trust a big part of that has been regular annual dividend increases since 2018 and while kinder morgan s dividend increase in 2020 was smaller than management had promised another blow on the trust front management specifically stated that the decision was related to dividend safety in 2016 the problem was too much leverage so it looks like the north american midstream giant realizes that dividend consistency is the key issue for investors highlighted by the fact that distributable cash flow covered the dividend by roughly 1 7 times in the third quarter of 2022 there s ample room there to increase the payment and to absorb adverse events all of this plays into kinder morgan s business as well it owns the pipelines storage processing and transportation infrastructure that helps to move oil and natural gas around the world most of its business is driven by fees which means that commodity prices don t play a huge role on the top or bottom line it is exactly the kind of company you would expect to pay a reliable dividend now that management is more on board with that the generous 6 or so dividend yield is probably worth a closer look but only if you can look past the 2016 cut big things to come matt dilallo phillips 66 phillips 66 recently outlined big plans to return even more cash to its shareholders in 2023 and beyond the diversified energy giant aims to send its investors an additional 10 billion to 12 billion by the end of 2024 via dividends and share repurchases that will add to the more than 30 billion it has already returned to investors since its formation a decade ago the company has already authorized a 5 billion increase in its share repurchase authorization meanwhile it boosted its dividend by another 5 earlier this year and has given investors 11 raises in 10 years more dividend growth seems likely over the next few years making its 3 8 yielding payout attractive for income seeking investors fueling phillips 66 s increased capital return plans is a strategy to grow its adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda by 3 billion over the next three years a third of that will come from its plan to acquire the remaining stake in dcp midstream that it doesn t already own the company boosted its interest in that master limited partnership mlp in a deal with canadian energy giant enbridge in exchange for cash and a stake in an oil pipeline phillips 66 hopes to seal a deal to buy the rest of the mlp from outside investors so it can capture the anticipated 1 billion of ebitda accretion it predicts it will see by integrating its operations the company also expects sustainable cost savings from its business transformation and incremental income from expansion projects to boost its earnings that combination of earnings growth and increased shareholder returns should give phillips 66 s stock the fuel to head higher over the next few years that makes it a great oil stock to buy before the end of this year so that investors can capitalize on this upside opportunity a dividend aristocrat you won t regret owning neha chamaria chevron while it s hard to predict where oil prices may head next you still want to consider buying an oil stock now that has its fortunes tied closely to oil prices this oil stock though is also a dividend stalwart and most likely to announce a good dividend hike in early 2023 now that it s on track to generate record cash flows this year i m talking about chevron which has increased its dividend every year for 35 consecutive years now chevron is on solid footing right now having used its incremental cash flows to repay debt for several quarters now while also investing in growth in the third quarter for example chevron s production from the permian basin was up 12 year over year in between chevron also invested in its new energy low carbon businesses to adapt to the changing times chevron just announced its capital budget for 2023 and it expects to spend 25 more or 14 billion on organic growth next year versus 2022 the oil giant believes this spending should help lower carbon and deliver higher returns in the coming years which should eventually help it return more cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases the framework works in investors favor as chevron s stable and growing dividends can hugely help investors navigate any volatility in the oil markets with chevron shares losing steam in recent weeks on lower oil prices this 3 3 yielding stock looks like a solid oil dividend stock to buy right now especially with a dividend hike around the corner

induced complete remissions such roles can define the ultimate therapeutic success for patients and commercial success for tuspetinib while the superior target and safety profile and proven breadth of activity of tuspetinib compared to competitive compounds in development advocate for tuspetinib to participate in broader and more sizable commercial markets said william g rice ph d chairman president and chief executive officer responses generated by tuspetinib in mutationally defined populations of high unmet need may also provide accelerated approval opportunities highlights of updated tuspetinib data in addition to 5 crc and 1 pr reported at ash 2021 4 new crc and 3 new pr have been generated thus far during 2022 new responses during 2022 were achieved with 160 mg 120 mg 80 mg and

window spanning the dose levels of 40 80 120 and 160 milligrams for the aptivate expansion trial that has initiated patient enrollment aptose has selected 120 mg as the initiating single agent expansion dose and 80 mg as the initiating dose selected for combination with venetoclax the trial is designed to confirm activity through patient enrichment of specific mutationally defined aml populations including flt3 mutant patients who have been failed by a prior flt3 inhibitor as supported by fast track designation and a significant response rate to date more detail on the data is available on the presentations page of the aptose website here aptose also provided an update of the luxeptinib clinical program luxeptinib key highlights luxeptinib is an oral first in class flt3 and btk kinase inhibitor in phase 1 a b clinical studies for the treatment of myeloid hematologic malignancies this small molecule demonstrates potent inhibition of wild type and all mutant forms of flt3 including internal tandem duplication or itd and mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase domain and gatekeeper region and cures animals of aml in the absence of toxicity in murine leukemia models just recently a cr was achieved with a diffuse large b cell lymphoma dlbcl patient at the end of cycle 22 with 900mg bid of the original g1 formulation previously an mrd negative cr was reported with a r r aml patient receiving 450mg bid of the original g1 formulation collectively these findings demonstrate luxeptinib is active against aml as well as lymphoid malignancies the original g1 formulation of luxeptinib was hampered by poor absorption the new g3 formulation was designed and developed for more rapid absorption early tmax more efficient absorption use lower doses longer retention longer t 1 2 and greater accumulation higher steady state levels and greater accumulation higher steady state levels the new g3 formulation this year was tested as a single dose in 20 patients from a phase 1 clinical program of luxeptinib modeling of the pharmacokinetic pk properties of g3 predicts steady state plasma exposure from continuous dosing with 50 mg of g3 every 12 hours q12h should be comparable to that of 900 mg of the original g1 formulation q12h representing up to an 18 fold improvement in bioavailability with g3 aptose recently announced dosing of the first patient with continuous dosing of the g3 formulation 50 mg bid in an ongoing phase 1a b clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory aml a second patient now has initiated continuous dosing with the g3 formulation the g3 formulation may result in greater exposures of luxeptinib and additional responses in these difficult to treat patient populations aptose expects that 9 15 patients will

today we ll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of civitas resources inc nyse civi as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today s value our analysis will employ the discounted cash flow dcf model models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person but they re fairly easy to follow remember though that there are many ways to estimate a company s value and a dcf is just one method anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the simply wall st analysis model see our latest analysis for civitas resources the method we use what is known as a 2 stage model which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company s cash flows generally the first stage is higher growth and the second stage is a lower growth phase to start off with we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows where possible we use analyst estimates but when these aren t available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow fcf from the last estimate or reported value we assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow over this period we do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years advertisement advertisement generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today s dollars 10 year free cash flow fcf estimate 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 levered fcf millions us 669 9m us 749 0m us 700 9m us 673 5m us 659 1m us

now need to calculate the terminal value which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period for a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country s gdp growth in this case we have used the 5 year average of the 10 year government bond yield 2 0 to estimate future growth in the same way as with the 10 year growth period we discount future cash flows to today s value using a cost of equity of 8 9 terminal value tv fcf 2032 1 g r g us 672m 1 2 0 8 9 2 0 us 9 9b present value of terminal value pvtv tv 1 r 10 us 9 9b 1 8 9 10 us 4 3b the total value or equity value is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows which in this case is us 8 6b the last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding relative to the current share price of us 56 1 the company appears quite good value at a 45 discount to where the stock price trades currently the assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation so it is better to view this as a rough estimate not precise down to the last cent dcf the assumptions now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows you don t have to agree with these inputs i recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them the dcf also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry or a company s future capital requirements so it does not give a full picture of a company s potential performance given that we are looking at civitas resources as potential shareholders the cost of equity is used as the discount rate rather than the cost of capital or weighted average cost of capital wacc which accounts for debt in this calculation we ve used 8 9 which is based on a levered beta of 1 237 beta is a measure of a stock s volatility compared to the market as a whole we get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies with an imposed limit between 0 8 and 2 0 which is a reasonable range for a stable business moving on valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company the dcf model is not a perfect stock valuation tool rather it should be seen as a guide to what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under overvalued for instance if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly it can dramatically alter the overall result can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value for civitas resources we ve put together three further items you should assess advertisement advertisement risks for example we ve discovered 2 warning signs for civitas resources 1

does the december share price for hf sinclair corporation nyse dino reflect what it s really worth today we will estimate the stock s intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today s value the discounted cash flow dcf model is the tool we will apply to do this it may sound complicated but actually it is quite simple we would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and like the dcf each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios if you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation take a look at the simply wall st analysis model check out our latest analysis for hf sinclair step by step through the calculation we are going to use a two stage dcf model which as the name states takes into account two stages of growth the first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value captured in the second steady growth period to begin with we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows where possible we use analyst estimates but when these aren t available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow fcf from the last estimate or reported value we assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow over this period we do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years advertisement advertisement generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today s dollars 10 year free cash flow fcf estimate 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 levered fcf

10 year cash flow pvcf us 9 0b advertisement advertisement after calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10 year period we need to calculate the terminal value which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage the gordon growth formula is used to calculate terminal value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5 year average of the 10 year government bond yield of 2 0 we discount the terminal cash flows to today s value at a cost of equity of 10 0 terminal value tv fcf 2032 1 g r g us 1 4b 1 2 0 10 0 2 0 us 18b present value of terminal value pvtv tv 1 r 10 us 18b 1 10 0 10 us 6 9b the total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value which results in the total equity value which in this case is us 16b in the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding relative to the current share price of us 48 7 the company appears quite good value at a 39 discount to where the stock price trades currently valuations are imprecise instruments though rather like a telescope move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy do keep this in mind dcf the assumptions we would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows if you don t agree with these result have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions the dcf also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry or a company s future capital requirements so it does not give a full picture of a company s potential performance given that we are looking at hf sinclair as potential shareholders the cost of equity is used as the discount rate rather than the cost of capital or weighted average cost of capital wacc which accounts for debt in this calculation we ve used 10 0 which is based on a levered beta of 1 434 beta is a measure of a stock s volatility compared to the market as a whole we get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies with an imposed limit between 0 8 and 2 0 which is a reasonable range for a stable business moving on whilst important the dcf calculation ideally won t be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company it s not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a dcf model instead the best use for a dcf model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued for example changes in the company s cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation what is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value for hf sinclair there are three fundamental items you should look at advertisement advertisement risks we feel that

these oil stocks are well positioned heading into the new year this past year has been a fascinating one for the oil market crude prices rocketed into the triple digits following russia s invasion of ukraine however they ve since given back most of those gains on concerns that rising interest rates to combat inflation will drive the economy into a recession next year denting oil demand despite all that volatility most oil stocks have surged this year as investors realize that fossil fuels remain vital to fueling the economy given that backdrop it s difficult to know what will happen in the oil patch in 2023 however a few fool com contributors believe that some oil stocks stand out as great buys heading into the new year here s why they think investors should scoop up shares of kinder morgan kmi 1 56 phillips 66 psx 1 83 and chevron cvx 0 83 before the end of this year regaining trust in the income story reuben gregg brewer kinder morgan it is completely understandable if conservative income investors chose not to buy kinder morgan after its 2016 dividend cut the big issue was that just a couple of months prior to the cut management was talking about dividend increases in 2016 there s a legitimate trust issue there however since that point kinder morgan has been working hard to regain investor trust a big part of that has been regular annual dividend increases since 2018 and while kinder morgan s dividend increase in 2020 was smaller than management had promised another blow on the trust front management specifically stated that the decision was related to dividend safety in 2016 the problem was too much leverage so it looks like the north american midstream giant realizes that dividend consistency is the key issue for investors highlighted by the fact that distributable cash flow covered the dividend by roughly 1 7 times in the third quarter of 2022 there s ample room there to increase the payment and to absorb adverse events all of this plays into kinder morgan s business as well it owns the pipelines storage processing and transportation infrastructure that helps to move oil and natural gas around the world most of its business is driven by fees which means that commodity prices don t play a huge role on the top or bottom line it is exactly the kind of company you would expect to pay a reliable dividend now that management is more on board with that the generous 6 or so dividend yield is probably worth a closer look but only if you can look past the 2016 cut big things to come matt dilallo phillips 66 phillips 66 recently outlined big plans to return even more cash to its shareholders in 2023 and beyond the diversified energy giant aims to send its investors an additional 10 billion to 12 billion by the end of 2024 via dividends and share repurchases that will add to the more than 30 billion it has already returned to investors since its formation a decade ago the company has already authorized a 5 billion increase in its share repurchase authorization meanwhile it boosted its dividend by another 5 earlier this year and has given investors 11 raises in 10 years more dividend growth seems likely over the next few years making its 3 8 yielding payout attractive for income seeking investors fueling phillips 66 s increased capital return plans is a strategy to grow its adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda by 3 billion over the next three years a third of that will come from its plan to acquire the remaining stake in dcp midstream that it doesn t already own the company boosted its interest in that master limited partnership mlp in a deal with canadian energy giant enbridge in exchange for cash and a stake in an oil pipeline phillips 66 hopes to seal a deal to buy the rest of the mlp from outside investors so it can capture the anticipated 1 billion of ebitda accretion it predicts it will see by integrating its operations the company also expects sustainable cost savings from its business transformation and incremental income from expansion projects to boost its earnings that combination of earnings growth and increased shareholder returns should give phillips 66 s stock the fuel to head higher over the next few years that makes it a great oil stock to buy before the end of this year so that investors can capitalize on this upside opportunity a dividend aristocrat you won t regret owning neha chamaria chevron while it s hard to predict where oil prices may head next you still want to consider buying an oil stock now that has its fortunes tied closely to oil prices this oil stock though is also a dividend stalwart and most likely to announce a good dividend hike in early 2023 now that it s on track to generate record cash flows this year i m talking about chevron which has increased its dividend every year for 35 consecutive years now chevron is on solid footing right now having used its incremental cash flows to repay debt for several quarters now while also investing in growth in the third quarter for example chevron s production from the permian basin was up 12 year over year in between chevron also invested in its new energy low carbon businesses to adapt to the changing times chevron just announced its capital budget for 2023 and it expects to spend 25 more or 14 billion on organic growth next year versus 2022 the oil giant believes this spending should help lower carbon and deliver higher returns in the coming years which should eventually help it return more cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases the framework works in investors favor as chevron s stable and growing dividends can hugely help investors navigate any volatility in the oil markets with chevron shares losing steam in recent weeks on lower oil prices this 3 3 yielding stock looks like a solid oil dividend stock to buy right now especially with a dividend hike around the corner
