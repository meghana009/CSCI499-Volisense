fond du lac patricia john listens to stories told by people who come to sleep at the salvation army warming shelter for the homeless near the city s downtown district through her interactions as a shelter advocate she s received cherished advice from a terminally ill veteran held the hand of a father struggling to provide for his three small children and shared tears with a man who had just buried his partner of 13 years and sought solace from sorrow and isolation what people need most is an ear to listen and my role here is to support them john said at the same time it s no secret they support me as well through what i learn from them every day the city s warming shelter typically serves more than 100 people who are homeless during the coldest months of the year and opened for another season on nov 1 salvation army is part of a continuum of care commitment among multiple community agencies that offer services to those experiencing hunger and homelessness that continuum of care includes two housing shelters in fond du lac with a third opening next spring plus nonprofits that offer food clothing help with job searches and other services volunteers and staff members say they re seeing more people and families who need that help in the fond du lac area this year the salvation army shelter is running at half staff and it s been a scramble to fill positions and attract desperately needed intake workers said connie millard the agency s community resource development director a shower the warming shelter with kindness facebook event runs through nov 16 to solicit volunteers meals clothing and essential household and personal hygiene supplies john herself has taken on additional hours despite working a full time job and caring for her small children even with this unseasonably warm weather the 40 bed shelter was half full before the first week ended a record number for this time of year we are in a tough time and i just got through getting dinner for my kids and i m about to head to the shelter john said monday evening my family and friends understand it s a commitment i ve made to help others during the day the shelter s clients are directed to holy family s outreach center inside st mary s church at 59 e merrill ave the day shelter provides warmth food help with job and rental searches and links clients with other service providers within the continuum of care circle erin cobb holy family s director of human concern said the parish provides a meal distribution inside st mary s at 4 30 p m each tuesday called blessed bites and will serve about 400 thanksgiving dinners to the community for this year s holiday local agencies who serve families and individuals experiencing homelessness look to wisconsin s balance of state continuum of care for support in part through a variety of funding sources locally the continuum of care helps participating nonprofits be more efficient and avoid duplicating each other s services steered by advocap a community action agency the commitment encompasses all of fond du lac s homeless initiatives including the need for affordable housing said advocap participant stability manager amber bose since jan 1 81 households found permanent housing through advocap but 161 homeless individuals and 64 homeless families from fond du lac green lake and winnebago counties remain on a list for services bose said the housing program uses a process called coordinated entry to prioritize assistance based on vulnerability and severity of needs anyone who comes to us and identifies as being homeless we do an assessment to determine which programs they may be eligible for and they are placed on the coordinated entry list bose said we ve been applying for whatever funding there is available to us because the need is really high right now a time to come together share compassion national hunger and homeless awareness week is held in november before thanksgiving each year as a time to share compassion with those who are facing homelessness and collaborate to end hunger and homelessness in communities said amy loof director of homeless services in the city related fond du lac s first standalone homeless shelter has a name and a benefactor related in fond du lac 42 of families struggle to put food on the table please donate to stock the shelves solutions center s family shelter has so far this year served 95 men women and children and anticipates helping 130 people by year s end loof said the shelter has had to turn down 543 people for lack of room up from 345 turned down last year crisis calls to the help line are at almost 2 000 for 2021 the family shelter on east second street in fond du lac can accommodate up to 15 people or about five families depending on size stays are typically for 90 days evictions right now from rental properties are substantial and that is a hard barrier for many people to overcome loof said on top of that the lack of available housing has made landlords super picky as to who they are taking in as tenants which compounds the problem for many of our clients but there s a bright spot ahead as construction moves forward at st katharine drexel shelter the city s first stand alone full service homeless shelter at 330 n peters ave slated to open in march the 20 000 square foot space provides housing for up to 100 people with a lower level where clients can meet with other agencies children can do homework and adults can take online courses and apply for jobs the property is owned by st vincent de paul and the project is in partnership with solutions center bob hartzheim council president at st vincent de paul in fond du lac said of the 373 people the agency assisted in october alone over 20 identified as homeless the society helps with rent assistance and bills and provides vouchers for clothing at its thrift store our programs do a good job of moving people into self sufficiency by helping them face their issues and learn new life skills hartzheim said we ve paid for safety shoes getting a driver s license just about anything if it means helping people remain employed all agencies funnel people in need of meals to fondy food pantry which last month distributed 33 000 pounds of food to households and 9 500 pounds of food to 1 000 students from fond du lac and north fond du lac who participate in the pantry s weekend food for thought program said mallory gilbertson board president if it continues at this rate by year s end the pantry will have distributed about 340 000 pounds of food worth an estimated 586 000 the pantry provides a drive through food pickup on mondays tuesdays and thursdays gilbertson said household sizes the pantry serves grew significantly this past year which she believes shows residents are often doubling up on housing arrangements to get by and many adult children are living with their parents or siblings we ve been able to do what we do because of our continuing collaboration with other agencies she said st vincent de paul provides us a building for free and pays all of our utility bills so that s been pretty amazing loof said the tightknit continuum of care seen in the fond du lac area has been key in addressing homelessness but there is still much work to do people who find themselves in need can reach out to any of the agencies to connect with all available resources we have been successful here in fond du lac because we are doing this together and i think that s an important piece in our efforts to raise awareness and work

hunters who haven t found ammo for this year s gun deer season might need to get creative or pay inflated prices online with opening day a little more than a week away many gun shops and outdoor retailers shelves are empty of popular rifle calibers looking for 30 30 270 or 30 06 cartridges local ammo dealers might just tell you good luck i d say the key phrase for people right now is desperation said justin gaiche owner of chase outdoors in rothschild there are a lot of people who are having to make decisions on whether they re going to use a different gun or borrow from family or go out there with four shells instead of 20 gun store workers and hunters said it has been the most difficult year to find ammo in more than a decade they said the shortage is a result of several factors including the covid 19 pandemic supply chain issues with manufacturers new gun ownership panic buying and hoarding and political messaging put simply it s complicated and it depends on who you ask paul bunczak a lifelong hunter and land appraiser from wausau started looking for deer hunting ammo in january because of how difficult it was to find cartridges last year he s the gun guy of his hunting group having recommended rifles and calibers for most of his family which hunts in marathon and portage counties his father uses a 30 06 his sister shoots a 30 30 and her son shoots a 7mm 08 that s not including the other nephews related smith a massive trempealeau county buck taken in october is likely to become the state crossbow record related trail camera picks up image of cougar on west bend property bunczak s job which involves traveling around western and northern parts of the state gave him the ability to check out dozens of shops during the year he figures he spent 20 hours driving out of the way to look through small town stores and national retailers and several more hours browsing online bunczak had luck finding cartridges at a walmart and fleet farm in marathon county he also kept a tab open on the cabela s website where he found most of the ammo for his group obviously two years ago you went to your store picked out what you wanted and put it in the cart bunczak said you didn t think about it other than is fleet farm having a sale or not while retailers stock is sparse there are websites where most popular deer hunting calibers are still available the problem is you ll have to pay inflated prices close to double the market price to get your hands on any hunters can expect to pay just under 29 for a box of 20 30 30 cartridges from scheels in appleton the same box on gunbroker com will run about 55 or more there s always someone who s willing to pay a price for something gaiche said there are online auction sites where a lot of the things that people want are available but it s disgusting what they re doing bunczak who also works as a real estate agent and auctioneer said he s seen more and more homes with huge caches of ammunition he said a similar thing happened in 2012 with 22 ammo most of which was sold years later in estate sales for much less than it was originally bought bunczak predicts a similar outcome once this is done several years from now there will be estate auctions for people who were hoarding ammo he said it ll get sold off for half of what they paid gene schnurr owner of sheboyguns in sheboygan gets close to 150 calls each day asking about ammunition he s sold so much that he s had to pause his gunsmithing services for anything other than trade ins schnurr said millions of americans bought new firearms this year which is contributing to the shortage there s not only new people but there are hundreds of millions of firearms sold last year he said that s why there s a shortage of ammo federal background checks for gun purchases reflect the surge in gun sales as they climbed 40 last year to 39 7 million according to the federal bureau of investigation wisconsin deer hunting license sales also were up 3 5 last year and the number of women hunting grew 12 according to dnr numbers gaiche whose store has grown notably in the past seven years said he has about 4 million of ammo on backorder he buys it from close to 30 sources both manufacturers and distributors gaiche said it has been challenging to keep a selection in the store often spending nights till 3 a m online chasing sales if he can get 50 boxes of shells it s all the same caliber and it s gone in a day or two he is not getting a diverse selection i might have to let down the whole world but i might be able to satisfy the guy with the 308 winchester gaiche said i just had a pallet show up five minutes ago of all of the most desirable stuff and by the time this goes to print it will all be gone gaiche said he also believes the shortage is a result of consumer driven demand he said countless customers have come in the past year to purchase their first firearm and each time they do he tells them the first thing they need to do is practice shooting the diversity at gun ranges has increased from the past when it was only men firing one or two shots from their hunting rifles the number of people who own many firearms in many calibers and shooting them is their passion it s not even close to the same anymore gaiche said if you go to the shooting range now there are people of all walks of life at all income levels shooting some very expensive stuff they re just shooting for the joy of shooting the new demand prompted firearms manufacturer henry repeating arms in rice lake to expand in wisconsin the company announced this month that it s building an 84 000 square foot building in ladysmith the new property is expected to employ more than 100 people in the next three years ammo inc also announced plans earlier this year to build a 12 million ammunition and brass casing manufacturing plant in manitowoc the company plans to open next summer with 150 employees with demand surging and manufacturers struggling to keep up gun shop owners and hunters said the shortages won t end anytime soon just remember next year s season will be here soon don t stop looking once hunting season is over said joe fritsch an assistant store leader at appleton scheels the guys who were looking all year are the guys who aren t worried about it now contact jake prinsen at jprinsen gannett com follow

the biggest culprit for rising prices that s not being talked about is the increasing economic concentration of the american economy in the hands of a relative few giant big corporations with the power to raise prices if markets were competitive companies would seek to keep their prices down in order to maintain customer loyalty and demand when the prices of their supplies rose they d cut their profits before they raised prices to their customers for fear that otherwise a competitor would grab those customers away but strange enough this isn t happening in fact even in the face of supply constraints corporations are raking in record profits more than 80 percent of big s p 500 companies that have reported results this season have topped analysts earnings forecasts according to refinitiv obviously supply constraints have not eroded these profits corporations are simply passing the added costs on to their customers many are raising their prices even further and pocketing even more how can this be for a simple and obvious reason most don t have to worry about competitors grabbing their customers away they have so much market power they can relax and continue to rake in big money the underlying structural problem isn t that government is over stimulating the economy it s that big corporations are under competitive corporations are using the excuse of inflation to raise prices and make fatter profits the result is a transfer of wealth from consumers to corporate executives and major investors this has nothing to do with inflation folks it has everything to do with the concentration of market power in a relatively few hands it s called oligopoly where two or three companies roughly coordinate their prices and output judd legum provides some good examples in his newsletter he points to two firms that are giants in household staples procter gamble and kimberly clark in april procter gamble announced it would start charging more for everything from diapers to toilet paper citing rising costs for raw materials such as resin and pulp and higher expenses to transport goods baloney p g is raking in huge profits in the quarter ending september 30 after some of its price increases went into effect it reported a whopping 24 7 profit margin oh and it spent 3 billion in the quarter buying its own stock how can this be because p g faces very little competition according to a report released this month from the roosevelt institute the lion s share of the market for diapers for example is controlled by just two companies p g and kimberly clark limiting competition for cheaper options so it wasn t exactly a coincidence that kimberly clark announced similar price increases at the same time as p g both corporations are doing wonderfully well but american consumers are paying more or consider another major consumer product oligopoly pepsico the parent company of frito lay gatorade quaker tropicana and other brands and coca cola in april pepsico announced it was increasing prices blaming higher costs for some ingredients freight and labor rubbish the company recorded 3 billion in operating profits and increased its projections for the rest of the year and expects to send 5 8 billion in dividends to shareholders in 2021 if pepsico faced tough competition it could never have gotten away with this but it doesn t in fact it appears to have colluded with its chief competitor coca cola which oddly announced price increases at about the same time as pepsico and has increased its profit margins to 28 9 and on it goes around the entire consumer sector of the american economy you can see a similar pattern in energy prices once it became clear that demand was growing energy producers could have quickly ramped up production to create more supply but they didn t why not industry experts say oil and gas companies and their ceos and major investors saw bigger money in letting prices run higher before producing more supply they can get away with this because big oil and gas producers don t face much competition they re powerful oligopolies again inflation isn t driving most of these price increases corporate power is driving them since the 1980s when the federal government all but abandoned antitrust enforcement two thirds of all american industries have become more concentrated monsanto now sets the prices for most of the nation s seed corn the government green lighted wall street s consolidation into five giant banks of which jpmorgan is the largest it okayed airline mergers bringing the total number of american carriers down from twelve in 1980 to four today which now control 80 percent of domestic seating capacity it let boeing and mcdonnell douglas merge leaving america with just one major producer of civilian aircraft boeing three giant cable companies dominate broadband a handful of drug companies control the pharmaceutical industry so what s the appropriate response to the latest round of inflation the federal reserve has signaled it won t raise interest rates for the time being believing that the inflation is being driven by temporary supply bottlenecks meanwhile biden administration officials have been consulting with the oil industry in an effort to stem rising gas prices trying to make it simpler to issue commercial driver s licenses to help reduce the shortage of truck drivers

the brother in law of u s sen richard burr was ordered wednesday by a federal judge to comply with an investigative subpoena from the securities and exchange commission burr and brother in law gerald fauth are being investigated by the sec for potential insider trading a case that stems from their abrupt sales of financial holdings during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic according to recent federal court filings burr a republican is among several lawmakers from both parties who faced outrage over their aggressive trading in early 2020 before the economic threat from the virus was widely known that fueled accusations congressional members were acting on inside information gained through their official duties to benefit financially which is illegal under a law known as the stock act burr was previously investigated by the trump administration s justice department for offloading 1 6 million from his portfolio in january and february 2020 the department cleared him of wrongdoing almost a year later on jan 19 donald trump s last full day in office but the sec continued to investigate burr according to court documents filed in the southern district of new york that were recently made public the filings stem from a case brought by the sec to force fauth the brother of burr s wife to comply with a subpoena the agency argued that his close relationship with burr and a phone call between the two followed by calls to fauth s brokers made his testimony critical whether fauth was himself tipped with inside information from senator burr and whether fauth knew senator burr was violating his duties under the stock act by conveying that information are matters fauth is uniquely positioned to speak to the sec said in a filing to bolster their case sec attorneys released a timeline of phone calls from feb 13 2020 the day burr sold off the vast majority of his portfolio it was roughly one week before the stock market went into a tailspin fauth is accused by the sec of declining to cooperate since may 2020 the agency says that he and his legal counsel have waged a relentless battle to avoid it fauth through his legal counsel cited health issues that make it difficult for him to sit for long periods of time the sec said fauth had no problems attending a confirmation hearing when president joe biden appointed him to the national mediation board earlier this year a job he still holds the commission has no intention of conducting the questioning in an adversarial manner as this is investigative testimony not a deposition according to the sec filing fauth has been warned that if he didn t comply he could be held in contempt without warning cnn reported

by john harwood and phil mattingly cnn president joe biden is nearing a decision on his choice for federal reserve chair with observers inside and outside the administration viewing incumbent jerome powell as the front runner for another term an announcement is expected as early as next week biden has waited longer in making his selection than his two immediate predecessors leaving a relatively narrow window for the senate to confirm his choice before powell s term expires next february biden during a november 2 news conference said he planned to make an announcement about his selection fairly quickly and said there would be plenty of time to move his pick through the confirmation process i ve given a lot of thought to it and i ve been meeting with my economic advisers on what the best choices are and we ve got a lot of good choices biden said when asked about the position but i m not going to speculate now the decision marks a critical moment for a white house in the midst of managing an economy emerging in fits and starts from a once in a century pandemic while job and wage growth have been robust a combination of pandemic driven supply chain bottlenecks and a demand surge for goods have led to price increases that this week reached a three decade high post pandemic crosswinds make biden s choice of the nation s most important economic policymaker unusually complex powell is a republican appointed chairman having been picked by president donald trump four years ago leading members of the democratic party which narrowly controls congress want the president to replace powell with current fed governor lael brainard in the belief that she would advance more aggressive regulation of financial institutions sen elizabeth warren a leading progressive voice with ties to key economic advisers across the administration leveled a fierce broadside against powell in september when she called him a dangerous man to head up the fed given her view of his posture on regulatory matters disclosures that multiple fed officials bought and sold stocks at the height of the pandemic as the fed was deploying extensive emergency measures to forestall a market collapse have fueled progressive efforts to push for a change atop the central bank two regional bank presidents departed the fed in the wake of the disclosures the fed in october announced a sweeping ban on top officials owning individual stocks and bonds as well as other trading restrictions the stock trading revelations have not been viewed as a problem for powell during the current process according to people familiar with the matter powell has also faced criticism from some lawmakers in both parties for continuing to back an expansive monetary policy even as inflation spikes amid the bumpy recovery from coronavirus shutdowns but to this point neither warren s strident opposition nor other concerns about powell s approach have generated any broad based public opposition on capitol hill the white house has kept key democratic senators in the loop throughout the process though they have not tipped biden s hand people familiar with the matter said at a time of heightened uncertainty over inflation and growth alike powell has overall received strong reviews for handling extraordinary economic turbulence since early last year and his commitment to using monetary policy levers to help repair the labor market matches the view of white house economists powell is steering this ship through very rocky waters and he seems very determined to get us to the other side where there is maximum employment said betsey stevenson a university of michigan economist who advised former president barack obama i m really worried about what happens if he gets asked to hand over the wheel right now he deserves it added tony fratto a former treasury department official who worked in president george w bush s administration he s been an anchor in the face of truly unprecedented challenges in addition the 84 senate votes powell received for confirmation as chairman in january 2018 along with the public support from several republican senators for his selection this time around suggest he could win a second term without much difficulty which might not be true of brainard obama originally appointed powell to the fed s board of governors in 2011 a vacancy for the position of fed vice chair of supervision gives biden the opportunity to respond to democratic concerns about powell s approach to financial regulation without replacing him as chair some economists close to the administration have speculated that he could select brainard for that post biden has known brainard who served in the obama treasury department when he was vice president for years he interviewed both her and powell at the white house last week if he nominates powell for a second term biden would become the third consecutive democratic president to keep a republican in the fed chairmanship bill clinton renominated alan greenspan in the job in 1996 as obama did with ben bernanke in 2009 biden s predecessor donald trump broke what had become an unofficial precedent when he chose not to re nominate janet yellen obama s second term selection for the role powell replaced yellen and went on to become a regular punching bag for trump as the former president sought to influence the fed s interest rate policy yellen is now biden s treasury secretary and privately communicated to white house advisers this fall about the value of continuity at the central bank which was viewed internally as a tacit endorsement for the job according to people familiar with the matter publicly yellen has only acknowledged that she s spoken to biden about the fed selection and not given an explicit endorsement but she did offer praise for powell s time in the role i think that chair powell has certainly done a good job yellen said in a november 1 cnbc interview the cnn wire

the build back better legislation makes a series of investments to improve the lives of families across the country by reducing poverty expanding health coverage and addressing climate change policymakers have committed to offsetting the costs of the bill s new investments and have proposed a series of sound measures to do so including revenue increases and savings from lowering the costs of prescription drugs while some have argued that the bill is not fiscally sustainable their criticisms miss four basic points the legislation is on track to be fully offset unlike some other recent pieces of major legislation first the legislation is on track to be fully offset unlike some other recent pieces of major legislation the build back better legislation contains revenue increases and spending reductions that fully offset its costs over ten years according to recent white house estimates notably the commitment to fully offset the cost of the build back better legislation has strengthened over time the budget resolution would have allowed for a reconciliation bill with significant un offset costs but policymakers have chosen a higher fiscal standard for the current build back better bill than the resolution required in contrast both the 2001 and 2017 tax cut packages significantly increased deficits the budget resolutions guiding these measures allowed them to increase the deficit and there was no subsequent effort to pay for these tax cut packages more recently the bipartisan infrastructure package was not fully offset though it did include some savings some argue that the bill the house is scheduled to consider the week of november 15 is not fully offset a key issue is the increased revenues that will result from stepped up enforcement by the irs while both treasury and the congressional budget office cbo find that more funding for irs enforcement will generate significant new revenue treasury s revenue estimates from higher audit collections and improved voluntary taxpayer compliance are higher than cbo s but even these higher treasury estimates are viewed as conservative by some former treasury secretaries ultimately the expectation is that policymakers will settle on a reasonable estimate for increased revenues that result from more irs enforcement and with that estimate the bill will be fully offset moreover policymakers could address any concerns about enforcement revenues by restoring the irs information reporting requirements for financial institutions that were dropped from the package second the legislation improves the long term fiscal picture because the revenue increases and drug savings are permanent policies even though many of build back better s new spending programs are temporary the revenue increases and prescription drug provisions that generate savings are permanent this means the legislation will reduce deficits over the long term in excess of 2 trillion in the second decade after enactment according to the white house the improvement in the fiscal picture after 2031 will put the nation in a stronger position to sustain important policy advances and address policy challenges third it is misleading to claim that all expiring provisions will be extended without any offsets when expiring build back better provisions near their expiration date policymakers will have to evaluate the benefits and costs of the policies and take affirmative action if they want to extend them policymakers crafting the current package committed to financing the investments with sound offsets now and policymakers considering extensions of policies in the future likely would similarly choose to offset their costs analysts with the penn wharton budget model and the committee for a responsible federal budget have estimated the ten year costs of various build back better provisions as if they were in place over the full decade this exercise can yield helpful information but it is not a prediction of the future because it excludes any analysis of the many plausible offsets that could be used to finance program extensions and the pressures policymakers will face to offset the cost of these extensions to address the cost of extending expiring provisions policymakers could use measures that have been proposed but not included in the build back better legislation that would raise revenues from wealthy households and profitable corporations and are broadly popular with the public the revenue measures were scaled back in part because the overall level of investments was scaled back but proposals put forward by the biden administration and many members of congress are meritorious and could raise substantial revenues to support future investments including extensions of build back better policies for example proposals that would have reduced the extremely large and permanent cut in the corporate tax rate enacted in 2017 ensured that very wealthy people pay taxes on unrealized gains in their stock portfolios and other wealth provided for a more robust surtax on wealthy households or narrowed or closed various loopholes would all generate substantial revenues and push back against the nation s very large income and wealth gaps in addition to revenue measures there are further ways to reduce the cost of prescription drugs that the house proposed but have been scaled back substantially in the current legislation recent history suggests that congress is likely to face significant pressure to pay for extending build back better provisions over the past two decades far more effort has gone into offsetting the cost of investments designed to reduce poverty expand health care and buttress human capital than the cost of tax cuts both the 2001 and 2017 tax cuts increased the deficit over the first decade and when most of the 2001 tax cuts were extended their cost was not offset in contrast the affordable care act made major investments in health coverage but revenue increases and spending reductions more than fully offset its costs in the first decade and over time while none of this guarantees that all potential build back better extensions would be fully offset it surely calls into question the assertion that none of their cost would be offset and of course there is no guarantee that policymakers will extend these policies even though they have a strong base of evidence behind them and would advance health and economic security as discussed more below but if the policies were extended it is certainly reasonable to assume that the extensions would be coupled with substantial offsets fourth the investments in this package will meet critical needs and have important long term benefits for individuals and the nation as a whole the fiscal impact of the build back better legislation is only one metric by which the bill should be judged and not the most significant crucially important is whether the investments will meet important national needs and benefit the nation in ways that outweigh the cost of any increase in debt service major investments in this package such as investments in children early education college access and completion and health coverage have a strong base of evidence investments that reduce poverty and hardship among children for example improve children s long term education and health outcomes helping them meet their full potential and benefiting the nation as a whole investments in health coverage improve access to health care and health outcomes and reduce financial hardship investments in quality child care and preschool and efforts to improve college access and completion help children and students succeed later in life and strengthen our future workforce while helping parents get or keep jobs and make ends meet these investments also make us a fairer more equitable nation the question of how investments will benefit the country and what costs will be imposed by failing to make these investments is too often ignored in discussions about whether the nation can afford to make them indeed the returns on many of these investments are so substantial that increasing deficits to finance them would be better than forgoing the investments even so policymakers have committed to offsetting the costs of these critical investments with sound revenue measures and savings from prescription drugs

while the potential influence of continued high inflation adds an element of caution to the current state of the economy zonda chief economist ali wolf said her take on the overall economy is more positive during the latest covid 19 update webinar we had really good jobs report data and as long as we don t see another run up in covid 19 cases and as long as we don t see businesses and consumers responding too much our expectation is that the economy does continue to grow from here says wolf the positive signs for the economy start with october s jobs data which reported the economy added 531 000 jobs month over month coupled with revisions for data from august and september total nonfarm employment is down 4 2 million workers from march 2020 or 81 recovered in particular the leisure and hospitality sectors which were stagnant in recent months are back on track according to wolf while not directly related to the housing industry a more equal distribution of job recovery could influence an increase in short term interest rates more quickly than initially predicted if we see a more universal rebound if we see the labor market come back pretty quickly now that the service sector is showing more signs of life that can impact the federal reserve policy wolf says that trickles down into real estate interest rates and the economy moving forward while job growth is positive labor shortages are still widespread nationwide and impairing companies abilities to meet demand wolf says in the housing industry specifically while 40 of builders reported having strong labor shortages in january zonda survey data from october indicates close to 80 of builders are experiencing labor shortage issues wage growth and inflation partially as a result of the labor crunch employers are feeling pressure and increasing wages wolf says the country is experiencing a wage growth between 4 and 6 compared with 2020 the highest levels of year over year growth since 2004 2005 the positive impact of higher wages and consumer spending power however is being offset by higher costs and high inflation numbers inflation has grown between 3 5 and 5 year over year and is at its highest levels since the 1990s continued high levels of inflation could cause the fed to pump the brakes on interest rates according to wolf between now and january try to look past the noise a lot of the inflation numbers have been pretty scary we could see choppy numbers on the labor front and we could see choppy numbers on the stock market it s really easy to get hung up on that wolf says home sales and affordability home sales are tracking around 31 higher than in september 2019 and in several major metro markets including indianapolis jacksonville florida riverside california and san diego sales have increased 50 to 80 since 2019 the sales increases come despite 80 of division presidents reporting to zonda they are still intentionally capping sales eventually i think throttling sales will be a thing of the past we started to see some throttling pullback when the market slowed in june and july but as the market showed more life in october we started to see any plans of throttling go on pause because we do still have the production capacity that s struggling to keep up wolf says several factors including strong demographics rising wealth accumulation low inventory high migration low interest rates and strong financial safeguards have served as fundamental price drivers in the housing market the result is that in many of the top performing metro markets including phoenix salt lake city and los angeles orange county experienced double digit price growth across entry level move up and luxury homes year over year wolf says while some metros such as louisville kentucky san antonio jacksonville and indianapolis have between 40 and 60 of new homes priced below 300 000 these numbers need to be compared on a relative basis to these market s historical prices as a result even markets with high percentages of homes priced below 300 000 are experiencing their own affordability crunch on a relative basis tim sullivan zonda senior managing principal says affordability is expected to be the biggest influencer on the market in 2022 and it could lead to slower sales and a leveling of the market real time housing data while the word normal remains difficult to define particularly in a covid 19 environment data from zonda s regular builder survey indicates some stabilization is occurring while between 96 and 98 of builders reported raising prices month to month during the first half of 2021 56 of builders raised prices month over month in october builders reported buyer hesitancy decreased from august to october but buyers not getting qualified has increased significantly during the same time period similarly 14 of builders reported an increase in cancellations during october well below nearly 28 in september zonda data also indicates 36 of builders are reporting higher online traffic looking a bit more closely into i think that means the consumer is hovering says sullivan we look at that as a potentially good news element because it means we still have potential buyers engaged but they re hovering

company achieved strong operating performance at chelopech and ada tepe production at chelopech was lower than the third quarter of 2020 as a result of mining lower grade zones at ada tepe gold production was better than the third quarter of 2020 as a result of higher gold grades the tsumeb smelter delivered performance that was in line with the third quarter of 2020 but below expectations as a result of a water leak in the off gas system with solid performance in the first nine months of the year the company remains on track to meet its 2021 guidance for metals production net earnings and adjusted net earnings net earnings attributable to common shareholders from continuing operations in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 were 50 4 million 0 27 per share and 138 6 million 0 75 per share respectively compared to 55 2 million 0 31 per share and 148 9 million 0 83 per share in the corresponding periods in 2020 net earnings attributable to common shareholders from continuing operations in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 and 2020 were impacted by unrealized losses on sabina gold and silver corp sabina special warrants and deferred income tax adjustments not related to current period earnings both of which are not reflective of the company s underlying operating performance and are excluded from adjusted net earnings adjusted net earnings in the third quarter of 2021 were 52 5 million 0 28 per share compared to 51 6 million 0 28 per share in the corresponding period in 2020 due primarily to lower treatment charges at chelopech and higher realized copper prices partially offset by lower volumes of metal sold and higher operating expenses adjusted net earnings in the first nine months of 2021 were 150 6 million 0 82 per share compared to 144 3 million 0 80 per share in the corresponding period in 2020 due primarily to higher realized metal prices lower share based compensation and lower treatment charges at chelopech partially offset by a planned maintenance shutdown at tsumeb in the first quarter of 2021 lower volumes of metal sold and higher operating expenses adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 was 85 8 million and 252 6 million respectively compared to 86 3 million and 244 5 million in the corresponding periods in 2020 reflecting the same factors that affected adjusted net earnings except for interest income tax depreciation and amortization which are excluded from adjusted ebitda production delivery and cost measures gold contained in concentrate produced in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 decreased by 10 to 71 755 ounces and by 3 to 227 141 ounces respectively relative to the corresponding periods in 2020 due primarily to mining lower grade zones at chelopech in the third quarter of 2021 partially offset by higher gold grades at ada tepe copper production in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 decreased by 9 to 8 3 million pounds and by 9 to 25 5 million pounds respectively relative to the corresponding periods in 2020 due primarily to mining lower grade zones in the third quarter of 2021 partially offset by higher copper recoveries payable gold in concentrate sold in the third quarter of 2021 of 66 234 ounces was 4 lower than the corresponding period in 2020 due primarily to mining lower grade zones at chelopech and lower gold recoveries at ada tepe partially offset by higher gold grades at ada tepe payable copper in concentrate sold in the third quarter of 2021 of 7 8 million pounds was 3 higher than the corresponding period in 2020 due primarily to the timing of deliveries payable gold in concentrate sold in the first nine months of 2021 of 205 231 ounces was comparable to the corresponding period in 2020 payable copper in concentrate sold in the first nine months of 2021 of 24 5 million pounds was 4 lower than the corresponding period in 2020 due primarily to lower metal production partially offset by the timing of deliveries complex concentrate smelted at tsumeb during the third quarter of 2021 of 55 137 tonnes was comparable to the corresponding period in 2020 complex concentrate smelted at tsumeb during the first nine months of 2021 of 137 773 tonnes was 23 lower than the corresponding period in 2020 due primarily to the planned ausmelt furnace maintenance shutdown which was completed during the first quarter of 2021 cost of sales in the third quarter of 2021 of 87 5 million was 7 6 million higher than the corresponding period in 2020 due primarily to higher local currency operating expenses in bulgaria reflecting higher prices for electricity and direct materials cost of sales in the first nine months of 2021 of 263 0 million was 13 3 million higher than the corresponding period in 2020 due primarily to higher local currency operating expenses in bulgaria and higher royalties at ada tepe reflecting a higher profit based royalty rate and a weaker u s dollar partially offset by lower local currency operating expenses at tsumeb due primarily to lower volumes of complex concentrate smelted and lower depreciation all in sustaining cost per ounce of gold in the third quarter of 2021 of 701 was 10 higher than the corresponding period in 2020 due primarily to higher local currency operating expenses in bulgaria higher cash outlays for sustaining capital expenditures and lower volumes of gold sold partially offset by higher by product credits reflecting higher realized copper prices and lower treatment charges at chelopech as a result of a higher proportion of gold copper concentrate deliveries to third party smelters all in sustaining cost per ounce of gold in the first nine months of 2021 of 621 was 5 lower than the corresponding period in 2020 due primarily to higher by product credits reflecting higher realized copper prices partially offset by higher local currency operating expenses in bulgaria and a stronger euro relative to the u s dollar cash cost per tonne of complex concentrate smelted in the third quarter of 2021 of 393 was 14 lower than the corresponding period in 2020 due primarily to lower local currency operating expenses and higher acid by product credits partially offset by a stronger zar relative to the u s dollar cash cost per tonne of complex concentrate smelted in the first nine months of 2021 of 492 was 123 higher than the corresponding period in 2020 reflecting the fixed cost nature of the facility and the impact of lower volumes of complex concentrate smelted resulting from the maintenance shutdown during the first quarter of 2021 combined with a stronger zar relative to the u s dollar partially offset by lower local currency operating expenses a table comparing production delivery and cash cost measures for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 against 2021 guidance can be found on page 9 of this news release cash provided from operating activities cash provided from operating activities in the third quarter of 2021 of 41 0 million was comparable to the corresponding period in 2020 and consistent with earnings before taxes due primarily to an unfavourable period over period change in working capital mainly related to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and higher income taxes paid offset by the prepaid forward gold sales agreement at ada tepe being fully satisfied with the final delivery in december 2020 cash provided from operating activities in the first nine months of 2021 of 164 3 million was 37 9 million higher than the corresponding period in 2020 and higher than the 3 8 million increase in earnings before income taxes due primarily to the prepaid forward gold sales agreement at ada tepe being fully satisfied with the final delivery in december 2020 and a favourable period over period change in working capital partially offset by higher income taxes paid during the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 ada tepe delivered 6 992 ounces and 27 094 ounces of gold respectively pursuant to the prepaid forward gold sales arrangement which resulted in 9 6 million and 37 1 million of deferred revenue being recognized in revenue during the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 respectively with no corresponding impact on cash as these deliveries were in partial satisfaction of the 50

was due primarily to the planned maintenance shutdown at tsumeb in the first quarter of 2021 and accelerated grade control drilling at ada tepe initiated in september 2020 growth capital expenditures incurred during the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 were 4 2 million and 9 6 million respectively compared to 1 0 million and 5 1 million in the corresponding periods in 2020 due primarily to the costs related to the timok and loma larga gold projects loma larga gold project ecuador in the third quarter of 2021 dpm completed the acquisition of the high quality advanced stage loma larga gold project in ecuador based on the feasibility study fs completed in 2020 by inv loma larga has the potential to produce an annual average of approximately 200 000 gold ounces in its first five years of operation life of mine production is estimated to be approximately 170 000 gold ounces per year at an attractive all in sustaining cost of approximately 630 per ounce of gold which continues to support dpm s peer leading cost profile following closing of the acquisition the company has been focused on integration activities stakeholder engagement and a review of the technical studies and permitting schedule dpm is targeting completion of a revised fs in 2022 and has commenced scoping for the fs optimization work as well as the design of a metallurgical test program the results of

that seeks to identify growth companies ahead of the market consensus unlike traditional etfs that tell the public what assets they hold each day this etf will provide less information to traders who

greater for this etf compared with other etfs the etf will publish on its website each day a tracking basket designed to help trading in shares of the etf while the tracking basket includes some of the etf s holdings it is not the etf s actual portfolio by keeping certain information about the etf secret hartford funds says this etf may face less risk that other traders can predict or copy its

good news for refined product tankers those cannibals over in the crude business have temporarily stopped feasting on their cargoes some tankers are specifically designed with coated tanks to switch between crude oil and refined products like gasoline and diesel but even uncoated crude tankers can carry products if they re brand new on their maiden voyage out of an asian shipyard that is exactly what they ve done in 2021 more so than ever before newly delivered crude tankers in the vlcc 2 million barrel capacity and suezmax 1 million barrel capacity classes have frequently filled up with refined products in asia stealing loads from larger product tankers known as lr2s tankers with capacity of 80 000 119 999 deadweight tons or dwt now there is a lull in crude tanker newbuild deliveries and consequently a lull in cargo cannibalization lr2 rates have just jumped clarksons platou securities put spot rates for modern lr2s built 2015 or later at 22 900 per day on thursday up 15 from wednesday and up 62 month on month shares of product tanker owner scorpio tankers nyse stng which operates 42 lr2s spiked 12 on thursday after the company s bullish conference call as stifel analyst ben nolan put it no one has ever accused scorpio of being conservative and that can certainly be said with respect to this quarter s conference call despite one of the most challenging tanker markets in history the company basically called their shot that marked the trough with the back half of q4 being sharply better and things only getting better from there scorpio execs as well as those of other product tanker owners reporting results this week did bring up the lull in cannibalization issue although they stressed a much wider range of positive drivers for lr2s as well as smaller size categories but after so many disappointments and head fakes for product tanker rates not to mention huge losses in 3q 2021 a key question for 2022 is will broader fundamental improvements prevail if cargo cannibalization returns cannibalization redux in 2022 according to a new report by alphatanker one major factor capping clean tanker hire rates so far this year has been the gobbling up of long haul east to west gasoil and diesel cargoes by newbuild vlccs and suezmaxes undertaking maiden voyages although this trend is not new it has accelerated this year against a backdrop of a lousy crude tanker market with returns often standing well below breakeven levels this is one of the main reasons why it has been so hard for cpp tankers to garner sustained upward momentum despite soaring global oil and cpp tanker demand amid the steady unmasking of regional supply imbalances in refined product supply and demand alphatanker said that of the 33 vlccs and 22 suezmaxes delivered this year 15 of the vlcc newbuilds and 16 of the suezmaxes loaded diesel or gasoil on maiden voyages furthermore these tankers delayed entering the crude market for as long as possible in some cases they subsequently went into storage employment for refined products in rare instances they have undertaken multiple clean voyages added alphatanker citing the case of one vlcc that loaded a clean cargo east of suez in q2 unloaded in the atlantic basin loaded gasoil in europe in q3 then stored it off west africa altogether alphatanker estimates that a record 69 lr2 tanker cargoes were cannibalized by newbuild crude tankers this year crude newbuild deliveries are likely over for 2021 you don t have the cannibalization by the vlccs and suezmaxes because they re not going to be delivered in november and december said lars nielsen commercial director of scorpio tankers on thursday s conference call alphaliner said that there are an additional four vlccs and two suezmaxes scheduled for delivery by year end but it predicted that these would be pushed back to 2022 for two reasons crude tanker rates are very weak and delaying delivery a few months will give owners the benefit from a 2022 delivery date and certification however that will create an avalanche of crude tanker deliveries in q1 2022 and all of these newbuilds will make good candidates for loading east of suez refined gasoil and diesel cargoes on their maiden voyages which should pressure lr rates lower opined alphatanker over full year 2022 it sees 52 vlccs and 50 suezmax newbuild deliveries considering that crude tanker demand is forecast to remain below its pre pandemic level by the end of 2022 this suggests that crude tanker hire rates will remain under pressure for at least the first half of the year there should be no shortage of crude tankers looking to cannibalize cpp cargoes jacob melgaard ceo of product tanker owner torm nasdaq trmd echoed that sentiment during his company s conference call on wednesday this has been an issue throughout the year said melgaard currently there s a bit of an easing because the number of newbuilds has gone down that will pick up again in the first half of next year if the crude tanker market is not picking up from where we are we will see continued cannibalization by maiden voyages in the first half of next year broader fundamentals all positive scorpio s nielsen put a positive spin on the situation he said that by the time crude tankers with delayed deliveries hit the water in q1 2021 at that point i would imagine you re going to start to see the opec crude increase starting to filter in as those markets come back to life nielsen also emphasized that the product tanker sector is seeing green shoots well beyond the long haul east west lr2 trade demand is rising in south america and mexico for u s exports which fuels demand in the mr 25 000 54 999 dwt and lr1 55 000 79 999 dwt classes we have seen a material rise in the u s gulf mr market index said nielsen the mr market is segregated from product tanker trades cannibalized by crude tankers according to clarksons modern mr spot rates are currently at 13 500 per day up 69 month on month anthony gurnee ceo of product and chemical tanker owner ardmore shipping nyse asc said on a conference call wednesday that his company s mrs were averaging 15 300 per day over the past two weeks and one of its mrs was just fixed out of the u s gulf at 20 500 per day nielsen also pointed to other positives global refinery runs are above 80 million barrels per day for the first time since pre covid u s east coast gasoline inventories are the lowest in almost seven years lr2 volumes are not just increasing from east to west but also from west to east and mobility is increasing worldwide due to vaccinations according to torm s melgaard the obstacles to the transportation fuel demand recovery are largely being removed evercore isi analyst jon chappell said of product tanker fundamentals this notoriously volatile industry requires a sustainable proof of recovery before calling the end of the prolonged downturn but with markets moving higher and all of the macro factors now trending favorably we have even greater conviction that the bottom is in product tanker earnings roundup click for more articles by greg miller related articles

in america the three cylinder mitsubishi mirage is a car that just can t stop being joked at by people who call them wimpy puny or heaven forbid a pansies car photo drift xaust photo drift xaust as despicable as it is to appropriate one s choice of car with their sexual orientation or whether or not it qualifies them as a beta male there are unfortunately more than a few people on the internet that genuinely believe this a not so flattering review by doug demuro did little to help matters but in asia and a few other places the mirage is more than just a laughing stock it s what frees people from the comically unsafe motor scooter to these people cars like the mirage are their pride and joy and they modify them accordingly granted a 1 2 liter three cylinder engine making between 74 and 78 horsepower isn t all that great of a starting point not that this puny power stops people from trying being that the engine is so gutless owners of mirages in far east countries often start elsewhere starting many times with a wicked looking body kit believe it or not a company in thailand exists that builds custom fabricated body kits directly for use on this little eco box siam bodykits as they re known will ship you a range of different body kits with bitchin red and black accents for the front and rear bumpers anywhere in the world and yes that includes the united states it s also a much safer bet than the engine to take the wobbly and frankly pretty terrible suspension setup that comes with the mirage and replace it with a kit sure to at the very least make it infinitely more fun to drive these days loads of different companies like bc racing for one will make a custom four corner coilover kit for just about any modern car for the right price of course american mirage owners often complain that they can only find replacement shocks and struts through the dealer often marked up by two or three times what they cost to make racing shocks is a solution to this problem that our friends in the far east have come up with which makes the car handle like a champ all at once a new suspension intrinsically needs bigger brakes and that calls for bigger chunkier wheels and tires just like in the us urban centers in asian countries like japan thailand vietnam and the philippines have streets lined with aftermarket rim and tire shops that can make a mirage grip and stop like an adequately tuned project car should you might even be able to get a better deal on high quality aloy wheels from japan as a citizen of a far east country shipping expensive wheels all the way to the us is not cheap there s even a handful of the particularly brave diy gurus in thailand especially that try to squeeze every ounce of power out of their 1 2 liters and three cylinders they have to play with there s even one post from a prominent online mirage forum showing one mirage g4 sedan fitted with a speedlap supercharger kit with a k n air filter and a body kit setup fitting of a steroid injection dyno tests rated the boosted three banger at 91 horsepower still not great if you re used to 5 7 hemis and ls motors that make 450 minimum all day but remember the stock mirage only weighs 2100 pounds 995 kg in a package that light and with a sorted suspension you have something that s suddenly a lot less scorn worthy we might even be tempted to call this creation a full on driver s car in a package that starts around 15 000 or so it looks like our gearhead friends in asia have snobby internet trolls with more egg on their face than what the mirage could carry in its rear hatch or trunk lid if it s the g4 so then if you thought that it was impossible to make a mirage cool or fun to drive think again but what would this whole exercise in humble pie eating mean without a little bit of context a short while ago we showcased an awesome custom 2016 dodge charger project from an american instagrammer what makes cars like john_hemi s charger build make sense is not the car itself or the mods made it works because the wide open american highways fit modern chargers just as well as these little mirages fit the cramped narrow roads of southeast asia the it most often finds themselves in so before you say your two cents about the mirage being a joke of a car maybe bite your tongue first
enthusiasm for ev stocks is simply electric today what happened shares of several related stocks are ripping higher today suggesting that investors are feeling especially bullish on the prospects of the ev industry besides a general tailwind from the passage of the ev friendly infrastructure legislation earlier this week the successful ipo of rivian and some positive attention from wall street it s clear that investors are eager to park ev stocks in their portfolios as of 11 56 a m est shares of several ev oriented stocks have driven higher nio nio 2 83 fisker fsrn 5 29 evgo evgo 0 96 so what while the positive effect of legislation moving out of the house with 7 5 billion in funding to develop ev charging infrastructure on ev stocks is tapering off it s still worth noting since one of the main concerns of potential ev customers is the fear of not having a convenient place to recharge the recently passed legislation assuages a significant concern leading investors to suspect that increasing ev sales are coming down the road with regards to nio investors are surely encouraged today after hearing a vote of confidence from wall street keeping a buy rating on the stock jeff chung an analyst at citigroup raised his price target to 87 from 70 according to thefly com the new price target represents some serious upside about 120 from yesterday s closing price of 39 55 similarly news from the street seems to be buoying fisker s stock today as well yesterday an analyst from bank of america john murphy lifted his price target to 24 from 18 murphy s bullish perspective was the second in as many days on tuesday dan levy an analyst at credit suisse initiated coverage on the stock with an outperform rating and a 32 price target according to streetinsider com levy said with electric vehicle ev uptake sharply inflecting and the market lacking sufficient model options fisker offers a compelling value proposition sleek product at a high volume price point evgo investors on the other hand aren t reacting to favorable commentary from analysts instead the stock s rise today can be attributed to the company s q3 2021 earnings report beating analysts revenue estimates of 5 4 million evgo reported sales of 6 2 million for the recently completed quarter the company s profitability in the quarter also provided a pleasant shock for the ev charging stock while analysts expected the company to report a loss per share of 0 08 the company delivered earnings per share of 0 09 besides the surprises on the top and bottom lines evgo delighted investors with its more auspicious forecast for 2021 originally evgo had provided guidance of 20 million for 2021 however it upwardly revised that to 20 million to 22 million in addition the company foresees a narrower loss in 2021 instead of negative adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda of 58 million the company now is guiding for adjusted negative ebitda of 54 million to 58 million now what although it s worth acknowledging analysts bullish price targets on nio and fisker it s critical for prospective investors to remember that wall street s time horizons are oftentimes much shorter than the longer investing periods that we prefer instead investors should place greater importance on the company s performances in the case of nio investors have plenty to dig through as the company has cars on the road unlike fisker which is still preparing to commence deliveries of its vehicles in q4 2022 regarding evgo it will be interesting to see if the company achieves its revised guidance and what it foresees for 2022

for most of the past two years all the focus has been on the coronavirus but these biotechs have big plans to develop inoculations against other diseases too vaccine focused biotech stocks have been amazing performers over the last couple of years particularly if you owned the right ones novavax nvax 0 94 jumped from a micro cap to a 12 billion valuation and of course mrna vaccine specialists have been on fire moderna mrna 0 12 is now worth 94 billion and biontech bntx 1 85 has grown to a 58 billion valuation even tiny vir biotechnology vir 1 65 has crushed the market it s up by 144 over the past two years of course it was covid 19 that caused this segment of the healthcare sector to skyrocket but there are a lot of other ugly diseases out there and effective vaccines could knock some of them out too we asked three of our contributors which companies in this niche they re bullish on now their picks novavax moderna and vir biotechnology flu vaccines could be a big moneymaker for this biotech george budwell novavax novavax s shares are up by a staggering 3 560 over the past two years the stock s meteoric rise during this period wasn t without cause however its protein based covid 19 vaccine candidate nvx cov2373 is forecast to haul in somewhere between 3 billion and 8 billion in sales next year either end of that range would qualify as a strong revenue stream for a company with a 12 8 billion market cap at present with all the focus on nvx cov2373 though some investors have seemingly forgotten about novavax s recombinant quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine candidate dubbed nanoflu that s unfortunate because nanoflu could prove to be a blockbuster in its own right and it arguably has a better shot at delivering sustainable revenue growth than nvx cov2373 over the next five years novavax wrapped up the final analysis for its seasonal flu vaccine s pivotal trial in september and the study s results were subsequently published in the lancet infectious diseases the most important takeaway for investors is that nanoflu did in fact achieve statistical significance on the trial s primary endpoints novavax also recently commenced an early stage trial to evaluate the combination of nanoflu and nvx cov2373 top line data from this trial ought to be available in the first half of 2022 an annual vaccine that provides protection against both seasonal flu and covid 19 would likely appeal to millions of older adults nanoflu in turn has very real potential to be the company s next major growth driver nearly three dozen reasons to pick moderna patrick bafuma moderna moderna has a widely used covid 19 vaccine on the market and 15 billion in cash and investments on the books as of sept 30 but the 94 billion market cap biotech is not resting on its laurels with 34 candidates in its pipeline it is pushing hard to be known for more than just its covid 19 vaccine furthest along in the development process is its cytomegalovirus cmv vaccine which is currently in phase 3 studies cmv is the leading infectious cause of birth defects in the u s pregnant women who get infected with cmv can pass the virus on to their fetuses each year about 25 000 babies in the u s are born infected with it and about 20 of those have birth defects including learning disabilities hearing loss vision impairment and decreased muscle strength and coordination thus far there are no approved vaccines for cmv slightly behind that in the r d pipeline is a vaccine against rsv another common contagious respiratory virus it s currently in phase 2 3 trials for older adults and could become another growth driver for the massachusetts based biotech it is unclear if rsv boosters would be needed but considering the two dose series of glaxosmithkline s gsk 0 27 shingles vaccine shingrix saw 2 4 billion in sales in 2019 this could be a major opportunity for moderna the company has an annual influenza vaccine in phase 2 3 trials as well and the total addressable market for flu vaccines is anticipated to be almost 10 billion in 2030 this all feeds nicely into the organization s clear goal of bringing a pan respiratory virus annual vaccine to market and finally the biotech has a 50 50 partnership with merck to develop personalized oncology vaccines after a sample of a patient s tumor is analyzed by the company moderna provides an injection of personalized mrna that is intended to enhance the patient s immune system s ability to recognize and attack cancerous cells this personal cancer vaccine is in phase 2 trials for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma as well as for melanoma if it shows promise the concept might be applicable to other cancers too after helping curb one of the most fatal pandemics in the last century it would be hard to imagine a better encore than revolutionizing cancer therapy a world without infectious disease taylor carmichael vir biotechnology while the mrna vaccine for covid 19 that pfizer pfe 0 08 brought to market in partnership with biontech made all the headlines glaxo decided to collaborate with a much smaller biotech the 4 billion market cap vir biotechnology george scangos formerly the ceo of biogen biib 1 06 for many years now heads up vir and the mission statement of that little vaccine specialist is pretty audacious a world without infectious disease vir biotechnology was founded many years ago a company named alnylam alny 0 21 had a pipeline bursting with rnai therapies while these drugs are also focused on rna instead of trying to create new messages as the mrna drugs from moderna and biontech do alnylam s treatments seek to inhibit certain rna molecules alnylam has been highly successful but it wasn t actively pursuing vaccines with the technology so a biotech start up licensed the science and vir was born since then vir has moved beyond its sirna small interfering rna roots it has platforms in antibodies t cells and innate immunity too all of the company s treatments are focused on helping people fight off infectious diseases right now vir biotechnology has three antibody therapies for covid 19 including one that s already been authorized by the fda glaxo is handling the covid 19 drug development and vir is actively pursuing vaccines for hepatitis b the flu and hiv with almost 1 billion in cash on the books and very promising science underpinning its pipeline vir looks likely to be a winner over the next several years

over the years cigar manufacturers have attributed a large number of influences when it comes to creating their blends from family relationships to specific foods and even certain holidays however one brand has cited music as its influence more than any other in recent memory crowned heads from its first release that was inspired by a kings of leon song to subsequent creations inspired by works from johny cash and even led zeppelin the company has never shied away from explaining most times in quite a bit of detail how a song or lyric influenced the creation of a specific cigar in june crowned heads announced its newest addition to the list of musically inspired creations named chc serie e the chc in the name is short for crowned heads court while the e is short for eruption as a followup to its court reserve xviii line if you are not aware eruption is a guitar solo performed by eddie van halen that segues into van halen s song you really got me on the band s self titled album released in 1978 i listened to that solo and saw it as a sonic metaphor for smoking this cigar said jon huber co founder of crowned heads in a press release from the drum and bass intro which i saw as the cutting lighting prep of the cigar to the mixing of triads and harmonics which i compared to the complexity of the flavor profile to the bottoming out dive bombs that was reminiscent of the finish of the cigar it all paralleled seamlessly the chc serie e smoking experience is a medium plus bodied dance on the edge between technical mastery and random entropy resolving in a balanced melodious harmony blend wise the chc serie e incorporates an ecuadorian habano oscuro wrapper covering a binder from jalapa nicaragua as well as fillers from three of the four nicaraguan growing regions jalapa ometepe and pueblo nuevo the regular production release is being made at tabacalera pichardo in estelí nicaragua and boxes began arriving at retailers in september the chc serie e debuted in four

cigars smoked for review 3 the band on the chc serie e hermoso no 2 is quite distinctive with an aggressive black and red color scheme that was seeming inspired by the art design on one of eddie van halen s guitars the wrapper is also visually attractive due in large part to its combination of dark espresso brown color and obvious oil as well as being silky smooth to the touch a physical inspection reveals a number of prominent veins as well as two soft spots on one sample located just under the triple cap and under the main band on the back the aroma from the wrapper is a combination of milk chocolate earth leather and oak while the foot brings notes of dark chocolate slight orange peel hay and more oak after a straight cut the cold draw features flavors of cognac oak barrels cocoa nibs leather peanut shells and raisin sweetness just after lighting the foot of the crowned heads there is plenty of leather mixed with some spice on my tongue the former of which quickly morphs into top flavors of strong oak and peanut shells secondary notes of earth hay ground coffee beans leather tack cinnamon and a touch of citrus flit in and out at various points and there is a nice amount of bready graham cracker sweetness on the along with some noticeable black pepper on the retrohale construction wise the burn is not even close to razor sharp but not bad enough to need correcting as of yet while the draw is excellent after a straight cut flavor and body end the first third just below medium while the strength level is between mild and medium but still rising although it is not close to taking over one of the main spots in the profile i taste a bit of buttered popcorn on my palate as the second third of the cigar begins however the main flavors continue to be the same oak and peanuts that were so prevalent in the first third with additional flavors of bitter espresso baker s spices earth hay cinnamon and slight vegetal bringing up the rear the spice on my tongue disappears totally by the halfway point but the retrohale still exhibits an obvious amount of both black pepper and graham cracker sweetness albeit with less of the former than before thankfully the burn has improved noticeably and is now very close to razor sharp while the draw continues to impress and smoke production emanating from the foot is slightly above average both flavor and body are firmly in the medium range by the time the second third closes while the strength has increased to just below the medium mark a new flavor of powdery cocoa nibs overtakes peanuts as one of the top notes in the profile during the final third of the chc serie e hermoso no 2 combining nicely with the existing oak flavor that remains on top as well the peanut note which is now more of a generic creamy nuts flavor is relegated to the background of the profile where it joins other flavors of strong gritty earth cinnamon hay espresso beans and slight citrus both the graham cracker sweetness and black pepper continue to top the retrohale although the pepper note is waning in terms of construction the draw continues to impress while the burn gives me no major issues and the smoke production has not decreased flavor ends up just over medium body remains at a solid medium and the strength hits a solid medium by the time i put the nub down with a little less than an inch remaining final notes the robusto vitola s name is 5150 a reference to the van halen album of the same name that was released in 1986 it is also slang for article 1 section 5150 of the california welfare and institutions code which involves the temporary involuntary psychiatric commitment of someone who is a danger to others or to himself or herself due to signs of mental illness sadly eddie van halen passed away on oct 6 2020 it was great to see that the sublime vitola basically a double robusto in the chc serie e lineup is the exact size as the traditional cuban size of the same name i e 6 1 2 x 54 i am usually not a fan of ometepe tobacco to me its inclusion sometimes makes the cigar taste like dirt but other than a noticeable earthy note that sometimes became a bit overwhelming in the final third there was not much to complain about in that regard i do wonder what percentage of that specific tobacco is in the blend the cigars smoked for this review were purchased by halfwheel final smoking time for all three samples averaged one hour and 41 minutes if you would like to purchase any of the chc serie e hermoso no 2 cigars site sponsors atlantic cigar co famous smoke shop jr cigars and stogies world class cigars all have them in stock now 89 overall score i look forward to trying any new release from crowned heads and the chc serie e was no exception in that regard what i found was a blend that included a profile that is not overly complex but quite smooth with top flavors of oak and salted peanuts that shift back and forth as the cigar burns down along with a nice bready graham cracker sweetness on the retrohale while not the most impressive new crowned heads release this year so far that would be the las calaveras edición limitada 2021 lc50 the excellent construction and well integrated strength combine to make the chc serie e is a wonderful addition to the company s portfolio

aware selling your services to make something requested by the customer is not against the law of copyright infringement regardless of where you live and sharing your work isn t either let s take a printing business for example that offers printing images for the customer be it as posters or anything else customer brings in kimetsu no yaiba image data for an a0 poster business receives the data and uses it to print the poster business shares their printing expertise on sns to attract new customers customer receives the package in this case simply replace the printing business for a personalised cake business since this was done by request as a single product it s not infringing on any patents copyrights or whatever sharing your work online doesn t either as the object of the promotional picture is to display what you can do not the exact thing you have made being able to print with a specific quality on a certain type of paper with the results being as shown it d be a different story if you had an image in stock and printed it for anyone that requested it in this case it would be mass production and that would be a breach of the copyright law this case to me seems more like a staged thing to deter others from doing this it is still possible for them to file a complaint regardless of wether they re right or not as long as there s a possibility such as only showing kimetsu no yaiba cakes on sns or a vast majority of the images being from that it s always possible for copyright law to be different in japan but that would be strange since it would force small businesses to keep a record or have access to one for every single copyrighted image element object or whatever this is obviously not feasable so the responsibility would fall on the individual customer but then you d be restricting an individual freedom to replicate something for themselves in another medium would you ban peopple or would you be able to ban them from printing an image in their homes well i think my point is pretty clear or i hope so sobe joined 04 jun 2011 posts 881 posts 881 posted thu nov 11 2021 7 13 pm so the solution to this problem if she wanted to continue

rivian had quite a debut on wall street this week with trading on opening day propelling it past the 100 billion valuation making it the second most valuable automaker in the us after tesla the ev maker s stock opened at 78 a share on wednesday and closed at 100 73 later in the day representing one of the biggest opening day gains seen in years propelling it past ford and gm s market values while also flashing back to nikola s own brief market triumph over ford in 2020 the market debut was made all the even more dramatic given the fact that rivian has started production of its r1t electric truck just weeks ago for which it has 55 000 pre orders but does not expect profitability for some time it also doesn t expect its delivery numbers to top those of decades old automakers that have a far more modest market valuations in fact rivian expects a 1 275 billion net loss in this quarter alone so just how much overlap there is between the world of trading stocks and the world of actually making ev for customers remains to be examined given the giddy state of the ev start up landscape on the financial markets related story rivian r1t electric pickup truck production starts i think rivian s ipo is a clear sign of the direction in which industry investor and consumer priorities are heading electrification robby degraff industry analyst at autopacific told autoweek what makes the number so staggering is that rivian s only just started to roll out the first examples of their very first finished product the r1t whereas storied legacy automakers that have been around forever some over a century with fully established lineups of product and dramatically more sales are trailing behind that colossal valuation the cash generated by the ipo will come at a crucial time for the ev maker which has posted a loss of 994 million in the first half of the year more cash will be needed to ramp up production before rivian will start making a dent in those 55 000 truck orders the ev maker expects to burn though even more cash next year rivian rivian has been testing its trucks out in the real world in the lead up to the start of production we have generated significant losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of 1 7 billion and 2 7 billion as of december 31 2020 and june 30 2021 respectively rivian noted in its prospectus additionally we have generated significant negative cash flows from operations and investing activities as we continue to support the growth of our business we anticipate our cumulative spending on capital expenditures to be approximately 8 billion through the end of 2023 to support our continued commercialization and growth objectives as we strategically invest in infrastructure including additional manufacturing capacity battery cell production service operations charging networks experience spaces and software development an even bigger order the one that is giving investors more optimism at the moment is the 100 000 delivery van order from amazon through 2030 which also happens to be one of rivian s financial backers along with ford so the r1t pickup and the r1s sport utility while important to the public image of the company especially as the truck has beaten tesla s cybertruck to production by a whole year represent just two components of rivian s planned production in the near term there s a long road ahead for rivian and its 12 billion or so in funding will help them upshift into the next year degraff added more product needs to be sold and delivered to customers but in order for that to happen a new assembly plant really needs to get up and running because capacity at the normal illinois plant is limited remember they ve got a delivery van they need to build too for amazon whose partnership definitely attributed to the sky high valuation and beyond all under the same roof additionally that funding will likely be used for the expansion of rivian s portfolio we know there are more models on the way some of which will likely be in need of a new platform any time a new platform enters the picture it can be a fortune to develop and they don t just take shape overnight rivian s market debut is also unfolding at quite a favorable time for the market and its appetite for things electric if tesla s recent surge past the 1 trillion mark is any indication whether rivian s debut is taking place at a favorable time for the auto industry is a different question as most automakers are currently beset by chip shortages and have dialed back expectations of financial performance before the end of the year rivian is headed for plenty of choppy waters as well in the coming quarters we expect to operate at a negative gross profit per vehicle for the near term as our fixed costs from investments in vehicle technology manufacturing capacity and charging infrastructure are spread across a smaller product base until we launch additional vehicles and ramp production rivian noted in its prospectus this dynamic will cause our gross profit losses to increase on a dollar basis even as our revenue increases from ramping production volumes over the short to medium term rivian production of the r1t began just weeks ago when it comes to the vehicle that has attracted the most attention thus far the r1t pickup the model will face some significant competitors in just a few months as production of the ford f 150 lightning begins in the spring to be followed shortly by gm s electric chevrolet silverado in 2022 the cybertruck lest we forget is also expected to enter production next fall and rivian s r1s sport utility production of which is expected to start later this year already faces no shortage of competitors at home and overseas ones that are now arriving with some regularity whether rivian will be able to peel off a lot of those buyers in the longer term still remains to be seen by this time next year it won t be the only ev maker offering pickups but will likely be one of five brands with ev trucks in production

by john harwood and phil mattingly cnn president joe biden is nearing a decision on his choice for federal reserve chair with observers inside and outside the administration viewing incumbent jerome powell as the front runner for another term an announcement is expected as early as next week biden has waited longer in making his selection than his two immediate predecessors leaving a relatively narrow window for the senate to confirm his choice before powell s term expires next february biden during a november 2 news conference said he planned to make an announcement about his selection fairly quickly and said there would be plenty of time to move his pick through the confirmation process i ve given a lot of thought to it and i ve been meeting with my economic advisers on what the best choices are and we ve got a lot of good choices biden said when asked about the position but i m not going to speculate now the decision marks a critical moment for a white house in the midst of managing an economy emerging in fits and starts from a once in a century pandemic while job and wage growth have been robust a combination of pandemic driven supply chain bottlenecks and a demand surge for goods have led to price increases that this week reached a three decade high post pandemic crosswinds make biden s choice of the nation s most important economic policymaker unusually complex powell is a republican appointed chairman having been picked by president donald trump four years ago leading members of the democratic party which narrowly controls congress want the president to replace powell with current fed governor lael brainard in the belief that she would advance more aggressive regulation of financial institutions sen elizabeth warren a leading progressive voice with ties to key economic advisers across the administration leveled a fierce broadside against powell in september when she called him a dangerous man to head up the fed given her view of his posture on regulatory matters disclosures that multiple fed officials bought and sold stocks at the height of the pandemic as the fed was deploying extensive emergency measures to forestall a market collapse have fueled progressive efforts to push for a change atop the central bank two regional bank presidents departed the fed in the wake of the disclosures the fed in october announced a sweeping ban on top officials owning individual stocks and bonds as well as other trading restrictions the stock trading revelations have not been viewed as a problem for powell during the current process according to people familiar with the matter powell has also faced criticism from some lawmakers in both parties for continuing to back an expansive monetary policy even as inflation spikes amid the bumpy recovery from coronavirus shutdowns but to this point neither warren s strident opposition nor other concerns about powell s approach have generated any broad based public opposition on capitol hill the white house has kept key democratic senators in the loop throughout the process though they have not tipped biden s hand people familiar with the matter said at a time of heightened uncertainty over inflation and growth alike powell has overall received strong reviews for handling extraordinary economic turbulence since early last year and his commitment to using monetary policy levers to help repair the labor market matches the view of white house economists powell is steering this ship through very rocky waters and he seems very determined to get us to the other side where there is maximum employment said betsey stevenson a university of michigan economist who advised former president barack obama i m really worried about what happens if he gets asked to hand over the wheel right now he deserves it added tony fratto a former treasury department official who worked in president george w bush s administration he s been an anchor in the face of truly unprecedented challenges in addition the 84 senate votes powell received for confirmation as chairman in january 2018 along with the public support from several republican senators for his selection this time around suggest he could win a second term without much difficulty which might not be true of brainard obama originally appointed powell to the fed s board of governors in 2011 a vacancy for the position of fed vice chair of supervision gives biden the opportunity to respond to democratic concerns about powell s approach to financial regulation without replacing him as chair some economists close to the administration have speculated that he could select brainard for that post biden has known brainard who served in the obama treasury department when he was vice president for years he interviewed both her and powell at the white house last week if he nominates powell for a second term biden would become the third consecutive democratic president to keep a republican in the fed chairmanship bill clinton renominated alan greenspan in the job in 1996 as obama did with ben bernanke in 2009 biden s predecessor donald trump broke what had become an unofficial precedent when he chose not to re nominate janet yellen obama s second term selection for the role powell replaced yellen and went on to become a regular punching bag for trump as the former president sought to influence the fed s interest rate policy yellen is now biden s treasury secretary and privately communicated to white house advisers this fall about the value of continuity at the central bank which was viewed internally as a tacit endorsement for the job according to people familiar with the matter publicly yellen has only acknowledged that she s spoken to biden about the fed selection and not given an explicit endorsement but she did offer praise for powell s time in the role i think that chair powell has certainly done a good job yellen said in a november 1 cnbc interview the cnn wire

even give berkshire hathaway a quick flyby and we ve got some zillow news to get to as well as always joining me this week it s my guy he wasn t here last week folks he s back this week it s mr matt frankel certified financial planner matt you re on location this week tell everybody where you are matt frankel i am in las vegas and normally i would try to find a sub but i was out last week and i can t leave jason for two weeks in a row i am in las vegas there s a couple of real estate focus conventions going on here this week i get to talk to you the ceo of exp realty one of the more interesting companies in the real estate space i m really excited for that today i m on location here in my las vegas hotel room glad my internet is holding on how are you doing jason jason moser doing all right keeping busy here with work and family everything was a nice weekend here in northern virginia just getting back to the grind here on a monday as everyone else is matt last week square reported their most recent quarterly results this is a company clearly we cover pretty frequently on the show here it s a company where a lot of our listeners own shares you and i both own shares still in the company it seemed like it was a good enough quarter now you look at the stock the stock was down almost seven percent for the week now obviously we don t invest on those types of short time horizons but it s worth noting at least the sentiment for what seems like a relatively decent quarter the market weren t really buying the stock hand over fist let s go through some of your takeaways here for the quarter because because all in all it does seem like the business continues to perform well but maybe there were some signs of some slowing growth that have some investors concerned what do you think matt frankel well speaking of the slowing growth the big headline is that bitcoin revenue slowed down considerably from the second quarter jason moser yeah matt frankel i ve said before that square s fascination with bitcoin is probably my least favorite part of the company as an investor not like an anti bitcoin thing it s going to be very volatile it s not going to be predictable revenue it s like how we were talking with trading revenue with investment banks it s just really tough to predict from one quarter to the next bitcoin revenue was down significantly they don t make a ton of money off that but when you re doing billions of dollars in bitcoin volume in a quarter it s significant profit there but elsewhere in the business it s somewhat pretty strong square s gross profit was up 39 percent year over year one of the rare quarters where the seller ecosystem actually outpaced the cash app because it was compared to the third quarter of last year when things were still pretty shutdown cash app revenue looking great they rolled out a few new products square capital the business lending platform remember they got their banking charter recently they said that s approaching pre pandemic levels which during the pandemic everybody was borrowing through ppp loans and things like that they didn t have a reason to use square capital as much and now we re seeing that trickle back they launched a few different initiatives that i m excited to see where they go they expanded to france during the quarter that s interesting they set the second biggest card payment market in europe pretty promising they opened up cash app to 13 17 year olds with parent permission jason moser with all that i wanted to get your take on that because as you and i both are parents your kids are a lot younger than mine matt frankel yours are in that age group aren t they jason moser they are i wish that square had done this two years ago that was one of the bigger challenges when we were getting our girls into a banking relationship there weren t really very many compelling options because venmo and cash app essentially you have to be of age to do it consequently what we did is we initially got them started through greenlight which is that team banking consortium i think jpmorgan owns a good chunk of that ultimately they have now transitioned into capital one as a great checking account for students you can sign up for it online great mobile app you get your card and no issues there now they re working with capital one and their direct deposits go there i have a hard time seeing them you know how those banking relationships are matt they re sticky once you get in there you start moving forward with that matt frankel sure i think this could be a brilliant move in like 10 years here s why the teenagers of today don t want wells fargo they don t want bank of america they want venmo and cash app because it s cool jason moser exactly matt frankel if you have to be 18 to sign up for venmo and only 13 with a parent permission to sign up for cash app you re landing these customers say 8 10 years before they get into their real earning years you re building this relationship with these customers like you said banking relationships can be very sticky people don t change banks often this could give them an edge with that demographic as they get into their earning years in the coming years i really i m a big fan of that i have a list of stuff square did this quarter that s among my favorites one of the less favorites is the afterpay acquisition that s coming up jason moser we talked about that before and i agree with you i think cash app opening itself up to that 13 year old and above demo i think it s a great move i just wish they did it sooner i d imagine we ll see venmo doing something like that and shorter as well but yeah in regard to the afterpay it feels like that acquisition you and i probably i think are coming at it from basically the same direction there it s not afterpay but it s the price that square paid for it matt frankel yeah i don t have a problem with them acquiring afterpay i have a problem with them paying 29 billion in stock to do it jason moser yeah matt frankel especially i think square s stock price a little bit down since the announcement so they re diluting shareholders i m not a big fan of that price to pay i think paypal did it better in that case they re doing bolt on acquisitions to build out their buy now pay later jason moser yeah matt frankel not just buying one that s already up and running because i don t think square needs it i don t think they need it 29 billion worth jason moser probably not matt frankel that s roughly 1 5 of their market cap is it worth 20 percent of what square s already built to add a buy now pay later service i have a tough time making that argument jason moser yeah i m with you matt frankel but overall the numbers look good this quarter i m still encouraged i am still a square shareholder i don t plan on selling any shares they re still growing their payment volume their core business which a lot of people think of as boring actually grew 37 percent year over year they re processing on an annualized basis about 160 billion of payments it seems like just a few months ago that they cracked that 100 billion barrier for the first time jason moser yeah i m glad you mentioned that even at what you said 125 billion or something like that obviously it sounds like a lot then you look at something like a paypal i was just looking through that call from last quarter with paypal because paypal earnings since then only they dropped the night after the market closes but paypal now they re going to push through 1 25 trillion through their networks this year that just gives you an idea i think square could deal with it matt frankel roughly 10 times the size of square in terms of payment volume still a lot of room to grow this is not a mature company by any means jason moser yes well i agree there i think it s a good take there i remain a happy shareholder of this pullback in the stock here it s not just square we ve seen paypal could open up some interesting opportunities for patient investors but we shall see matt you re a big real estate guy everybody knows that i know it our listeners know it you even know it man simon property group and tanger factory outlet centers both reported earnings last week i tell you we re talking about how square got a lukewarm reception from the market these two i ll tell you the market was picking up but they were putting down tanger shares up 27 percent last week simon up 16 percent for the week let s start with tanger as we reopen i think these are two companies that you really like talk a little bit about tanger and simon together however you want to break it down but what s stood out to you in these quarters why is the market so enthusiastic matt frankel you remember the retail isn t dead basket we did about a year ago jason moser i do matt frankel these were two companies that were in it i loaded up on these companies during the pandemic tanger was trading about a fourth of what it is now everyone thought these companies we re going to go bankrupt if only someone had been saying they were not only going to survive but thrive this is going to accelerate their adaptation to the new digital economy in a good way i was grading year to year when i was reading these earnings reports i got to tell you jason moser someone was out there beating the drum for these things and i can t remember his name matt frankel i m going to do an update on the retailers dead basket because the numbers they might give your a war on cash basket a run for their money right now both of these were fantastic tanger was the winner in my opinion simon s already had a really strong business they didn t even completely eliminate their dividend during the pandemic like all the other companies including tanger did jason moser yeah matt frankel the big story i ll start with simon because that ll be a quick one occupancy is the big story with both of these simon s occupancy went from 91 8 percent in the second quarter it increased by a full percentage point to 92 8 percent now even before the pandemic retailers were losing tenants the retail bankruptcy started way before covid ever hit jason moser oh yeah matt frankel for a retail reit to be trending in that other direction is something investors have been waiting for for five years now net operating income from simon s domestic properties is up 25 percent year over year they re really getting past the pandemic even after acquiring one of their rivals taubman centers earlier this year simon s has eight billion dollars of liquidity including over a billion dollars of cash left to continue to innovate its properties i m very optimistic about they ve raised their dividend in the past few quarters in a row their dividend is now 27 percent higher than it was this time last year they did a 10 percent sequential dividend increase after raising it in the third quarter already they raised their full year guidance their numbers were just excellent tanger was another story altogether they boosted their occupancy even better than simon tanger s properties are 94 3 percent full that s 150 basis points greater than simon which is the best mall reit in the world beating them in occupancy rent spreads were up 240 basis points meaning when they re releasing these properties they re getting more money now their tenants said here s the key statistic for tanger s earnings report tanger s tenant sales are at an all time high on a square footage basis thirteen percent higher than pre pandemic levels for a retail reit everyone s said no one is going to go to outlets anymore you can t social distance at outlet stores and they re all crowded and no one wants to do that yes they do jason moser well we ve talked about this a lot i mean you see on the headlines with companies that are keeping their offices closed but you can look around there are more that are opening up and you look all i mean anywhere you look with these nfl games were ready to get out and do stuff and travel we re seeing it i mean i m sure that you are seeing it there in vegas i mean people are letting their guard down and starting to go back out and that s certainly is reflecting in the traffic a lot of these stores are getting as well matt frankel i mean i think that per square foot sales number is at a record that has big implications for the future growth of the outlet industry tanger didn t want to open any more properties when occupancy was falling before the pandemic now that occupancy is rising and it s tenants are happy it has existing relationships with these tenants so it can go to the gap which is its biggest tenant and say your sales are killing it and all these properties you have stores at now we re about to open a new one in nashville which is where they re planning the next one are you in all their tenants are going to say yes it s a great catalyst for growth in the industry which the outlet industry is a very small part of retails though i m very excited for tanger it s about quadrupled since the pandemic lows and i don t plan on selling any of it jason moser well that s good to hear on both fronts there now over the weekend matt berkshire hathaway as they do released their earnings report and that s one that always just flies right under the radar because it s off hours so to speak there s not a whole heck of a lot of really going on with berkshire i mean not a whole lot has changed but you took a look at this report real quick what are one or two things you feel like investors need to know from this quarter for berkshire hathaway matt frankel berkshire always releases its earnings on a saturday which is by design they wanted to give the market time to digest it before it reacts berkshire s businesses are boring which is why nobody really pays that much attention to it they want to know what berkshire did in it s stock portfolio which is a different report three key takeaways operating earnings were up 18 percent for berkshire operating businesses year over year some nice recovery from the pandemic berkshire s cash stockpile is at an all time high now surprise surprise it seems like we said that every quarter jason moser yeah buffett before is really talked about how cash just isn t where you want to be now you see where his cash balances is just an interesting dissonant there matt frankel don t get me wrong i think having 149 billion of cash is a negative in times of inflation like we re starting to see right now that s losing five percent of its purchasing power a year right now i wish he would do something with it that s my biggest complaint about berkshire right now but he is buying back berkshire s own shares at the highest rates so far berkshire spent 7 6 billion on buybacks in the quarter a little over 20 billion so far this year but the third quarter buyback pace was a little greater than the first and second and the cash stockpile still went up so that tells you how much money berkshire s businesses really generate but i m happy to see them spending money on buybacks i hope they continue to do that especially if buffett continues to think i don t necessarily disagree that acquisitions are expensive right now i hope he continues to pull the trigger on some buybacks jason moser yeah well i mean he s buying stock he just its his own exactly you can t fault him for that i mean i feel like if anyone knows that business it s warren and charlie so it seems like much more of the same year and berkshire shareholders should be i would think at least encouraged feeling good about the big picture with this business matt let s wrap up this week with a conversation regarding something that happened early last week and it s something that i think took a lot of us by surprise last week zillow announced that it is getting out of the ibuying business now if this seemed a bit out of nowhere it kind of was even given the recent headline that they were pressing pause on the initiatives for the remainder of 2021 chris hill and i had talked about this on market foolery one day and it felt like well you understand they want to just get their feet set underneath and then make sure they understand what they re doing and the sign was if they kept that pause button held down for a considerable part of 2022 if they kept on stringing that alone then you start wondering do they really know what they re doing and then lo and behold they decided they re getting out of ibuying altogether it sounded like they re getting out of it basically because it s just not working out how they thought it would but i want to read what you tweeted and let s go from there because you have some strong feelings about this honestly i mean i understand where you re coming from but i m going to read your tweet here you said the recent news from zillow is one thing i ve ever been in a company i invested in terrible execution poor shareholder communications and a high level of incompetence planning to sell my shares very soon and walk away i don t think you re the only one that feels this way matt but let s dig into this a little bit i mean this happened so quickly particularly rich barton has been thinking about it for a while and now it sounds like it s gone matt frankel i m apparently not the only one who thinks this way because that was my most liked tweet of 2021 so far apparently i m not the only one who feels that way people don t really see my salty side very often jason moser i love it matt frankel it s an old buffett quote that i tweeted right after that lose money and i will be forgiving if you lose reputation and i will be ruthless i feel like they lost reputation here with me and that s really the problem i have a bunch of numbers to go through but let me tell you why i m disappointed it not just that they re getting out of ibuying if zillow is getting out of ibuying if it wasn t working out if they weren t doing a good job i m fine pulling the plug on a money losing business before things get really bad that s fine i even agree with what they said the business there it s not working out economically the way they thought it would they said it s alienating a lot of their customers who are disappointed in the offers they re getting things to that effect fine whatever i don t like the misleading communication number one you mentioned that they just said they were taking a pause on ibuying like a week before this came out that means one of two things either this was a knee jerk reaction to one bad quarter or they already had the decision made when that news came out one of those has to be true jason moser it feels to me like the latter it really does feel like they had that decision made i can t believe they went from hitting pause altogether in the stretch of like a week it just doesn t add up matt frankel right it s either incompetence of management or misleading communications it s one or the other on that note you have to take a step back and decide what zillow s core businesses is worth because they still have their premier agent business which is profitable but my problem with that zillow gets 227 million unique viewers a month they had 2 8 billion visits to their site in the third quarter they have the biggest collection of real estate data in the world in terms of residential real estate for them to take that translate it to an ibuying business and have worse economics than their rivals like opendoor and offerpad and redfin who have much better unit economics on the houses they re buying and selling in zillow for them not to be able to leverage that data to their advantage that s the biggest red flag to me because they weren t able to take the key advantages they have they ve been developing zestimate for over a decade now the way to algorithmically price homes for them not to be able to have that to the point where it does a better job than their rivals of pricing homes that is a big red flag for me i want to see what zillow s going to do from here they ended the quarter with 9 790 homes in inventory and another over 8 100 under contract to buy that s a lot of houses when they unloading to sell all those they re going to have roughly 5 billion of cash on their balance sheet i m wondering what they re going to do with that what i d like to see zillow do is become the kayak of ibuying where they partner with opendoor and offerpad and redfin you can go to zillow and get your get offers on your house from all of them and decide which one is best for you zillow makes some money off that doesn t take any of the risk the other three get some lead generation so it s a win win for everybody i would like to see them do something like that if zillow s management s listening please take that advice but i m disappointed ibuying was probably the big part of my thesis with zillow but it s really the way they went about it i never felt a company for walking away from a business that s not working if they do it the right way jason moser yeah i agree i think i tweeted something out to that extent too it s easy to pile on i respect the decision i respect them getting in there and saying hey you know what this is working let s go ahead and bag it s a good investing once in there you get an investment and it s not working if there s a thesis has changed or it s busted being able to admit you re wrong and then moving forward that s a great quality to have i do want to ask you a couple of things so number one don t you get the feeling that real estate agents are just relishing this news because this has traditionally been a very difficult market to disrupt traditionally it s been a very difficult market to disrupt it felt like zillow was helping blaze that trail leading the way to doing that i feel like real estate agents are looking at this and saying yeah you know what we told you it was harder than you thought and they re feeling ok about it matt frankel i m interviewing exp realty which is a brokerage business i m interviewing their ceo later today i can t wait to ask them about this news because he believes that traditional brokerage business that s growing rapidly i can t imagine he s disappointed that zillow s getting out of ibuying jason moser no i can t then the other thing because it feels like so much of this decision to get into ibuying in the first place hinged on their proprietary data and certainly centered a lot around that zestimate that you mentioned earlier they ve been developing for the better part of a decade it really feels like this is another strike against the zestimate they have to feel like maybe the big picture view is that folks look at the zestimate is really nothing more than cosmetic at this point and not so informative at least not informative enough to where you re making decisions based around it matt frankel yeah that s a good point they re essentially saying that zestimate is just for fun is what it sounds to me if you re saying you can t do a good job predicting houses their unit economics went from positive 1 200 basis points so 12 percent profit margin in the second quarter to a negative 5 7 percent profit margin in the fourth quarter that s a pretty bad job of predicting what you re going to be able to do with these houses you re saying that that volatility and your inability to predict houses or the region you re pulling the plug it really makes me think what have you been doing with the zestimate all this time because they specifically said they wanted to get to the point where the zestimate was the offer of the house when someone can just click the zestimate and that s the offer it s just a big about face they ve been hyping this up as the future of the company for a long time now jason moser well it sounds like the zestimate has become a bit more of a pestimate matt i m going to go ahead and leave the building now matt i think that s going to do it for us this week i really appreciate you taking the time to be here particularly preparing for all these means good luck with everything on the trip there i can t wait to hear all your takeaways hey thanks again for being here matt frankel awesome always fun to be here jason moser remember folks you can always reach us at mfindustryfocus or drop us an email in as always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against so don t buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear thanks as always to tim sparks for putting the show together for us for matt frankel i m jason moser thanks for listening and we ll see you next week
barbados prime minister mia mottley wants richer countries to stop throwing garbage in her yard and then telling her to clean it up the garbage in this case is greenhouse gas emissions that fuel more extreme storms and hurricanes causing widespread destruction which can cost billions of dollars at the glasgow climate negotiations mottley is leading a push for richer countries to compensate poorer ones for the loss and damage caused by climate change their argument is this developed countries like the u s and those in the european union are responsible for most of the heat trapping emissions pumped into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution developing countries have lower emissions but are still bearing the brunt of a hotter climate through more severe heat waves floods and droughts it is unjust and it is immoral mottley said at the summit it is wrong to help compensate for that developing countries are asking richer ones to contribute to a loss and damage fund the money could offer payment for things that are irrevocably lost like lives or the extinction of species it could also help countries with the cost of rebuilding after storms replacing damaged crops or relocating entire communities at risk while loss and damage was discussed at the paris climate talks in 2015 progress has been slow industrialized countries have been reluctant to commit funding concerned it could lead to being legally liable for the impacts of climate change at this year s climate talks developing countries say it s a crucial part of climate justice providing finance for loss and damage is the very least that wealthy countries can and should do says raeed ali a climate activist from fiji and part of the loss and damage youth coalition but to do this they will have to acknowledge that they are responsible for this and i think that is something they are not willing to do few resources to recover from disasters for countries with where much of the population lives in poverty extreme weather can be a devastating blow individuals have little savings to rebuild while governments with few resources struggle to secure the millions of dollars needed to help communities recover in fiji we are at the forefront of the climate crisis ali says so every single person knows about climate change because it s a daily reality for us ali says while his grandparents only remember experiencing one category 5 cyclone in their lives he s already seen three and with rising sea levels threatening to make villages uninhabitable a handful in fiji have already been relocated and more than 40 are slated to be moved he said raeed ali raeed ali climate activist raeed ali from fiji seen here at cop26 is pushing wealthier countries to compensate for climate change losses like villages being relocated in his country due to rising seas some countries are being hit by back to back disasters in 2015 the caribbean island nation of dominica was hit by tropical storm erika causing more than 400 million in damage equal to 90 of the country s gross domestic product two years later hurricane maria slammed the island damaging 90 of the country s housing stock in the gambia in west africa where the majority of people in rural areas depend on agriculture crop failures can be catastrophic because the country s main river flows into the ocean rising sea levels are pushing saltwater farther and farther upriver making it harder to get freshwater it s really affecting the farming communities says isatou camara a climate negotiator for the gambia in west africa because of sea level rise we have saltwater intruding into our river which is affecting farm production especially rice farming which is usually done along the riverside developed countries have promised 100 billion per year in climate finance to help poorer nations reduce their emissions through things like renewable energy and sustainable agriculture they ve yet to fully deliver on that goal since each country determines its own contribution but many developing countries say that funding doesn t help with the climate impacts they re already experiencing which is why a separate loss and damage fund is needed in 2020 natural disasters caused 210 billion in damage worldwide assigning liability for climate change at the 2015 paris climate summit countries signed an agreement recognizing the need to address loss and damage but developed countries pushed to include language that specified it did not provide a basis for any liability they feared that admitting responsibility for their share of heat trapping pollution would expose them to paying developing nations every time a disaster hit it s always something developed countries have been very cautious about exactly because they don t want it to be a precedent for international courts maria antonia tigre a fellow at columbia university s sabin center for climate change law they really do want to avoid that responsibility because it can be endless recent advances in climate change science have upped the pressure while many climate studies examine long term trends researchers at the world weather attribution initiative study whether climate change has amplified an extreme weather event in the weeks or months after it hits hurricane harvey which released a deluge of rain on houston in 2017 was made 15 more intense by climate change they found this past summer the severe heat wave in the pacific northwest that caused dozens of deaths was virtually impossible without the added boost of human caused greenhouse gas emissions paul ellis afp via getty images afp via getty images protesters at the cop26 climate summit in glasgow scotland are rallying for new funding specifically for loss and damage in vulnerable countries the fact that we are able to pinpoint the climate fingerprint in specific things that hurt us today i think is a very important element in the current loss and damage conversation says maarten van aalst director of the red cross red crescent climate centre and a scientist with the world weather attribution initiative it has changed the conversation over the past years van aalst is quick to point out that assigning blame is a complex question while a storm s destruction is caused by its strength it also occurs if the buildings and homes aren t built to handle storms some communities aren t designed to endure the kinds of events that occurred even before the effects of climate change started to be felt still court cases are underway around the world to establish liability for climate change either seeking damages from governments or fossil fuel companies the uncertainty of science was one of the main arguments that was always used by states to avoid responsibility says tigre and that s a bridge that s now crossed no show of funding for loss and damage at the glasgow summit scotland announced a major milestone for addressing loss and damage needs it offered 2 million pounds in funding the first of its kind that is in the right direction said sonam wangdi of bhutan who chairs a group of the 46 poorer countries at the talks it s going to be very clear that there should be separate funds for loss and damage and it should not be mixed with all the other funds still other funding commitments haven t followed yet while the u s has formally recognized the need to address loss and damage a senior u s official says the country doesn t support creating a dedicated new fund instead of waiting for voluntary offers barbados prime minister mottley is proposing using 1 tax on sales revenues from fossil fuels which she estimates could raise 70 billion per year some are simply hoping that countries invest in the united nation s santiago network which was set up in 2019 to handle loss and damage issues but without enough staffing and funding it exists mainly symbolically today even if developed countries offer new support for a loss and damage fund they could still be held liable for the impacts of climate change at a press conference in glasgow the island nations of tuvalu and antigua and barbuda announced they re forming a new commission to enable small island countries to seek compensation through international courts copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

the covid 19 pandemic has shifted demographic trends in a number of ways from lower birth rates to increased death rates to reductions in immigration but one of the most significant changes is where people are choosing to live as they migrate within the u s a new study by porch looking at the fastest growing low density cities in the united states finds that phoenix is the 7th fastest growing large low density city in the early months of the pandemic many city dwellers left for less populated locations where physical distancing was easier outdoor activities were more plentiful and living space for remote work and schooling was more affordable now as covid 19 s long term effects on work become clearer including permanent remote work arrangements and massive shifts in employees career preferences flexibility in where to live and work has become critical for many workers as a result second tier cities suburbs and small towns are seeing an influx of new residents looking to take advantage of their new work arrangements in more affordable locales read also hispanic population is now the majority in phoenix census shows on some level however these covid driven migrations are also reflective of recent pre pandemic population trends one of the important factors driving this trend is the affordability of real estate while many young highly educated professionals in recent years have tended to cluster in major metros for their quality jobs and amenities these locales also usually have higher costs of living for those raising families or just seeking out affordable real estate many of these densely populated locations now hold less appeal the result of this trend is that certain states have experienced much more rapid population growth than others while major metros in states like california and new york do have appeal for young job seekers the states themselves have been experiencing weak or even negative population growth over the past decade instead more affordable states like texas florida and colorado have grown at a strong clip over the last ten years more recently they have been joined by mountain west locations including idaho nevada utah and arizona the four fastest growing states from 2015 to 2020 cities in these states usually have more land available for development and zoning policies that make it easier to expand than in older denser metros this is important for the development of housing stock and real estate in lower density areas is usually more affordable as a result while lower density living also has its downsides most prominently fewer transit options and longer commutes affordable housing prices are a significant enough factor to persuade many people to choose less densely populated areas recent data bears out this phenomenon when cities are distributed by their population density the most densely populated cohort of cities has an overall 0 0 population growth over the last five years all of the other cohorts have shown growth over the same period led by cities in the 25 50 density cohort with a 5 7 increase in population to identify the fastest growing low density cities researchers at porch used census bureau data to calculate the percentage change in population between 2015 and 2020 and only included those cities where the population density is lower than the median to improve relevance only cities with at least 100 000 people were included the analysis found that between 2015 and 2020 the total population in phoenix increased by 7 9 out of all large u s cities with relatively low population density phoenix is the 7th fastest growing here is a summary of the data for phoenix 5 year percentage change in population 7 9 population density per square mile 3 298 population 2020 1 708 127 population 2015 1 583 760 land area square miles 518 0 for reference here are the statistics for the entire united states 5 year percentage change in population 2 7 population density per square mile 93 population 2020 329 484 123 population 2015 320 738 994 land area square miles 3 537 042 5 for more information a detailed methodology and complete results you can find the original report on porch s website

barbados prime minister mia mottley wants richer countries to stop throwing garbage in her yard and then telling her to clean it up the garbage in this case is greenhouse gas emissions that fuel more extreme storms and hurricanes causing widespread destruction which can cost billions of dollars at the glasgow climate negotiations mottley is leading a push for richer countries to compensate poorer ones for the loss and damage caused by climate change their argument is this developed countries like the u s and those in the european union are responsible for most of the heat trapping emissions pumped into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution developing countries have lower emissions but are still bearing the brunt of a hotter climate through more severe heat waves floods and droughts it is unjust and it is immoral mottley said at the summit it is wrong to help compensate for that developing countries are asking richer ones to contribute to a loss and damage fund the money could offer payment for things that are irrevocably lost like lives or the extinction of species it could also help countries with the cost of rebuilding after storms replacing damaged crops or relocating entire communities at risk while loss and damage was discussed at the paris climate talks in 2015 progress has been slow industrialized countries have been reluctant to commit funding concerned it could lead to being legally liable for the impacts of climate change at this year s climate talks developing countries say it s a crucial part of climate justice providing finance for loss and damage is the very least that wealthy countries can and should do says raeed ali a climate activist from fiji and part of the loss and damage youth coalition but to do this they will have to acknowledge that they are responsible for this and i think that is something they are not willing to do few resources to recover from disasters for countries with where much of the population lives in poverty extreme weather can be a devastating blow individuals have little savings to rebuild while governments with few resources struggle to secure the millions of dollars needed to help communities recover in fiji we are at the forefront of the climate crisis ali says so every single person knows about climate change because it s a daily reality for us ali says while his grandparents only remember experiencing one category 5 cyclone in their lives he s already seen three and with rising sea levels threatening to make villages uninhabitable a handful in fiji have already been relocated and more than 40 are slated to be moved he said raeed ali raeed ali climate activist raeed ali from fiji seen here at cop26 is pushing wealthier countries to compensate for climate change losses like villages being relocated in his country due to rising seas some countries are being hit by back to back disasters in 2015 the caribbean island nation of dominica was hit by tropical storm erika

in west africa where the majority of people in rural areas depend on agriculture crop failures can be catastrophic because the country s main river flows into the ocean rising sea levels are pushing saltwater farther and farther upriver making it harder to get freshwater it s really affecting the farming communities says isatou camara a climate negotiator for the gambia in west africa because of sea level rise we have saltwater intruding into our river which is affecting farm production especially rice farming which is usually done along the riverside developed countries have promised 100 billion per year in climate finance to help poorer nations reduce their emissions through things like renewable energy and sustainable agriculture they ve yet to fully deliver on that goal since each country determines its own contribution but many developing countries say that funding doesn t help with the climate impacts they re already experiencing which is why a separate loss and damage fund is needed in 2020 natural disasters caused 210 billion in damage worldwide assigning liability for climate change at the 2015 paris climate summit countries signed an agreement recognizing the need to address loss and damage but developed countries pushed to include language that specified it did not provide a basis for any liability they feared that admitting responsibility for their share of heat

to be a precedent for international courts maria antonia tigre a fellow at columbia university s sabin center for climate change law they really do want to avoid that responsibility because it can be

change they found this past summer the severe heat wave in the pacific northwest that caused dozens of deaths was virtually impossible without the added boost of human caused greenhouse gas emissions paul ellis afp via getty images afp via getty images protesters at the cop26 climate summit in glasgow scotland are rallying for new funding specifically for loss and damage in vulnerable countries the fact that we are able to pinpoint the climate fingerprint in specific things that hurt us today i think is a very important element in the current loss and damage conversation says maarten van aalst director of the red cross red crescent climate centre and a scientist with the world weather attribution initiative it has changed the conversation over the past years van aalst is quick to point out that assigning blame is a complex question while a storm s destruction is caused by its strength it also occurs if the buildings and homes aren t built to handle storms some communities aren t designed to endure the kinds of events that occurred even before the effects of climate change started to be felt still court cases are underway around the world to establish liability for climate change either seeking damages from governments or fossil fuel companies the uncertainty of science was one of the main arguments that was always used by states to avoid responsibility says tigre and

shellfish such as crab lobster and shrimp it is utilized in medicine chitosan is used to treat hypertension high cholesterol obesity wound healing and other ailments however there is no scientific proof to back up many of its claims chitosan is used in pharmaceutical manufacture as filler in tablets to improve the way certain medications dissolve and to conceal bitter flavors get report sample

usd 3 3 billion aided by an increase in vannamei prawn sales due to increased retail demand during the pandemic india the world s largest shrimp exporter had a tough year in 2020 with the covid 19 pandemic significantly affecting production and export performance last year the south asian country produced between 650 000 and 700 000 metric tons of shrimp falling from 780 000 to 800 000 mt in

chitosan and its derivatives are widely utilized in cosmetics owing to their antioxidant cleaning protective humectant and antioxidant properties because of its particular benefits in the cosmetics sector the increased demand for skincare in the cosmetics market will have a significant impact on the chitosan market restraint high production cost owing to the irregular supply of the raw material the irregular supply of raw materials will hamper the chitosan market growth india s shrimp exports fell 14 percent year on year to 575 000 mt in 2020 with the united states china and the european

increased sales of raw peeled products by 15 000 mt compensated for its decrease in output on the worldwide market ecuador increased its shipments of mid sized shrimp to the united states significantly last year whereas india lost 14 percent of its market share in the united states india also lost market share in the shell on market in the united states to ecuador and indonesia such irregularities in the raw materials supply the overall value chain may hamper which in turn hamper the chitosan overall production volume opportunities increasing obesity and overweight issues in the region and rising health awareness among people the region s expanding obesity and overweight issues as well as people s growing health consciousness will generate prospects for the chitosan industry according to the institute of health metrics and evaluation around 30 0 percent of the world s population is fat or overweight according to the cdc roughly 93 million americans over the age of 20 or nearly 40 of the u s population have excessive cholesterol putting them at an elevated risk of heart disease and stroke western european countries with the highest cholesterol levels in the world such as greenland iceland andorra and germany have mean blood total cholesterol levels of roughly 5 5 mmol l early study suggests that consuming chitosan orally may lower cholesterol aid to repair anemia and enhance physical strength appetite and sleep in persons on hemodialysis who have renal failure challenges the imposition of ban on the import export one aspect that was not considered in its conclusions but which is expected to have a substantial impact on world commerce is a proposed ban on shrimp imports from india by the european union this country is the world s second biggest producer of farmed shrimp and the largest source of imports to the netherlands and the united kingdom following ten years of concerns about the presence of antibiotics in shrimp india s pre export control process will be audited in november during this procedure all cargoes going for the eu must be scrutinized and the eu commission last year boosted its own inspection regime on consignments from india from 10 to 50 despite guarantees from indian officials 11 examples of noncompliance mainly with nitrofurans have been registered since the beginning of the year as a result the eu has reached the end of its patience and if the upcoming audit uncovers ongoing flaws in the system a ban is a very real prospect report highlights based on the sources the chitosan market is dominated by shrimp followed by crab shrimp is considered the primary source of chitosan because it contains approximately 25 to 40 chitin whereas crab shell contains approximately 15 to 20 the waste water segment is the most prominent segment in the market which contributed largest share in the chitosan market nations have enacted stringent regulations prohibiting the pollution of naturally occurring water bodies and the illegal discharge of wastewater which will create a positive impact on the chitosan market browse more related reports recent developments bioavanta bosti a pioneer in chitosan

here s what you need to know north korea s light infantry and special forces are taking on increasing importance infantry weapons have long been a pillar of the north korean people s army or kpa for short the kpa that invaded south korea was largely an infantry army and despite significant mechanization in the 1970s the foundation of the army has been its infantry forces today the bulk of the kpa s 1 1 million army is infantry with approximately 200 000 light infantry and special forces after the korean war north korea followed the soviet union s lead in infantry weapons the oldest gun still in service is the kpa type 58 assault rifle a clone of the soviet ak 47 the type 58 was produced in two factories 61 and 65 located near chongjin between 1958 and 1968 the type 58 was a basic ak pattern rifle with a 30 round magazine and a rate of fire of up to 650 rounds per minute approximately 800 000 rifles were produced and while the 7 62 millimeter assault rifle is no longer in service with frontline units it allegedly still equips reserve units and militia a new rifle the type 68 was a clone of the soviet akm assault rifle and manufactured beginning in 1968 in practical terms the type 68 had few major improvements over the type 58 although it did come with a folding stock the type 68 was also extensively exported abroad to el salvadoran marxist guerrillas and across central and south america these rifles are also likely still in service with reservists and rear area units as north korea is undoubtedly still sitting on a considerable supply of 7 62 rifle ammunition the kpagf s main weapon is the type 88 assault rifle the weapon is similar to the soviet ak 74 although at least one report suggests it may be derived more from the chinese copy of the ak 74 than the original soviet weapon the weapon represents a major logistical break for the kpagf using 5 45 millimeter ammunition instead of the the 7 62 round utilized by previous rifles the type 88 may have started out in special commando units but appears to have gradually spread out into regular army units north korean watchers have spotted the type 88 using helical magazines capable of carrying more than one hundred rounds of ammunition and the rifle also formed the basis for north korea s version of the u s army s objective individual combat weapon a combination gun grenade launcher weapon equipped with an advanced gunsight north korea also maintains a small arsenal of m 16 pattern rifles several such rifles were reportedly found on the bodies of infiltrators during the 1996 gangneung incident the south korean military at one time used m 16a1 rifles and the weapon could have been used by agents and saboteurs to impersonate south korean military personnel it s not clear where these weapons came from one report suggests the rifles could have been chinese norinco cq rifles but north korea s history suggests that the weapons could have come from central or south american guerrillas or even vietnam north korea s early squad automatic weapon the type 73 was an idiosyncratic weapon based on the soviet pkm machine gun it featured a dual feed ammunition system allowing it to accept metal belted ammunition but also vertically loaded 30 round magazines similar to the czechoslovakian vz 52 or british army bren machine gun the dual feed system has always been something of a mystery as the type 73 uses different ammunition than north korean assault rifles and as such there is no commonality vertical magazines do however allow machine gunners to fire from the prone position and while belted ammo can do the same thing feeding belts can allow the machine gun to ingest debris and jam even more intriguingly the type 73 can fire rifle grenades north korea s follow on machine gun and their current squad level support firearm the type 82 was introduced in 1982 and is a more orthodox weapon the type 82 bears greater similarity to the pk pkm machine guns lacks a magazine fed option and is belt fed only north korea s light infantry and special forces are taking on increasing importance as the country s aging mechanized units starved for technology and fuel are likely becoming less relevant to the country s war plans the guns of the kpa ground forces help ensure north korean sniper airborne and marine infantry units remain operationally relevant now and into the near future whether this impoverished country with an economy smaller than panama s can arm their infantrymen as well as their american and south korean counterparts while simultaneously affording an expanding nuclear arsenal is another question kyle mizokami is a defense and national security writer based in san francisco who has appeared in the diplomat foreign policy war is boring and the daily beast in 2009 he cofounded the defense and security blog japan security watch you can follow him on twitter kylemizokami this article first appeared in 2017 image reuters

the theme for today is that business creates wealth this goes back to adam smith that is in 1770 he said that within a framework of law caps here are important business venues will be driven by an invisible hand to promote the general welfare next it can seem if someone makes a lot of money they have a larger share of the pie and thus others have less the reality is that a good venture helps make the pie bigger to illustrate how the pie grows let us look at a celebration in our family in november 1891 exactly 130 years ago my great great grandfather caleb woodyard bought what we call the windmill farm the windmill pumped water for cattle in a small pasture in the 1950s dad built the corn cribs to store the 80 bushels per acre corn on the cob today our machinery picks shucks and shells the corn in one operation so it is called a combine sadly the cribs are gone and we have modern but less attractive storage bins thirty years later he gave the farm to my grandfather joe woodyard varner in the legal conveyance there is what we call an in terrorem provision i believe written by his soon to be father in law a terre haute lawyer and my namesake carson hamill it said that for 10 years he could not sell or take a loan using the farm as collateral if he did the farm would go to other members of the family today my brother and i as well as our children own the farm caleb gave land to other family members as well but all our now distant cousins have sold their land and gone their ways illinois farm records begin right after the civil war and show yields up and down but average about 40 bushels per acre in the 1950s several agricultural companies looking to make some bucks got to work and while annual yields continue to go up and down the trend line has been upward and onward seeds used to be taken from a good looking ear but now while expensive from carefully cross bred strains fertilizers and improved drainage also contribute to the record 230 bushel yields on our windmill farm many mclean county farmers might brag about even more think of the wealth increase coming every year from the very same land caleb bought so many years ago remember in the 1970s it was illegal in the u s to own a telephone but rather ma bell rented them out to homeowners and businesses telephone service was either a government enterprise like the postal system or in our case a heavily regulated monopoly president ronald reagan proclaimed there should be competition and we were off and running in what i believe have been 40 of the most creative years in human history as i write apple stock trades at 150 a share on my tech student s recommendation i got mine at 15 i didn t buy enough did i are you poorer after steve jobs and i have taken your money you could still be dialing your numbers but today 85 of us own a smart phone that includes quite a few who live in what we call poverty government stay out of the way has been my creed but after swallowing a bit i must admit sometimes they get it right thirty years ago they pushed some grumpy farmers into using a no till or low till method which was more friendly to the environment a recent presentation began with a picture of a bright red oh so cool 65 chevy the presenter then said this was a picture of a death trap he then went on in sometimes gruesome detail to explain why i well recall safety did not sell back then my first car was a volkswagen beetle dad wondered why i wasted 20 each to have two lap seat belts installed recently a friend of mine was in a car accident that totaled her car driver probably on the phone running a yield sign she and her young daughter were obviously shaken but otherwise unhurt in that 65 chevy survival would be in doubt i find cars ugly these days but for the 91 of u s households that have cars they are so much better off and share the added safety created by although sometimes pushed by government business there is a lot of noise these days that immigrant musk college dropouts gates and zuckerberg bezos and their ilk in the name of fairness and equality should be stripped of a significant portion of their holdings there seems to be a feeling that their money is in some sort of an uncle scrooge money bin and just waiting to be taken and put to good use the truth is that their money or capital as well as mine in apple is working very hard creating

if you forget you left a marijuana product in your luggage what will happen if it s found at the airport the answer is changing and changing fast the majority of u s states have now legalized access to marijuana whether it s for recreational or medical use people ranging from young adults to great grandmothers now casually use low doses of cannabis to manage conditions like stress or insomnia and millions of americans now carry their doses as casually as car keys or a tube of lip balm for travelers that s where the trouble comes in when you re bringing packed bags through airport security it s easy to forget that you ve thrown those cbd tabs in your backpack or tucked a tin of edibles in your toiletries bag is the transportation security administration looking for pot anymore in a word no technically even though most states have legalized cannabis with restrictions marijuana remains federally illegal but the tsa is most concerned with that s initial the one that stands for security the agency announced as much in early 2019 before many states legalized cannabis on instagram let us be blunt tsa officers do not search for marijuana or other illegal drugs our screening procedures are focused on security and detecting potential threats but then came the caveat but in the event a substance appears to be marijuana or a cannabis infused product we re required by federal law to notify law enforcement this includes items that are used for medicinal purposes it s possible that the tsa is trying to send a message from between the lines if you don t store your cannabis derived substances in the original packaging that lists its contents as cannabis products the tsa agent won t know that s what you re carrying and there will be no obligation to report you the question is if you do get reported will the cops care it depends on the cops and how much time they want to waste drug trafficking busts are still a thing of course just ask the guy who stands accused of lugging 51 pounds of marijuana through nashville in september the one who allegedly stuffed his suitcase with 40 pounds of leaf from california and took it to south carolina or the new york man reportedly nabbed with with 2 25 pounds at an airport on the island of st thomas but major smuggling attempts are not what we re talking about we re talking about the three edibles you forgot to take out of your purse are the police going to haul you in for those while federal laws remain on the books and so the potential for prosecution remains we re simply not seeing many cases of individuals being charged for traveling domestically with amounts that might have simply slipped the traveler s mind law enforcement doesn t appear to want to waste the time police in albany new york told the times union newspaper that while they re occasionally summoned to checkpoints because cannabis items have been found they really don t care as long as the amount in question is less than 3 ounces as more of us are traveling with relatively small amounts of cannabis the chances of local authorities pursuing a conviction let alone winning one are not strong and get less likely by the month rather than waste resources most law enforcement authorities seem to have stepped back but do you know what really could still get you into grave trouble taking cannabis across international borders such as on a cruise ship most cruise vacations travel through at least three jurisdictions state where you board international waters and then the countries of the foreign ports the port inspectors may not care about your stash in the state where you board but once you bring your cannabis into those other jurisdictions you re risking a world of hurt if you re caught even if law enforcement doesn t find out cruise lines have their own strict bans including for medical marijuana and the crew might turn you in to an unfriendly government don t try bringing cannabis across international borders at any time there s no gray area it s illegal anytime you pick up your passport scour your luggage for forgotten treats that includes in canada even though cannabis is now legal there and may be allowed at your u s destination it remains forbidden to transport marijuana over the international border between the two countries in fact you could wind up in prison for as long as 14 years even if you re flying from a u s state where it s legal to a canadian province where it s also legal that makes no sense we know but until the united states sorts out the legality of cannabis on the federal level that s where things stand speaking of that the federal legal situation is showing strong signs of an imminent shift we won t get too far into the weeds here but various politicians have routinely proposed taking marijuana off the top of the drug enforcement administration s list of federally controlled substances even going as far as drafting legislation on several occasions those efforts usually went nowhere because of congressional obstruction bungling and old fashioned fuddy duddery during the 2020 election then vice presidential candidate kamala harris promised under a biden harris administration we will decriminalize the use of marijuana and automatically expunge all marijuana use convictions and incarcerations for drug use alone this month things began moving on november 10 three democratic senators sent a letter pressing biden on the matter and asking him to use his executive powers a controversial ask to be sure to pardon all nonviolent cannabis convictions that move would achieve decriminalization not full federal legalization but for purposes of traveling domestically between two states that permit cannabis without risking jail time the proposed measure would be enough to wipe concerns away there have been more promising signs on the congressional front where legal changes would be more definitive and lasting a house republican from south carolina nancy mace is drafting the states reform act which would at last federally decriminalize marijuana but not legalize it in agreement with biden s position federally tax its sale and allow americans to carry it across state lines without breaking the law at the same time two dozen state governors have urged congress to reform banking laws surrounding cannabis a change that would almost certainly accompany decriminalization the signs have been so optimistic this week that the stock value of cannabis businesses have shot upward now that there s a groundswell of support for decriminalization from both democrat and republican lawmakers bipartisan agreement is closer than it ever has been which makes sense because how ridiculous is it to have to worry about taking small amounts of cannabis between two states that have made it legal and how heinous is it that anyone would still be rotting behind bars for carrying marijuana years ago in a state where there are now fancy cannabis shops doing big business so if you do accidentally carry cannabis across state lines we have to tell you that you have just broken the law and broken it in a way that is keeping some 40 000 people in prison right now that figure by the way is more than a decade old and in some dispute mostly because the federal corrections system is pitifully bad at keeping track of numbers the truth is we don t know just how deep

day operations although public health restrictions continue to be lifted as vaccines are being rolled out in both canada and the united states our priority remains on ensuring the well being of our employees customers and business partners during fiscal 2021 we continued to experience some of the trends from past quarters those primarily relate to sustained demand for our residential high speed internet product due to customers spending more time at home for work online education and entertainment purposes and a reduction of certain expenses due to a more stable customer base fewer connections and disconnections and not being able to use all usual sales channels in these unusual circumstances certain marketing and advertising activities were delayed during fiscal 2021 in both countries we expect that the current remote working trend will continue after the covid 19 pandemic where more workers will work remotely than pre pandemic on a partial or full time basis this trend should benefit our various network expansion projects especially in underserved and unserved areas as for our radio operations they were negatively impacted by the pandemic due to certain segments of the retail industry reducing or cutting their advertising activities which resulted in radio advertising revenue being directly impacted by covid 19 related lockdown measures as public health restrictions continue to be lifted certain segments of the retail industry are gradually resuming their advertising activities in order to mitigate the impact on its operations cogeco media managed its operating expenses tightly as it did since the beginning of the pandemic while maintaining quality programming although we are pleased with the financial results for fiscal 2021 we remain cautious

constant currency and consolidated basis would otherwise increase between 5 and 15 covid 19 pandemic the covid 19 pandemic continues to impact our day to day operations although public health restrictions continue to be lifted as vaccines are being rolled out in both canada and the united states our priority remains on ensuring the well being of our employees customers and business partners during fiscal 2021 we continued to experience some of the trends from past quarters those primarily relate to sustained demand for our residential high speed internet product due to customers spending more time at home for work online education and entertainment purposes and a reduction of certain expenses due to a more stable customer base fewer connections and disconnections and not being able to use all usual sales channels in these unusual circumstances certain marketing and advertising activities were delayed during fiscal 2021 in both countries we expect that the current remote working trend will continue after the covid 19 pandemic where more workers will work remotely than pre pandemic on a partial or full time basis this trend should benefit our various network expansion projects especially in underserved and unserved areas although we are pleased with the financial results for fiscal 2021 we remain cautious in our management of this situation as

lightspeed tsx lspd nyse lspd stock has dipped 46 and is trading closer to its 52 week low is this weakness temporary or here to stay it takes years to build and grow a business and just a split second to ruin it one report from american short seller spruce point has vanished lightspeed commerce tsx lspd nyse lspd stock s one year growth the short seller report pointed at lightspeed s losses despite 16 years of operating in the business this is no hidden fact that lightspeed has been making losses but the reason why the stock surged all this while was because of its revenue and gross transaction volume gtv growth numbers why did lightspeed stock fall in september spruce point s report highlighted the high losses hence when lightspeed reported a net loss of 59 1 million in its second quarter results its stock dropped 31 in six days aggravating its 40 day stock performance to a 46 dip is this reaction overblown let s find out on november 2 lightspeed stock saw a major selloff that pushed it to the oversold category pomerantz law firm is investigating spruce point s allegations on behalf of investors even if they prove correct lightspeed is not a bad bargain at its current price of 85 the company is an omnichannel platform working its way to cater to the niche market of small and mid sized retailers and restaurants there is no doubt the company has a competitive platform and the market is fast growing it does face competition from shopify tsx shop nyse shop and amazon but there is a catch competition with shopify and amazon when i interviewed lightspeed ceo dax dasilva in february i d asked him if the company plans to target large enterprises in the future one large customer can bring significant cash flow for a lower customer acquisition cost at that time he responded by saying that lightspeed wants to bring all sme retailers and restaurants on a single platform and empower them with the technology large enterprises use the problems smes face are very different than what large enterprises face an efficient way to grow in this fragmented niche market is to acquire smaller competitors that cater to different geographies and verticals the company is in ongoing talks with other companies to which it finds a strategic fit dasilva stated that lightspeed wants to become the android of sme retailers and restaurants this approach needs a lot of marketing effort as no single customer accounts for a huge revenue chunk moreover the company faces a high churn rate if shopify and amazon tap these smes they might not be able to address the challenges a small retailer or restaurant faces as long as lightspeed maintains its niche and evolves its technology it may thrive hence lightspeed continued to post high losses while shopify reduced its losses over the last 15 years it was only during the pandemic that shopify turned profitable i don t say that spruce point is wrong but its allegations have not been proven right and even if the allegations are right and lightspeed did report inflated figures the stock has already been discounted for this despite spruce point s allegations lightspeed took its time to respond and stated the arguments to be misleading this shows the management s confidence in the company how to make money from lightspeed if you want to make money from the current volatility buy more lightspeed stock at the current price and hold it for the long term simultaneously short the stock for 80 if the stock falls below its current price of 84 6 you will benefit but if the allegations are proven wrong the stock will overcome the dip and surge past 115 representing a 36 upside

wandeler who we announced earlier this week will be departing for his efforts in strengthening the foundation of our commercial operations moving to slide 5 with the ongoing launch of monjuvi important concerning data for parsaclisib and the execution of multiple pivotal studies we are making significant progress on our vision to become a leader in hematology oncology on slide 6 now monjuvi net sales of 22 million for the third quarter increased by 22 compared to the previous quarter the growth was driven primarily by demand the greater proportion of second line patients are now treated with monjuvi which over time will increasingly result in a longer duration of therapy we also saw a broadening of the prescriber base and a high penetration in the community setting roughly 70 of orders are coming from the community setting while still maintaining a consistent foothold in the academic setting looking more closely at demand more than 850 accounts have ordered monjuvi since launch during the quarter we received orders from 500 accounts over 70 of these accounts were repeat orders which is an increase from the previous quarter enthusiasm for monjuvi by physicians continue to build this is supported by our three year data from our l mind trial which demonstrated a median overall survival of 33 5 months which means at four years 42 of patients were still alive prescriber enthusiasm is also supported by real world evidence they saw for the trastuzumab lenalidomide combination showing comparable or even longer overall survival compared to other systemic therapies which we look forward to sharing at ash as we approach the end of the first full year on the u s market we are encouraged with the future growth potential of monjuvi as we gain more traction from second line patients importantly we remain confident that monjuvi can become a backbone therapy and partner of choice in b cell malignancies we are also excited for monjuvi to expand its geographic footprint and provide broader access for patients last quarter we received conditional approvals in the eu and canada with our partner incyte and we are happy to have started to receive the first royalty payments from ex u s markets moving to slide 7 we are also making great progress advancing our clinical programs we are very excited about pelabresib which is currently being studied in myelofibrosis in a pivotal study manifest 2 if approved we believe this product has the potential to generate more than 1 billion in sales we are excited for the upcoming ash annual meeting where we will share new data with additional patients from the manifest phase ii trial the data confirm earlier data caters an increase our confidence in pembrolizumab and the probability of success for felzartamab our anti cd38 we recently announced encouraging early proof of concept data in autoimmune membranous nephropathy and we dosed the first patient in a new phase ii trial for felzartamab in iga nephropathy we believe our next generation ezh2 inhibitor cpi 0209 has exciting potential and optionality in certain solid and hematologic oncology indications in summary we are focused on executing our strategic priorities and we continue to make significant progress with that i will turn the call over to malte for an r d update malte please malte peters chief research and development officer thank you jean paul we have made great progress across our pipeline in recent months last week we highlighted our presence at ash conference in december we are proud to be able to share data from our two late stage assets monjuvi and pelabresib and two oral presentations as well as multiple posters for pelabresib we will share the latest data from the manifest phase ii trial including updated data for the primary endpoint spleen volume reduction 35 at week 24 for the combination arm 3 with ruxolitinib in front line myelofibrosis importantly this data confirms the previous data presented at ash 2020 giving us further confidence in pelabresib and specifically in the probability of success for our phase iii manifest 2 study we are also excited about some new and previously unpublished data on the disease modification potential of pelabresib and specifically how pelabresib differentiates from ruxolitinib for tafasitamab we will present data for the retrospective real world data study re mind2 data presented at the soho conference earlier this year showed that the tafasitamab and lenalidomide cohort was associated with longer overall survival versus a pool dataset of other systemic therapies br and r gemox our oral presentation at ash will now show all comparator rules and include pola br r2 and car t cell treatment and we look forward to sharing the data with you we are excited about pelabresib for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis and we believe it has first in class and best in class potential pelabresib impacts the four major hallmarks of myelofibrosis and we believe it has the potential to become the standard of care pelabresib has shown a strong response rate in combination with ruxolitinib achieving a spleen volume reduction in 67 of first line myelofibrosis patients we intensified our personal interactions with key opinion leaders in the field and received very positive feedback on data and the compound we are making great progress to ensure operational excellence for the execution of the ongoing phase iii study and we are seeing the results of the measures we have implemented we added additional cros improved the interaction with investigators and expanded the number of countries and sites with all activities in place we expect to report top line data from this study in the first half of 2024 now moving to monjuvi we have two pivotal phase iii studies ongoing expanding the clinical development to patients with front line dlbcl in patients with relapsed refractory indolent lymphoma for front line we are doing very well in terms of enrollment investigators are excited about this study and we are well underway adding additional sites in the united states to satisfy investigator and patient interest in late august monjuvi the brand name of tafasitamab outside of the u s was granted conditional marketing authorization by the european commission for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large b cell lymphoma who are not eligible for stem cell transplant two days earlier monjuvi received conditional approval in canada in both jurisdictions our partner incyte is responsible for the commercialization we are very excited that the european commission followed the fda in approving tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide based on compelling data from the l mind study supported by our real world data package we also made considerable progress with felzartamab in autoimmune membranous nephropathy or amn a disease with significant unmet medical needs the m place study evaluating felzartamab in patients with amn is fully enrolled and the antibody has shown proof of concept for this indication the data that we shared at kidney week recently demonstrated that felzartamab can rapidly and significantly reduce anti pla2r antibody titers in difficult to treat patients with anti pla2r positive membranous nephropathy while it s still early to appreciate the full effect on proteinuria we are encouraged to see the first patients with a drop in proteinuria already as early as six months after the initiation of treatment last month we also dosed the first patient in the phase ii ignaz trial in patients with iga nephropathy another autoimmune disease affecting the kidney dosing of the first patients with iga nephritis is an exciting milestone for morphosys physicians and also patients as we are broadening our development program for felzartamab we believe felzartamab could have great potential as a targeted therapy for patients with autoimmune renal diseases with limited treatment options as you can see we expect to deliver a steady flow of late stage clinical data over the next several years which have the potential to change treatment paradigms in several oncology and autoimmune indications we are very excited about this progress and the potential of our pipeline with that i ll now turn the call over to sung for a review of the financials sung lee chief financial officer thank you malte we re pleased to share our financial results for the third quarter of 2021 moving to slide 15 monjuvi sales in q3 2021 were eur18 6 million reflecting 22 growth quarter over quarter excluding the impact of fx as jean paul mentioned earlier we received additional regulatory approvals of monjuvi outside of the u s and recorded eur82 000 in royalty revenue from our partner incyte with monjuvi royalty revenue becoming a regular item in our p l going forward it s important to note that morphosys provides the commercial and clinical supply for ex u s utilization at an agreed upon rate the revenue from this supply is recorded in the licenses milestones and other category in our top line and the exact same amount as subsequently recorded in cost of sales yielding a zero gross margin on monjuvi supply sales moving to slide 16 total revenues for the third quarter of 2021 were eur41 2 million compared to eur22 million for the same period in 2020 total cost of sales was eur7 5 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to eur3 7 million for the third quarter of 2020 cost of sales specific to monjuvi u s product sales was eur3 6 million in the third quarter of 2021 turning to operating expenses r d expenses in the third quarter were eur64 4 million compared to eur34 2 million in the same period of 2020 the growth primarily reflects the inclusion of r d expenses from constellation since july 15 2021 and increased investment to support the advancement of our clinical stage programs selling expenses were slightly down at eur32 4 million in the third quarter compared to eur32 9 million in the third quarter of last year g a expenses in the third quarter were eur19 4 million compared to eur13 3 million for the third quarter of 2020 the increase was driven by the inclusion of constellations g a expenses as well as transaction related costs for the third quarter of 2021 we reported a consolidated net loss of eur112 8 million compared to a net loss of eur65 3 million in the third quarter of 2020 turning to the balance sheet we ended the third quarter of 2021 with cash and investments of eur1 13 billion compared to eur1 24 billion as of the end of 2020 in the third quarter of 2021 we recorded significant amounts in our balance sheet related to the constellation and royalty pharma transactions a high level overview of the accounting for these transactions is provided on slide 18 specific to the royalty pharma transaction we recorded a financial liability in the amount of eur1 2 billion for the future royalty and milestone payments owed to royalty pharma the measurement of the financial liability is initially at fair value and subsequently based on the effective interest method tremfya royalties and any potential royalties from gantenerumab and otilimab milestones for otilimab and future net sales of pelabresib and cpi 0209 will be recorded as revenue on the morphosys income statement it s important to note that there will be no cost of sales amount recorded in the morphosys income statement for the revenue share that is passed on to royalty pharma as we have completed some financially complex transactions with royalty pharma and incyte in the previous year we have included slides 23 and 24 to help the investment community better understand the ongoing impact of these transactions to our income statement this view excludes the tremfya royalties since that is being passed on to royalty pharma and excludes the effect of the 50 50 u s profit share with our partner incyte the result is a p l that connects net profit or loss more closely with cash generation or utilization turning to our guidance for 2021 on slide 19 we are reiterating our guidance that was updated in july this year following the close of the constellation and royalty pharma transactions we expect group revenues in the range of eur155 million to eur180 million as mentioned previously we will continue to record tremfya revenues and this is reflected in the guidance range moving to operating expenses we expect 2021 operating expenses to be in the range of eur435 million to eur465 million which included expenses for constellation as of july 15 2021 the range also includes onetime transaction related costs of eur36 million we anticipate r d expenses to comprise between 52 to 57 of operating expenses excluding the onetime transaction related costs with that we would like to open the call up for questions operator questions and answers operator the first question is coming from geoffrey porges at svb leerink your line is now open geoffrey porges svb leerink analyst thank you very much for taking the question and congratulations on the progress with the integration one for malte one for jean paul and maybe one for sung malte first on manifest 2 do you plan to have an interim look at that study and when might that occur and then jean paul now you betted in your combined company could you give us a sense of what assets are potentially partnerable and what assets or geographies are pretty much off limits that you re committed to retaining and then sung lastly do you expect consensus to track to what for the time being called your abc income statement or to ifrs i m just wondering how you see the various agencies and consolidators guiding at least setting things up in consensus thanks malte peters chief research and development officer so geoff let me start with the first question what i would like to say is that we are seeing good progress with where we are with manifest 2 in terms of enrollment i refer to the measures we are putting in place to accelerate operational excellence and improve on the operational excellence of that trial i would prefer not to make comments on specific statistical details as it can have the potential to impact the integrity of the trial and fda typically does not encourage sponsors to publicly comment on this so i would prefer not to give any details on what we re doing in terms of interim analysis jean paul kress chief executive officer and geoff thanks for the question this is jean paul regarding the potential of partnering for our assets it s pretty clear we ve been very clear on our focus on our late stage assets monjuvi we have the deal with incyte for felzartamab you might recall that we have the whole rights worldwide so we have a lot of optionality right now we really believe we should retain all the geographies and all the rights we re not contemplating partnership yet we think we have enough with the pivotal trials going on in the manifest 1 to bring and raise and create value until we decide later but so far we are not working on any partnership for this major asset for us major opportunity for the mid stage assets which are respectively felzartamab and cpi 0209 we think that following the data and the progress we are making we could potentially partner those assets and make sure that that would help us to keep the focus on the later stage assets and also generate some funding which will obviously help us keep our balance sheet in a great shape so we re working on that but at the same time we stay very determined on the progress on the data as malte mentioned for those late stage assets but we have a lot of optionality i should end by saying that there is interest on those assets by some strategics and we ll keep you posted sung lee chief financial officer great and geoff on your third question on the consensus it s my hopeful desire that the sell side will model us as demonstrated in the orange highlighted column the a minus b minus c column because this is more reflective of how morphosys will generate cash and utilize cash with respect to net income there are some complications that happen below the line and that is with two specific line items on the income segment that s finance expense and finance income and i think it would be very difficult for the sell side to try to predict how fx movements impact the liabilities on our balance sheet with regard to incyte and royalty pharma also there s interest rate charges to those liabilities and then of course there s items that are booked there as a result of the deviation from our lrp so that is something the sell side would not have any great visibility into so for all those reasons i hope people would start modeling to the orange highlighted column geoffrey porges svb leerink analyst great thanks sung jean paul kress chief executive officer thanks geoff operator the next question is coming from jason butler at jmp securities your line is open jason butler jmp securities analyst hi thanks for taking the question first one on manifest 2 malte can you just expand on your comments around improving the interactions with investigator and the operational excellence of the trial conduct i guess now that you re running the trial are there aspects of the design that you re considering amending or trial conduct in general and then second question on felzartamab clearly there s a lot of opportunities for the candidate can you just walk through in addition to following the biology how you re thinking about prioritizing indications and i guess broadly therapeutic areas thank you malte peters chief research and development officer sure jason thanks i will answer the question one first so for manifest 2 we have made significant changes in the conduct and in the operational excellence of the trial and i think i spoke about this at the last quarterly call and highlighted that already during the due diligence that we performed for the constellation assets we were aware of several areas that would benefit from our expertise at morphosys and certain improvement so we have really intensified our interaction with key opinion leaders we have expanded the number of countries we have significantly expanded the number of sites and we are already seeing turnaround in terms of how quickly enrollment functions we have also significantly improved our interaction and choice with clinical research organizations cro because there was clearly room for improvement and we have made some very i would say smart changes that also already shows benefit with respect to the design changes i had spoken last time about increasing the sample size to 400 that was a measure of caution increasing the probability of success to get a positive trial on both endpoints on the primary and the key secondary endpoint but beyond that we do not plan to conduct any further changes with respect to the design of the trial jean paul kress chief executive officer yes and i would i think there was a question on felzar as well i ll start and you can add on the science malte for felzartamab in theory because of the mode of action of an anti cd38 in autoimmune diseases which is targeting the long living plasma cells which should in theory give an advantage versus rituximab which targets earlier b cell stages we have the potential to address many autoimmune diseases the criteria for selection and that s what we applied for our current two investigational trials in nephrology are a mix of unmet need market size and competitive stage so if you take for instance if you would ask us why don t you do a study in myasthenia gravis well we could in theory we think it would work but this is a busy space and there are already a couple of agents being investigated but we don t exclude it so we started with our nephrology indications because there are few agents being explored especially in amn and it s a very high unmet need these patients end up with end stage renal disease and sometimes transplants which we think we can really help the unmet need here malte do you want to add anything on that malte peters chief research and development officer no i think you summarized it very well maybe one slight addition here on the amn patients as jean paul said we really focus on patients who have very limited treatment options and that means patients who have high autoantibody titers or patients who have progressed on previous immunosuppressive treatment so these patients are notoriously difficult to treat and we are seeing as you have seen in the poster maybe we have seen very encouraging results both on the level of autoantibody titers as well as on proteinuria levels so we consider this very positive and encouraging data and we are super happy that we could start a second trial in iga nephritis and then jean paul summarized it really well there are multiple other options in other autoimmune diseases where autoantibodies play a role but i think we have focused really on two of the most pressing and best proof of concept indications jean paul kress chief executive officer and i would maybe just thank you malte i will add on the pela comment to remind you that all eyes will be on us at ash with very important abstract we have three abstracts on pela there especially including one on the combination arm number 3 increasing our confidence for the phase iii trial which is very important so more to come pretty soon at ash jason butler jmp securities analyst thank you jean paul kress chief executive officer thanks operator the next question is coming from rosie turner at barclays your line is now open rosie turner barclays analyst hi thank you very much for taking my questions two curious ones firstly sorry another follow up regarding arm 3 and data at ash it s probably just me but i m kind of i am slightly confused as to kind of what data we ll get that s going to kind of help with the read across to manifest 2 just because i think the primary and secondary endpoints to manifest 2 are 24 week data and we ve obviously already seen admittedly very strong data from pelabresib in the manifest original trial as you ve shown in your slides for 24 weeks so presumably this is going to be kind of duration of same response data which is going to be kind of much longer term but maybe you can kind of help me understand that a bit better and then just secondly regarding selling expenses why were they down year on year and is this going to be a kind of sustained decrease or is this something that you expect to kind of come back in 2022 jean paul kress chief executive officer okay so thanks rosie malte will take the first question and sung the second one malte peters chief research and development officer yes so rosie what we are going to show at ash is a new data cut off which comes precisely one year after the last data cut off so that means a couple of things first of all we have roughly 23 or 24 more patients included in our analysis for the primary endpoint mean volume reduction every single patient of the 80 something patients have reached the 24 week time point so this is a fairly mature dataset which is likely not going to change much so it s it can be considered a fairly final data set and that s why it s so important and we spoke about this and what s so encouraging for us is that this data set confirmed the earlier data cutoff which was less mature so in summary we really have gained more confidence and we are more confident in terms of how manifest 2 which pan out in terms of probability of success so you see more patients all patients in arm 3 having reached the 24 week milestone and you see longer duration of response data so that s going to be the rest of the ash presentation sung lee chief financial officer and rosie on your question on selling expenses year over year they re just down slightly they re almost flat but we did go up sequentially and that s just a phasing phenomenon that s happening but i would say outside of that there s nothing extraordinary happening with the q3 selling expenses rosie turner barclays analyst right perfect thank you guys very much jean paul kress chief executive officer thank you operator your next question is comes from james gordon at jpmorgan your line is now open james gordon jpmorgan analyst hello james gordon from jpmorgan thanks for taking the questions a couple of questions please one was on monjuvi update so encouraging comments on repeat orders and second line patient use can you quantify at all can you give us a split of what percentage use is now coming from second line and do you have any sense of what percentage of patients who started getting the therapy commercially are still on therapy second question was on monjuvi competition so we recently had some ash abstracts come out and the cd3 cd20 is still looking pretty good in relapsed refractory dlbcl and they re going to be filed next year so any thoughts about how sort of the patient population those will be used in versus monjuvi are they going to be try to competing or is it different so third the ignaz study that you started looks encouraging but what s the path to market there so when is the earliest that might actually be able to come to market and would that be the same sort of patients of cd38 or different and then final one was it was really helpful at the back of the presentation if we call it abc reporting but are you now going to put that in the release every time when you report and will we get that at the time you report or will that only come out in the presentation going forward jean paul kress chief executive officer thank you james four questions so first thing first i ll give a high note on your monjuvi commercial questions at the beginning and joe will elaborate first of all we like the momentum we are building we continue to engage and educate hcps on our long term data as i mentioned in my prepared remarks there is growing enthusiasm on those data and we expect continuous growth in terms of the second line share yes we are actually leading the second line space and we have increasing numbers of patients in second line which is so important that we discussed several times for duration of treatment we have some patients actually over a year of treatment and that s great to see that we are really filling an unmet need again we are the only approved second line compound and we lead the space here and as i said several times there is a disconnect between real life and clinical trials we have shown our l mind trial that we have data beyond three years four years actually but in real life we are talking more in month because it s not a clinical trial the good news here is that we are working toward engaging and educating on those data and we see progress being made so we think that time will really play a big role here but joe has been spending a significant amount of time in the field and he will add some comments here vineet agrawal citi analyst yes james thank you for that question as jean paul mentioned i ve been spending quite a bit of time in the field whether it s large academic settings smaller community settings large community accounts right across the u s and the physicians continue to respond very favorably to that three year data that was presented at asco and other conferences and your question as it relates to repeat orders as we reported on slide 6 through q3 we ve had more than 850 accounts that have ordered since launch that continues to grow when we look at repeat orders in q3 we had greater than 500 accounts ordered with approximately 70 of those accounts representing repeat orders so we continue to make good progress and this is reflected by the enthusiasm of the hcps and increasing accounts and reorders and as jean paul mentioned as it relates to the percentage of second line as jean paul did allude to the fact that we do have leading share in second line as we continue to penetrate more and again this is based on the robustness of the data and our ability to get out and see physicians jean paul kress chief executive officer great so the other question your question was on third one ignaz trial malte do you want to take that malte peters chief research and development officer yes i think it s a little early to speak about details on the path to market i think we are at this moment we are super happy about where we are we are seeing good traction for both indications we want to take a moment really in the middle of the year to evaluate the data in both indications and then make a good decision of how we can move forward in terms of registration activities we have some thoughts already but we want to really look at the entirety of the data in both indications and then make an informed decision that s data driven of how we will get this approved so i think stay tuned a little bit we will update you of course as soon as we know more but at this point we are really focusing on corroborating the proof of concept data and also executing on our iga nephritis data sung lee chief financial officer okay and james with regard to your question on the continuation of this alternative income statement view yes the answer is we will absolutely continue to provide going forward i think it s essential to look at the business this way given the two collaborations or arrangements we have with incyte and royalty pharma i think the yellow column would be much more meaningful to anyone looking at morphosys in terms of timing of this given it s the first time we re sharing information like this i think that s still in discussion as to the timing and other areas or disclosures this might appear in but we thought initially this was a good venue putting it in the earnings slide deck but let us get back to you in terms of timing and whether this would appear in other disclosures thank you jean paul kress chief executive officer james i realized you had a question of monjuvi future competition and i don t want to skip that i mean we really as i said focusing on growing the momentum on our compound and our regimen on monjuvi and again we are the only ones in second line of course it s a competitive space but in some ways also we could leverage the fact that there will be more and more combinations based on monjuvi in the future we are as you know exploring a bispecific combination with xencor we re not excluding any other combinations it s part of our backbone strategy it s a matter of fact that we are talking to other companies for potential combinations with why not another bispecific but all the modalities as well and that s going to be very important because if we are at the core as a backbone that will mean in the future more prescriptions more sales so we know it s a competitive space but we know the strength of our regimen and our assets could be the base for more competitions in the for more backbone combinations in the future operator next question is coming from vineet agrawal at citi your line is now open vineet agrawal citi analyst yes hi can you hear me jean paul kress chief executive officer yes we can vineet agrawal citi analyst great thanks for taking my questions so most of them have been answered but just quickly first on pelabresib the question is more from a reimbursement perspective now given the proposed medicare reforms particularly regarding the design redesigning of the part d program where manufacturers will be on the hook for 20 of the costs in the catastrophic coverages phase and the plan sponsors now 60 versus 15 earlier now assuming this is implemented can you comment on any potential impact on the combination drug pelabresib plus jakafi i know this is all early stage but would love to know how do you think about this then one for sung is the eur82 000 royalty revenue on monjuvi is that a gross number or a net number i mean is it after factoring your pay aways to xencor and then if i can follow up on the selling expenses how should we think about this line going forward at least until before you get ready for pelabresib launch and so i just wanted to clarify on your phasing comments does that relate more to the general and administration expenses or even for the selling expenses jean paul kress chief executive officer okay thanks vineet i ll start by your pelabresib question first and foremost the more we speak to kols we ve been speaking to most if not all relevant kol and investigators in myelofibrosis over the last couple of months there is a very high unmet need in this disease remember that there is almost one standard of care only out there and only 50 of the patients are being addressed by the standard of care for several reasons one being toxicity or high anemic which compound on the anemic status of the patients to start with so there is a high unmet need and when we presented our data the manifest 1 phase ii data that are going to be disclosed at ash to a group of kols they all were very very impressed so the feedback is very strong and they are telling us that we are leading the space in terms of a potential new standard of care in combination i m saying all that because that s going to determine the value proposition of the regimen and the compound in combination potentially in monotherapy as well later so long story short we have the basis with the strength of our data to establish a very strong proposition toward the new standard of care and obviously a value based proposition which is the base for any reimbursement or pricing discussion in the future and we have time to do that remember that we have a couple of years to prepare for shaping the market and making sure that we address any concerns in potential concerns with the payers but again the unmet need is so high that there is room for us to play in this market in a very competitive way and then sung will address your finance questions sung lee chief financial officer yes you had a question on the royalty revenue from ex u s sales of monjuvi we booked those in our top line at gross and then the amount that we have to pay to xencor our partner is recorded in cost of sales i think you also had a question on phasing when i was addressing rosie s question it was specific to selling expenses and vineet i don t know if you broke up in the middle of the question vineet agrawal citi analyst no that s fine that s helpful and i just wanted to just follow up on the selling expenses how should we think about this line going forward at least until before you get ready for pelabresib launch sung lee chief financial officer yes well we ve spoken before there s some synergies here we have a field team here and there could be an 80 overlap in terms of myelofibrosis and dlbcl so of course we re going to realize synergies from our infrastructure today could something incremental be added in the future we re going to keep all options open at this point vineet agrawal citi analyst thank you operator we have no more further questions coming in so i will then back over to julia neugebauer to wrap up today s call julia neugebauer director corporate communications investor relations ladies and gentlemen this concludes today s conference call if any of you would like to follow up investor relations team from morphosys is available for the reminder of the day once again thank you for joining our call have a good day and

a month into the nation s largest work stoppage striking john deere workers are holding out for a better deal for the second time in a month 10 000 auto workers at john deere stunned both the company and the union leadership november 2 by rejecting a tentative agreement workers at the farm equipment manufacturer remain on strike company and union negotiators are set to meet today for the first time since the deal was voted down the vote was closer than on the first tentative agreement which was rejected by 90 percent of members this time 55 percent voted no it came as a shock to many analysts given the concessions workers had been able to wring out of deere during their first two weeks on strike the agreement included immediate 10 percent raises double what was in the first ta plus two more 5 percent raises and three 3 percent lump sum payments during the six year contract it killed the third tier deere had proposed preserving the option of a traditional pension for all new hires it restored a cost of living adjustment that workers had lost in the last contract and it boosted existing pensions and added retirement bonuses to sweeten the deal deere offered an 8 500 ratification bonus but for a majority of deere workers that wasn t enough they re pushing for a deal that includes retiree health insurance currently offered only to workers hired before 1997 shores up the incentive pay system fixes a broken grievance system and brings real wages up to pre 97 levels taking deere s record profits into account they feel like it s now or never if we don t get caught up now we ll never be in this position again said brad lake a member of uaw local 838 in waterloo iowa we will always be playing catch up because these contracts are six years not so final offer the company initially told the media it didn t plan to return to the bargaining table the agreement that we provided is frankly our best and final offer marc howze chief administrative officer for deere said november 3 in an interview with bloomberg in order for us to be competitive we have gone as far as we re gonna go yesterday afternoon however news broke that there was indeed a meeting scheduled between the uaw bargaining team and management for today wall street seems more concerned with a prolonged strike than with increases in labor costs which currently account for 10 percent of the company s expenses deere just wrapped up its most profitable year ever in its fiscal year 2021 which ended on october 31 the company was projected to make 5 7 to 5 9 billion in net income on november 24 the company will report its actual earnings and set projections for the new fiscal year some workers think deere will want to settle before that happens to protect investor confidence analysts at morgan stanley estimate each day of the strike is costing deere 58 million in revenue and 17 million in profits each month the strike drags on will cost the company an estimated 500 million in profits the question for workers is how long will the company hold out will deere attempt to starve out its workers until they re ready to accept the same deal or is the company bluffing the no vote a sense of confidence fueled the no vote if after 17 days on strike workers were able to get deere to double the raise boost the pension and eliminate the proposed third tier what could be won after a few more weeks with deere so far behind on production the planting season just around the corner and the company about to release its projected earnings for the next fiscal year eagerly anticipated by wall street investors for whom deere is a hot stock having more than doubled since the beginning of the pandemic the company is surely feeling the squeeze in a tight labor market deere may have trouble finding thousands of replacement workers while it s easier for strikers to find short term jobs with comparable wages if not benefits elsewhere to stay afloat while the strike continues one member told labor notes they d received 11 job offers in two weeks under these circumstances many workers expect a better agreement soon rather than a prolonged strike i don t think it ll take two more months before deere comes back to the table said lake before the announcement that the company and union meeting today this first quarter is always one of the busiest because they re getting ready for the next planting season they re getting ready for spring we re so far behind that they need to get caught up and get ready for the push deere has thus far held back from cutting off workers health insurance it had threatened to do so early in the strike as well as vowing to withhold the continuous improvement pay plan cipp bonus payments due to members but abruptly reversed course if deere followed through on its threat the uaw would use its 790 million strike fund to cover the costs of continuing health insurance coverage split vote unlike in the first ratification vote where every local voted no overwhelmingly the vote split on the second ta varied widely from local to local a majority in five of the nine locals in the master agreement voted yes some by as much as 65 percent the no vote was strongest in the two largest locals both in iowa waterloo local 838 which voted 71 percent no and dubuque local 94 which voted 63 percent no in waterloo the commitment to obtaining pre 97 benefits was a major factor behind the no vote we put our bodies into a meat grinder every day for eight to 12 hours a day and weekends said local 838 member james geiger we ve sacrificed our bodies and time with our families to build the best equipment in the world retirement healthcare is the least the company can do for us at harvester local 865 in east moline illinois which also rejected the contract by 55 percent the focus was more on broken grievance procedures and language around the cipp pronounced kip a complicated piece rate formula that determines bonuses workers under the plan each have a cipp fund into which bonuses are paid according to their departmental output when your department s performance exceeds the 115 percent target set by management funds go into your account when performance falls short of that metric known as a failing plan money comes out accounts are paid out at the end of each quarter for those lucky enough to work in certain departments cipp payouts can be in the thousands every quarter for many others though even if there are a few good weeks failing plans eat into the gains the process for challenging management s metrics or speed up mechanisms is opaque workers at harvester recently lost a multi million dollar arbitration over significant lost cipp payouts when one department s formula was revised they want to see language ensuring the same thing won t happen again support labor notes become a monthly donor give 10 a month or more and get our fight the boss build the union t shirt another big frustration is that grievances over cipp and other issues often take years to resolve many members voted no because of that factor alone saying they wanted a stronger faster grievance procedure you end up filing the same grievance week after week after week said kristin jordan of local 865 who has worked at deere for 19 years still that wasn t reason enough to vote no on the deal for jordan who felt it was a good offer citing improvements on retirement the ability to take vacation time and the cost of living adjustment she said that while changing the grievance procedure would be a step forward the union still needs to be more proactive about enforcing the contract i think our union could be a lot more aggressive said jordan they could be out on the floor more be proactive as far as the problems that we have the company does the things they do because we let them to some extent jordan also feels the union could be providing more information to members about the status of negotiations they should be sending out weekly updates even when you go to the hall there s no one to talk to they don t know anything psychologically you ve got to tell people what s going on wouldn t you want your membership to at least know what s happening on the picket line the strike has hampered operations for deere one salaried worker at the massive parts distribution center estimated output at less than 50 percent of normal a dealer told labor notes that many parts are being mislabeled or misdelivered trainings for new employees in the construction and forestry division of the company have been cancelled because those staff are diverted to strikebreaking duties for those salaried staff working the strike deere published an faq with this advice when in towns where uaw strikes are occurring avoid wearing jd apparel outside of work deere has moved away from sharing documents with salaried workers because many sympathetic salaried workers have been leaking documents to the media as the intercept s ken klippenstein learned in a leaked audio recording early in the strike locals organized mass pickets to slow salaried workers and management employees who were attempting to enter the plants members reported a three hour backup of traffic entering plants deere responded by requesting injunctions on october 20 a state judge issued an injunction against local 281 s picketing outside the iowa davenport works the injunction limited the number of picketers at each gate to four and banned the union from using burn barrels or any type of fuel or setting up chairs in response community members started organizing an emergency rally at the plant the injunction only banned pickets by uaw local 281 members and those acting in concert with them so the theory was supporters acting independently would not be subject to arrest some members privately cheered the rally on others worried it could jeopardize the strike as a compromise the rally was moved to the county courthouse where the judge had issued her ruling the local responded to the limitations on the number of pickets by sending the hundreds of workers on rotating picket duty out to do community service stocking food banks and working at habitat for humanity we wanted to make sure that we spread our harassment and intimidation around as much as possible so we decided to head down to humility homes and services wrote local 281 in a facebook post with images of members volunteering at a local homeless shelter a judge in ankeny iowa ruled against an injunction request by deere after a hearing meanwhile outside of deere s parts distribution center in milan illinois tragedy struck in the dark early hours of october 27 a local 79 picket shift was ending as a new one began richard rich a 15 year uaw member at deere was hit and killed as he crossed the busy milan parkway from the lot where picketers were instructed to park since the strike began members had been calling the city and the county asking them to replace several non functioning street lights to no avail the day after rich s death utility vehicles were spotted fixing the lights other locals sounded the alarm about similar hazards in waterloo in the wake of rich s death the company offered the use of a parking lot that would allow picketers to show up for picket duty without crossing a busy four lane highway on foot the next morning just 24 hours after rich had been struck and killed management reversed course forcing members to continue crossing the dangerous road we aren t volvo in the wake of ta 2 s defeat locals have maintained their round the clock picket lines but many members were concerned that the divided vote would undermine the unity that deere workers had built in the run up to and during the strike shannon olsson a local 838 member and parts picker at waterloo engine works decided the best way to preserve unity was through action olsson had voted no on the contract as did 71 percent of members of local 838 the largest deere local immediately after the vote he began organizing an informational picket at deere s corporate headquarters the glass palace in moline illinois not waiting for the official blessing from uaw leaders i am trying to turn people from pointing fingers at each other and take them fingers and point them back at the company olsson said members had rallied at the glass palace in mid september in the wake of the initial strike authorization vote there they held signs that said post retirement healthcare and we aren t volvo the uaw strike at volvo s virginia truck plant earlier this year is now on many members minds since it ended after the union brought a tentative agreement that had just been voted down to members for a second vote days later after the company re labeled it a last best and final offer olsson s hope was to bring those messages back to deere headquarters he printed flyers and went to picket lines across waterloo and asked members of other locals to do the same one hundred members joined the november 8 picket including members from each of the eight uaw locals at deere in iowa and illinois this isn t about that guy voted no this guy voted yes i feel the company attacked us said olsson the fact that they try to say this is our last offer no matter what that is a threat against these 10 000 workers and their families
barbados prime minister mia mottley wants richer countries to stop throwing garbage in her yard and then telling her to clean it up the garbage in this case is greenhouse gas emissions that fuel more extreme storms and hurricanes causing widespread destruction which can cost billions of dollars at the glasgow climate negotiations mottley is leading a push for richer countries to compensate poorer ones for the loss and damage caused by climate change their argument is this developed countries like the u s and those in the european union are responsible for most of the heat trapping emissions pumped into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution developing countries have lower emissions but are still bearing the brunt of a hotter climate through more severe heat waves floods and droughts it is unjust and it is immoral mottley said at the summit it is wrong to help compensate for that developing countries are asking richer ones to contribute to a loss and damage fund the money could offer payment for things that are irrevocably lost like lives or the extinction of species it could also help countries with the cost of rebuilding after storms replacing damaged crops or relocating entire communities at risk while loss and damage was discussed at the paris climate talks in 2015 progress has been slow industrialized countries have been reluctant to commit funding concerned it could lead to being legally liable for the impacts of climate change at this year s climate talks developing countries say it s a crucial part of climate justice providing finance for loss and damage is the very least that wealthy countries can and should do says raeed ali a climate activist from fiji and part of the loss and damage youth coalition but to do this they will have to acknowledge that they are responsible for this and i think that is something they are not willing to do few resources to recover from disasters for countries with where much of the population lives in poverty extreme weather can be a devastating blow individuals have little savings to rebuild while governments with few resources struggle to secure the millions of dollars needed to help communities recover in fiji we are at the forefront of the climate crisis ali says so every single person knows about climate change because it s a daily reality for us ali says while his grandparents only remember experiencing one category 5 cyclone in their lives he s already seen three and with rising sea levels threatening to make villages uninhabitable a handful in fiji have already been relocated and more than 40 are slated to be moved he said raeed ali raeed ali climate activist raeed ali from fiji seen here at cop26 is pushing wealthier countries to compensate for climate change losses like villages being relocated in his country due to rising seas some countries are being hit by back to back disasters in 2015 the caribbean island nation of dominica was hit by tropical storm erika causing more than 400 million in damage equal to 90 of the country s gross domestic product two years later hurricane maria slammed the island damaging 90 of the country s housing stock in the gambia in west africa where the majority of people in rural areas depend on agriculture crop failures can be catastrophic because the country s main river flows into the ocean rising sea levels are pushing saltwater farther and farther upriver making it harder to get freshwater it s really affecting the farming communities says isatou camara a climate negotiator for the gambia in west africa because of sea level rise we have saltwater intruding into our river which is affecting farm production especially rice farming which is usually done along the riverside developed countries have promised 100 billion per year in climate finance to help poorer nations reduce their emissions through things like renewable energy and sustainable agriculture they ve yet to fully deliver on that goal since each country determines its own contribution but many developing countries say that funding doesn t help with the climate impacts they re already experiencing which is why a separate loss and damage fund is needed in 2020 natural disasters caused 210 billion in damage worldwide assigning liability for climate change at the 2015 paris climate summit countries signed an agreement recognizing the need to address loss and damage but developed countries pushed to include language that specified it did not provide a basis for any liability they feared that admitting responsibility for their share of heat trapping pollution would expose them to paying developing nations every time a disaster hit it s always something developed countries have been very cautious about exactly because they don t want it to be a precedent for international courts maria antonia tigre a fellow at columbia university s sabin center for climate change law they really do want to avoid that responsibility because it can be endless recent advances in climate change science have upped the pressure while many climate studies examine long term trends researchers at the world weather attribution initiative study whether climate change has amplified an extreme weather event in the weeks or months after it hits hurricane harvey which released a deluge of rain on houston in 2017 was made 15 more intense by climate change they found this past summer the severe heat wave in the pacific northwest that caused dozens of deaths was virtually impossible without the added boost of human caused greenhouse gas emissions paul ellis afp via getty images afp via getty images protesters at the cop26 climate summit in glasgow scotland are rallying for new funding specifically for loss and damage in vulnerable countries the fact that we are able to pinpoint the climate fingerprint in specific things that hurt us today i think is a very important element in the current loss and damage conversation says maarten van aalst director of the red cross red crescent climate centre and a scientist with the world weather attribution initiative it has changed the conversation over the past years van aalst is quick to point out that assigning blame is a complex question while a storm s destruction is caused by its strength it also occurs if the buildings and homes aren t built to handle storms some communities aren t designed to endure the kinds of events that occurred even before the effects of climate change started to be felt still court cases are underway around the world to establish liability for climate change either seeking damages from governments or fossil fuel companies the uncertainty of science was one of the main arguments that was always used by states to avoid responsibility says tigre and that s a bridge that s now crossed no show of funding for loss and damage at the glasgow summit scotland announced a major milestone for addressing loss and damage needs it offered 2 million pounds in funding the first of its kind that is in the right direction said sonam wangdi of bhutan who chairs a group of the 46 poorer countries at the talks it s going to be very clear that there should be separate funds for loss and damage and it should not be mixed with all the other funds still other funding commitments haven t followed yet while the u s has formally recognized the need to address loss and damage a senior u s official says the country doesn t support creating a dedicated new fund instead of waiting for voluntary offers barbados prime minister mottley is proposing using 1 tax on sales revenues from fossil fuels which she estimates could raise 70 billion per year some are simply hoping that countries invest in the united nation s santiago network which was set up in 2019 to handle loss and damage issues but without enough staffing and funding it exists mainly symbolically today even if developed countries offer new support for a loss and damage fund they could still be held liable for the impacts of climate change at a press conference in glasgow the island nations of tuvalu and antigua and barbuda announced they re forming a new commission to enable small island countries to seek compensation through international courts copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

drive an increased reinsurance spend in 3q we see the increase in net ceded earned premium which impacts our core earnings ex hurricane down about 6 million year over year but we also see significantly reduced hurricane retention with approximately 30 million this year versus 125 million in 2020 as we go forward we can capture the increased reinsurance spend in our rate filings which will continue to earn through the portfolio in 2022 and 2023 and the gross exposure reduction our tiv and continuing personal lines is down year to date by 13 4 we expect about another 5 in q4 for an annual reduction near 20 we expect to continue exposure reduction through at least september 30 of next year 2022 and anticipate at least a 10 decline in tiv for personal lines next year on the front end we continue to drive compounding rate increases in nearly all states with third quarter record average of 13 8 across the entire personal lines renewal business portfolio over the last four quarters we have increased premiums on like for like renewal business of approximately 100 million with a record 31 7 million in 3q rate increases are expected to continue compounding into low to mid double digit range through at least the end of 2022 despite these rate increases our renewal retention excluding the non renewed accounts remains over 89 commercial lines continued to perform well with premium year to date up nearly 19 while pml exposure is down in american coastal we have a market leader in florida commercial residential with a dozen years of expertise underwriting that portfolio american coastal is positioned extremely well to grow profitably in one of the hardest florida market since 2006 our plan is to continue moving the book toward a 50 50 balance between commercial and personal lines over the next three years and for 2022 we plan to maintain our exposure levels in commercial lines approximately flat then we anticipate an average 15 to 20 rate increase and therefore a 15 to 20 premium increase profitable underwriting doesn t just include rate increases and exposure management it also includes risk selection we have implemented many underwriting changes including the development of mosaic a technologically advanced risk measurement algorithm that would be applied to new and renewal business to identify loss drivers we are supplementing these types of underwriting tools with increasing physical inspections and underwriting actions for unacceptable or increased risk levels differentiating between risk levels can drive a significant decrease in combined ratio as a key component of our long term formula for success as we drive toward becoming a top quartile underwriting company brad is going to comment on florida senate bill 76 which was effective july 1 of 21 but i ll offer that at least initially we ve seen a drop from a peak in june at 840 lawsuits to approximately 400 per month in september and october while it remains too early to quantify the impact on reserves and it does appear to have at least stopped the run away escalation the pre suite notification provisions enable a settlement in many cases and should be good for both insurers and insureds there is significant cost savings in reduced with reduction of litigated claims as statistics suggest in florida 91 of payments made in litigated claims were made to plaintiff and defense attorneys the current insurance market continues to be as firm as it has in years and the florida market is expected to remain hard for an extended period of time especially for personal lines and commercial residential for upc we continue working through our 2021 transition year again with third quarter results in line with expectations we expect to return to profitability in the fourth quarter of this year and continue to move toward a strong underwriting profit in 2022 and achieving targeted roes in 2023 with that i ll turn it over to brad martz bennett bradford martz president and chief financial officer thank you dan and hello this is brad martz president and cfo of upc insurance first happy better and state all our american heroes we thank you for your service i m pleased to review upc s financial results but encourage everyone to review our press release investor presentation and form 10 q for more information regarding the company s performance for the quarter ended september 30 2021 uihc reported a gaap net loss of 14 3 million or 0 33 a share compared to a loss of 74 1 million or 1 73 per share last year on page 5 of our investor presentation you will see a reconciliation of our core loss of 15 5 million or 0 36 a share to our underlying core earnings which excludes catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development which declined roughly 6 million or 0 14 a share year over year the decline in core earnings as dan mentioned was primarily driven by higher reinsurance costs associated with our stated objective of reducing leverage and protecting capital i m proud of the hard work and good progress our team is making on taking care of policyholders in the wake of new catastrophe losses this quarter and i believe our third quarter showed several positive signs that uihc is moving in the right direction gross premiums written for the quarter declined 43 3 million or approximately 12 due to continued intentional exposure reduction throughout our personal lines portfolio we are reducing risk exposure at a faster pace than the reduction of our top line which is a good thing and gross premiums earned were basically flat year over year at 353 million for the current quarter ceded earned premiums were 200 million a decrease of 34 9 million or 21 year over year due primarily to more business being ceded via quota share reinsurance programs whereby those sessions are partially offset by ceded losses and ceding commission income earned other items included in total revenue during the third quarter were 3 7 million of fee income which declined slightly due to fewer personal lines policies in force investment income of 3 5 million which declined about 2 5 million due to lower yields and dividend income from a smaller common stock portfolio investment gains of 5 5 million were down from approximately 25 million last year and unrealized losses from equities were 3 3 million versus 11 5 million a year ago upc s third quarter net loss and loss adjustment expense was 102 8 million a decrease of 115 9 million or 53 year over year hurricane ida was the most significant loss event in the quarter representing 18 million of the 37 million in net catastrophe losses incurred cat added over 24 points to our net loss and combined ratios which we obviously expect during hurricane season as a catastrophe focus property underwriter our underlying loss in lae was 63 8 million down 19 million or 23 year over year this produced an underlying net loss ratio of 41 6 which was down over two points from 43 9 in the third quarter last year the improvement can be attributed mainly to the good performance of our commercial property business page 6 of our investor presentation breaks down our results for the current quarter and year here you will see a stark contrast between our personal lines and our commercial lines businesses that we re working hard to correct page 7 of our investor presentation summarizes the five key underwriting improvement initiatives that the company has been working diligently on over the past year to improve our personal lines results we firmly believe that getting more rate being more selective shedding unprofitable risks cutting policy acquisition costs and being more disciplined with agency management is moving the company toward restoring underwriting profitability pages 8 through 11 of our investor presentation provides some evidence that our underwriting actions are having the intended result on our risk portfolio and should lead to better results over time page 12 of our investor presentation provides some more insight on our litigation experience in florida during the current period as you will see since peaking in june new lawsuits have declined significantly which is partially offset by an increase in claims following the new pre suite notice requirements of senate bill 76 it s still too early to say whether or not senate bill 76 will have a positive impact on our loss costs or loss reserves but the early indications of successful dispute resolution are encouraging upc s operating expenses were 76 3 million a decrease of 16 1 million or 17 year over year this decline was driven mainly by higher ceding commission income in the current quarter which is reflected in lower acquisition costs however our net expense ratio increased approximately 0 8 to 49 8 inclusive of ceded premiums on the balance sheet upc s assets totaled 3 3 billion including cash and investments of 1 160 billion the modified duration of our fixed income holdings decreased to 3 9 years with an average overall composite rating of a plus at september 30 reinsurance recoverable and loss reserves increased primarily as a result of our estimated ultimate direct and ceded losses for hurricane ida gaap equity attributable to uic stockholders declined approximately 19 from year end to 320 4 million with a book value per share of 7 42 and tangible book value per share of 5 28 unrestricted liquidity at the holding company was approximately 36 million at quarter end that concludes our prepared remarks and we re now happy to take any questions questions and answers operator thank you and ladies and gentlemen at this time we will conduct our question and answer session our first question comes from greg peters with raymond james please state your question greg peters raymond james analyst hey good afternoon i would like to focus first on your comment stand that your ultimate objective is to get to i think you said a 50 50 mix of personal lines and commercial lines is that is that right and did you put a time period on when you might get there r daniel peed chief executive officer and chairman yes that s been our plan for this year and we ve said three years approximately three years and we are moving in that right direction greg peters raymond james analyst with the retention it seems like i mean even though you sort of limited in how much you can non renew and it seems like your retention ratios are holding up pretty well despite the rate action i think you listed interboro this potential sale of that are there other operations you re looking at or states that you re considering more aggressive actions in r daniel peed chief executive officer and chairman our exposure management plan has several different levers that we can that we can use in the various different states and each state is somewhat different as you know also we sold the renewal right to the northeast states with a quota share treaty behind that on december 31 of last year so that s reduced our exposure significantly on the commercial side you can do a lot more stuff with deductibles and the specific buildings and distance to the coast and those type of exposure management so we re considering all of those and also for our planning for next year like i said we plan to be down by at least 10 more by september 30 of next year greg peters raymond james analyst and when i think of i notice you said that and you said or so i think one of the slides you expect to return to profitability next year i guess when i think about you ve done a great job with exposure management and you ve your reinsurance has protected you from these big name storms but in the first and second quarter of this year and then certainly last year you ve been affected by these the proverbial kitty cat storms how should we think about that for the first half of next year maybe maybe that s more wrapped up into a discussion of higher reinsurance renewals coming r daniel peed chief executive officer and chairman yes so we do have exposure in the first and second quarter to what we call or kitty cat that tended to be more so in the northeast which is one of the reasons that we have exited most of the northeast except for interboro in new york we actually and during this year we had a loss but we were protected pretty well by our aop cat tower we are planning at the moment to renew that tower although we may have to change things around a little bit down in the bottom layers because as you ve said that s been hit several times it s really too early to say how that reinsurance renewal is going we re working on it greg peters raymond james analyst yeah i figured as much i guess just the last question is you know we re watching just from a big picture perspective the slow moving train wreck that s happening in the autos auto insurance space too because of inflation reduced or increased frequency severity and some of the companies some of the specialty companies in that market have really laid down the gauntlet like we re not going to write new business until we get our pricing right and i guess when i think about at least on you re doing fine on the commercial side but on the personal line side it feels like there should be and i m sure you guys have looked at it why can t you just stop writing new business altogether or you ve cut your commission rates how can you effect the inflow of new business more dramatically near term until the profitability reset r daniel peed chief executive officer and chairman good question and i think we have our new business flow is down to about 5 of what it was a year ago a year and a half ago so we ve effectively almost shut off new business the accounts that do make it through are generally in very very nice accounts just everything you would think new roofs and good valuation and good rate and so we have almost we have almost stopped on new business in most of the categories and we have stopped on new business in some specific exposure zones that we don t like such as inland risks and stuff like that so we are very aware of that and almost all of our premium is coming out of our new business and on our renewal business greg peters raymond james analyst got it well the commercial business certainly had a great quarter and year and hopefully that will continue as we look to 22 and 23 r daniel peed chief executive officer and chairman yeah the commercial businesses as you know i ve been involved with that for a dozen years and it is especially attractive in a firming and the hard market and obviously we are coming into i mean we are in quite firm market i believe one of the hardest markets we re going to see in florida since 2006 so we expect that to go well through 22 and 23 greg peters raymond james analyst yeah makes sense thanks for the answers r daniel peed chief executive officer and chairman yeah thank you operator thank you our next question comes from bill dezellem with tieton capital please state your question bill dezellem tieton capital analyst thank you i have two questions first of all what led to the modest unfavorable 1 9 million pre tax or prior year reserve adjustment bennett bradford martz president and chief financial officer hi bill this is brad there were a few older catastrophe events that we saw some strange development on so we decided to do a little bit of strengthening but it was not systemic throughout the portfolio just a few events and remember we re getting dozens and dozens of these non hurricane events on top of hurricanes but all reserves for the name windstorms last year still look good in fact we had some redundancy there but that redundancy benefited the reinsurers so these are smaller events that were within our retention bill dezellem tieton capital analyst great thank you brad and then dan i think you mentioned that you re in process of renewing the reinsurance agreement would you talk to kind of your objective of the total cat loss exposure this season versus what you are wanting to accomplish for next season r daniel peed chief executive officer and chairman sure so we re kind of in a continual state of renewing our reinsurance treaties but so our aop cat treaty it comes up january 1 and we also renew part of our quota share as well as part of our cat excess but so from a general perspective on our view is to have i ll start with cat which is hurricane cat which is the easiest to describe at the moment and that s mainly june 1 treaty renewal so we aren t fully into that but at the moment we re very happy with our current retention we have 15 million per event and we but on top of that a 31 million aggregate for our pooled companies and in this case like with ida it hit not only louisiana but a continued run up through new york where we have a 3 million retention in our interboro insurance company in new york so that s where the 18 comes from in ida but obviously ida was a very significant event and we felt like that retention was good there and aop cat we are starting with the same framework that we had last year again we think that served us pretty well in uri and this is just something that we have to underwrite against we may also put in some type of aggregate protections or quarterly aggregate protections but that is yet to be determined so in general our cat retentions at the moment we expect to be pretty consistent with where we are right now this year in 21 bill dezellem tieton capital analyst thank you dan let me ask one more question from a point of ignorance if i may please that your maximum cat loss that you ve talked about this year would be 31 million and yet i think you ve had 37 million here would you would you talk about that gap please r daniel peed chief executive officer and chairman yeah and just to be careful with our words so we have a pooled group that s three of the company s american coastal family security and upc and that has 31 million aggregate but it applies to main storms and there is a 3 5 million so a very small storm may not get into that pool some of them that you never even really hear about but then also like i mentioned we had 3 million in interboro that was not part of that pool and then we also had a retention in journey insurance company which is not part of that pool so those miscellaneous ones and in some ways the smaller hurricanes can add up just as fast or faster than the large hurricanes which run into our protection bill dezellem tieton capital analyst that s very helpful and so as you think about that does that alter your thinking about next year s next year s retention or are you are you comfortable accepting that it sounds like roughly 3 million per smaller event in some of these non pooled companies r daniel peed chief executive officer and chairman i would say it s it s a matter of negotiation each year but the structure that we came up with we feel protects us from the severe loss and when you get into the very small and modest losses of 1 million or so that can be almost like another fire or another thing they get reported in accumulative basis but they impact our income statement more like a like a large fire does bill dezellem tieton capital analyst right thank you for taking the remedial question r daniel peed chief executive officer and chairman no problem operator thank you thank you your next question comes from greg peters of raymond james please state your question greg peters raymond james analyst hey guys i just had another follow up questions we re obviously on seeing some movement in the expense ratio maybe can you provide some guidance on how you think that might look next year either on a gross or net basis or both just to give us some parameters bennett bradford martz president and chief financial officer hi greg this is brad so on a net basis you re probably going to see it very comparable to this quarter it s unlikely we ll move away from quota share in the short term but depending on how much we see that that s going to obviously have a significant impact on the net expense ratio so our preference is always to point to the direct or the gross expense ratio which has been trending favorably and we might see a slight improvement of up to a point next year but again that s going to be dependent upon our overall premium volume greg peters raymond james analyst won t the agent cutting of commissions have a favorable effect on that as we think about next year bennett bradford martz president and chief financial officer yes that is part of why we have an outlook for a reduced expense ratio on a direct basis but again as depending on our capital needs and how much premium we are ceding reinsurance costs can be very distorted to that so on a net basis that may get washed out but on a direct basis absolutely greg peters raymond james analyst got it all right thanks for your answers operator thank you thank you there doesn t appear to be any additional questions at this time i will turn it back to management for closing remarks thank you r daniel peed chief executive officer and chairman okay thanks and with that we ll wrap up our call for today i want to thank our entire team because their tireless efforts and thanks to all of you joining our call today so thanks again operator duration 30 minutes call

even give berkshire hathaway a quick flyby and we ve got some zillow news to get to as well as always joining me this week it s my guy he wasn t here last week folks he s back this week it s mr matt frankel certified financial planner matt you re on location this week tell everybody where you are matt frankel i am in las vegas and normally i would try to find a sub but i was out last week and i can t leave jason for two weeks in a row i am in las vegas there s a couple of real estate focus conventions going on here this week i get to talk to you the ceo of exp realty one of the more interesting companies in the real estate space i m really excited for that today i m on location here in my las vegas hotel room glad my internet is holding on how are you doing jason jason moser doing all right keeping busy here with work and family everything was a nice weekend here in northern virginia just getting back to the grind here on a monday as everyone else is matt last week square reported their most recent quarterly results this is a company clearly we cover pretty frequently on the show here it s a company where a lot of our listeners own shares you and i both own shares still in the company it seemed like it was a good enough quarter now you look at the stock the stock was down almost seven percent for the week now obviously we don t invest on those types of short time horizons but it s worth noting at least the sentiment for what seems like a relatively decent quarter the market weren t really buying the stock hand over fist let s go through some of your takeaways here for the quarter because because all in all it does seem like the business continues to perform well but maybe there were some signs of some slowing growth that have some investors concerned what do you think matt frankel well speaking of the slowing growth the big headline is that bitcoin revenue slowed down considerably from the second quarter jason moser yeah matt frankel i ve said before that square s fascination with bitcoin is probably my least favorite part of the company as an investor not like an anti bitcoin thing it s going to be very volatile it s not going to be predictable revenue it s like how we were talking with trading revenue with investment banks it s just really tough to predict from one quarter to the next bitcoin revenue was down significantly they don t make a ton of money off that but when you re doing billions of dollars in bitcoin volume in a quarter it s significant profit there but elsewhere in the business it s somewhat pretty strong square s gross profit was up 39 percent year over year one of the rare quarters where the seller ecosystem actually outpaced the cash app because it was compared to the third quarter of last year when things were still pretty shutdown cash app revenue looking great they rolled out a few new products square capital the business lending platform remember they got their banking charter recently they said that s approaching pre pandemic levels which during the pandemic everybody was borrowing through ppp loans and things like that they didn t have a reason to use square capital as much and now we re seeing that trickle back they launched a few different initiatives that i m excited to see where they go they expanded to france during the quarter that s interesting they set the second biggest card payment market in europe pretty promising they opened up cash app to 13 17 year olds with parent permission jason moser with all that i wanted to get your take on that because as you and i both are parents your kids are a lot younger than mine matt frankel yours are in that age group aren t they jason moser they are i wish that square had done this two years ago that was one of the bigger challenges when we were getting our girls into a banking relationship there weren t really very many compelling options because venmo and cash app essentially you have to be of age to do it consequently what we did is we initially got them started through greenlight which is that team banking consortium i think jpmorgan owns a good chunk of that ultimately they have now transitioned into capital one as a great checking account for students you can sign up for it online great mobile app you get your card and no issues there now they re working with capital one and their direct deposits go there i have a hard time seeing them you know how those banking relationships are matt they re sticky once you get in there you start moving forward with that matt frankel sure i think this could be a brilliant move in like 10 years here s why the teenagers of today don t want wells fargo they don t want bank of america they want venmo and cash app because it s cool jason moser exactly matt frankel if you have to be 18 to sign up for venmo and only 13 with a parent permission to sign up for cash app you re landing these customers say 8 10 years before they get into their real earning years you re building this relationship with these customers like you said banking relationships can be very sticky people don t change banks often this could give them an edge with that demographic as they get into their earning years in the coming years i really i m a big fan of that i have a list of stuff square did this quarter that s among my favorites one of the less favorites is the afterpay acquisition that s coming up jason moser we talked about that before and i agree with you i think cash app opening itself up to that 13 year old and above demo i think it s a great move i just wish they did it sooner i d imagine we ll see venmo doing something like that and shorter as well but yeah in regard to the afterpay it feels like that acquisition you and i probably i think are coming at it from basically the same direction there it s not afterpay but it s the price that square paid for it matt frankel yeah i don t have a problem with them acquiring afterpay i have a problem with them paying 29 billion in stock to do it jason moser yeah matt frankel especially i think square s stock price a little bit down since the announcement so they re diluting shareholders i m not a big fan of that price to pay i think paypal did it better in that case they re doing bolt on acquisitions to build out their buy now pay later jason moser yeah matt frankel not just buying one that s already up and running because i don t think square needs it i don t think they need it 29 billion worth jason moser probably not matt frankel that s roughly 1 5 of their market cap is it worth 20 percent of what square s already built to add a buy now pay later service i have a tough time making that argument jason moser yeah i m with you matt frankel but overall the numbers look good this quarter i m still encouraged i am still a square shareholder i don t plan on selling any shares they re still growing their payment volume their core business which a lot of people think of as boring actually grew 37 percent year over year they re processing on an annualized basis about 160 billion of payments it seems like just a few months ago that they cracked that 100 billion barrier for the first time jason moser yeah i m glad you mentioned that even at what you said 125 billion or something like that obviously it sounds like a lot then you look at something like a paypal i was just looking through that call from last quarter with paypal because paypal earnings since then only they dropped the night after the market closes but paypal now they re going to push through 1 25 trillion through their networks this year that just gives you an idea i think square could deal with it matt frankel roughly 10 times the size of square in terms of payment volume still a lot of room to grow this is not a mature company by any means jason moser yes well i agree there i think it s a good take there i remain a happy shareholder of this pullback in the stock here it s not just square we ve seen paypal could open up some interesting opportunities for patient investors but we shall see matt you re a big real estate guy everybody knows that i know it our listeners know it you even know it man simon property group and tanger factory outlet centers both reported earnings last week i tell you we re talking about how square got a lukewarm reception from the market these two i ll tell you the market was picking up but they were putting down tanger shares up 27 percent last week simon up 16 percent for the week let s start with tanger as we reopen i think these are two companies that you really like talk a little bit about tanger and simon together however you want to break it down but what s stood out to you in these quarters why is the market so enthusiastic matt frankel you remember the retail isn t dead basket we did about a year ago jason moser i do matt frankel these were two companies that were in it i loaded up on these companies during the pandemic tanger was trading about a fourth of what it is now everyone thought these companies we re going to go bankrupt if only someone had been saying they were not only going to survive but thrive this is going to accelerate their adaptation to the new digital economy in a good way i was grading year to year when i was reading these earnings reports i got to tell you jason moser someone was out there beating the drum for these things and i can t remember his name matt frankel i m going to do an update on the retailers dead basket because the numbers they might give your a war on cash basket a run for their money right now both of these were fantastic tanger was the winner in my opinion simon s already had a really strong business they didn t even completely eliminate their dividend during the pandemic like all the other companies including tanger did jason moser yeah matt frankel the big story i ll start with simon because that ll be a quick one occupancy is the big story with both of these simon s occupancy went from 91 8 percent in the second quarter it increased by a full percentage point to 92 8 percent now even before the pandemic retailers were losing tenants the retail bankruptcy started way before covid ever hit jason moser oh yeah matt frankel for a retail reit to be trending in that other direction is something investors have been waiting for for five years now net operating income from simon s domestic properties is up 25 percent year over year they re really getting past the pandemic even after acquiring one of their rivals taubman centers earlier this year simon s has eight billion dollars of liquidity including over a billion dollars of cash left to continue to innovate its properties i m very optimistic about they ve raised their dividend in the past few quarters in a row their dividend is now 27 percent higher than it was this time last year they did a 10 percent sequential dividend increase after raising it in the third quarter already they raised their full year guidance their numbers were just excellent tanger was another story altogether they boosted their occupancy even better than simon tanger s properties are 94 3 percent full that s 150 basis points greater than simon which is the best mall reit in the world beating them in occupancy rent spreads were up 240 basis points meaning when they re releasing these properties they re getting more money now their tenants said here s the key statistic for tanger s earnings report tanger s tenant sales are at an all time high on a square footage basis thirteen percent higher than pre pandemic levels for a retail reit everyone s said no one is going to go to outlets anymore you can t social distance at outlet stores and they re all crowded and no one wants to do that yes they do jason moser well we ve talked about this a lot i mean you see on the headlines with companies that are keeping their offices closed but you can look around there are more that are opening up and you look all i mean anywhere you look with these nfl games were ready to get out and do stuff and travel we re seeing it i mean i m sure that you are seeing it there in vegas i mean people are letting their guard down and starting to go back out and that s certainly is reflecting in the traffic a lot of these stores are getting as well matt frankel i mean i think that per square foot sales number is at a record that has big implications for the future growth of the outlet industry tanger didn t want to open any more properties when occupancy was falling before the pandemic now that occupancy is rising and it s tenants are happy it has existing relationships with these tenants so it can go to the gap which is its biggest tenant and say your sales are killing it and all these properties you have stores at now we re about to open a new one in nashville which is where they re planning the next one are you in all their tenants are going to say yes it s a great catalyst for growth in the industry which the outlet industry is a very small part of retails though i m very excited for tanger it s about quadrupled since the pandemic lows and i don t plan on selling any of it jason moser well that s good to hear on both fronts there now over the weekend matt berkshire hathaway as they do released their earnings report and that s one that always just flies right under the radar because it s off hours so to speak there s not a whole heck of a lot of really going on with berkshire i mean not a whole lot has changed but you took a look at this report real quick what are one or two things you feel like investors need to know from this quarter for berkshire hathaway matt frankel berkshire always releases its earnings on a saturday which is by design they wanted to give the market time to digest it before it reacts berkshire s businesses are boring which is why nobody really pays that much attention to it they want to know what berkshire did in it s stock portfolio which is a different report three key takeaways operating earnings were up 18 percent for berkshire operating businesses year over year some nice recovery from the pandemic berkshire s cash stockpile is at an all time high now surprise surprise it seems like we said that every quarter jason moser yeah buffett before is really talked about how cash just isn t where you want to be now you see where his cash balances is just an interesting dissonant there matt frankel don t get me wrong i think having 149 billion of cash is a negative in times of inflation like we re starting to see right now that s losing five percent of its purchasing power a year right now i wish he would do something with it that s my biggest complaint about berkshire right now but he is buying back berkshire s own shares at the highest rates so far berkshire spent 7 6 billion on buybacks in the quarter a little over 20 billion so far this year but the third quarter buyback pace was a little greater than the first and second and the cash stockpile still went up so that tells you how much money berkshire s businesses really generate but i m happy to see them spending money on buybacks i hope they continue to do that especially if buffett continues to think i don t necessarily disagree that acquisitions are expensive right now i hope he continues to pull the trigger on some buybacks jason moser yeah well i mean he s buying stock he just its his own exactly you can t fault him for that i mean i feel like if anyone knows that business it s warren and charlie so it seems like much more of the same year and berkshire shareholders should be i would think at least encouraged feeling good about the big picture with this business matt let s wrap up this week with a conversation regarding something that happened early last week and it s something that i think took a lot of us by surprise last week zillow announced that it is getting out of the ibuying business now if this seemed a bit out of nowhere it kind of was even given the recent headline that they were pressing pause on the initiatives for the remainder of 2021 chris hill and i had talked about this on market foolery one day and it felt like well you understand they want to just get their feet set underneath and then make sure they understand what they re doing and the sign was if they kept that pause button held down for a considerable part of 2022 if they kept on stringing that alone then you start wondering do they really know what they re doing and then lo and behold they decided they re getting out of ibuying altogether it sounded like they re getting out of it basically because it s just not working out how they thought it would but i want to read what you tweeted and let s go from there because you have some strong feelings about this honestly i mean i understand where you re coming from but i m going to read your tweet here you said the recent news from zillow is one thing i ve ever been in a company i invested in terrible execution poor shareholder communications and a high level of incompetence planning to sell my shares very soon and walk away i don t think you re the only one that feels this way matt but let s dig into this a little bit i mean this happened so quickly particularly rich barton has been thinking about it for a while and now it sounds like it s gone matt frankel i m apparently not the only one who thinks this way because that was my most liked tweet of 2021 so far apparently i m not the only one who feels that way people don t really see my salty side very often jason moser i love it matt frankel it s an old buffett quote that i tweeted right after that lose money and i will be forgiving if you lose reputation and i will be ruthless i feel like they lost reputation here with me and that s really the problem i have a bunch of numbers to go through but let me tell you why i m disappointed it not just that they re getting out of ibuying if zillow is getting out of ibuying if it wasn t working out if they weren t doing a good job i m fine pulling the plug on a money losing business before things get really bad that s fine i even agree with what they said the business there it s not working out economically the way they thought it would they said it s alienating a lot of their customers who are disappointed in the offers they re getting things to that effect fine whatever i don t like the misleading communication number one you mentioned that they just said they were taking a pause on ibuying like a week before this came out that means one of two things either this was a knee jerk reaction to one bad quarter or they already had the decision made when that news came out one of those has to be true jason moser it feels to me like the latter it really does feel like they had that decision made i can t believe they went from hitting pause altogether in the stretch of like a week it just doesn t add up matt frankel right it s either incompetence of management or misleading communications it s one or the other on that note you have to take a step back and decide what zillow s core businesses is worth because they still have their premier agent business which is profitable but my problem with that zillow gets 227 million unique viewers a month they had 2 8 billion visits to their site in the third quarter they have the biggest collection of real estate data in the world in terms of residential real estate for them to take that translate it to an ibuying business and have worse economics than their rivals like opendoor and offerpad and redfin who have much better unit economics on the houses they re buying and selling in zillow for them not to be able to leverage that data to their advantage that s the biggest red flag to me because they weren t able to take the key advantages they have they ve been developing zestimate for over a decade now the way to algorithmically price homes for them not to be able to have that to the point where it does a better job than their rivals of pricing homes that is a big red flag for me i want to see what zillow s going to do from here they ended the quarter with 9 790 homes in inventory and another over 8 100 under contract to buy that s a lot of houses when they unloading to sell all those they re going to have roughly 5 billion of cash on their balance sheet i m wondering what they re going to do with that what i d like to see zillow do is become the kayak of ibuying where they partner with opendoor and offerpad and redfin you can go to zillow and get your get offers on your house from all of them and decide which one is best for you zillow makes some money off that doesn t take any of the risk the other three get some lead generation so it s a win win for everybody i would like to see them do something like that if zillow s management s listening please take that advice but i m disappointed ibuying was probably the big part of my thesis with zillow but it s really the way they went about it i never felt a company for walking away from a business that s not working if they do it the right way jason moser yeah i agree i think i tweeted something out to that extent too it s easy to pile on i respect the decision i respect them getting in there and saying hey you know what this is working let s go ahead and bag it s a good investing once in there you get an investment and it s not working if there s a thesis has changed or it s busted being able to admit you re wrong and then moving forward that s a great quality to have i do want to ask you a couple of things so number one don t you get the feeling that real estate agents are just relishing this news because this has traditionally been a very difficult market to disrupt traditionally it s been a very difficult market to disrupt it felt like zillow was helping blaze that trail leading the way to doing that i feel like real estate agents are looking at this and saying yeah you know what we told you it was harder than you thought and they re feeling ok about it matt frankel i m interviewing exp realty which is a brokerage business i m interviewing their ceo later today i can t wait to ask them about this news because he believes that traditional brokerage business that s growing rapidly i can t imagine he s disappointed that zillow s getting out of ibuying jason moser no i can t then the other thing because it feels like so much of this decision to get into ibuying in the first place hinged on their proprietary data and certainly centered a lot around that zestimate that you mentioned earlier they ve been developing for the better part of a decade it really feels like this is another strike against the zestimate they have to feel like maybe the big picture view is that folks look at the zestimate is really nothing more than cosmetic at this point and not so informative at least not informative enough to where you re making decisions based around it matt frankel yeah that s a good point they re essentially saying that zestimate is just for fun is what it sounds to me if you re saying you can t do a good job predicting houses their unit economics went from positive 1 200 basis points so 12 percent profit margin in the second quarter to a negative 5 7 percent profit margin in the fourth quarter that s a pretty bad job of predicting what you re going to be able to do with these houses you re saying that that volatility and your inability to predict houses or the region you re pulling the plug it really makes me think what have you been doing with the zestimate all this time because they specifically said they wanted to get to the point where the zestimate was the offer of the house when someone can just click the zestimate and that s the offer it s just a big about face they ve been hyping this up as the future of the company for a long time now jason moser well it sounds like the zestimate has become a bit more of a pestimate matt i m going to go ahead and leave the building now matt i think that s going to do it for us this week i really appreciate you taking the time to be here particularly preparing for all these means good luck with everything on the trip there i can t wait to hear all your takeaways hey thanks again for being here matt frankel awesome always fun to be here jason moser remember folks you can always reach us at mfindustryfocus or drop us an email in as always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against so don t buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear thanks as always to tim sparks for putting the show together for us for matt frankel i m jason moser thanks for listening and we ll see you next week

duty to update these statements as a reminder today s call is being recorded it is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host david fischel chairman and ceo of stereotaxis david fischel chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator and good morning everyone i m joined today by kim peery our chief financial officer we are proud of the progress made on multiple fronts in the third quarter we continue to demonstrate both year over year and sequential revenue growth driven by increased adoption of our robotic systems we initiated a strategic collaboration with microport ep that serves as the foundation for a new geographic pillar for our business in china we made meaningful progress on a wave of upcoming innovations and we did this while establishing new headquarters expanding our team and maintaining financial discipline i ll discuss each of these in a bit more detail system revenue in the third quarter reflects the successful installation and launch of the genesis and model s system at princess grace hospital in monaco as well as the shipment of the genesis and model s system to missouri baptist in st 10 stocks we like better than stereotaxis when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and stereotaxis wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of november 10 2021 louis both hospitals have begun performing procedures and we are pleased with the launches since our last call we received orders for two additional genesis systems one from a hospital establishing a new robotic electrophysiology program in europe and the second from a u s hospital that is upgrading its existing robotic lab we made progress on multiple other capital processes during the quarter and expect additional near term orders this activity supports our confidence in our previously provided guidance of approximately a doubling of robotic system revenue next year strength of our system revenue more than counteracted the impact of resurgence of covid and hospital staffing shortages had on recurring revenue by depressing procedure volumes we saw the brunt of this impact in august across several geographies with a return toward more normal activity through september and october we continue to view renewed adoption of robotic systems as the first significant wave of revenue growth in our strategic innovation plan to be followed in relatively rapid succession by additional waves we are aggressively advancing the subsequent waves of innovation and revenue growth our proprietary robotically navigated ablation catheter represents the second wave in our strategic innovation plan supply chain challenges that had delayed production were successfully addressed late in the summer and osypka has been ramping up manufacturing of the hundreds of catheters needed for submissions for european approval and a u s ide study we remain on track with the time lines provided on the last call expect to complete the manufacturing and testing early next year and believe that will allow for initial revenue contribution from the catheter in europe in 2022 and a potential u s regulatory approval in 2023 we continue to work energetically on a third wave of innovations that we are looking forward to showcase at an innovation day next month tentatively planned for monday december 13 as mentioned on previous calls these innovations not only expand our robotic technology to new clinical applications but also enhance our opportunity in ep and across interventional medicine we view these innovations as transformative for stereotaxis strategic and financial future and are very excited to share them with you geographically our strategy has been to deliver this revenue growth with a focus on the united states and europe as a small company pioneering transformative technology with very long growth runway geographic focus is prudent on our last call i mentioned that we were seeing particularly high customer and strategic interest in china and that china was thus emerging as a potential third geographic pillar for our business we were very pleased to enter into a strategic collaboration with microport ep as a realization of that promise microport is one of the largest and most successful medical device companies in china specifically in the cardiovascular field microport ep has built a particularly broad platform of ep products and a commercial team that is serving hundreds of customers across china our collaboration calls for the development of a robust ecosystem of products in china surrounding our robotic technology including integration of microport s mapping system with our robots and the development of robotically navigable catheters and regulatory approvals for genesis and future innovations since entering into the collaboration both teams have begun working together on development regulatory and commercial activity with an aim toward substantial long term revenue growth and value creation china is a unique region where many of the benefits of our robotic technology are pronounced and with the right ecosystem of products i believe we could see a very significant business there with the potential to sell tens of systems a year we expect this ecosystem of technologies catheters integrated mapping and robotics to come into focus in 2023 and to support a substantial commercial efforts then in a similar way to how we re building the foundations for long term growth in china we are investing in the foundations for substantial growth here the most tangible activities include the build out of our new headquarters and growth of our team stereotaxis new headquarters in downtown st louis is in the final stages of being built out and we plan to move our office there in the middle of december our new space will support improved collaboration an expanded team and several times greater manufacturing capacity it s a more modern office and was a financially thoughtful move already this year our team has expanded by 14 additional net hires this growth and enhancement of our team is across all parts of the business with a particular focus on r d manufacturing and service operations and clinical regulatory and quality these are the right areas to invest at this point in our growth cycle and we have a strategy for how to build a substantially larger commercial sales team as our new catheter and future innovations come to market we are glad that we have been able to make these investments in a financially prudent fashion we have maintained a relatively low cash utilization of about 2 million through the first nine months of this year and even with substantial cost to build out the new headquarters and advance several innovations we expect to end the year with greater than 40 million in cash kim will now provide some commentary on our financial results and then i will make a few financial comments as well before opening the call to q a kim peery chief financial officer thank you david and good morning everyone revenue for the third quarter of 2021 totaled 9 1 million a 5 increase from the prior year third quarter system revenue of 3 5 million includes the delivery of genesis rmn systems in both the u s and europe recurring revenue for the quarter was 5 3 million consistent with the prior year third quarter and pressured by a resurgence of covid that depressed procedure volumes across various geographies gross margin for the third quarter of 2021 was 52 of revenue with system gross margin of 5 and recurring revenue gross margin of 86 system gross margins reflect an allocation of overhead and other expenses and do not reflect a normalized expected margin from system revenue which we expect to be north of 30 for the full year operating expenses in the quarter of 9 4 million included 2 6 million in noncash stock compensation expense excluding stock compensation expense adjusted operating expenses were 6 8 million compared to 5 5 million in the prior year third quarter increased adjusted operating expenses continue to reflect r d project spending and measured investment in key business functions operating loss and net loss for the third quarter of 2021 were 4 6 million compared to 1 6 million in the previous year adjusted operating loss and adjusted net loss excluding noncash stock compensation expense were 2 million for the quarter both compared to the prior year quarter adjusted operating and net loss of 0 8 million negative free cash flow for the third quarter was 1 5 million compared to 0 2 million for the prior year third quarter negative free cash flow for the first nine months of 2021 totaled 1 9 million compared to 3 9 million during the same period the previous year at september 30 we had cash and cash equivalents of 42 8 million i will now hand the call back to david david fischel chairman and chief executive officer thank you kim consistent with our previous guidance we expect robotics system revenue for 2021 of approximately 11 million given the orders we announced on today s call and several additional orders we expect in the near term we continue to expect approximately a doubling of system revenue in 2022 compared to 2021 contributing to robust double digit overall revenue growth in 2022 we expect to start 2022 with 40 million in cash and we ll continue to balance increased investment in key value drivers with financial prudence our robust balance sheet allows us to continue these investments and reach profitability without the need for additional financings we look forward to now taking your questions operator can you please open the line to q a questions answers operator thank you our first question will come from josh jennings with cowen josh jennings cowen and company analyst good morning thanks for taking the questions i wanted to ask about the third wave of innovation but i know we re going to get more details on that in a couple of weeks so i ll hold off i wanted to just check in david on you ve had more orders you re expecting two more since the last call you re expecting more orders to be to come in in the relatively near term you have the microport partnership just wanted to see if you could provide an update on the sales funnel trends on both the replacement of greenfield channels and just whether your level of confidence in the doubling of system revenue next year has increased since the last earnings call then i have one follow up david fischel chairman and chief executive officer sure so it was difficult to hear you but i think i understood that you wanted to get more color on the pipeline of orders and our confidence in the doubling of system revenue next year is that correct josh jennings cowen and company analyst that s right thank you sorry for the bad transmission david fischel chairman and chief executive officer no worries so kind of our guidance for next year on system revenue as we described on the last call is predicated largely on a return to a more normalized level of replacement cycle system sales across our installed base and then kind of similar or perhaps some growth in the number of greenfield system sales next year and when we look at our installed base we see that many of the replacement cycle projects are seem to be advancing in a way where that would support our thesis and similarly as you saw we do continue to engage with and receive orders from greenfield hospitals where we haven t had a system before and so given that level of activity i would expect obviously given the commentary today several new orders before our next call and i think we re on track to meeting that expectation of approximately doubling next year josh jennings cowen and company analyst great and then i just wanted to follow up on the china microport partnership and i know it s very early it s only been i think less than two months since you announced that agreement but they have a large number of china hospital accounts already that for the electrophysiology business i was hoping you could just help us understand the selling process the sales cycle maybe the book to bill timing through that channel anything else you can offer just in terms of whether or not tender processes involved in some regions and just the book to bill timing with this microport distribution channel and then whether or not this partnership gives you even more confidence in that 2022 near doubling of system revenue or should we think that it will take time for this partnership to bear fruit in terms of generating new orders in china thanks a lot david david fischel chairman and chief executive officer sure so our china business has done that beautifully overall despite being a relatively small part of our installed base they use us very actively and we obviously had the two orders in system revenues this year from china and that team there has performed beautifully when we look at kind of our relationship with microport i would divide the activities into three main categories and one is innovation related activities how do we build out the right ecosystem of products in china surrounding our robotic technology the second is the regulatory activities which is part of also building out that ecosystem but how do we bring genesis to china how do we bring our new catheter to china how do we bring other future innovations and then the third is the commercial activity together and there obviously we benefit from the footprint and the team that microport has which is order of magnitude larger much larger than ours and when i think about kind of what we should expect over the coming few years i d say that in 2022 you won t yet have the ecosystem of products that allow you to really accelerate and push hard from a commercial perspective though i think that there are obviously leveraging the microport team i expect 2022 to be better than 2021 in china so that will contribute to our overall growth but i really think that what we re working hardest on is all of the innovation and regulatory activities that really create that nice kind of a nice proprietary tightly connected ecosystem of products in china and i think that that s what when that comes together which we think should be in 2023 that really allows you to now not just increase your efforts but really kind of make an exponential increase in the way you commercialize in the market so there s a range of commercial activities we can do now to prepare for that some of that will bear fruit just in the nearer term but in terms of really accelerating and reaching what we want to be the potential of this partnership i would look more toward the building of that product ecosystem and right now it seems like that s a 2023 event josh jennings cowen and company analyst great thanks so much operator our next question comes from adam maeder with piper sandler adam maeder piper sandler analyst hi david hi kim thanks for taking the question congrats on the progress i wanted to start with a question just on headcount and you talked about adding 14 new members to the team year to date was just curious if you could maybe elaborate on what those roles are or the functions are at stereotaxis are they part of the commercial organization and then one question i get from investors is when will you look to kind of go a little bit more on the offense or aggressive in terms of adding headcount to the sales team the company has obviously done a really nice job managing cash and operating with discipline but when can we see spending maybe accelerate some just to capitalize on the large opportunity in front of the company and then i have a follow up thanks david fischel chairman and chief executive officer sure hi adam good morning so the 14 incremental new hires it s obviously more than that but you also have turnover obviously in the normal business but the 14 incremental new hires which is about probably 10 plus between 10 and 15 of our employee base that kind of was primarily focused on it s across all aspects of the business including actually the sales team but it s primarily was focused on r d clinical regulatory quality and manufacturing field operations when we think about kind of what we re doing right now in the normal life cycle of a business those are the types of things that you do prior to a significant commercial effort and so those are areas where we ve had a lot of activity we could kind of see immediate near term use for incremental energy and effort there and so kind of we ve been kind of investing accordingly in that on the r d team particularly i think that kind of some of the things we expect to show you next month i think are transformative for our business and for our long term growth and so i think that kind of it will be very clear why we are increasing the r d team given that activity and i think that that innovation day might also help explain why we have not yet aggressively built up the commercial team obviously and we ve spoken in the past having our own proprietary ablation catheter and the increase in disposable revenue that that provides that allows for a very natural way to build the sales team in a significant fashion where you can kind of move more toward the model that most other companies have in this field where they have one sales rep per hospital that is really dedicated to a specific hospital and that is that will be a sustainable model when we have our own ablation catheter and so we have a plan in place for how to build the sales team as that comes to market and i think some of the other innovations as well will probably provide some color as to when it makes sense to incrementally invest in the sales team and then switch to kind of a more again kind of stepwise or exponential growth in the sales team so hopefully it will become clear and we can also discuss this more in december adam maeder piper sandler analyst ok understood appreciate the fulsome response david and then for the follow up scrn the medical meeting is coming up this weekend tomorrow i believe so i just wanted to take your pulse there how impactful can that meeting be is this a potential springboard for genesis are there presentations of note or planned stereotaxis commercial activities at that event that could maybe kind of help you build the momentum heading into the latter part of this year and 2022 thanks so much guys for taking the questions david fischel chairman and chief executive officer sure so i m actually doing today s call from the society for cardiac robotic navigation conference it starts formally tomorrow but there s already some activities today and this evening and the scrn is an independent physician led society but it s obviously was started and is run by physicians that are very passionate about what we re doing in our mission to improve cardiac care disease and it has blossomed into a beautiful organization over the last few years in the press release we shared earlier this week we kind of listed many of the more interesting or unique topics that are being discussed it s a powerhouse group of physicians that are speaking at the conference and so overall we re very excited by it it always allows us to engage with physicians that know us very well and there are some physicians also that aren t long term users of stereotaxis that joined and so i kind of view as one of the nicest events of the year in terms of engaging with the community and so i wouldn t i don t expect kind of that orders don t get signed at conferences like this if that was kind of what you were perhaps alluding to that s usually kind of more on the administrative side when we talk about near term late orders but i do think it s a very good opportunity to engage with the physician community and in reality also with the strategic community it was nice to see how many other companies scrn has recruited to support the conference and to join the conference and so there s a range of both the physician community and the general electrophysiology industry community here adam maeder piper sandler analyst great thanks for the color david operator our next question comes from frank takkinen with lake street capital markets frank takkinen lake street capital markets analyst david kim congrats on the quarter i wanted to start on the order side maybe just level set us on how many orders you have in hand right now that will be recognized in 2022 and then as you start to get more greenfield orders into the book can you just talk a little bit about expected time from order to install some of those might have in comparison to some of your greenfield sites david fischel chairman and chief executive officer frank good morning sure so the two orders that we announced today those will turn into revenue installations in 2022 and generally i would expect again that the time line between an order and kind of either a shipment or an installation is probably somewhere in the range of three to nine months in a typical situation frank takkinen lake street capital markets analyst ok that s helpful and then i wanted to ask on the disposable side of the business obviously a lot of impacts and different headwinds in the quarter maybe bring us a little bit deeper into what went on exactly in this quarter and then how you re kind of feeling about a sequential rebound into the last quarter of this year david fischel chairman and chief executive officer sure so as probably a kind of i ve heard on some of the other earnings calls of other medical device companies i think both the resurgence of covid in certain geographies relatively broadly actually both in the u s and europe and in some unique cases we heard about just personnel challenges and staffing challenges as we did see a decline in procedures particularly in august and then gradually kind of returning back to better and better activity in september and october and so overall it is still a pressured environment we ve not gotten back to levels pre covid that being said we re able to with the system revenue counteract those forces but that is still somewhat pressured external environment frank takkinen lake street capital markets analyst ok and then just last one for me maybe give us an update on utilization trends i know some of your earliest genesis users were tracking above the average of the overall installed base maybe talk to some of your mid year installs and how those are tracking from a utilization perspective david fischel chairman and chief executive officer i do not actually have the numbers closely available i know that when we do launch a new site kind of anecdotally i m thinking about one of the most recent ones we get flurry of near term activity we have one of those launching just a few weeks ago and so there is a general increase in activity again i wouldn t kind of we are still in the early phases of these launches and so it s hard for me to say that typically we would expect about 100 procedures per system per year it s hard for me to put kind of something down definitively that it should be much higher with genesis but our activity both at banner and helsinki where we ve obviously been installed now for over a year and then the initial activity which is really kind of weeks or a few months at kind of two of the more recent sites matches that frank takkinen lake street capital markets analyst ok that s helpful i ll stop there thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from javier fonseca with spartan capital javier fonseca spartan capital analyst thank you so much great being here congratulations on a solid quarter my question is regarding the progress with the proprietary magnetic ablation catheter and if management has any sort of expectation as far as when you expect a market entry for this device david fischel chairman and chief executive officer javier sure so as we kind of discussed in the prepared remarks osypka is still ramping up the manufacturing of the hundreds of catheters needed for the testing necessary for regulatory submissions that is advancing relatively well and we expect to finish all the manufacturing and the testing early in the year and that will support a ce mark submission and that will support an ide submission to the fda and so with that we would expect ce mark approval at some point in 2022 and a commercial launch in europe in 2022 and depending on how well we re able to enroll patients in an ide trial how quickly we re able to do it it could support also an approval in 2023 in the u s javier fonseca spartan capital analyst excellent and another quick follow up question i think this was touched on before but as far other than the microport strategic collaboration could you provide any insight as far as any specific channels or infrastructure that s currently in place to support double system revenue in 2022 david fischel chairman and chief executive officer sure we have a commercial team of about 40 people globally that s kind of they re focused from system sales to clinical adoption to training but that direct global sales team along with distributors that we have in various geographies like eastern europe like middle east like our relationship with microport that kind of commercial effort is what we expect to drive the increase in revenue next year and i think that s a reasonable again assumption given what that team has shown they re capable of doing this year the natural benefit you have with time and as you ve commercialized genesis more and more there is increased comfort in the community about how it s performing that is able to work well and that gives you a natural tailwind and then you also have the start to a replacement cycle that again we got very little benefit of that during this past year but a normalized level would incrementally add at least several more systems and i think that next year is going to look much more like a normalized year from a replacement cycle so i think those are the ways we think about the commercial effort and what s driving revenue growth next year and i d also kind of add similar to what adam s question was earlier is that we do have a plan for how to build the commercial team up in a much more robust way so when we think about the commercial team that s needed to sustain a multiyear significant double digit revenue growth there is a plan in place for that and i think you ll see as we launch the catheter and then also as you have better clarity on some of our future innovations why that staged approach to building the commercial team makes a lot of sense javier fonseca spartan capital analyst awesome thank you for the insight operator our next question comes from guy judkowski with pufferfish capital guy judkowski pufferfish capital analyst hi david how are you david fischel chairman and chief executive officer hey guy good morning guy judkowski pufferfish capital analyst good morning to you as well my question is regarding the magnetic vt randomized trial you guys i know you talked about it like maybe over a year ago and the last i had heard that it was gonna result in early or at least in 2022 i guess one do you have any update on that and also is it significant in any do you still feel that it has significance once it s released david fischel chairman and chief executive officer sure so let me talk about clinical data overall and i ll then touch upon specifically the magnetic vt trial so the overall the continued build out of the clinical data for robotics and ep is kind of i think one of our strong points and i was particularly pleased with the publication in pediatric patients that came out a few weeks ago i think again kind of consistently that type of data coming out on safety benefit and efficacy benefit across all sorts of arrhythmias across all sorts of patients and then particularly in the most kind of delicate sensitive patients like children like those with severe disease and that s what drives our entire business and our reason for existence is how good that clinical data is and so that s kind of overall been a very strong suite i think also on the last call i mentioned that there was a very interesting publication on silent cerebral events that should come out very soon so i hope that we ll have an ability to share that also in the near term and then the magnetic vt trial was actually a prospective randomized trial initiated by stereotaxis multiple centers looking to demonstrate superiority of robotics versus manual ablation in ischemic vt patients we ended up enrolling about 180 patients the last patient was enrolled i believe in february or march of last year there s a one year follow up period and so we should have the last follow up in the first quarter of 2023 with probably kind of the unblinding of the data a few months later and so i would expect by about mid 2023 to have data announced from that trial and again i think that kind of it s unlikely that any one data point immediately switches the field but i think the totality of the data is what really counts and the magnetic vt trial is obviously in terms of the structure of the trial it s as good as it gets it s a prospective randomized head to head trial it s kind of it s as good of a structure as one could ever ask for and again we think that given kind of everything that we know still being blinded we expect that we are going to show off well and so we re excited to have that as positive or material guy judkowski pufferfish capital analyst one follow up question david regarding the fellowship program i think originally it sounded from what i ve been able to ascertain you had about 18 graduates and it looked like the program now has like close to 50 and i m just curious like once they i guess one is that accurate and then two once these doctors do graduate what is happening how many do you track what percentage of them are actually able to use robots in their day to day or i m just kind of curious what happens to them once they graduate from the program david fischel chairman and chief executive officer sure so i don t have the exact numbers in front of me right now but there has been that gradual growth from i think we had about 10 graduates in the first year now we have about 20 or so fellows in any given year so about 40 fellows active right now across the u s and europe we actually just started an asia pacific version of the fellowship program as well so that s kind of adding a little bit on top of that and i d say that kind of there is kind of three ways that things evolve after the fellow graduates from the fellowship program and goes on into practice either they stay on at the site or we help and match making them with sites that have a robot and they can continue their procedural activity there and oftentimes again kind of their energy and youth and kind of the engagement they have with us in the fellowship program provides kind of a nice halo effect wherever they go second is they might go to a site that doesn t have a robot but then they remain engaged with us and we try to advance the capital process at that site and then in the third setting they go to a site that doesn t have the opportunity to do a capital build out of a lab and adoption of a robot in the near term and then what we try to do is to find ways to engage with them and to maintain a connection with the hope that when an opportunity presents itself in the future that we can kind of start a robotic program there and that they will be the clinical champion for that and so that s kind of the way i d categorize the graduates and i don t have again i apologize i don t have just the numbers in front of me but i probably guess that about somewhere about a third of the graduates probably end up at sites that have a robotic program and so they just continue their procedural activity after the fellowship guy judkowski pufferfish capital analyst is there like a number that you guys target i mean could you add 150 fellows i m just kind of i m trying to obviously that s somewhat of a leading indicator on the more fellowship people you would have the greater opportunities it would sound like but i m curious like is your capacity for 100 students to 150 is now your actual capacity is there any kind of plan there that you have david fischel chairman and chief executive officer yes so it s really driven by two things it s driven by how many robotic programs we have at university style hospitals where they have fellowship programs and it s driven by how well we do in attracting fellows in those programs to actually join our program and so what i d say is that given our installed base we re doing relatively well maybe we could have 50 more fellows if we really kind of were successful across the entire installed base but relatively we ve i d say the majority of fellows at hospitals that are active users of our robot and have fellowship programs are part of our program and so there s room for incremental improvement but we can t double or triple the fellowship program given our existing installed base as we sell new robots and have an expanding installed base that provides additional opportunities but we re doing relatively well in our existing base guy judkowski pufferfish capital analyst got you last question no one asked it so i ll ask it did you do continue to do these virtual test drives this quarter and do you have any kind of numbers that you could share with us david fischel chairman and chief executive officer yes we continue to do them and we ve seen more and more though as kind of things have open up or opened up close down opened up again we ve seen more and more site visits to actual hospital accounts and so hospitals like banner university and helsinki university monaco have all hosted physicians already and so we re continuing the telerobotic visits but i d say that we re kind of seeing more and more a shift toward in person visits guy judkowski pufferfish capital analyst thanks so much david operator i am showing no questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back over for closing remarks david fischel chairman and chief executive officer ok thank you for all your questions and for your continued support we look forward to speaking with you in a few in a month at stereotaxis innovation day thank you operator duration 41 minutes call participants david fischel
