australia s prime minister scott morrison a person who finds the truth a creature best beaten shunned and ignored is now moving into what looks like campaign mode at cop26 in glasgow he sold the world a climate change model that kept company with countries where fumes linger stubbornly and the fossil fuels burn bravely he made sure to do it the australian way ensuring that emission reduction targets would not so much be met as thoroughly beaten without the need for taxes he spoke of technology unproven and made assumptions unfounded prior to heading to glasgow morrison having done his bit of crossdressing on the climate change front was coy he refused to reveal the modelling that went into the fabulous predictions of net neutral utopia but on his return and after any sense of jet lag had been overcome he was happy to promote the scanty details of an enterprise verging on a hoax scott morrison is no supporter of great causes or freedom with such a poor track record on human rights issues scott morrison s talk of fighting for freedom is pure hypocrisy such efforts have become the stock and trade of a man habitually committed to the advertising message at best it is simple dissimulation at worse and here we find ourselves on difficult territory it is mendacious little wonder then that critics have been coming out of late with a sort of adamant righteousness against the australian prime minister s relationship with lying french president emmanuel macron has led the pack letting the world know that he did not think morrison was a liar he knew he was deceived about australia s intentions regarding the now rescinded au 90 billion submarine contract between the naval group and canberra macron singled out morrison in an impromptu interview with australian journalists at the g20 summit in rome the conduct of the australian government had been showing that this was not secret men s business former australian prime minister and victim of a palace coup that saw morrison come to power suggested much the same thing australia s incumbent claimed malcolm turnbull had a reputation for being habitually dishonest his conduct regarding the submarine deal with france had enhanced his reputation for being untrustworthy morrison s response has been all shrugs it s politics and in the political jungle the thin skinned will not outlast those with thick hides he said this gave him ample opportunity to lie about ever having told a lie have you ever told a lie in public life inquired melbourne radio host neil mitchell morrison s reply was deputy prime minister barnaby joyce as is often the case preferred to be honest about such instances of mendacity he said fairness and due process for a figure such as morrison demands an understanding about the role of lies in politics the recent fixation about his less than fond association with the truth is a reminder of the effort by the washington post to count the fibs of u s president donald trump in january 2021 its fact checker unit found no less than 30 573 false or misleading claims over the course of four years the washington post wrote can the frail truth survive in a thriving economy of lies devotees of the anti lie cult have taken a near fundamentalist line on the issue the great 16th century french essayist michel de montaigne regarded lying as an accursed vice we are men and we have relations with one another only by speech lying and obstinacy were those faults that needed correction in a child lying in politics is much a statement of fact as rising obesity levels in industrialised states as that keen student of totalitarianism hannah arendt pondered factual truth is ever at the mercy of the lie made in the name of political power she wrote in his unsurpassed essay politics and the english language george orwell also reminds us with severity that political language itself is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind such conduct is inherent between political leaders so much so that international relations theorist john mearsheimer found little literature in his field on it his own contribution was to come up with seven different types of lying including fear mongering inter state lies nationalist myths and strategic cover ups scott morrison has destroyed australia s humanity under prime minister scott morrison australia no longer displays compassion and humanity towards those in need ever contrarian mearsheimer sees instances of lying notably between the leaders of countries as less frequent than commonly assumed leaders are more likely to lie to their constituents than their counterparts which is hardly reassuring to fans of montaigne the standard of politics and public life is low and finding distinguished figures who fail to deceive their electorates is a task doomed political endeavour remains the featherbed of mendacious undertakings but to make such a fuss about being a liar in politics is exactly the sort of thing that is unlikely to affect morrison he is seemingly immune his armour a prophylactic against veracity dr binoy kampmark was a cambridge scholar and is an independent australia columnist and lecturer at rmit university you can follow dr kampmark on twitter bkampmark related articles
opinion for months indirect talks with iran to restore the disastrous 2015 nuclear agreement have been postponed with disasters on every front and tanking poll numbers president joe biden is desperate for a win and is looking to restart the negotiations iran has preferred to negotiate through european russian and chinese intermediaries and delayed the talks in june after their presidential election brought hardliner ebrahim raisi to power iran claims it needs to appoint new ministers and negotiators meanwhile iran moved up the path to a nuclear weapon producing more than 120 kg of 20 enriched uranium approaching the 170 kg required to make a bomb they are also increasing the stock of 60 enriched uranium using centrifuges to purify it some experts believe iran s breakout time the time needed to make one bomb s worth of highly enriched uranium has shrunk to about one month or at most a few months far shorter than the year or more contemplated by the jcpoa making a reset to the situation under the prior deal now technically impossible and simply nonsensical secretary of state antony blinken tried to address the upcoming showdown stating that the runway is getting shorter other officials say they will have to turn to other options without saying what these might be speaking before u n general assembly israel s prime minister naftali bennett was far more direct stating iran s nuclear program has hit a watershed moment and so has our tolerance mr biden vowed iran will never get a nuclear weapon on my watch president barack obama achieved that goal by kicking the can at the end of his administration with a deal with iran badly needed for his legacy mr biden reentering that deal is no solution u s credibility after the withdrawal from afghanistan is low where mr biden falsely claimed he would never abandon americans in afghanistan iran knows mr biden wants to disentangle america from the forever wars in the muslim world and will be reluctant to start a new war over its nukes israel makes little secret of its covert campaign to assassinate iran s nuclear scientists and sabotage their facilities israel s chief of staff aviv kochavi has stated that operations to destroy iranian capabilities will continue in various arenas and at any time and that israel would always have an effective and timely military response however it is unclear what such a response might be when mr trump withdrew from the jcpoa which he called the worst deal ever he thought imposing sanctions would exert maximum pressure on iran however these sanctions failed to make iran stop developing ballistic missiles end support for terrorists and give up its nuclear ambitions in iran s view the u s is seen as untrustworthy the economic benefits of the jcpoa were short lived and the sanctions did not bring about the collapse of the clerical regime as some had hoped firms linked to the islamic revolutionary guards corps irgc flourished at the same time the regime has shown that brutality can keep it in power as their security forces shot dead hundreds of people to put down nationwide protests over the economy china has become the biggest buyer of iran s oil and iran is being incorporated into china s worldwide belt and road initiative not to be outdone russia is talking of integrating iran into a eurasian trade group regionally iran has become more powerful helping to save bashar al assad s regime in syria and defending friends in iraq from the jihadists of the islamic state most recently in afghanistan with the u s out the taliban are now on friendly terms with iran mr biden first wanted an agreement that would be longer and stronger than the jcpoa while iran argued that the u s needed to make up for its reneging on the deal they also demanded lifting all trump era sanctions and guaranteeing that a new agreement would not be repudiated again at the same time mr biden s team claimed that any new deal would also cover iran s ballistic missiles and support to terrorists two key concepts that have now disappeared in the talks as iran said they were unacceptable mr blinken s call for a mutual return to compliance with the jcpoa is technically nonsense as iran has moved well past what the situation was in 2017 even if stocks of highly enriched uranium are shipped out of iran and centrifuges dismantled a new jcpoa can no longer restore the one year breakout time the sunset clauses mean iran can expand nuclear enrichment starting in 2025 mr biden would never submit any new agreement with iran for congressional approval though many in congress are trying to find ways to oblige his administration to do so mr biden seems to be hoping that some congressional opponents seeing the dangerous consequences of an unconstrained iran will support a deal israel has been forced to acquiesce to the talks while some israelis are expressing dismay about the lack of a plan b with serious military options one idea floated by israel is a death by a thousand cuts strategy conducting many small military and diplomatic actions short of overt air strikes on iran a revived jcpoa is bound to be repudiated by a future republican president one answer some of mr biden s opponents suggest is to tighten the economic noose on iran and prepare for the worst if the iranians do get close to getting nuclear weapons the biden white house needs to seriously consider what they will do when they get the call from the israelis mr biden has no real intention of applying pressure on iran recent contacts between the u s and israel reveal that as the iranian government moves closer to gaining a nuclear weapon there is no plan b other than restoring jpcoa mr biden is desperate for a win and may be tempted to simply reenter the old agreement knowing it s outdated and won t prevent iran from gaining a nuclear weapon in the future such a win might help to boost mr biden s disastrous poll numbers but it would be a massive step in the wrong direction for dealing with iran abraham wagner has served in several national security positions including the nsc staff under presidents nixon and ford he is the author of the recent book henry kissinger

commentary to anyone paying the slightest attention to the indictments so far resulting from john durham s investigation the still posted announcement of the 2018 pulitzer prize awards in national reporting to the staffs of the new york times and the washington post now reads like an entry from the babylon bee for deeply sourced relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nation s understanding of russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the trump campaign the president elect s transition team and his eventual administration at the link the pulitzer committee lists some of the deeply sourced relentlessly reported well it might have been the latter articles they had in mind some of the more amusing and bee like in retrospect are emails disclose trump son s glee at russian offer new york times and trump reveals secret intelligence to russians washington post more ominous less funny and more than slightly disreputable considering what we know now is white house received warning about flynn washington post at the link you can read the list of reporters who received the prize as well as the distinguished journalists who made the award so i will skip over that except to say the frequent unabashed appearances of many of these reporters on twitter are one of the reasons i left that site some time ago it nauseated me to see them on there pontificating there s only so much self deception you can tolerate consequently the question that most interests me is to what degree these people knew they were lying at the time were they merely victims of extreme trump derangement syndrome did they believe the ends in this instance justified the means they allowed themselves to be conduits for lies did they ask serious questions informants almost always anonymous were telling them things collecting those anonymous informants has been the stock and trade of establishment journalists since watergate the most obvious conclusion is that they wanted to believe the lies they were hearing so they didn t question them to be blunt they were lousy reporters and remain so because most of them all to my knowledge on the linked list haven t publicly acknowledged their faults one way perhaps the best way would be to return their pulitzers they haven t done so are we supposed to believe anything else they say in light of the igor danchenko indictment the washington post has at least corrected two stories the washington post on friday took the unusual step of correcting and removing large portions of two articles published in march 2017 and february 2019 that had identified a belarusian american businessman as a key source of the steele dossier a collection of largely unverified reports that claimed the russian government had compromising information about then candidate donald trump a washington post article reads largely unverified is putting it mildly the dossier has been revealed as a collection of scurrilous lies instigated by hillary clinton campaign associates a political dirty trick unprecedented in modern american history that borders on or crosses over into the treasonous nevertheless the post did something to acknowledge they had a problem they also published an opinion article by erik temple that excoriates multiple media outlets including msnbc host rachel maddow in light of the durham investigation the ny times has done little more than mutter in editorials this isn t new for the one time newspaper of record that so many still inexplicably believe without question and yet the ny times record especially regarding the pulitzers is particularly egregious despite multiple efforts including one by bill keller when he was executive editor of the paper 2003 2011 he was overruled by the owners the ny times hasn t returned the pulitzer won by their reporter you could call the father of fake news walter duranty duranty the paper s moscow correspondent in the 20s and 30s received the prize in 1932 for articles submitted by the ny times in his reporting duranty denied the existence of therefore excusing and encouraging the widespread ukrainian famine largely instigated by stalin the holodomor that left a million or more people starving to death estimates vary he also white washed stalin s behavior in general as duranty put it you have to break a few eggs to make an omelet duranty s photograph still appears on a wall at the ny times along with its many other pulitzer winners i bring him up to remind us all that journalistic reporting like elections has consequences fdr based on his reading of duranty recognized the soviet union and later acquiesced to stalin on eastern europe and his wasn t the only journalistic malfeasance perpetrated by the ny times books have been written about how they downplayed the actual holocaust and had a known nazi sympathizer as their berlin bureau chief and then there s herbert matthews reporting from the sierra maestra that characterized the soon to be dictator fidel castro as something resembling a secular saint if it seems as if i m picking on the ny times which i once wrote for it s because i am they have too much power too much monopolization of the information flow no paper should ever be considered the newspaper of record or anything close that s no way to run a democracy a democratic republic or a constitutional republic it more resembles a subtler version of pravda and izvestia of the soviet era and yet the networks and many other outlets including the supposedly all powerful social media still trot along behind the ny times like seven dwarfs behind snow white this is how trump s fake news happens but in all honesty i never liked the term fake news popular as it is it s too weak what we re surrounded by is more than fake it s the quite deliberate manipulation of information in order to brainwash the public and it has been quite successful alas nevertheless the 2018 pulitzer prizes now look ludicrous that s a good start in beginning to do away with this propaganda better would be for the reporters at the two papers to return their pulitzers as joseph welch would put it have you no shame better still would be putting an end to the pulitzers themselves addendum but while you re waiting for that to happen you can always relax in a fake news

article to print this article all you need is to be registered or login on mondaq com introduction the swiss financial market supervisory authority finma the federal department of finance fdf and the office of the attorney general of switzerland oag are the main authorities in charge of monitoring the swiss financial market and protecting its integrity as a regulatory authority finma is responsible for investigating the violation of supervisory law and taking appropriate measures to restore compliance with the law making use of coercive measures where necessary the term enforcement covers all investigations proceedings and measures taken by finma in connection with violations of supervisory law article 30ff of the swiss financial market supervision act finmasa in certain cases the behaviour of financial market participants may also fall within the scope of criminal offences finma has an obligation to report them to the competent prosecution authorities depending on the nature of and circumstances surrounding the criminal offences at stake the competence to prosecute lies either with the oag with a cantonal prosecution office or with the fdf for instance finma investigates insider trading and market manipulation cases and then coordinates its efforts with the oag for the prosecution of the criminal offences article 161 of the swiss criminal code and articles 142 143 of the financial market infrastructure act while according to article 50 finmasa violations of criminal provisions set out in such act or in other financial market acts which include for example the anti money laundering act fall within the competence of the fdf pursuant to article 29 finmasa persons and entities under the supervision of finma must provide finma with all information and documents that it requires to carry out its tasks withholding essential information or providing false information to finma may trigger criminal sanctions in practice the extensive duty to co operate set out in article 29 finmasa may conflict with the fundamental right not to incriminate oneself nemo tenetur se ipsum accusare afforded by the european convention on human rights in particular where the information provided to finma in the context of its supervision is subsequently made accessible and used as evidence by a criminal prosecution authority in parallel or subsequent criminal proceedings documents and information documents and information provided to finma by regulated persons or entities may be shared by finma with criminal prosecution authorities upon their request in the frame of mutual assistance proceedings and the exchange of information between authorities eg article 38 finmasa however the obligation for finma to provide mutual assistance to prosecution authorities is not absolute it assumes that there is no overriding public or private interest to maintain secrecy over the documents and information one can oppose for example that the disclosure may affect ongoing proceedings before finma or adversely affect its supervisory activity see also article 40 finmasa the swiss federal supreme court recently confirmed that a person who argues that it has been impacted by the transmission of documents in the context of mutual assistance between finma and a criminal prosecution authority has no standing to intervene in such administrative proceedings however it may assert its rights in the frame of the criminal proceedings in particular by challenging the admissibility of the sogathered evidence arguing that it was obtained in violation of its right not to incriminate itself article 141 crimpc decision 1b_268 2019 of 25 november 2019 moreover during the criminal investigation it may be requested that the documents obtained by the prosecution authorities from finma shall be placed under seals this means that pending the outcome of the unsealing proceedings before the competent court the prosecution authorities are prevented from reviewing and using relevant documents for the purpose of their investigation it should be emphasised that the right not to incriminate oneself is not intended to prevent documents containing secrets worthy of protection from coming to the attention of the criminal authorities but to prevent evidence obtained in violation of this principle from being used as a basis for accusation or conviction in a landmark ruling from may 2016 the swiss federal supreme court confirmed the unsealing of a memorandum that a bank prosecuted for money laundering in connection with the malaysian bribes that allegedly transited through its accounts had drafted for finma s supervisory purposes the bank requested the sealing of the memorandum which analysed the bank documents on which the money laundering accusations were based the supreme court upheld the unsealing request from the oag and concluded that the memorandum had been prepared based on a request for information from finma without the threat of criminal sanctions consequently the principle nemo tenetur se ipsum accusare did not prevent the seizure of the memorandum in possession of the bank bge 142 iv 207 in june 2020 the swiss federal supreme court similarly ruled that the prosecution authority could use in its money laundering investigation against a bank the report prepared for finma by the investigator it had mandated against such bank in connection with the very same set of complex facts even though the bank had applied for the sealing of the report based on the nemo tenetur principle and the protection of business secrecy in that case the bank claimed that it had to provide documents to finma under the threat of criminal sanctions but it failed to demonstrate that the report in question resulted from the documents provided under threat decision 1b_59 2020 of 19 june 2020 bank examination privilege confidentiality is a key ingredient in maintaining dialogue and communication between the regulator and the financial institutions indeed financial institutions are more likely to volunteer information to the regulator when they know that it is mindful of this sensitivity and the impact of potential disclosure however maintaining such confidentiality may be a true challenge in case the relevant facts give rise to parallel or subsequent criminal investigation by way of comparison the situation is different in the usa where federal courts have developed the so called bank examination privilege the purpose of such privilege is to enhance effective supervision and generally protects from disclosure the communication between financial institutions and regulators in essence the bank examination privilege covers all confidential supervisory information which encompasses regulator to bank and bank to regulator communications internal agency communications that are not shared with banks and internal bank communications that are not shared with regulators it is important to note that the privilege strikes a balance a court may override the privilege if the requesting party has a sufficiently strong interest known as good cause to obtain information that outweighs the interest in confidentiality however in many cases the bank examination privilege will preserve the confidentiality of the most sensitive aspects of the bank s examination records conclusion the tensions that arise between the duty to cooperate with a supervisory authority and the fundamental right not to incriminate oneself in the context of criminal proceedings pose a real problem in practice this situation needs to be properly addressed and resolved by the swiss lawmaker by the inclusion of a supervisory privilege in the law it seems that this is the only sustainable solution to avoid supervisory proceedings being opportunistically leveraged on and used by criminal prosecution authorities to secure incriminating evidence the content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances

australia s prime minister scott morrison a person who finds the truth a creature best beaten shunned and ignored is now moving into what looks like campaign mode at cop26 in glasgow he sold the world a climate change model that kept company with countries where fumes linger stubbornly and the fossil fuels burn bravely he made sure to do it the australian way ensuring that emission reduction targets would not so much be met as thoroughly beaten without the need for taxes he spoke of technology unproven and made assumptions unfounded prior to heading to glasgow morrison having done his bit of crossdressing on the climate change front was coy he refused to reveal the modelling that went into the fabulous predictions of net neutral utopia but on his return and after any sense of jet lag had been overcome he was happy to promote the scanty details of an enterprise verging on a hoax scott morrison is no supporter of great causes or freedom with such a poor track record on human rights issues scott morrison s talk of fighting for freedom is pure hypocrisy such efforts have become the stock and trade of a man habitually committed to the advertising message at best it is simple dissimulation at worse and here we find ourselves on difficult territory it is mendacious little wonder then that critics have been coming out of late with a sort of adamant righteousness against the australian prime minister s relationship with lying french president emmanuel macron has led the pack letting the world know that he did not think morrison was a liar he knew he was deceived about australia s intentions regarding the now rescinded au 90 billion submarine contract between the naval group and canberra macron singled out morrison in an impromptu interview with australian journalists at the g20 summit in rome the conduct of the australian government had been showing that this was not secret men s business former australian prime minister and victim of a palace coup that saw morrison come to power suggested much the same thing australia s incumbent claimed malcolm turnbull had a reputation for being habitually dishonest his conduct regarding the submarine deal with france had enhanced his reputation for being untrustworthy morrison s response has been all shrugs it s politics and in the political jungle the thin skinned will not outlast those with thick hides he said this gave him ample opportunity to lie about ever having told a lie have you ever told a lie in public life inquired melbourne radio host neil mitchell morrison s reply was deputy prime minister barnaby joyce as is often the case preferred to be honest about such instances of mendacity he said fairness and due process for a figure such as morrison demands an understanding about the role of lies in politics the recent fixation about his less than fond association with the truth is a reminder of the effort by the washington post to count the fibs of u s president donald trump in january 2021 its fact checker unit found no less than 30 573 false or misleading claims over the course of four years the washington post wrote can the frail truth survive in a thriving economy of lies devotees of the anti lie cult have taken a near fundamentalist line on the issue the great 16th century french essayist michel de montaigne regarded lying as an accursed vice we are men and we have relations with one another only by speech lying and obstinacy were those faults that needed correction in a child lying in politics is much a statement of fact as rising obesity levels in industrialised states as that keen student of totalitarianism hannah arendt pondered factual truth is ever at the mercy of the lie made in the name of political power she wrote in his unsurpassed essay politics and the english language george orwell also reminds us with severity that political language itself is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind such conduct is inherent between political leaders so much so that international relations theorist john mearsheimer found little literature in his field on it his own contribution was to come up with seven different types of lying including fear mongering inter state lies nationalist myths and strategic cover ups scott morrison has destroyed australia s humanity under prime minister scott morrison australia no longer displays compassion and humanity towards those in need ever contrarian mearsheimer sees instances of lying notably between the leaders of countries as less frequent than commonly assumed leaders are more likely to lie to their constituents than their counterparts which is hardly reassuring to fans of montaigne the standard of politics and public life is low and finding distinguished figures who fail to deceive their electorates is a task doomed political endeavour remains the featherbed of mendacious undertakings but to make such a fuss about being a liar in politics is exactly the sort of thing that is unlikely to affect morrison he is seemingly immune his armour a prophylactic against veracity dr binoy kampmark was

t he home of the scottish mortgage investment trust smit is an office a mile down the road from edinburgh castle aside from that it has little to do with scotland and nothing at all to do with mortgages this makes it an apt flagship for baillie gifford a british investment manager that prides itself on its unconventionality baillie gifford s 12 trusts and 33 funds together oversee assets worth 346bn 466bn that puts it well below the heavyweight category for global fund managers whose members hold assets in the trillions yet the firm and its star vehicle hold wider lessons for other fund managers listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element among the previous jobs of members of baillie gifford s investment team are ballerina soldier doctor and concert pianist one partner likes to tell potential clients that the firm s equity fund managers aren t much interested in the stockmarket another describes her enthusiasm for a founder who is so focused on developing a breakthrough medical technology that he refuses point blank to discuss what his company could be worth but even those investors who insist on vulgar bean counting will be impressed by the fact that 1 000 invested in the smit ten years ago would be worth around 11 600 today by contrast the same amount invested in the ftse all world index of stocks would be worth around 3 800 the author of this success is james anderson who took the helm of the smit 21 years ago and will step aside in april the iconoclastic mr anderson participates in a long tradition of fund managers pouring scorn on their own industry conventional asset management he said in his latest annual review of the smit is irretrievably broken markets are in thrall to the near pornographic allure of news such as earnings announcements and macroeconomic headlines mr anderson has used his tenure to mould the smit to his liking when he took over the trust then 91 years old held shares in hundreds of listed firms around half of which were british today it invests in a few dozen public and private companies based all over the world the meteoric rise in the trust s share price was fuelled by backing companies like alibaba amazon tencent and tesla early and then hanging on to them along the way the amount of money baillie gifford oversaw grew by a factor of ten the challenges the firm faces as mr anderson leaves are emblematic of those that confront the wider industry the first is how to prevent a run of extraordinary performance from reverting to the mean and becoming pedestrian under mr anderson the smit broadened its horizons to include new geographies and unlisted companies it also placed bets on firms with unconventional business models and maverick founders that put other investors off that does not mean that the route to future success lies in finding more privately owned companies run by irascible bosses the smit s outperformance in fact came from its early recognition of trends such as the growing dominance of internet retailers and the increasing importance of electric vehicles there is no set of rules for arriving at such insights and so no guarantee of repeating them the second challenge is to square the opportunities for returns with investors demands for social responsibility the firm s health innovation strategy attempts to do this by betting on a hoped for megatrend that will deliver both profits and improved medical care but elsewhere in baillie gifford s portfolio is bgi genomics a shenzhen based firm it is part of a group that had two subsidiaries placed on an american watch list last year for conducting genetic analyses used to further the repression of uyghurs and other muslim minorities in xinjiang according to the commerce department even the most quixotic aim can end up in a moral quagmire the final challenge is timeless and universal succession in announcing mr anderson s departure baillie gifford emphasised continuity his replacement tom slater has managed the smit jointly with him since 2015 the philosophy and investment process of the trust it insists will not change yet it is losing the leadership of an uncommonly prescient investor mr anderson himself has written of his waning enthusiasm for amazon as jeff bezos its founder and ceo stepped aside and it ceased to feel like day one at the company having been founded in 1908 baillie gifford s first era passed a long time ago as another day draws to a close replicating its successes will be a tall order for more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to money talks our weekly newsletter an early version of this article was published online on november 16th 2021

over the course of 2020 the food and drug administration fda released numerous guidance documents covering diverse areas and aimed at increasing the availability of various medical products to prevent treat and diagnose covid 19 some of our prior blog posts on those pandemic response activities implemented by fda can be found here and here in all of those actions fda made clear that the agency s enforcement discretion policy was temporary or that an emergency use authorization eua was being granted pursuant to statutory criteria that include a requirement that there be no adequate approved and available alternative to the product which by definition renders the eua temporary as well accordingly several euas granted to diagnostic tests therapeutic products and medical devices have been revoked based on a determination that all of the criteria necessary to support emergency authorization under the statute can no longer be met and although the public health emergency is not over even as 2021 comes to a close fda has kept its promise to continually reassess circumstances and needs on the ground in the united states and to modify policies and emergency authorizations as necessary notably early on in the pandemic fda s center for drug evaluation and research cder developed and released multiple enforcement discretion policies intended to increase the supply of alcohol based hand sanitizer by in part allowing non traditional manufacturers to produce these non prescription drug products in mid october 2021 the agency announced via a statement by the cder director that the supply of alcohol based hand sanitizer from traditional suppliers has increased and now most consumers and healthcare personnel are no longer having difficulty obtaining these products therefore it s appropriate to withdraw the temporary guidances and are providing manufacturers time to adjust their business plans related to production of these products under these temporary policies a federal register notice announcing the withdrawal of those enforcement discretion policies was also published and is available for review here it s also worth pointing out that cder has identified a significant amount of serious adulteration in alcohol based hand sanitizers over the past year or so leading to many recalls and import alerts which almost certainly contributed to this regulatory decision as well unless they plan to stay in the business and to comply with all applicable drug manufacturing requirements starting next year however non traditional hand sanitizer producers do not need to wind down these operations as quickly as they most likely created and ramped them up back in 2020 fda s recent announcement offers not only advance notice to those entities but also a post withdrawal grace period during which any remaining stocks of hand sanitizer produced under the temporary policies can be sold and distributed in particular all of the temporary covid 19 guidance documents pertaining to hand sanitizers are withdrawn effective december 31 2021 companies manufacturing alcohol based hand sanitizers under the temporary policies must cease production of such products by that date any entities wishing to continue producing hand sanitizer after december 31 2021 must do so in compliance with the tentative final monograph for topical antiseptics and with good manufacturing practice regulations for human drugs among other potentially applicable requirements any entities ceasing their production of hand sanitizer in parallel with fda s withdrawal of the temporary policies must deregister and delist to ensure that public records are updated to show that those products are no longer in commerce hand sanitizers produced before december 31 2021 under the temporary guidances must no longer be sold by their manufacturers to wholesalers or retailers by march 31 2022 any remaining undistributed hand sanitizers produced under the temporary policies after march 31 2022 should be destroyed according to a q a for industry also published by the agency concurrently with the announcement and federal register notice on the other hand retailers who may have purchased and are in possession of hand sanitizers manufactured under the temporary policies do not have to take any actions after the march 31 2022 sell through deadline for manufacturers the q a for industry states clearly that even after april 1 2022 retailers may continue to sell their stock of hand sanitizer produced under the guidances withdrawing the guidances is not a requirement to recall all hand sanitizer produced under the temporary policies another example of fda s shifting focus towards ending some of the regulatory flexibilities it put into place to respond to the emerging public health emergency last year is the recent posting of upcoming guidance document priorities for the center for devices and radiological health cdrh two of the draft guidance documents cdrh plans to issue over the next 12 months are entitled transition plan for medical devices that fall within enforcement policies issued during the covid 19 public health emergency and transition plan for medical devices issued emergency use authorizations euas during the covid 19 public health emergency recent public remarks by policymakers within cdrh have indicated that some of the agency s goals are to ensure that these transitions are orderly transparent and risk based entities who took advantage of any fda enforcement discretion policies or have been granted emergency authorizations to market medical countermeasures in response to the covid 19 pandemic should make note of these announcements by the agency and take appropriate steps to prepare for the end of those temporary pathways this is especially the case for entities that are interested in continuing to market those products when the relevant temporary policy or authorization is no longer available to them

reading time 4 minutes the u s postal service paid its top executives more in bonuses and perks last year than at any other point in the past decade adding up to 370 622 in extra income for postmaster general louis dejoy and four of his deputies according to a center for public integrity review of the agency s financial disclosures dejoy got a 75 000 performance bonus in fiscal year 2021 plus about 56 000 in other perks which includes membership in two airline clubs retirement counseling and financial planning services according to the postal service s newly released 10 k report dejoy earned this in addition to his 305 681 salary the highest ever paid for the top job at usps in all dejoy earned about as much as president joe biden the typical annual pay for all postal service employees meanwhile was 51 150 in 2020 the most recent year surveyed by the bureau of labor statistics the starting salary for an assistant city mail carrier was about 38 000 at the beginning of the year the generous executive compensation comes as the usps continues to lose billions of dollars annually and as mail carriers complain about rampant wage theft at the quasi public agency a public integrity investigation published in august found that hundreds of managers at post offices across the country have been caught illegally changing mail carriers time cards to show them working fewer hours than they did resulting in lost pay while many of those cases predated dejoy s tenure managers continue to change time cards to avoid paying overtime to hourly workers according to dozens of mail carriers and private arbitration documents shared with public integrity despite delivering a record number of packages to homes and businesses since the start of the pandemic the postal service lost 4 9 billion in income and recorded 206 billion in debt and unfunded liabilities in fiscal year 2021 seems like the last person who should be the recipient of an unprecedented salary increase and bonus said noah bookbinder president of the government watchdog group citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington bookbinder pointed out that dejoy intentionally slowed mail delivery as millions of americans tried to vote by mail during the 2020 presidential election and resisted calls to sell stock he owned in a company that does business with the postal service posing a conflict of interest in october the postal service began slowing delivery of letters bills and other first class mail from three to five days in large swaths of the country part of dejoy s plan to save the agency money the agency has long wrestled with massive amounts of debt because federal law requires the postal service to prepay retiree pension and healthcare benefits the three major labor unions representing postal workers the national association of letter carriers the national rural letter carriers association and the american postal workers union did not respond to public integrity s request for comment on the 2021 bonuses the postal service s board of governors which hired dejoy sets his salary and determines his annual performance award which is directly tied to meeting goals related to finances employee performance and customer service according to the report the financial disclosure did not provide details about what those goals were for 2021 but dejoy s bonus was more than double the 30 650 targeted for the year the agency implied in its filing that this was unusual given our financial condition any individual award is unlikely to exceed the target amount the disclosure stated the postal service s board of governors which plays a similar role as a corporate board of directors did not explain why dejoy received a higher than expected award this year john barger a member of the board who leads its compensation committee did not respond to questions from public integrity david partenheimer a spokesperson for usps said the executive bonuses reflect agency wide improvements in line with dejoy s delivering for america plan in just the last fiscal year alone the postal service saw a 5 3 increase in revenue a smaller net loss and the strongest service performance for all mail categories since the previous year partenheimer wrote in a statement shared with public integrity partenheimer said that executive bonuses in 2021 were not the highest in 10 years though he did not provide evidence to support his claim which contradicts the numbers in the agency s publicly reported financial disclosures unlike federal cabinet officials whose pay was capped at 221 400 this year the board of governors at usps can set the postmaster general s salary up to 20 higher than the vice president s in 2021 that added up to 306 960 roughly what dejoy earned the board also has broad discretion in rewarding the postmaster general with perks and performance bonuses that s because congress passed a law in 2006 the postal accountability and enhancement act that raised the salary cap for usps executives to provide them with more generous pay the thinking was that because the postal service operates like a business it needs to better align executive pay with the private sector to attract top talent and just like many large private sector companies the postal service has been cited repeatedly by the u s department of labor for illegally underpaying its workers with few consequences the postal service was cited by the federal government 1 150 times for underpaying letter carriers and other employees between 2005 and 2020 according to labor department data obtained through a freedom of information act request partenheimer the usps spokesperson said that the agency does not condone supervisors making improper changes to employee time cards and that it takes such allegations seriously this position is messaged to the postal workforce directly from postal leaders he wrote in a statement mail carriers who have struggled to get paid for all their work said it has impacted their mental health and their work relationships some have had to dip into their retirement savings we are depending on that money nancy campos a mail carrier in midland texas told public integrity earlier this year when you get shorted it s the most horrible feeling related help support this work

sacramento calif ap amazon has agreed to pay 500 000 and be monitored by california officials to ensure it properly notifies its workers about new coronavirus cases the state s attorney general said monday amazon employs about 150 000 people in california most of them at 100 fulfillment centers sprawling warehouses where orders are packed and shipped the agreement which must be approved by a judge requires the seattle based retailer to notify its workers within a day of new coronavirus cases in their workplaces amazon also agreed to notify local health agencies of new virus cases within 48 hours and will stop issuing notices that attorney general rob bonta said do not adequately tell employees about amazon s safety and disinfection plan and workers rights related to the pandemic as the company enjoyed booming and historic sales with its stock price doubling amazon failed to adequately notify warehouse workers and local health agencies of covid 19 case numbers often leaving them unable to effectively track the spread of the virus bonta told reporters in san francisco at an event held across the street from an amazon warehouse bonta added this left many workers understandably terrified and powerless to make informed decisions to protect themselves and to protect their loved ones like getting tested for the virus staying home or quarantining if they ve been notified of a potential workplace exposure amazon spokesperson barbara agrait said in a statement that the company was glad to have this resolved and to see that the ag found no substantive issues with the safety measures in our buildings former california attorney general xavier becerra who now heads the u s health and human services department last december asked a judge to order amazon to comply with subpoenas his office issued nearly four months earlier as part of its investigation into how the company was protecting workers from the coronavirus at its facilities the state attorney general s office first disclosed the investigation in a filing in july 2020 in a san francisco superior court case in which an employee accused the company of not doing enough to safeguard staff it s not known how many amazon employees have been exposed to the virus at work during the course of the pandemic in october 2020 the company disclosed that nearly 20 000 of its front line u s workers had tested positive or were presumed infected the judgment which applies only in california requires the company to allow monitoring of its virus notifications by the attorney general s office for a year and to pay the half million dollar settlement that will go to enforce the state s consumer protection laws bonta said the judgment is the first of its kind in the u s and complies with a state right to know law that took effect last year the stipulation was signed on friday and both the complaint and stipulation were filed with the sacramento county superior court on monday california s law sponsored by assembly majority leader eloise gómez reyes requires employers to notify employees of coronavirus cases at their worksites tell the workers about pandemic related protections benefits disinfection and safety plans and to report cases to local health agencies gómez reyes said her bill was enacted after lawmakers heard stories of workers who were not told that they might have been exposed many california companies have since complied she said but some found loopholes and they either failed or chose not to comply with the law the agreement came as amazon gears up for the holiday crush of package deliveries bonta said compliance is particularly important as the state prepares for another possible winter surge in cases as people gather indoors for the holidays california this year also became the first state to prohibit big retailers from firing warehouse workers for missing quotas that interfere with bathroom and rest breaks that law prohibits amazon and similar companies from disciplining workers for following health and safety laws and allows employees to sue to suspend unsafe quotas or reverse retaliation
hurricane researcher follows storm fury in the lab and on the land forrest masters was an undergraduate student at uf when a professor asked if he wanted to join a research team that chased tropical cyclones he has been tracking storms ever since in addition to conducting research during major storms forrest oversees uf s advanced wind tunnel a national science foundation user facility that attracts researchers from across the u s in this episode of from florida forrest shares what it is like to conduct research in the middle of a hurricane and how his research may help contribute to more resilient communities produced by nicci brown brooke adams emily cardinali and james l sullivan original music by daniel townsend a doctoral candidate in music composition in the college of the arts transcript nicci brown welcome to from florida where you ll learn how minds are connecting great ideas are colliding and groundbreaking innovation is becoming a reality because of the university of florida i m your host nicci brown and today we re talking about hurricanes experts predicted that the 2021 atlantic hurricane season would have above average tropical storm activity and they were right there have been 20 named storms as of october 11 and we won t reach the end of what is the typical hurricane season until november 30 this season storms have resulted in damages collectively estimated at more than 70 billion on top of that dozens of people have lost their lives during flood surges and other storm related events this loss of life and property makes the work of the university of florida researcher who is joining us today incredibly vital forrest masters is a professor of civil and coastal engineering in the herbert wertheim college of engineering he works in the college s school of sustainable infrastructure and environment and is also the college s associate dean for research and facilities in addition to his work at uf forrest serves on the board of the federal alliance for safe homes forrest has received more than 50 grants from state federal and private organizations to support his work which is focused on developing a deeper understanding of hurricane behavior and how to better design structures to withstand the increasing ferocity and frequency of these storms forrest it s a pleasure to have you with us today forrest masters good morning really great to be here nicci brown so as a starting point i d love to learn more about what made you interested in hurricanes in the first place forrest masters for me it began as an undergraduate student at the university i was in a structural engineering course and the professor came to me and said do you want to chase storms and when you re 20 years old there s only one answer to that question and subsequently i got involved in an undergraduate research program here and that s when i really began to fall in love with the study of tropical cyclones and from there i built a career eventually became a professor studying both the meteorological effects of these events but also studying how buildings respond under extreme winds and wind driven rain conditions nicci brown so you ve conducted field experiments in nearly 40 named storms several of them category 4 what s it like to chase a hurricane forrest masters well certainly it s not as sensational as what hollywood would show you there s a lot of hurry up and wait honestly and a lot of driving when we leave the university we re bringing a lot of equipment we have a convoy of vehicles large trucks trailing portable weather stations that get deployed in the path of the storm and hauling other types of equipment ultimately we re bringing the lab to the hurricane as deployments typically go i d say most of the work actually happens in the lead up to the event there s just a lot of planning and preparation but once we hit the road we stay on the road and so generally all of our trucks we have 100 gallon diesel reserves so we don t have to do a lot of stopping we keep moving we move to the site we do a lot of coordination on the road with local officials to get permission to go into different places there s a lot of communication with meteorologists and other people that are keeping close tabs on the storm to identify the right place to be but when we actually get there it s relatively quick we have these 6 000 pound weather stations that when they re fully deployed are about 33 feet in the air you know we ve done this now for almost 20 years over 20 years so we have a lot of experience putting these out so that takes on the order of about an hour to put one up we move around the area we put these in strategic locations we re often coordinating with other university teams that are in the field for example we have colleagues at illinois and texas tech and oklahoma and university of alabama huntsville who bring portable doppler radar systems and we try to co deploy so that as they re surveilling above we re taking measurements below so there s just a lot of coordination and we get out there but i don t think our heart rates get over 100 beats per minute or anything like that it s a very intentional process and you know this is the great thing about doing it today the amount of information i have at my fingertips is exceptional so i really have a great idea of what s going on down to maybe the 15 minute increment about weather conditions to get us in the right place at the right time so i hope i didn t dash any dreams for anybody that s listening about how exciting this is to go in the field it is quite exciting but at the end of the day it s work and it s professional work that s how it s treated we re very safety conscious and we spend a lot of time making sure that we have the best information to make sure that we re making the right decisions we re trained to be highly analytical to respond to changing situations so this is a perfect environment to put those skills to test there s a lot of improvisation involved because you don t know exactly where you need to be and by when you need to be there the situation is very fluid it s a wonderful opportunity to work with your colleagues and particularly to bring students in the field in my experience it brings out the best in them they almost always after leaving their first storm come out a different person someone who s more prepared for their professional future and someone who s more in touch with the issues that ultimately drive all the engineering work that s being done to protect society from these storms nicci brown i understand that we ve become a lot better at tracking hurricanes but with all of the science and technology we have at our disposal why aren t we better at predicting the changes in the strength of hurricanes forrest masters predicting the intensity of a storm it s a very tricky business storms when they re moving across the atlantic and eventually they recurve and they strike the u s as they re moving towards the shoreline typically they re encountering a lot of new conditions i mean the presence of land for example cuts off the supply of moisture and heat we also see dry air become entrained in the storms among other factors and so the reality is when a storm s over the water often we know more about it than we know about it when it s actually making landfall it s the period of sort of greatest uncertainty because of those changing conditions and that s in large part what motivates us to go out in the field and take the type of measurements we do is really to create both situational awareness about the overall storm intensity but also to collect data that will be used for many generations from now to improve those models so eventually we hope we can help put ourselves out of the storm chasing business by having better and more actionable data to improve modeling nicci brown so we hear about modifying clouds with seeding why can t we modify hurricanes so they just dissipate or become less powerful forrest masters the topic of weather modification has existed for a long time and there are notable projects that looked at all possibilities to do this including a very large one called project storm fury which was done in the last half of the last century and generally the biggest problem with modifying a storm s intensity is simply the sheer amount of energy in a storm these large events can have more than 100 terajoules of energy it s not straightforward there isn t a magic bullet here to kill a hurricane so while it may be true that some of these technologies can be deployed and can ultimately reduce intensity in certain parts of the storm when you re talking about a storm that spans hundreds of square miles it s not a trivial thing to do and also there are unintended consequences of modifying the environment that have to be dealt with i wouldn t rule out at some point in the future of humankind we don t figure this problem out but for the time being at least it s a very complicated problem and we have other areas certainly where we can make a difference in terms of for example improving our building codes and standards and our design practices and there s also just handling the flow of people during these events through evacuation and that type of thing to give us a more direct path to ultimately reducing the impact of the storm nicci brown so the data you collect when you are chasing hurricanes what is that data like how do you gather it and how are you using it forrest masters the purpose of our program is to measure surface wind speeds we take out ruggedized weather stations that are designed to withstand up to 200 mile per hour winds and we deploy them right where the highest winds are expected to arrive and we measure wind in three different directions at a very high resolution and that ultimately allows us to characterize the structure of these damaging winds and that s important because the nature of the turbulence affects the loads that act on buildings and so we re able to make strong inferences about if we re going to simulate that environment for example in our wind tunnel here at the university of florida we can use that information to help improve those simulations so that we re doing additional testing the data are also used for post storm damage assessments this is one of the probably the hardest problems hurricanes these extreme events make it very difficult for people to actually go out and observe what s going on yet engineers and meteorologists are called immediately back in to tell us what happened and so providing these types of measurements gives us a very clear line of sight on what the wind field intensity was at that location so that we can evaluate if the building stock performed adequately and as often is the case what we do see is a lot of damage at well below design wind speeds and that s important because it allows the engineering teams to pinpoint what are the links in civil infrastructure that ultimately cause systemic failures so those are some of the ways that we use the data we also provide it to operational users it s fairly common to see when the national hurricane center is monitoring hurricane weather conditions at landfall that were reported out on measurements we re taking and in turn this information is shared with emergency managers both at the state and local leve l who are ultimately figuring out when can they get their people back in so it s a wonderful community of people both on the research and operational side sharing information and supporting each other that by far is probably the part i love the most about being in this role is interacting with all these people that are so passionate about doing the best they can to take care of the affected community and i take a lot of pride that i m part of that community and i can contribute to it nicci brown well let s talk a little bit more about that wind tunnel it s called the terraformer and it s quite central to your work can you tell us more about what it is and what it actually can do forrest masters so in addition to our field work we do a lot of work in our laboratory we for example do physical testing where we actually destroy systems to see how they perform and then we study the underlying engineering that led to the design we also operate a large what s called a boundary layer wind tunnel and the purpose of the wind tunnel is to simulate at a reduced geometric scale the actual atmospheric boundary layer so you can imagine if you went outside and you felt the wind on your face and it s changing in different directions well that s a product of the fact that the wind is moving through trees and buildings to get to you and so we actually in this tunnel we can simulate the earth s landscape over a very far extent and the terraformer is one component of the wind tunnel that allows us to dial up any type of terrain at a specified geometric scale so if you came to me and said i need to run an experiment at 1 to 100 scale in marine conditions or a 1 to 10 scale in suburban conditions within 90 seconds we can reconfigure the floor of the wind tunnel there are over 1 100 individual roughness elements that we can raise and lower and twist to give us exactly the type of condition that we d expect and so the terraformer allows for high throughput testing in different types of terrain environments to evaluate loads or evaluate how buildings might move aerolastically is how that s referred to in the wind among other applications nicci brown how large is it forrest masters the wind tunnel s quite large it s one of the largest in the world actually for this type of application nominally at the test section it s 20 feet wide by about 10 feet tall and it s powered by eight large what are called vane axial fans and it s an open circuit wind tunnel because it s so large and also the tunnel in length i think is about 125 feet so it s a pretty substantial piece of equipment to operate in fact because it s so large and we built so much sophistication into the equipment we use to control the flows in it it actually became a national science foundation user facility back in around 2015 so anybody in the united states that s an academic that wants to use the wind tunnel can work with the national science foundation to come to our lab so we have people coming there all the time to exploit its unique capabilities and its size nicci brown fantastic so it sounds like this really does help guide you when you re looking at building an infrastructure safety and the guidelines or recommendations that you would make forrest masters yeah that s what we re shooting for i would say our aspirations go further than that i mean ultimately we re trying to create a test bed that allows people to be as creative as possible about exploring these issues so i wouldn t say that the structural engineer is the target audience it goes way beyond that you know we work with meteorologists we ve worked with people in other fields looking at different types of technology deployment for sensing and so on i think that s really i mean if you really had to distill down what we do at the university of florida i think it s trying to push the envelope the facility although it probably could operate with the speed and productivity of a commercial facility that s not the intent the intent is to allow people to come in and try wild new ideas that potentially could be transformative or ultimately lead to better solutions in an engineering context nicci brown and to your earlier point this really is a community if you will of people interacting and coming up with solutions and trying things out despite the improvements we re seeing in building codes and the like we are still seeing increasing damage to buildings so with all of that in mind what are the implications that you see for the future forrest masters yeah this is i think one of many lenses when you think about society and how it operates that tells us a lot about how the u s infrastructure will change over time because ultimately we re looking at buildings that might have existed 50 to 100 years and are expected to be around for another 100 years or so and the implication is that actually in solving the hurricane problem we have to actually understand how buildings perform in day to day weather so i think it s a good platform to sort of study the holistic performance of buildings and if you want to sort of step out to more of a macro scale when you think about how communities respond to events that s the thing about a natural disaster or some other type of exogenous shock to a community time speeds up and all the bad things that might happen to that community over 20 years might happen in three months and so there s a real opportunity to i think self reflect on how resilient communities are in the face of these events and specifically to places like florida which has a lot of coastline and i think upwards of a 1 000 people a day moving into the state it s an opportunity to think long term i have real concerns about what the state of evacuation will look like in 50 to 100 years in a crowded place like southeast florida where people can t build i mean we re going to be forced to think about the function of buildings particularly sheltering in place in areas that don t flood more so than we ve ever thought about that before so these events really i think positively influence design engineering thinking around what we re going to do and ultimately this is a silver lining i guess to the problem it forces us to think about building better communities to stand up to these events nicci brown forrest thank you for the work that you re doing and that of the other researchers that you partner with it was great to have you as a guest on our show today thank you so much forrest masters thank you nicci brown listeners thank you

over the past couple of weeks i ve been trying and mostly failing to engage in the news coming out of the 2021 united nations climate change conference cop26 in glasgow i have dipped in and out when i can afford to feel angry or dispirited i have started podcasts and then abandoned them halfway through for something that s easier to listen to it s hard to know what to feel about the international community s yearly attempt to create a livable future using pledges commitments and bureaucracy on one hand i can t remember a time in the ten years since i graduated from the university of california santa cruz with an environmental studies degree where the climate emergency has dominated the headlines in such a way so that s something but on the other hand i cannot stomach the kind of incremental bureaucracy and un speak that defines events like this one the hypocrisy and the private jets and the pageantry of it all just makes me want to tune out i think a great indictment of the climate movement over the past ten years is that creating real change is always framed as a compromise if we want to preserve civilization and humanity we must give up on some of the things we like in other words saving the climate has to be done at the expense of much of the progress innovation and comfort that capitalism has afforded us never is it framed as an invitation hey have you noticed the way we re living actually kind of sucks with all the mental illness inequality loneliness pollution and the fact that you spend the vast majority of your life working while ignoring all the aforementioned ills because you simply don t have time and have you heard that the same things that would help the planet thrive once again would also help you and your community do the same sadly gatherings like cop26 are basically all we have when it comes to global cooperation but i still think meetings like this and the officials who attend them frame the problem all wrong a recent edition of the solutions focused climate newsletter hothouse quotes peter norton an associate professor of history at the university of virginia who teaches through the lens of climate issues he believes coming up with climate solutions requires us to reprogram certain deeply held beliefs about progress and innovation when asking his students how to cool homes and buildings without air conditioning thousand year old technologies deployed in everything from old florida homes to bedouin tents in the middle east many didn t know where to start even a mechanical engineer didn t have a clue of ventilating a building without power said norton i ve learned to expect certain blind spots the least expensive most accessible most proven and most inclusive solutions are very often low to zero tech the problems have to be reframed so what does reframing this problem look like i think it starts by taking stock of the many things we ve willingly given up in exchange for all this progress the list is long a deep sense of place and time the profound comfort of working within natural rhythms the ability to truly deeply rest the deep ties and interwoven communities that make life rich and interesting and also solve for many of the societal level mental health issues we see play out in facebook conspiracies and misinformation today we ve developed a misconception that we are individualized atoms optimizing for our own success forgetting that we are actually nodes in living networks who thrive in concert with each other in the name of having everything all the time we ve given up a lot of what it means to be human and yet we still wonder why we re so polarized i used to be a business journalist so i know that to even come close to saying we can solve the climate crisis by changing how we live our lives is a big no no it s no longer fashionable to suggest that individual actions play a pivotal role in solving such a global existential problem so forget cooperation consuming less and living at a slower pace it s all carbon taxes renewable energy credits and geo engineering civilization as we know it can stay intact we re taught to believe if we elect the right leaders and they find just the right mix of policy technology and innovation and sure all those things probably do play a role in solving this problem in fact at this point we ll take anything we can get but the policy fixes and technological shifts feel hollow to me without addressing the very fundamentals of how humans live and connect it s like teaching chemistry in a different class from biology and physics as james lovelock creator of the gaia hypothesis put it it is impossible to understand these subjects in isolation because they are interconnected the same is true of living organisms that greatly influence the global environment at cop26 it feels like they re searching for an answer that in a way we already have everything is going to change we can choose to let the planet force that change on us and then try to innovate and engineer ourselves out of it using progress or we can accept that the way we ve been living is in planetary terms an aberration it has to end the latter choice is the least expensive most accessible most proven and most inclusive to use norton s words it means giving up a lot but it also means gaining a lot back too i will concede that perhaps that kind of shift simply can t be made in a conference room in europe where diplomats wear suits and pop champagne when they sign a piece of paper about theoretical targets five years in the future maybe it can only happen at the scale of an individual life each person figuring out how to live a bit more like a human which means each community starts to wind itself back together which means each ecosystem has a chance to find homeostasis once again for me it looks like this foster a sense of place get to know my home pick tiny things about it that i can maybe change or make better pay attention to cycles work within them instead of trying to outsmart them give and take from closer where i live when i get distracted by shiny objects a trip an achievement a comparison ask myself what feeling i m trying to ignore and i ll be honest these days that work feels more productive to me than reading the news anyway rosie spinks is a freelance writer whose recent work focuses on how to create a meaningful life in a

97 24 89 0 34 dax30 16247 86 99 22 0 61 by greg peel still plausible a 36 point fall in the futures ahead of yesterday s trade on the asx with wall street flat seemed out of context suggesting a market sell order set to hit from the open judging by the opening fall and relative uniformity of sector losses on the day this was the case backing up that assumption is the fact the asx200 did bounce from a momentum driven low of 66 points with half an hour to go to close down 49 and the fact the futures are up 32 points this morning albeit wall street was stronger the only standout moves yesterday were in technology 0 2 which is all about square and can be duly ignored and materials 1 7 which responded to lower commodity prices of more interest yesterday were the minutes of the november rba meeting and a speech from dr lowe post release including q a the minutes suggested the board s central forecast for the economy accords with the cash rate remaining at its current level until 2024 although this could be late 2023 lowe later said it was still plausible that the cash rate will not move until 2024 while a move in 2022 as the market is pricing in seems a very very low probability he didn t rule it out completely there seem to be chinks appearing in the dovish armour lowe also explained why the rba went mia following the cpi release allowing yields to rise in defiance of the board s 0 10 target suggesting the central bank did not want to jump in to a thin market before the board had had an opportunity to consider the implications for monetary policy of the most recent data and the updated forecasts in reference to that cpi result the minutes suggested the board was willing to look through inflation of 3 or more if it is not accompanied by stronger wages growth yet a question in the later q a had economists on the edge of their seats what does the rba think the neutral rate is now the neutral rate is a shangri la concept of what the cash rate should be if maximum economic growth and full employment meets stable inflation lowe said 2 5 which surprised economists to the upside arguably this slightly less dovish rba rhetoric overall could be blamed for weakness yesterday but the banks were down 0 4 and they d be cheering on an early rate hike so we might as well put yesterday behind and see what transpires today fittingly today will bring the september quarter wage price index shut up and pay up us retail sales rose 1 7 in october to mark the biggest monthly gain since march when biden s stimulus cheques hit bank accounts economists had forecast 1 5 given this is a dollar value measure economists estimate about half of the gain represents actual demand and the other half higher prices consumers are simply biting the bullet and paying up this is at odds with last week s consumer sentiment measure which hit a decade low on inflation concerns that said the biggest contributors to the rise were fuel which is not for most discretionary followed by electronics appliances and department store sales it must be noted that retailers spent the month warning consumers to buy now for christmas and not to wait for the traditional thanksgiving week sales next week and certainly don t leave it till december whatever is topping santa lists this year may simply be gone due to supply shortages and delays on this basis this month s retail sales result will perhaps be less buoyant than history suggests due to a pull forward dow components and retailers walmart and home depot think colesworth and bunnings both posted strong september quarter earnings results last night underscoring that bigger companies are better able to manage supply problems yet while home depot jumped 5 6 walmart fell 2 2 despite upgrading full year guidance for a third consecutive quarter sell the fact one presumes us industrial production rose 1 6 in october when 0 8 was forecast but this represents a catch up from a 1 3 fall in a september

health by increasing access to innovative treatment options available within the trials process and increasing insights around how different groups respond to new therapies people of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds make up nearly 40 of the u s population and are disproportionately impacted by chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease and diabetes yet due to historical and societal barriers these groups are still heavily under represented in clinical trials at times representing just 5 of trial enrollments this gap compounds existing health equity challenges and limits options for patients battling complex health conditions abbott s new initiative is focused on reducing barriers to access and building on the company s focus over the last several years of enhancing diversity within its own clinical trials the initiative also supports abbott s 2030 sustainability plan focused on innovating for access and affordability addressing health disparities and removing barriers to support its purpose of helping people live fuller healthier lives abbott s new initiative includes funding and scholarships for future trial leaders through new partnerships with the four hbcu medical schools the charles r drew university of medicine and science the howard university college of medicine meharry medical college and the morehouse school of medicine alongside the national black nurses association and national association of hispanic nurses abbott has dedicated 5 million to fund nearly 300 scholarships over the next five years to support the next generation of ethnically diverse nurses doctors and researchers who will lead and support future clinical trials increasing the diversity of doctors and nurses within the clinical trial landscape will also help advance trust in clinical research in diverse communities across the u s diversity in research medical advisory board made up of leading independent doctors trialists and health advocates abbott s new diversity in research medical advisory board mab will counsel on methods to reduce barriers to access within under represented populations and communities of color and provide feedback on how abbott can continue to drive diversity enrollment within select company clinical trials dedicated internal funding to improve access to abbott trials abbott will dedicate internal funding to improve access for women and under represented communities within abbott trials this funding will support additional trial sites for select abbott trials new investigator training opportunities and trial components to eliminate

of physician thought leaders to develop and publish an open source perspective to highlight key learnings around increasing clinical trial diversity across the health tech industry the best health care product is a product that helps the most people providing the greatest benefit as an industry we need to set new standards to make sure that our clinical trials remain representative of the

clinical trials so we can help more people have greater access to therapies that have the potential to change lives clinical research the foundation of future innovations clinical trials are the most effective way to understand how new medical devices diagnostic tests medicine and therapies impact the health of human patients they also represent opportunities to potentially treat patients battling complex conditions who haven t responded to traditional therapies improving representation from diverse populations in clinical trials is paramount to reducing health disparities and better understanding the impact of the next generation of health care therapies across all populations yet according to the u s food and drug administration fda people of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds as well as women continue to remain under represented in clinical trials in many communities several barriers to access have historically disrupted enrollment into clinical trials including lack of access to trial sites a lack of clarity around the trial process lack of trust and language barriers between patients and their physician in addition a shortage of diverse investigators leading trial sites along with too few research nurses and research coordinators representing diverse communities compound the challenge of increasing enrollment into clinical studies the importance for people considering being a participant in a clinical trial to have a doctor or nurse who looks like them who speaks their language and who understands their needs and those of their community cannot be overstated said melvin echols m d facc cardiologist and associate professor of medicine at the morehouse school of medicine and a member of abbott s newly formed diversity in research medical advisory board abbott s ability to build on its experience in supporting trials in communities of color and develop a platform to expand access to cutting edge therapies can truly

congressional democrats and the white house are rushing to discredit a looming report that will detail the cost of president biden s multitrillion dollar social welfare bill and the revenue collection proposals to fund it as part of the effort democrats are engaged in a campaign to delegitimize the work of the congressional budget office they claim the nonpartisan federal agency which is tasked with analyzing the fiscal impact of legislation cannot properly vet all of the provisions in mr biden s social welfare bill there s wide agreement cbo doesn t have experience analyzing revenue amounts gained from cracking down on wealthy tax cheats who are taking advantage of honest taxpayers said andrew bates the white house director of rapid response democrats further argue that the cbo s deficiencies mean it is likely to find the social welfare bill is not fully funded contrary to what mr biden has long claimed democratic leaders are widely adopting that position they worry that a bad cbo analysis will derail speaker nancy pelosi s effort for the house to pass the legislation this week we re working overtime to educate members about the flaws in the cbo s methodology said an aide to democratic leadership everyone has waited months for this bill to come together a few bad cost estimates shouldn t derail it from moving forward lawmakers fret that the cbo will miscalculate the impact of the proposed tax hikes and expanded irs enforcement democrats have proposed to hire 87 000 more irs agents to crack down on wealthy tax scofflaws the white house says the expanded workforce will help narrow the gap between taxes owed to the federal government and the amount paid the treasury department estimates that expanded tax enforcement can net 400 billion more in revenue over the next decade although the cbo has not officially released its estimate of the policy most expect that it will find the 400 billion projection does not add up still allies of mr biden are casting doubt on the cbo s accuracy appreciate cbo s advice but they ve long undercounted the tax gap said rep conor lamb pennsylvania democrat without there will be trillions in unpaid taxes this decade unpaid by the rich because it s more work to go after them and they know it phillip swagel the cbo director said the attempts to discredit his agency are unfounded there s people at cbo who have been at treasury and vice versa so it s a topic we re very familiar with and have a pretty established methodology he said despite the defense the democratic leadership s tactics to undercut the cbo seem to be working some moderate house democrats who have refused to vote on the bill until the cbo completes a proper review say a lower calculation of the impact of irs enforcement provisions is unlikely to deter their overall support i think that while as a group we re united around the concept of seeing cbo scores said rep stephanie murphy florida democrat i think each individual member will have to make their determination as to what they re willing to accept likewise there are strong concerns that the tax hikes in mr biden s spending bill will not generate the revenue needed to fund all of the proposed entitlement programs treasury secretary janet yellen estimates that the bill will raise nearly 2 trillion over the next decade by imposing more taxes primarily on corporations and the wealthy the menu of tax hikes includes doubling the federal tobacco tax to more than 2 per pack and a 15 flat tax on corporate profits the corporate flat tax applies to companies that publicly report more than 1 billion in profits over three years also tucked into the package is a 15 tax on the foreign earnings of corporations and a 1 surcharge on companies that buy back their own stock apart from corporate tax hikes the white house is proposing a series of taxes on the rich mr biden is backing a 5 wealth tax on individuals with adjusted gross income above 10 million the figure jumps to 8 on adjusted gross income over 25 million it is estimated to raise 230 billion over the next decade economic analysts say it is impossible to estimate how much revenue the tax hikes will generate because many have never been implemented house ways and means committee chairman richard e neal massachusetts democrat shares that concern mr neal initially authored a sweeping fiscal plan that would have repealed the trump era tax cuts some senate democrats considered the proposal which would have boosted income and corporate tax rates across the board a nonstarter because the social welfare bill will need to pass via budget reconciliation which allows some spending measures to avert the senate s 60 vote filibuster threshold and pass via a simple majority mr biden opted to avoid the disunity instead the white house crafted the proposal by relying on wealth and corporate surcharges this considerably increases tax complexity mr neal said haris alic can be reached at halic washingtontimes com
bloomberg the startup scene in the world s fifth largest nation is having a breakout year more money has flowed into pakistan s nascent technology sector during 2021 than in the previous six years combined with investors from the u s singapore and the united arab emirates joining the rush and one former microsoft corp and linkedin corp employee has been involved in about half the fundraising deals until 2018 pakistan born aatif awan was living the dream in silicon valley after more than a decade working for tech heavyweights he d become an angel investor for american startups and bought a house in san francisco then he went to visit his parents in lodhran a small town known for growing mangoes and cotton and new opportunities became clear multiple local entrepreneurs got in touch seeking advice on funding and how to accelerate their startups that s when awan 41 saw the possibilities in pakistan s startup space he moved back in february last year and started his early stage venture capital fund indus valley capital the law and order situation is so good mobile penetration is there everything seems right for this to happen he said while neighboring india has long had a vibrant startup scene foreign investors have traditionally viewed pakistan with trepidation security concerns power shortages and poor digital infrastructure have all counted against it in the past but by other measures the potential in fintech and retail is huge two thirds of the 200 million population are under 30 most shopping is still done in cash and relatively few people have a bank account internet users have more than tripled in the past five years to about 110 million by global standards the sum poured into the country s startups this year about 300 million according to crunchbase and invest2innovate data is tiny but it s a record for pakistan and the funding surge is expected to continue silicon valley based kleiner perkins an early investor in alphabet inc and amazon com inc made its first investment there this year defy partners management llc singapore s wavemaker partners llc and uae s zayn capital ltd are also on the list of investors pakistan has all the necessary ingredients to be a large market that is growing rapidly said mamoon hamid a partner at kleiner perkins just given the youth of the population we believe that they will adopt the new way of doing things much faster than most countries on the globe the venture industry is enjoying something of a boom everywhere global deals this year surged to 524 1 billion by the end of october according to research firm preqin 66 higher than last year s total and more than double the amount invested in 2019 the covid 19 pandemic has made some things easier for international investors as zoom meetings and exchanging documents by email have replaced in person meetings meanwhile china s tech crackdown has also prompted investors to hunt for new opportunities with startups from southeast asia to india seeing increased interest from venture capital and private equity firms to some the capital flowing into pakistan is yet another sign of frothiness in the market to others it s the logical next step in a global race to invest the internet economy has exploded over the last five to seven years and i think that is the main catalyst said ali mukhtar general partner at fatima gobi ventures whose portfolio companies have been involved in about 40 of pakistan s fundraising this year the large diaspora in places like silicon valley london and new york has also helped to provide a talent base and funding he added many young nationals have left high paying overseas jobs at places like morgan stanley mckinsey co and bnp paribas sa to become entrepreneurs back home the opportunity has also seen a few foreigners moving to pakistan the country has the last large population that hasn t been tapped said u s citizen jordan olivas 32 co founder of qisstpay inc the islamabad based startup is modeled on klarna bank ab a buy now pay later fintech firm and olivas s former employer just the population size and the average age of the consumer alone creates a good market he said up until this year there hasn t been any big vc money coming in in addition to rising interest from global venture capital companies the entrepreneurial ecosystem is also benefiting from a growing network of local investors incubators and shared working spaces pakistan s government has also increased support for the tech sector after realizing its potential for exports the startup scene s atmosphere is encapsulated at the karachi offices of e commerce startup bazaar technologies pvt which in august raised 30 million in the nation s largest series a fundraising of more than a dozen investors only one met with the company in person tucked away in an old office building it s a modern workspace with gleaming floors and furniture that buzzes with casually dressed young workers co founders hamza jawaid and saad jangda both 28 respectively worked in dubai for mckinsey and ride hailing company careem inc before returning home last year to start bazaar which operates a business to business marketplace for grocery stores just a few years ago startups in pakistan struggled to raise funding risk averse banks routinely turned down loan applications from entrepreneurs while most cash rich businesses and other private investors were not even willing to speak with them in 2012 there were zero significant funding sources said kalsoom lakhani co founder of investment fund i2i ventures you really had to have the network in pakistan to raise your funds for business if you fast forward there has been a support system that has been growing in speed around the startups she said a number of risks could slow the funding momentum investors may lose faith if pakistan s pace of digital adoption is slower than expected and banks with big pockets have been failing for decades to convince most of the population to take up bank accounts an abrupt change of government policy such as a more punishing tax regime or stricter regulation would be a real threat to the fledgling tech sector investors may also find it difficult to exit through pakistan s stock market since startup valuations are high relative to listed companies according to suleman rafiq maniya head of advisory at vector securities pvt pakistan being on the monitoring list of the financial action task force a financial watchdog is also a concern for investors and has created extra hurdles for startups for now though there s a lot of venture capital funding to be scooped up people realized this is a much larger force said awan several startups have found themselves attracting more money than they had initially sought while ideas and the results of a small test run can be enough to raise funds according to people who asked not to be named since the matter is private some are also hiring staff at double or triple their current salary as they have money to spend two of the people said if you have a good team and a good idea you d come in and just revolutionize said olivas there s so much white space early stage success stories include airlift technologies pvt a lahore based online shopping delivery platform which in august raised 85 million in the nation s largest single private funding round ahead of overseas expansion plans digital payments startup tag innovation pvt is now valued at 100 million after raising funds in september while competitor sadapay is projected to be the fastest growing mobile wallet in the world in the five years to 2025 according to london based fintech company boku inc neither company has begun fully fledged operations yet what happened in china india and indonesia has started to happen in pakistan only faster said awan the wheel has started turning now 2021 bloomberg l p

australia s prime minister scott morrison a person who finds the truth a creature best beaten shunned and ignored is now moving into what looks like campaign mode at cop26 in glasgow he sold the world a climate change model that kept company with countries where fumes linger stubbornly and the fossil fuels burn bravely he made sure to do it the australian way ensuring that emission reduction targets would not so much be met as thoroughly beaten without the need for taxes he spoke of technology unproven and made assumptions unfounded prior to heading to glasgow morrison having done his bit of crossdressing on the climate change front was coy he refused to reveal the modelling that went into the fabulous predictions of net neutral utopia but on his return and after any sense of jet lag had been overcome he was happy to promote the scanty details of an enterprise verging on a hoax scott morrison is no supporter of great causes or freedom with such a poor track record on human rights issues scott morrison s talk of fighting for freedom is pure hypocrisy such efforts have become the stock and trade of a man habitually committed to the advertising message at best it is simple dissimulation at worse and here we find ourselves on difficult territory it is mendacious little wonder then that critics have been coming out of late with a sort of adamant righteousness against the australian prime minister s relationship with lying french president emmanuel macron has led the pack letting the world know that he did not think morrison was a liar he knew he was deceived about australia s intentions regarding the now rescinded au 90 billion submarine contract between the naval group and canberra macron singled out morrison in an impromptu interview with australian journalists at the g20 summit in rome the conduct of the australian government had been showing that this was not secret men s business former australian prime minister and victim of a palace coup that saw morrison come to power suggested much the same thing australia s incumbent claimed malcolm turnbull had a reputation for being habitually dishonest his conduct regarding the submarine deal with france had enhanced his reputation for being untrustworthy morrison s response has been all shrugs it s politics and in the political jungle the thin skinned will not outlast those with thick hides he said this gave him ample opportunity to lie about ever having told a lie have you ever told a lie in public life inquired melbourne radio host neil mitchell morrison s reply was deputy prime minister barnaby joyce as is often the case preferred to be honest about such instances of mendacity he said fairness and due process for a figure such as morrison demands an understanding about the role of lies in politics the recent fixation about his less than fond association with the truth is a reminder of the effort by the washington post to count the fibs of u s president donald trump in january 2021 its fact checker unit found no less than 30 573 false or misleading claims over the course of four years the washington post wrote can the frail truth survive in a thriving economy of lies devotees of the anti lie cult have taken a near fundamentalist line on the issue the great 16th century french essayist michel de montaigne regarded lying as an accursed vice we are men and we have relations with one another only by speech lying and obstinacy were those faults that needed correction in a child lying in politics is much a statement of fact as rising obesity levels in industrialised states as that keen student of totalitarianism hannah arendt pondered factual truth is ever at the mercy of the lie made in the name of political power she wrote in his unsurpassed essay politics and the english language george orwell also reminds us with severity that political language itself is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind such conduct is inherent between political leaders so much so that international relations theorist john mearsheimer found little literature in his field on it his own contribution was to come up with seven different types of lying including fear mongering inter state lies nationalist myths and strategic cover ups scott morrison has destroyed australia s humanity under prime minister scott morrison australia no longer displays compassion and humanity towards those in need ever contrarian mearsheimer sees instances of lying notably between the leaders of countries as less frequent than commonly assumed leaders are more likely to lie to their constituents than their counterparts which is hardly reassuring to fans of montaigne the standard of politics and public life is low and finding distinguished figures who fail to deceive their electorates is a task doomed political endeavour remains the featherbed of mendacious undertakings but to make such a fuss about being a liar in politics is exactly the sort of thing that is unlikely to affect morrison he is seemingly immune his armour a prophylactic against veracity dr binoy kampmark was

this week on the treatment elvis welcomes musician and actor steven van zandt van zandt is a member of bruce springsteen s e street band as well as an actor best known for his role as silvio dante on hbo s the sopranos his new memoir is unrequited infatuations van zandt tells the treatment that writing the memoir gave him a new perspective on the music that springsteen and the band were creating decades ago he says he was fortunate to be at hbo for the start of the groundbreaking series and at netflix as the streaming giant began creating original content and he talks about arguing with david chase about that final song on the sopranos the following interview has been abbreviated and edited for clarity kcrw welcome to the treatment the home edition i m elvis mitchell my guest today is musician actor author stevie van zandt whose book is unrequited infatuations what s so great about the book is that your interest in social justice comes in in so many interesting places steve van zandt yeah i think it just became part of the dna of the art form once bob dylan introduced the idea i actually mentioned exactly the moment he did introduce the idea in the first two lines of subterranean homesick blues it was a new kind of idea to bring the consciousness of country blues and folk music to the pop idiom which was soon to become the rock idiom kcrw one of the things that s so much fun about the book is there s so much excitement in it van zandt i m glad i m passing that along because it s important that somebody provide a little bit of enthusiasm these days because i just think life has become insufferably boring i don t know how we got this boring elvis i may be a bit extreme because everyday is 1967 to me but it s boring out there and i don t know why we tolerate it everybody just seems to accept this boredom as inevitable i m gonna do everything i can to try and stimulate a little enthusiasm if i can do it kcrw part of it is that maybe there s not much that s new anymore and you were fortunate that you came up through a period where there was new all the time van zandt yeah i really cannot over exaggerate that we grew up in a renaissance in the true sense of the word it just really was exciting every single day you knew tomorrow was going to be more exciting than today and you know when the greatest art being made is also the most commercial you re in a renaissance and that s what was going on man you can measure it from wherever you want to but basically the 50s 60s and 70s it was a time of great invention and celebration in spite of all of the protests and civil rights and women s rights and vietnam and assassinations and you name it we still had the music and very few other things to do so the music was such an important part of our lives back then and it was just fantastic kcrw the book even opens in fact with a bit of intrigue doesn t it van zandt yeah i wanted to make it clear right from the beginning this is not going to be just a music book for music people and there s plenty of that really the whole first half of the book is that kid from new jersey makes it to the top and rock and roll and that s a good story i don t take that for granted but i wanted to make it more than that i wanted to make it like a detective novel like a dan brown book where you don t know what s coming next because i didn t know what was coming next in my life i mean the first half of the book it s pretty linear but once i leave the e street band man it s a whole different trip and i m starting from scratch there s no plan i didn t just change jobs my life ended after 15 years of work it was over and now i m looking out into the abyss and that s where things get interesting and the bigger themes start to emerge that i think are more universal than just show business themes or music themes it becomes a search for purpose in life a search for identity a search for spiritual enlightenment and bigger things and i think that s when it becomes a bit more of a general and hopefully useful book kcrw the book is almost calculated like a really great night of one of those legendary three hour e street band concerts that happen to be opened by the jukes and you re in both bands but the book feels like it s structured to be almost like an evening of keeping an audience engaged and alert van zandt it s one of those things that you realize as i m writing this thing i realize most of what i m saying no longer exists and you say to yourself man how can i make this thing relevant because literally almost everything i m talking about no longer exists but when it comes to the craft well the history is the history that s always kind of useful the craft stuff though that doesn t change much and the concept of craft which may be in danger these days just as the concept of greatness is in danger but those things don t actually change they may be being ignored they may be diluted to the point of mediocrity at the moment but they actually don t change greatness isn t born greatness is earned greatness is developed and we got a real problem with development in this modern world and i m not sure how that s going to change this generation man with so many distractions you know at some point they gotta shut all these distractions off and have the discipline to do it or else i m not sure how we re going to aspire to greatness in the future kcrw it really is a book about the ambition to find something greater and passion that goes hand in hand with generosity because who and what you are is because you re just so generous you couldn t keep your opinions to yourself but you also couldn t keep your passion to yourself van zandt i think it s just a matter of getting something done you know let s stop talking and start doing kcrw you re all doing you could have written this entire book about the first three springsteen records and that jump from born to run to darkness at the edge of town those first three records are so different and darkness is the proto bruce record that you don t have nebraska without darkness on the edge of town van zandt and i swear elvis i never really analyzed it till i wrote this book at the time i was just like let s make great records that s all i was concerned with because we were having trouble making great records capturing a live sound on record it took us five hours to do it that s all i was concerned with that s all i could think about i didn t analyze it until six months ago and i was like wow now i understand what was going on back then and i didn t all these years kcrw that s crazy because when i heard nebraska i thought well this is what darkness was reaching at the dna of that record can be found basically in every great springsteen record after that van zandt that s right that s why i recognized that right away when i heard nebraska i was like man this ain t no demo i m sorry this has got to come out it s just completely unique in that you re never gonna find something more intimate than an artist doing something that he believes no one will ever hear that s when you re gonna get intimate man kcrw you can see the influence of the movies on him probably more than any other major american recording artist van zandt i think that s right that s what john landau meant when he said i see the future of rock and roll because here comes an artist that is including all the other art forms and that was new and pretty unique even to this day it doesn t happen a whole lot it didn t occur to me at the time but looking back now i can see very clearly this was a tremendous transformation going on and not only within him and finding his identity which completely changed for born to run and then completely changed again to darkness and he s now stayed in that darkness thing ever since but in trying to encapsulate trying to use all the other art forms in the music that was new kcrw what s so much fun about the book is that you d have the ability to see the whole picture but also this almost cosmic boredom with the status quo i mean you could have stayed in any of these situations you were in and done very well for yourself and just spent the rest of your life telling stories about that but you can t not say what you re thinking and that s what to some extent ended your career with the band and also when you re meeting with ted sarandos and you re telling him who s gonna binge a tv show and he just says to you don t you listen to a record in one sitting bingo van zandt yeah he caught me man what a wonderful cat i mean can you imagine at that point their stock was falling they had done some dumb business thing and they re about to start making content and the first thing he picks is something with subtitles from norway however much money he has at this point he totally deserves executives don t have that kind of courage when the entire business is depending on this new content idea lillehammer was about to be the first one and he s gonna do it with subtitles a local show from norway man i got nothing but respect for that guy kcrw so much of the book is about this compass that you have that led you to all these people that sometimes relationships worked out for the best and sometimes they didn t but still you learn from them and you got stuff out of them you just in one way or another find yourself bouncing into these people who live life as passionately as you do van zandt this zelig kind of life i happened to be at hbo at the most important moment with sopranos one of the most important moments in television history changing television for sure i happened to be at netflix when it changes again the next major change of tv i happened to be at sirius brought the first two original formats to sirius satellite they didn t know what to do with it it wasn t like i sat down i m gonna plan this i m gonna be innovative here i m gonna make sure i m in the right place at the right time i wish i was that smart but i just happened to be there and i guess you just gotta stay a little bit flexible in this world and get ready to play whatever cards you re dealt kcrw there s such a restlessness in you as a person that even if you owned the yellow brick road you might think well wait what s that over there that s not so shiny and in fact you ve been on the yellow brick road a number of times so you can chalk it up to being circumstantial but the fact is that you are driven to find something that s not what other people are looking at van zandt i think that s really one of the main themes of the book that i hope is universal we are all searching for purpose in life searching for that identity that keeps on evolving searching for some kind of spiritual enlightenment where we feel like okay this is why i m here i think that s something that we all feel at some point maybe some of us aren t lucky enough to be able to act on it that s why i keep saying how lucky i am to be able to act on these impulses and try and do something about it i m very results oriented and that comes from i think my add which i had long before it was fashionable i just don t have a lot of patience and i ve come to understand the other side of the story the inch by inch sort of accomplishment that some people deal with in the political world we re gonna have these slow improvements imperceptible almost and i understand that that has its purpose also but i can t do it i cannot do it it is too slow i can t wait for the contracts to get done i can t wait for the lawyers if i m waiting for a lawyer i d still be in asbury park kcrw we have to talk a little bit about not fade away when i saw that movie it was thrilling to me to hear the song pretty ballerina go ahead and talk about your role in that movie van zandt the band in the movie had to kind of evolve throughout the film the band is just getting started to almost getting signed and that was so much fun we had to teach the actors how to play the instruments and they never really sung before and it was miraculous what we pulled off in four or five months david just loves doing music more than anything else he d be happy just doing that we had the longest friendly argument for that last song of sopranos i don t know if you guys talked about that or not kcrw no this is the point for you to bring it up van zandt cuz we had the reputation as the coolest show ever there were these obscure otis redding songs and obscure kinks things and johnny thunder just interesting interesting choices on the music that david had made and he wants to end the show with a song from journey now i got nothing against journey they re terrific fantastic one of the great singers of all time but you know it wasn t special and so i suggested three or four things one of which was pretty ballerina which would have been a juxtaposition kind of song and i also had loose ends from bruce which would have been a little bit i guess on the nose as it turned out and i had devil came from kansas from procol harum and darkness darkness from young bloods but in the end you couldn t argue with david he s like look i invented the character and that s what the character would play that s the song he would choose so end of discussion you know you can t really argue with that

were also on the agenda interestingly bitcoin took a breather overnight yesterday bitcoin took a breather as it sold off from all time highs to test support around us 60 000 this may stall the narrative that some have of seeing us 100 000 bitcoin by year end however is unlikely to dampen sentiment too much with fundamentals pointing towards a strong year end etoro analyst josh gilbert said the sell off may have been sparked by the passing of the new infrastructure bill in the us which was signed by joe biden the bill includes tax reporting and provisions that apply to crypto assets and nfts bitcoin reserves across exchanges continue to fall according to data from crypto quant the data indicates that supply continues to drop as demand increases with investors choosing to hodl their bitcoin rather than sell as we know when supply drops and demand increases prices often tend to increase as a result at the start of this week bitcoin also went through its most significant upgrade in
