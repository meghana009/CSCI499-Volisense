listen to this article listen to this article jackson hole wyoming ap a half hour drive or so from the resort where the high priests of international finance leading economists and central bank officials have convened in jackson hole wyoming to discuss the world s economic challenges ash hermanowski oversees the distribution of about 1 200 free meals a day at a food bank called jackson cupboard hermanowski hands out meals from a commercial garage after being forced from a previous site by a malfunctioning sprinkler the food bank couldn t afford any other place in town just across the street the glenwood a collection of townhomes that will sell for millions is nearing completion unparalleled luxury its website says in a truly relaxing oasis it s the ultimate irony hermanowski said the staff and i we talk about it all the time we all struggle to live here and they re building high end residences that dichotomy exists all over town but people refuse to see it as the federal reserve s annual economic symposium got underway thursday at a lodge in grand teton national park some of the very problems fed officials are grappling with high inflation soaring rental costs and home prices and wide economic inequalities were starkly evident near the idyllic mountain setting on friday fed chair jerome powell will deliver a speech that could signal how high or how fast the central bank may raise interest rates in the coming months powell s remarks will be scrutinized by wall street traders and economists and could potentially cause sharp swings in financial markets in its drive to tame the worst inflation bout the nation has endured in four decades the powell fed has embarked on its fastest series of rate hikes since the early 1980s the fed is trying to slow the economy just enough to cool inflation without causing a recession a notoriously delicate task inflation is particularly high in the town of jackson and the surrounding teton county which even before the pandemic erupted two years ago was the wealthiest and most unequal place in the nation jackson hole is the name of the broader valley the state of wyoming has calculated that the cost of living in the county at the end of 2021 was 68 higher than in the rest of the state with housing costs 130 higher at the food bank hermanowski says demand has escalated from a year ago as surging food and gas prices have sapped the budgets of their clients roughly 85 of the food bank s recipients have a job often more than one said sharel lund executive director of one22 a nonprofit that includes jackson cupboard like many resort towns jackson has always been expensive but the pandemic turbocharged the disparities that have widened the gap between the wealthy and everyone else real estate prices soared as many affluent families seeking to escape crowded cities moved into the jackson area or spent more time at vacation homes they already owned with many office professionals able to work remotely the area s natural beauty became an alluring draw wyoming s low tax status has also proved appealing to high income earners jackson a town of about 25 000 people year round still retains its aura as an old western town with its archways made from elk antlers around the town square the square is lined with a cowboy bar and an old timey five and dime shop yet wedged in among such outlets are symbols of the increasingly luxe jackson high end jewelry shops and a swarovski crystal store that is selling a bald eagle figurine for 9 600 we definitely see both sides of it here said hannah cooley executive director of hole food rescue a nonprofit that redistributes leftover food from restaurants and bakeries you have the ultra wealthy with their massive houses and then you have three immigrant families crammed into a one bedroom apartment already high home prices and rents in jackson have jumped further since the pandemic just as they have nationally a particular hardship for people who work as housekeepers chefs and waiters at resorts the median price for a home 3 million twice what it was five years ago the average apartment rent in teton county jumped 12 4 last year to 2 780 according to state government data jonathan schechter a member of jackson s town council says that according to the most recent irs data the average income in teton county in 2019 was 312 442 highest in the nation and nearly 50 above the second highest manhattan april norton director of the jackson teton county affordable housing department points to a major obstacle to home construction 97 of the county s land is federally owned and can t be developed compounding the squeeze retiring workers who bought homes at affordable prices decades ago are now selling them for eye popping prices that many current workers even higher income professionals can t afford norton s in laws recently retired from jobs as an engineer and accountant in jackson having built their own home in the 1970s they will eventually be able to sell it for a price far above what current engineers or accountants could afford a neighbor just sold a home for 8 million the county is trying multiple approaches to address the shortage of affordable housing they include building homes available only to people who work locally and with caps on price appreciation such deed restricted homes have still sold for more than 700 000 evidence of the intense demand and limited supply still a county report shows there is a waitlist of roughly 1 500 families seeking affordable housing up from 1 100 last year the housing crunch has exacerbated worker shortages that are plaguing the county a problem being felt by employers across the nation norton said the school system lost 60 teachers last year in part because of a lack of housing many workers including nurses and services workers are stuck commuting from places like victor idaho a roughly 45 minute drive over the 8 500 foot teton pass which is treacherous for

for years you ve been diligently turning off the faucet each time you brush your teeth you ve replaced harsh cleaning chemicals with more natural alternatives and even installed a low flow showerhead what more can you do to preserve our planet s finite supply of water although the aforementioned individual efforts are laudable household usage accounts for just 11 of global water withdrawals each year the real culprits i e those that can contribute most to preserving our water resources are companies although there are many reasons that corporations should evaluate their water management practices we re focusing here on the financial risks of poor water stewardship without further ado here are three that may well rain on investors parades reduced or costlier production capabilities and supply chain disruptions which have the potential to dramatically impact companies across all industries after all water is essential for the cultivation and production of raw materials the manufacturing process and the distribution of products in fact the far reaching effects of climate change induced water scarcity can already be observed in europe where a summer of severe droughts has threatened livestock production and crop yields vital waterways such as the rhone danube and po rivers are drying up hampering transportation of goods and impeding nuclear energy production the timing arguably couldn t be worse for a continent that s already grappling with soaring inflation and energy shortages following russia s invasion of ukraine earlier this year but nature waits for no one and the effects of our collective procrastination are now yielding notable economic effects in the form of elevated shipping costs supply shortages and likely production cuts some economists have warned that dry conditions in germany long considered mainland europe s economic powerhouse could stall the country s overall economic growth by as much as half a percentage point this year legal action and reputational damage as companies are taken to task for their roles in excessive water usage or contamination recent research has indicated that half of the united states waterways are now so polluted they are considered impaired meaning they are unsafe for swimming fishing or drinking among the contaminants garnering increased public attention are per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas commonly referred to as forever chemicals because they don t break down easily these man made substances which have been linked to a variety of negative health impacts in humans and animals are now so ubiquitous that they can be found in even the most remote areas of the world as awareness of pfas grows so too do efforts to hold companies accountable for releasing these harmful chemicals into surrounding waterways more than 1 200 pfas related lawsuits were filed in the united states last year corporate defendants could subsequently find themselves embroiled in protracted litigation spending considerably on legal defense settlements judgments and crisis management communications for some companies the financial risks are formidable well known chemicals manufacturer 3m devoted 15 entire pages in last year s annual report to its pfas linked legal exposures stranded assets in water stressed regions often emanating from inaccurate projections regarding water availability and access failure to implement appropriate risk mitigation and stewardship plans and or unfavorable regulatory responses stranded assets in case you were wondering are those that no longer generate revenue for a company they often transpire as a result of adverse environmental conditions yes that includes drought or significant disruptions in terms of consumer demand regulatory activity and technological innovation again this isn t a hypothetical scenario some major publicly traded companies have already seen their assets become albatrosses as a result of water related events one particularly prominent example is that of mining behemoth barrick gold which spent two decades and billions of dollars attempting to get its once touted pascua lama mining project underway this andean project straddling the borders of chile and argentina was met with dogged and unrelenting opposition from environmental groups and local stakeholders concerned about its destruction of nearby glaciers as well as depletion and contamination of local water supply these concerns were seemingly not unfounded and in 2013 upon determining that barrick gold did not have adequate protocols in place to prevent water pollution a chilean court imposed a 16 million fine and ordered that the company suspend construction on the project cue class action lawsuits from irate investors last month drawing a line under the sorry saga chile s supreme court ratified the definitive closure of pascua lama project far from being a cash cow pascua lama has become a cautionary tale for other companies and its fate now hangs in the balance barrick gold is currently exploring whether the argentine side of the mine remains viable but for now the project represents an extremely expensive thorn in the company s side what is the role of financial advisors in addressing the water crisis financial advisors who are well positioned to help their clients identify and manage water risks in their portfolios given the politicized and polarized nature of recent dialogue surrounding environmental social and governance esg investing some advisors might be hesitant to raise such issues with their clients however regardless of clients political inclinations there s a chance they are already experiencing the day to day effects of prolonged prevarication on water issues droughts might be affecting their livelihoods water pollution may be impacting their ability to enjoy much loved hobbies such as fishing scuba diving or boating they might even have good reason to doubt that their home water supply is safe for consumption importantly advisors wishing to help clients target the encroaching water crisis are not merely limited to esg funds which have contributed to skepticism of the broader sustainable investing movement particularly when it comes to a lack of transparency concerning these funds underlying selection criteria direct indexing solutions instead allow advisors to customize portfolios to clients specific values financial preferences and tax situations many such platforms also afford investors the flexibility to decide whether divestment or engagement is their preferred impact approach indeed some independent shareholders have been lending recent support to proposals that urge disclosure and mitigation of water risks the time to act is now the water crisis is not a nebulous theoretical concept it s here and it s already having profound social and economic impacts as other industry participants have observed by failing to account for water security in financial decision making financial markets are contributing significant financial flows that are increasing exposure and vulnerability to water related risks across the global economy advisors shouldn t be afraid to discuss this financially material issue with clients it s part of their fiduciary duty emma smith is director of communications at ethic ethic is an independent provider of personalized direct indexing strategies for financial intermediaries its scalable technology platform enables advisors to create custom portfolios tailored to clients unique values financial goals and tax preferences

market strategist from hedge fund telemetry the benchmark price for aluminum on the london metal exchange was last at 2 455 50 per ton down from its record high of more than 3 500 a ton in february i

new york ap stocks rallied thursday as the countdown clicked closer to zero for a highly anticipated speech about interest rates the s p 500 gained 58 35 or 1 4 to 4 199 12 for its best day in nearly two weeks much of the lift came late in the day as traders made moves ahead of friday morning s speech by federal reserve chair jerome powell which has long been circled on wall street s calendar the dow jones industrial average rose 322 55 or 1 to 33 291 78 and the nasdaq composite climbed 207 74 or 1 7 to 12 639 27 all three indexes trimmed their losses for the week caused by monday s tumble that was the worst for stocks in months treasury yields eased to let off some of the pressure on wall street following the release of several reports on the economy fewer workers applied for jobless claims last week than expected an encouraging sign for a jobs market that has been the main pillar for an economy struggling under high inflation a revised reading on the overall economy meanwhile suggested that its contraction during the spring wasn t quite as bad as earlier thought it shrank 0 6 on an annualized basis according to the government s second preliminary reading milder than the 0 9 given in its initial estimate the 10 year treasury yield which affects mortgage rates fell to 3 03 from 3 11 late wednesday brand connections that helped stocks that tend to benefit the most from lower interest rates such as internet and technology companies businesses whose profits closely track the strength of the economy such as producers of raw materials also helped to lead the market telehealth services providers were strong after amazon shut down its in house telemedicine service for employees teladoc gained 4 on the losing end were several companies that trimmed their financial forecasts for the year software company salesforce fell 3 4 and discount retailer dollar tree fell 10 2 several retailers have cut their outlooks recently even after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected they re struggling with swelling inventories and higher costs while their customers likewise get squeezed by inflation particularly lower income ones wall street s focus though remains on jackson hole wyoming where economists from around the world are gathering for an annual symposium it s been the setting for market defining announcements by the federal reserve in past years and investors are hoping powell will offer some clarity about where interest rates are heading the fed has already raised rates four times this year in its efforts to halt high inflation with most of them bigger than the usual hike and investors want to hear how it s leaning for future increases powell will begin speaking at 10 a m eastern time friday a half hour after trading begins on wall street besides what the fed will do with its key overnight interest rate powell may also talk about how the central bank is putting into reverse the money printer it used during the pandemic to goose the economy stocks had jumped through the summer on hopes the fed may go easier on rate hikes than feared because investors were seeing signs the nation s high inflation may be peaking the hope was that the fed could downshift the size of its rate increases sooner than expected and may not ultimately raise them as far as earlier thought but recent comments from a spate of fed officials have pushed back on that narrative leading to the hopes for more clarity from powell on friday expectations have built among some investors for powell to sound hawkish which is wall street s euphemism for a bias toward raising rates aggressively but some investors at the same time are speculating the fed could turn around quickly and actually begin cutting interest rates in 2023 given mounting pressures on the economy the market is looking for a consistent policy andy sparks head of portfolio management research at msci said in a statement raising rates and then allowing the market to believe it may soon begin lowering rates could undermine fed credibility with market participants higher interest rates slow the economy in hopes of undercutting inflation but they also risk choking off the economy if done too aggressively and they pull down on prices for all kinds of investments

quarter mile north of the butler bridge on highway 29 it is owned by napa redevelopment partners and catellus based in oakland is the development manager for the project that is a huge milestone said keith rogal of napa development partners i m just so excited to have these visible signs of substantial progress in the works it s going to be a great place with great homes great parks and great amenities said tom marshall of catellus it s a great project for the future of napa the first napa pipe houses all at least two stories will be built in the northeast corner of the largely vacant property said rogal this initial phase features 79 homes meant to be the highest priced houses of phase one model home designs were recently submitted by brookfield bay area holdings llc to the city planning department according to those plans brookfield proposes to build three architectural styles modern prairie farmhouse and modern spanish as is common in many new developments in california the proposed homes are built on lots ranging from about 2 800 to 3 235 square feet the two and three story single family houses range from 2 336 to approximately 3 166 square feet garages all located at

the pseudo left fightback group the canadian affiliate of the misnamed international marxist tendency is waging a campaign to promote a top down drive by the teamsters to establish itself as the bargaining agent for tens of thousands of amazon employees across the global conglomerate s canadian facilities in a june 15 article entitled amazon s unionization campaign spreads to canada victory to the workers fightback asserted that the drive provides an urgent reminder of the need to unionize the non unionized willfully ignoring the unions decades long suppression of the class struggle and their ever deeper integration into corporate management and the state fightback baldly asserts that a working class regimented by the pro capitalist unions is stronger and better able to resist the bosses attacks and that union organization constitutes the first steps in developing revolutionary consciousness a more accurate slogan for fightback s campaign would be victory to the bureaucratic union apparatuses it serves to strengthen the control of the unions over one of the fastest growing sections of the working class and bolster thereby the trade union liberal ndp alliance that is the canadian ruling class s key political mechanism for enforcing its imperialist interests at home and abroad the teamsters are endeavouring to unionize workers at a series of ontario fulfillment centres including sites in cambridge milton london and kitchener and the nisku fulfillment centre near edmonton alberta the teamsters bureaucracy has committed vast resources to this operation which was initiated at the union s international convention in june 2021 and is backed by the biden administration and trudeau government if the high paid officials who staff the teamsters apparatus want to establish the union as the bargaining agent for the hundreds of thousands of ruthlessly exploited amazon employees across north america it is to secure a new stream of dues money and contain and suppress all opposition to brutal working conditions within the state regulated pro employer collective bargaining system to achieve this the teamsters and their pseudo left promoters are cynically seeking to exploit workers justified anger over the horrendous working conditions that prevail in amazon s facilities workers are bullied into working at a hazardous back breaking pace docked for washroom breaks must adhere to gruelling work schedules and all for wages little above the minimum wage throughout the now two and a half year old covid 19 pandemic amazon workers have been forced to continue labouring with virtually no protections this has resulted in repeated massive outbreaks of the deadly virus in one infamous case amazon s brampton ontario heritage road fulfillment centre briefly shut down after recording 600 infections only because of a closure order from the local public health officer a successful struggle against a ruthless global conglomerate like amazon will require mobilizing workers collective power forging ties and developing a united struggle with amazon workers in the us and around the world and a challenge to the big business political establishment and the panoply of pro employer state institutions that enforce the exploitation of the working class the teamsters are organically incapable of and bitterly hostile to mounting such a struggle fightback does not even attempt to explain why bringing in such a notoriously corrupt nationalist anti worker outfit as the teamsters would represent any sort of victory to the workers as the world socialist web site previously noted in its analysis of the teamsters unionization drive the evolution of the teamsters over the past four decades provides a textbook example of how the entire union bureaucracy has developed into a mechanism for imposing the dictates of corporate management in workplaces across the united states and canada the teamsters enforce multi tier wage structures inadequate health benefits and mandatory overtime its promotion of economic nationalism makes a mockery of its boast to be an international union events in the intervening months have provided further confirmation of the correctness of this analysis in march cp rail workers set up the cp workers rank and file committee to combat the teamsters torpedoing of their struggle for improved scheduling and working conditions just hours after the rail giant had locked out 3 000 train engineers conductors and yard workers the teamsters arbitrarily imposed on them an anti democratic binding arbitration procedure overseen by the trudeau liberal government as a result cp rail workers are now burdened with a union contract that slashes their real wages and gives management free rein to continue with onerous and hazardous work practices underscoring the canadian teamster leadership s close ties to the federal liberal government they invited none other than chrystia freeland trudeau s finance minister and the leading war hawk in canada s government to address their june convention our assessment of the role of the teamsters and its attempt with fightback s enthusiastic support to hoodwink amazon workers into believing that it will use its considerable resources to challenge amazon and fight for their interests is based on an examination of the development of the class struggle in canada and around the world over the past four decades the nationally based pro capitalist unions proved incapable of mounting any progressive response to the globalization of capitalist production from the 1980s onwards they renounced their function as defense organizations of the working class which had won limited gains during the post second world war boom and instead have pressured workers to accept concessions to secure investments and enhance the global competitiveness of our employers this is exemplified by the dramatic decline in strikes and work days lost to strikes in all the advanced capitalist countries this decline moreover only accelerated during the last two decades as the ruling class imposed massive contract concessions eliminated large sections of industry and implemented wave after wave of austerity the transformation of the unions into appendages of corporate management and the state has been accompanied by a plunge in their memberships as workers especially the young and precariously employed shun organizations that function as labour syndicates imposing two tier wages and suppressing rank and file dissent in britain the trades union congress which had 13 million members at the end of the 1970s represents little more than 6 million in the us about 6 percent of private sector workers are unionized a rate akin to that at the beginning of the 20th century before the emergence of mass industrial unions as the result of the sit down strikes of the 1930s the international committee of the fourth international icfi since the beginning of the 1990s has anticipated and politically prepared for a resurgence of working class struggle it explained such a resurgence can and will only develop through a rebellion against the trade union apparatuses the establishment left parties and their pseudo left appendages like fightback and as an increasingly self conscious international movement fighting to unify workers struggles across national borders and continents this perspective has been confirmed in spades fightback s article championing the teamsters organization drive at amazon notes there has been a working class awakening in the united states what it neglects to say is that this awakening has taken the form of a rank and file upsurge in opposition to the union bureaucracy with workers time and again voting down union endorsed concessionary contracts moreover at volvo trucks john deere dana auto parts the bnsf railroad and in numerous other struggles rank and file committees supported by the socialist equality party the icfi s american section have emerged as the pole of opposition to the unions attempts to smother them based on this analysis and experiences we argued last october that amazon employees seeking to put an end to their slave like working conditions should establish rank and file committees to unify their struggle with workers around the world through the international workers alliance of rank and file committees we wrote a genuine working class struggle to enforce better working conditions against this global corporate giant can only be successful if it unifies amazon workers internationally as such an offensive develops it will inevitably come into conflict with bezos and other oligarchs who claim they have absolute power to dictate how and under what conditions workers are forced to labour and the capitalist governments who serve them it will unavoidably raise the question of which class rules society the rich oligarchs with their multi billion stock portfolios or workers seeking a livable wage and decent working conditions for this reason the struggle at amazon is above all a political one that can only be conducted on the basis of a socialist and internationalist program fightback defends the union bureaucracy fightback cannot entirely ignore the unending series of union sellouts and betrayals which have resulted in growing rank and file anger with the union bureaucracy however fightback s criticisms of the union leadership even if they sometimes employ the words bureaucrats and bureaucracy have nothing in common with marxism they present various symptoms of bureaucracy like conservatism corruption and the deleterious impact organizational pressures have on militant union leaders as its cause union betrayals are invariably described as unfortunate or mistakes that can be corrected by applying more pressure from below or by replacing bad union leaders fightback denies that the union bureaucracy constitutes a privileged social layer of state supported functionaries with interests different and opposed to those of the workers they purport to represent not only does the bureaucracy pay itself upper middle class incomes in response to the deepening capitalist crisis it has sought to uphold and expand its privileges by developing a vast network of corporatist and tripartite ties with big business and the state including through the development of multi billion dollar union investment funds the reason fightback cannot and will not lay bare the social interests of the union bureaucracy is because it speaks for sections of the privileged upper middle class thus for fightback the decline of the stifling grip enjoyed by the unions over the working class is something to be mourned and actively combatted rather than welcomed and politically encouraged by intensifying the struggle to build new genuine organizations of working class struggle their june 15 article laments unionization rates have been declining for decades while the situation is not as bad as in the united states where only 10 3 per cent of workers are unionized the unionization rate in canada has dropped from 37 6 per cent in 1981 to 30 9 per cent in 2021 the article goes on to hail the ostensibly independent amazon labor union alu which won an election to represent amazon workers at its staten island new york facility on the basis of promises to improve wages and workplace benefits the inspiring victory won by the independent amazon labor union was a david and goliath victory that sparked a wave of inspiration around the world fightback enthused fightback neglects to inform its readers that after its victory the alu and its leader chris smalls rapidly ditched their independent posturing smalls rushed off to washington for meetings with top afl cio bureaucrats and us president joe biden biden has declared himself a pro union president and established a high powered task force to promote unionization this is because he views the unions as crucial to suppressing the class struggle while his administration wages war on russia intensifies washington s military strategic offensive against china allows workers incomes to be slashed by price rises and supports the federal reserve in countering inflation by driving up unemployment following smalls trip to washington the alu s subsequent attempt to win representation at another new york facility went down to a crushing defeat fightback s focus on encouraging amazon unionization takes place as the retail giant is implementing a massive expansion of its canadian operations the company announced the establishment of an additional four facilities across ontario in april adding a further 4 500 employees to its workforce amazon opened 15 sites across the province in 2021 alone and now has over 50 nationwide fightback and their teamster allies are determined to bring this rapidly growing highly exploited and increasingly militant workforce under their political control to prevent amazon workers from taking their place in the front rank of the struggle against capitalist exploitation fightback s cheerleading for the alu like its endorsement of the teamsters is a product of the petty bourgeois anti working class political tradition it defends this organization whose cadre function as factions inside the pro war pro austerity ndp and québec solidaire a self described pro indépendentiste citizens party traces its roots back to a british based group led by ted grant that split from the fourth international in the late 1940s the grant group subsequently became among the most vociferous promoters of pabloism which the icfi was formed to fight in 1953 adapting to the post second world war restabilization of capitalism the pabloites wrote off the working class as an independent revolutionary force renouncing the program of the fourth international they argued that the stalinist bureaucracy the bourgeois nationalist movements in the colonial countries and the trade unions and the social democratic parties in the west could and would be transformed under mass pressure into the vehicles of socialist transformation the british trotskyists did intervene systematically in the labour party and the trade unions during the 1950s and 1960s they did so with the aim of helping the most politically advanced workers who continued to lend these organizations their active support to grasp the counter revolutionary character of the labour bureaucracies and thereby lay the foundation for the building of an independent revolutionary party capable of leading the working class to power by contrast grant and his followers developed entryism as a permanent strategic orientation their efforts were aimed not at politically educating workers through a struggle against the pro capitalist bureaucracies but to pressure these bureaucracies to the left and gain influence within them to this day the international marxist tendency imt and fightback are adamant that the workers and youth must remain oriented to and trapped within the unions and social democracy indeed the imt was established by ted grant and his disciple alan woods in 1993 after support for the british labour party and trade unions had collapsed as a result of their never ending betrayals with the express aim of upholding their perspective that the labour party must remain the predominant arena of political struggle for socialism in keeping with this anti working class orientation the imt was among the foremost promoters of jeremy corbyn s attempt to resuscitate the labour party on a tepid national reformist program after he was unexpectedly catapulted into the party leadership in 2015 by workers and youth seeking a means to fight austerity and war whilst the imt cheered him on and fightback urged that the ndp be corbynized corbyn capitulated to the right wing including by declaring his support for britain s nuclear weapons program and instructing labour councils to impose austerity after four years of cowardly retreats he handed the party back to the control of the hated blairites led by keir starmer fightback as the left flank of the liberal ndp trade union alliance fightback is among the most devoted of grant and woods acolytes on the global stage its cadres are fully paid up members of the ndp which it shamelessly promotes as a workers party based on its institutional ties to the trade unions it has continued to promote the lie that the ndp can be transformed into an instrument to fight for socialism as the social democrats have backed canadian imperialism s involvement in one us led war after another from yugoslavia and afghanistan to libya and have enforced austerity policies and balanced budgets whenever they have come to power at the provincial level the new democrats fully back the us nato proxy war against russia which threatens to spiral into a direct clash between nuclear powers this support has found its clearest expression in their entering a formal confidence and supply agreement with the liberal government last march with the explicit goal of providing political stability to the canadian bourgeoisie until june 2025 prime minister justin trudeau is using this political stability to supply ukraine with hundreds of millions of dollars of heavy weaponry to wage war with russia modernize the north american aerospace defence command and expand a massive rearmament program worth tens of billions of dollars to pay for waging war abroad and boost the competitive position of canadian capital amid an ever deepening economic crisis trudeau s liberals and his ndp allies are likewise committed to imposing savage austerity and inflation driven real wage cuts on the working class at home to enforce this agenda they are both relying on the trade unions to suppress mounting working class opposition imposing concession contracts and isolating and strangling strikes when they can t prevent them from breaking out one example of this is the unions repeated resort in recent months to binding arbitration to short circuit workers struggles fightback s role is to keep the working class under the political control of the trade unions and the ndp by corralling workers into vain efforts to make them fight and employing left and marxist rhetoric to excuse and cover up their betrayals fightback s bemoaning of the decline in union membership and urgent call for unionizing the non unionized resembles nothing so much as trudeau s insistence now echoed by biden and his task force on worker organizing and empowerment of the need to strengthen the trade unions for trudeau partnering with the unions has been a priority since he first came to power in november 2015 just days after being sworn in as prime minister trudeau became the first prime minister in five decades to address a meeting of the canadian labour congress executive and the heads of its principal affiliates in an interview soon after trudeau asserted canadians need to know that unions matter they need to know that unions are essential in the fight for fair wages canadians need a government which instead of attacking unions works with them to ensure that every canadian has a real and fair chance at success the intervening six years have demonstrated what this liberal union ndp alliance means in practice the unions supported the liberal government in renegotiating the north american free trade agreement so as to establish a more protectionist trade bloc to advance the interests of corporate canada around the world and lay the economic basis for us and canadian imperialism to wage war against their geostrategic rivals the unions and ndp worked hand in hand with trudeau s liberals to impose the profits before life pandemic policy bailing out the banks and big business to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars and keeping schools and businesses open as the deadly virus ran rampant so there was no interruption to the flow of corporate profits this homicidal policy has officially claimed the lives of over 43 500 canadians and now as the threat of world war grows with every passing day and the working class enters into mass struggles over the rising cost of living that are ever more directly posing the need for a political fight against the entire social order the canadian ruling elite s traditional preferred party of government has established a government alliance with the ndp with the unions enthusiastic support to strengthen their collaboration in defending the interests of canadian imperialism and suppressing the working class fightback s shameless promotion of the teamsters at amazon underscores that it is the left flank of the liberal ndp union alliance its key tasks are to strengthen the authority of the rotten unions at the very point where workers are beginning to break free from the straitjacket these pro capitalist organizations have imposed upon them for decades and prevent workers from taking up a political struggle by claiming that militant trade unionism will suffice to push the ndp and union bureaucracy to the left this is epitomized in fightback s response to the now more than five month old union backed liberal ndp confidence and supply agreement to date fightback has published just a single article that discusses in any substantive way this anti working class governmental alliance and it implications for the class struggle in that article published march 22 fightback leader alex grant placed on record his group s formal opposition to the deal between trudeau and ndp leader jagmeet singh he did so however from the standpoint that singh gained very little in his negotiations with trudeau resulting in a weak sauce agreement not that it is a flagrant betrayal of the class independence of the working class to prop up any capitalist government let alone one committed to waging imperialist war and austerity while grant gave singh a slap on the wrist for his poor negotiating skills he was completely silent on the unions enthusiastic support for the ndp deal to keep the trudeau government in office until june 2025 five months on one would continue to search the fightback website in vain for any criticisms of the union bureaucracy s role as architects and pillars of the ndp liberal governmental alliance significantly much of grant s article was given over to elaborating the conditions under which fightback would support a liberal ndp alliance he specifically cited fightback s support for the ndp s decision to back the paul martin minority liberal government s 2005 budget then ndp leader jack layton pompously termed this budget the first ndp budget because of a few modest social spending increases that the ndp had obtained in exchange for keeping the liberals in office needless to say these increases did nothing to reverse the devastating impact of the cuts to public and social services martin had imposed as chretien s finance minister between 1994 and 2002 even more tellingly the budget endorsed by fightback in 2005 and today some 17 years later included a 12 8 billion military spending increase over five years the largest in two decades the struggle for improved working conditions at amazon and throughout all sectors of the economy and against imperialist war and austerity can only go forward through the mobilization of the independent political power of the working class to unleash this power workers must build workplace rank and file committees independent of and in opposition to the pro corporate trade unions and fight to unify their struggles with workers around the world through the international workers alliance of rank and file committees on the basis of a socialist and internationalist program as a key element in this fight workers must resolutely oppose the liberal ndp trade union alliance and those like the pseudo left fightback group who politically cover up for it and serve as the publicists attorneys and recruiting agents for the labour bureaucracies that are its pillars

bitcoin could be poised for outsized gains if recent technical signals regarding mining hash rate are to be believed hash rate studied in various ways is used by crypto investors to try to figure out when the market might bottom one indicator known as hash ribbons recently flashed a buy signal according to one analyst bitcoin could be poised for outsized gains if recent technical signals are to be believed investors have been searching for a bottom to bitcoin since the cryptocurrency lost more than 60 of its value from the all time high of nearly 69 000 it hit in november nearly 2 trillion has been wiped off the entire crypto market in recent months get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters a measure of activity of bitcoin miners could give investors a clue as to where the digital currency is headed next miners validate transactions on the bitcoin network using highly specialized and power intensive computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles they are rewarded in bitcoin for their efforts as more bitcoin is mined solving these puzzles becomes more difficult during market slumps a depressed bitcoin price can make it unprofitable for many miners to continue operations they then sell some bitcoin to keep afloat but they also turn off their mining rigs to save money that has happened in the latest market slump and can be demonstrated by hash rate a measure of computational power used to mine bitcoin since mid may when the market really started to sell off the 30 day average hash rate a monthly average value fell more than 7 and at one point saw a 10 dip that signaled that miners were turning off their machines hash rate studied in various ways is used by crypto investors to try to figure out when the market might bottom because capitulation and a shakeout of the miners is often associated with the late stage of a bitcoin cycle historically speaking capitulation in the mining market has tended to correspond strongly with overall market bottoms matthew kimmell digital asset analyst at coinshares told cnbc via email hash rate and a buy signal following on from this charles edwards founder of quantitative crypto fund capriole investments came up with the idea of hash ribbons in 2019 to identify buying opportunities for bitcoin when the 30 day moving average for hash rate dips below the 60 day moving average this is called a bearish cross and signals that miners are shutting down machines usually selling is associated with these events as more miners are taken out of the market the difficulty of mining bitcoin reduces because there is less competition because of the reduced competition more miners may re enter the market and a recovery may occur these capitulations are painful events for miners within the ecosystem edwards told cnbc but using edwards method when the 30 day moving average for hash rate crosses back above the 60 day moving average the worst of the miner capitulation tends to be over when this happens along with the 10 day moving average price of bitcoin going above the 20 day moving average price then this is when a buy signal flashes according to edwards he said those crosses occurred on saturday in the past buying bitcoin at these points would have yielded strong returns depending on how long you held the cryptocurrency for according to edwards for example purchasing bitcoin at the buy signal of august 2016 would have given an investor a more than 3 000 return if held to the peak of december 2018 which was at the time when bitcoin hit a new record high more recently buying during the recent buy signal in august 2021 would have yielded a more than 50 return if bitcoin was sold at the november 2021 record high i created hash ribbons in 2019 as a way to identify when major bitcoin mining capitulation had occurred as once recovery resumes from these events they typically mark major bitcoin price bottoms edwards said historically these have been great times to allocate into bitcoin with incredible returns kimmell from coinshares said that the logic behind the buy signal is that if the bitcoin price tends to steadily outpace hashrate before a period of high price growth then a trending rebound in hashrate marked by the 30 day moving average for hash rate crossing above the 60 day moving average it may mean the rebound in bitcoin price has already begun i find this metric should not be solely relied upon to make an investment decision but can certainly be helpful if coupled with a suite of other metrics and qualitative evidence he added bottom near coinshares has put together a graph to show the correlation between hash rate and the bitcoin price and it is split into areas where there is gold rush as bitcoin s price rises and a subsequent inventory flush and miners shakeout as the price declines in a chart provided to cnbc coinshares suggests that the market is currently in the shakeout period which typically precedes rebalancing and a rally in prices right now according to the chart the bitcoin price line is below the hash rate coinshares but this could signal a bottom is near according to kimmell it is impossible to say if we have reached full capitulation however there is evidence we are in the phase of the mining cycle where capitulation most often occurs secondarily if previous cycles carry predictive power then yes bitcoin price steadily outpacing hashrate would likely precede a period of high price growth kimmell said vijay ayyar vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange luno holds a similar view i think we have seen broad signs of capitulation given the events in the previous months hence it is likely we could have the beginnings of a bottom being formed usually bitcoin consolidates in a range for a whole which indicates accumulation which is what we may be seeing ayyar told cnbc via text message bitcoin has been trading in a tight range of around 18 000 to 25 000 since mid june however there are risks that these indicators do not prove as positive as they have been in the past because of the broader macroeconomic environment the current global economy is in a very different state versus previous cryptocurrency cycles there is rampant inflation and rising interest rates globally aspects which have not been present before risk assets such as u s stocks and in particular the nasdaq to which bitcoin is closely correlated have seen a big sell off this year of course all this is still based on historical similarity and we are in a different macro environment ayyar said the major risk remains the economy and inflation but even then we are closer to an inflation peak than not and hence this also shows that on risk assets we are closer to a bottom than not

texas bans local state government entities from doing business with firms that boycott fossil fuels was first published by the texas tribune a nonprofit nonpartisan media organization that informs texans and engages with them about public policy politics government and statewide issues sign up for the brief our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential texas news texas banned 10 financial firms from doing business with the state after comptroller glenn hegar said wednesday that they did not support the oil and gas industry hegar a republican running for reelection in november banned blackrock inc and other banks and investment firms as well as some investment funds within large banks such as goldman sachs and jp morgan from entering into most contracts with state and local entities after hegar s office said the firms boycott the fossil fuel sector hegar sent inquiries to hundreds of financial companies earlier this year requesting information about whether they were avoiding investments in the oil and gas industry in favor of renewable energy companies the survey was a result of a new texas law that went into effect in september and prohibits most state agencies as well as local governments from contracting with firms that have cut ties with carbon emitting energy companies state pension funds and local governments issuing municipal bonds will have to divest from the companies on the list though there are some exemptions hegar said the environmental social and corporate governance esg movement has produced an opaque and perverse system in which some financial companies no longer make decisions in the best interest of their shareholders or their clients but instead use their financial clout to push a social and political agenda shrouded in secrecy hegar said in a written statement on wednesday new york based blackrock which has publicly embraced investing more in renewable energy criticized hegar s decision this is not a fact based judgment a spokesperson for the company said in a written statement blackrock does not boycott fossil fuels investing over 100 billion in texas energy companies on behalf of our clients proves that elected and appointed public officials have a duty to act in the best interests of the people they serve the spokesperson added politicizing state pension funds restricting access to investments and impacting the financial returns of retirees is not consistent with that duty the other nine companies banned completely are bnp paribas sa a french international banking group swiss based credit suisse group ag and ubs group ag danske bank a s a danish multinational banking and financial services corporation london based jupiter fund management plc a fund management group nordea bank abp a european financial services group based in finland schroders plc a british multinational asset management company and swedish banks svenska handelsbanken ab and swedbank ab the funds within larger companies are aimed at sustainable investing such as goldman sachs paris aligned climate us large cap equity etf and jp morgan s u s sustainable leaders fund texas energy experts said the intent of the law and wednesday s announcement was to punish financial firms that don t want to invest in the backbone of texas economy oil and gas but at the end of the day it s all about a rate of return said ed hirs an energy economist at the university of houston quite honestly fossil fuel companies in particular oil and gas companies have not been great performers in the stock market prior to this year the lone star chapter of the environmental group sierra club said hegar s climate denying publicity stunt will be costly for taxpayers major financial institutions like the ones on this list are beginning to recognize that investments in fossil fuels bring significant risk in the face of an inevitable clean energy transition and that addressing the financial risks of the climate crisis is essential to good business said sierra club fossil free finance campaign manager ben cushing the fact that the texas comptroller has arbitrarily picked a handful of companies that despite their climate commitments continue to have massive fossil fuel investments shows that this is nothing more than a political stunt at texas taxpayers expense james coleman an energy law professor at southern methodist university said there is political pressure driving both sides of this debate not just from those hoping to reign in fossil fuels but also from those worried that moving away from fossil fuels is an economic harm coleman said but coleman said that whenever the state limits the potential world that it can do business with that potentially leaves some returns on the table the actual impact on texas taxpayers is hard to predict said felix mormann a texas a m university school of law professor who studies energy and climate change he called wednesday s move a symbolic act by the comptroller to protest the rise of esg investing will this announcement give a boost to texas oil and gas companies morally perhaps mormann wrote in an email to the texas tribune but financially chevron exxonmobil and other texas oil and gas majors play in the global league in other words i strongly doubt that the comptroller is setting off the next oil and gas boom in texas as political campaigning heats up ahead of the november elections hegar this week also accused harris county of slashing its spending on its constables offices even though those offices would get big boosts to their budgets under a proposed budget republicans used hegar s accusation as an opportunity to criticize county judge lina hidalgo the county s democratic chief executive who is seen as a rising star in the party as she faces a reelection battle in november last week hegar announced he supports texas repealing state taxes on menstrual products such as tampons and sanitary pads a

new york us senate democrats compromise bill the inflation reduction act ira of 2022 addresses not just inflation but also several key longstanding problems facing our economy and society there is a simmering debate about the causes of today s inflation but regardless of what side one takes this bill represents a step forward for those worried about excessive demand there is more than 300 billion in deficit reduction and on the supply side the bill would mobilise 369 billion of investments in energy security and de carbonisation that will help bring down the cost of energy one of the main drivers of current price growth and put america back on track to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by some 40 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030 these investments will yield far reaching returns the costs of climate driven events wildfires hurricanes tornados and floods will reduce our standard of living even more than today s inflation will and they are disproportionately borne by lower income households people of colour and future generations these costs are far larger and more difficult to rectify than the costs of deficits moreover enhancing energy security has become essential for far too long authoritarian leaders of petrostates have been able to hold the rest of the world hostage russian president vladimir putin has reminded us once again that energy interdependencies come with serious risks something i warned about more than 15 years ago weather may be variable but fossil fuel dictators are unreliable and downright dangerous the ira also would help address the rising health care costs that have long plagued america both by lowering affordable care act obamacare premiums for millions of americans and by capping out of pocket drug costs for those on medicare the pharmaceutical industry has received tens of billions of dollars more from medicare payouts than it otherwise would simply because the government is prohibited from negotiating for lower prices this gift to the industry will finally be rescinded yielding savings of almost 300 billion over ten years the united states is one of the world s leading sources of pharmaceutical innovation and much of the basic research behind these advances was paid for by american taxpayers yet americans pay much more for prescription drugs than people in other countries partly because drug companies have been given an unbridled power to set prices many of us have been fighting for years to curb these firms undue market power if the ira becomes law this provision alone would be a signal achievement furthermore the bill would deliver sorely needed improvements to us tax policy corporations and the wealthiest households are not paying their fair share of taxes that not only erodes confidence in our democracy but also is economically inefficient tax revenues are necessary to finance essential public expenditures without generating inflationary deficits russia s invasion of ukraine has reminded us why defense expenditures are necessary but to preserve america s competitiveness we also must invest heavily in education research technology and infrastructure here the bill includes provisions that would raise more than 450 billion over a decade through a 15 per cent minimum corporate tax increased tax enforcement and the introduction of a 1 per cent excise tax on stock buybacks the 15 per cent minimum corporate tax is especially important the us has led a global negotiation to curtail the practice of a few governments cutting special deals for corporations so that they can siphon tax revenues and jobs from other countries and compete in a race to the bottom in tax rates a race in which the only winners are the multinational corporations a 15 per cent us minimum corporate tax will not only raise badly needed revenue it will also help stop this self defeating global race this is especially important for the us because it spares american jobs from unfair competition but the landmark global agreement that america forged is unlikely to move forward if america itself does not abide by its conditions from climate change and food insecurity to the fight for democracy in ukraine there are so many issues for which we need global cooperation like the climate measures the us minimum corporate tax is an important step in showing that we can be good global citizens of course some critics on the right many of them allied with drug companies other major corporations and the wealthy will argue that the ira will be inflationary and they will even produce models proving that that is the case but we know by now that bad models give bad predictions just look at the models that were marshalled in support of ronald reagan s tax cuts for the rich which they falsely claimed would increase revenues or donald trump s tax cuts for corporations which they falsely claimed would spur additional investment these predictable arguments against the ira s tax provisions are based on a flawed assumption namely that corporations will shift the burden of the minimum tax by raising prices and lowering wages but economists have long recognised that the current us corporation tax regime which allows firms to deduct virtually all costs including labour and capital is close to a pure profits tax and a longstanding presumption in economics is that a pure profits tax does not lead to either higher prices or lower wages this also implies that these taxes can be raised without fear of adverse effects either on inflation or investment the big distortions and gross inequities in the tax system come from inadequate enforcement and large loopholes and the ira at least makes progress on the first of these fronts while the full benefits of the ira will be realised only gradually over the coming years especially as we invest in the green transition some of its anti inflation effects could be felt almost immediately particularly in the case of the drug pricing provision since markets are forward looking even if imperfectly so the anticipation of increased renewable energy supply should lead to decreased fossil fuel prices today moreover according to some of the more prevalent theories anticipations of future inflation are a key determinant of current inflation so even the bill s slower moving inflation dampening provisions could have anti inflationary benefits today no bill is perfect in america s money driven politics there will always be compromises with special interests the ira is not as good as the original build back better bill which would have done more both to promote equitable growth and to fight inflation but we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good ultimately the ira is a very important step in the right direction joseph e stiglitz a nobel laureate in economics is university professor at columbia university and a member of the independent commission for the reform of international corporate taxation

after the kinks tapped into american music on 1971 s muswell hillbillies they continued to take inspiration from across the pond on its 11th album everybody s in show biz the lp was a direct product of the group being on the road and specifically allowed to tour in the u s again after being banned by the american federation of musicians during the mid 60s an initial fall 1969 return had been problematic with many shows canceled but subsequent u s treks were more successful and inspired ray davies sharp eye and keen wit we were touring back in america again that made a big difference guitarist dave davies ray s younger brother tells ucr it was a great way of getting back we were touring america and wanted to maximize it a lot of ideas came about just while we were touring america i think it gave ray a lot to write about ray had even greater initial ambitions in mind for the project beyond new music he took a camera to make what his brother calls a home movie it captured a lot of the comings and goings of touring just fun really the movie idea was scotched by the kinks new label rca though ray did manage to make a 45 minute documentary from the footage the 10 songs on everybody s in show biz meanwhile took often detailed stock of the band s travels from transportation to food here comes yet another day and sitting in my hotel are travelogue vignettes hot potatoes motorway and maximum consumption serve up ray s thoughts about the food he was presented with on the road the vaudevillian look a little on the sunny side was a slap at the kinks critics listen to the kinks hot potatoes and then there was the closing celluloid heroes an earnest but wry critique of hollywood stardom that dave considers one of ray s most beautiful pieces of course we were both in love with the movie industry and hollywood so it was obvious that ray was gonna write something that was a tribute to these great characters in the movies if you walk down hollywood boulevard you ll know what it s all about a lot of it was inspired by these great actors who inspired our music generally dave wasn t shut out as a writer on everybody s in show biz his rocking you don t know my name also drew from road experiences but was rooted in even darker terrain than his brother s tracks i was actually going through a bad time of it internally spiritually and psychologically having a breakdown while i was working really he acknowledges he ascribes some of his issues to lingering effects from a bad acid trip in 1969 in los angeles you don t know my name came out of one of my psychic aberrations of what the fuck am i doing feeling trapped but at the same time i wasn t able to get out of this weird place songwriting became like a therapy for me listen to the kinks you don t know my name musically meanwhile everybody s in show biz stayed in the rootsy americana lane the kinks explored with 1971 s muswell hillbillies with dave playing more acoustic guitar and banjo and adding some slide guitar to the mix the quintet was assisted again by the mike cotton sound a brass trio that was part of the previous album it gave me a chance to do a more americanized technique on the guitar a lot of things that were new definitely new to us dave recalls i ve always loved slide guitar he picked up the banjo from his father who used to play the instrument at family gatherings and events one of the first things i picked up actually was banjo he had a five string he used to play so it was destined to fit in somehow also distinguishing everybody s in show biz was the second disc of live recordings from shows on march 2 and 3 1972 at new york city s carnegie hall rather than hits the kinks second official live release featured four muswell hillbillies tracks oddities such as a bit of the title song from the broadway musical mr wonderful the harry belafonte popularized banana boat song the tin pan alley standard baby face and a brief tease of the kinks 1970 hit lola it was something that just worked out for us dave says crediting rca with supporting the endeavor it was a very productive time for us at rca he remembers rca really wanted to step up and promote the band and were up for the things we wanted to do listen to the kinks acute schizophrenia paranoia blues live at carnegie hall in 1972 that was certainly borne out over the next four years as the kinks would build on the thematic work of muswell hillbillies and everybody s in show biz with even more fully realized album and stage show concepts such as preservation act 1 and act 2 soap opera and schoolboys in disgrace none were great commercial successes but the everybody s in show biz single supersonic rocket ship was the group s last u k top 20 hit for more than a decade celluloid heroes despite critical acclaim and continuing radio play never charted everybody s in show biz and muswell hillbillies are being reissued on sept 9 separately and together in deluxe packages with bonus

by tetsushi kajimoto and takaya yamaguchi tokyo reuters japan is seeking to organise a sri lanka creditors conference hoping it could help solve the south asia nation s debt crisis but uncertainties cloud the outlook for any talks three people with knowledge of the planning said tokyo is open to hosting talks among all the creditor nations aimed at lifting colombo from its worst debt crisis since independence but it is not clear whether top creditor china would join and a lack of clarity remains about sri lanka s finances one source told reuters japan would be willing to chair such a meeting with china if that would speed up the process for addressing sri lanka s debt estimated at 6 2 billion on a bilateral basis at the end of 2020 this source said president ranil wickremesinghe told reuters last week that sri lanka would ask japan to invite the main creditor nations to talks on restructuring bilateral debts he said he would discuss the issue with prime minister fumio kishida in tokyo next month when he is expected to attend the funeral of the assassinated former premier shinzo abe tokyo the number two creditor has a stake in rescuing sri lanka not just to recoup its 3 billion in loans but also its diplomatic interest in checking china s growing presence in the region s p global this month downgraded sri lanka s government bonds to default after it missed interest and principal payments the island nation of 22 million people off india s southern tip with debt at 114 of annual economic output is in social and financial upheaval from the impact of covid 19 pandemic on top of years of economic mismanagement an international monetary fund imf team met wickremesinghe on wednesday to discuss a bailout including restructuring 29 billion in debt as colombo seeks a 3 billion imf aid programme the president met the same day with japan s ambassador tokyo believes a new platform is needed to pull creditors together the sources said sri lanka is running out of time since it defaulted on its debt the priority is for creditor nations to agree on an effective scheme one source said japan is keen to move this forward but it s not something japan alone can raise its hand and push through said the source adding that the cooperation of other nations was crucial japan s foreign ministry declined to comment sri lanka s central bank and finance ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment an imf spokesperson declined to comment new framework needed concerns include rivalry and territorial tensions between big creditors china and india while sri lanka would have to commit to reforming its finances and disclose more information about its debt the sources said last month shortly after wickremesinghe took office when his predecessor fled the country chinese president xi jinping wrote to him that he was ready to provide support and assistance to the best of my ability to president wickremesinghe and the people of sri lanka in their efforts but the sources said getting beijing s cooperation on a debt restructuring was complicated by factors such as a large number of lenders and that china was baulking at taking a haircut on its loans and at reducing colombo s debt burden a chinese foreign ministry spokesman told reuters that beijing was willing to stand with relevant countries and international financial institutions and continue to play a positive role in helping sri lanka respond to its present difficulties relieve its debt burden and realise sustainable development japan hopes to see a new debt restructuring framework resembling one set up by the group of 20 big economies targeting low income countries sri lanka does not fall under this common framework because it is classified as a middle income emerging country it must be a platform where all creditor nations participate to ensure they all shoulder a fair share in waiving debt another source said the third said until these conditions are met it would be difficult for any talks to succeed the common framework launched by the g20 and the paris club of rich creditor nations in 2020 provides debt relief mainly through extension in debt payment deadlines and reduction in interest payments some people involved think an initial creditors meeting could be held in september but one source said it would take a little while possibly several months restructuring talks are only possible after the imf scrutinises sri lanka s debt the sources said reporting by tetsushi kajimoto and takaya yamaguchi in tokyo additional reporting by yoshifumi takemoto and kentaro sugiyama in tokyo uditha jayasinghe in colombo eduardo baptista in beijing and david lawder in washington writing by leika kihara and tetsushi kajimoto editing by william mallard
