said the results should be verified in some way in 24 to 48 hours the test can be repeated at home to see if the test turns positive or the person can get a pcr test some employers she noted require a negative result from a pcr test because it is the most accurate if a person is at high risk for diseases dillaha recommended getting a pcr test because if the result is positive they may be eligible

news and opinion politicians on both sides of the aisle must never forget the importance of kitchen table items those issues which are of intense interest among voters such as wages jobs and health care costs president biden earned only tepid reviews in this department according to a cnbc change research survey which gauged voter sentiment the poll revealed that mr biden earned a d grade when it came to the economy jobs health care costs helping the middle class raising wages bolstering the wallet of a typical citizen and helping working parents afford child care this should be a wake up call for biden and democrats there is overwhelming frustration with the direction of the economy and biden earns c s or d s on every measure in this poll from the macro level to kitchen table issues the poll analysis reported trump voters express strong disapproval of biden and rate the economy negatively as they have since the day biden took office but biden earns such remarkably low marks because his own voters are unsatisfied they see and feel the rising cost of everything despite record corporate profits not the impact of the american rescue plan or the bipartisan infrastructure investment package and they are frustrated with the lack of progress on a democratic policy agenda the analysis said mr biden s report card did not display any a or b grades whatsoever the president earned a c for his coronavirus policies for the state of the stock market job creation infrastructure investment and helping the middle class the cnbc change research poll of 1 895 registered u s voters was conducted dec 17 20 and released sunday don t forget voter s remorse president biden would lose an election rematch to former president donald trump according to a heartland institute rasmussen reports national survey if the presidential election were held today a mere 40 of likely u s voters would vote to reelect mr biden while 46 would pick mr trump another 10 would choose some other candidate in a biden trump rematch there s some fierce favoritism as 81 of republican voters supported mr trump and 75 of democrats would vote for mr biden the pivotal role of the independent voter also came into play however among voters not affiliated with either major party however trump would win by a 16 percentage point margin with 45 to biden s 29 of the vote the poll analysis said there s another factor involved however less than one year into his presidency 52 of likely voters have an unfavorable impression of president biden this is astounding given the fact that the mainstream has given biden the benefit of the doubt so often and glossed over his administration s utter failures concerning the pandemic inflation foreign policy et cetera said chris talgo senior editor and research fellow at the heartland institute on the other hand 51 of likely voters now have a favorable opinion of former president trump in fact more likely voters would vote for trump over biden if the next presidential election were held today it seems like american voters are experiencing a classic case of voter s remorse mr talgo said the survey of 1 016 u s likely voters was conducted jan 5 the trump less news the public appears to be losing its taste for nonstop news a significant axios comparison of audience engagement throughout 2020 and 2021 finds that social media interactions with news stories fell by 65 one year to the next the number of primetime cable news viewers dropped by 36 downloads of popular news apps has dropped by a third and unique visits to popular news sites were down by 8 engagement with news content plummeted in 2021 compared to 2020 and given the ongoing decline in interest in news about covid 19 and politics it doesn t look like 2022 will be much better why it matters the trump era and the onset of the covid 19 pandemic created a one of a kind media moment that will be hard for news companies to replicate noted axios analysts sara fischer and neal rothschild the analysis used data from newswhip apptopia similarweb and nielsen media research to compare the years the analysis was released jan 4 hillary s perfect storm it only took one op ed in the wall street journal suggesting hillary clinton was fit to run for president in 2024 to prompt a media frenzy over the idea hillary clinton s 2024 election comeback joe biden and kamala harris have become unpopular it may be time for a change noted the op ed penned by douglas e schoen and andrew stein who also said a perfect storm is brewing in the democratic party schoen and stein conclude their piece by arguing that if democrats want a fighting chance at winning the presidency in 2024 mrs clinton is likely their best option if that is true the democratic party is in more trouble than we thought wrote national review senior writer charles c w cooke cnn columnist chris cillizza though wrote that it s worth noting that neither schoen nor stein have sterling credentials as democrats schoen worked for former new york city mayor michael bloomberg while stein endorsed none other than donald trump in the 2016 election against wait for it hillary clinton their backgrounds should give you pause about their intentions and their analysis of the state of the democratic party and the 2024 field he advised it is of note that former fox news anchor bill o reilly predicted in late 2021 that mrs clinton wants the presidential nomination it is also of note that her official website hillaryclinton com still prominently displays a section called hillary s vision for america it includes 41 sections outlining her progressive friendly policy on everything from climate change and criminal justice reform to voting rights and wall street reform poll du jour 34 of u s voters say they

an investor s victory over robinhood last week in a finra arbitration case involving last year s meme stock trading halt could provide a road map for future claims although experts caution that it s too early to tell nearly a year ago robinhood restricted transactions in certain stocks as a result of unprecedented volume during a trading frenzy involving gamestop and other shorted stocks since then several investors have filed claims against the online brokerage in the financial industry regulatory authority inc s arbitration system for losses related to the trading interruption robinhood had an undefeated record on those claims until jose batista a 27 year old truck driver prevailed on jan 6 a sole finra arbitrator ordered robinhood to pay batista 29 460 77 in compensatory damages batista argued that when robinhood placed prohibitions on purchasing stocks of some publicly traded companies on jan 28 2021 it caused the value of those shares including koss and exper which batista held to plummet we were thrilled for mr batista and his family that the arbitrator really made it right said august iorio a partner at iorio altamirano who represented batista we think this is a groundbreaking win in the industry and we hope to see more like it when news about the award got out early this week iorio s phone started to buzz with inquiries from aggrieved investors he said he received more than 100 calls on tuesday now there s an overwhelming interest iorio said a robinhood spokesperson declined to comment arbitration hopefuls shouldn t get too excited about their chances of winning experts said in the finra arbitration system individual decisions don t set a precedent and there s no case law to guide arbitrators it s still early said christine lazaro a professor at the st john s university school of law and director of its securities arbitration clinic it s hard to predict future outcomes based on one decision batista s win isn t necessarily a harbinger of more victories for robinhood investors because their claims could be different from his said andrew stoltmann a chicago securities attorney each of these cases is so fact specific that you can t read too much into this stoltmann said winning strategy iorio s winning approach could be a strategy that is adopted in other claims against robinhood he said the key was taking a conservative approach and following where the discovery process led the case included two hearing sessions rather than trying to prove robinhood halted trading in some sort of collusion with a third party iorio argued that it used flawed liquidity and risk management leading up to the trading halt it wasn t prepared for the volatility that hit last january and that caused significant investor losses these online broker dealers have a responsibility to investors beyond providing the platform iorio said stoltmann said that proving robinhood was involved in a conspiracy related to the trading restrictions would be difficult it may look good on paper but there s a proof problem he said familiar language the trading restriction cases pose challenges because they re not typical suitability disputes it s a hard claim to articulate lazaro said it s not a claim that arbitrators typically see iorio cited causes of action that often are found in finra arbitration claims such as breach of contract breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment it helps when an attorney can frame the claim using language arbitrators will be familiar with in other types of securities cases lazaro said most of the investors who have lost their claims against robinhood represented themselves but three were represented by nathan c volheim volheim did not respond to a request for comment batista s claim was heard under the special proceeding option for simplified cases it could be a year before the bigger ones are decided lazaro said robinhood could fare better in those cases or maybe batista has provided a pathway for investor success the more cases that go to hearing the clearer the playbook will become on how to beat them like a pinata stoltmann said robinhood has to be careful not to sprain its wrist patting itself on the back for its early wins

contributor richard gunner one of the side effects of living through a particularly severe covid 19 outbreak is that in addition to people becoming ill certain industries have come to a grinding halt due to staffing issues we ve seen this play out in a number of places but there has been considerable attention paid naturally to the gaps in food production if you ve found your usual cuts of meat are not available to purchase as an example here s a guide to expanding your choices from the onglet or butcher s cut to the flat iron and skirt steak there are tons of cuts available that can work as a substitute to your standard sirloin in this guide we look at 23 different cuts of beef in detail and explain everything you need to know about cooking the perfect steak for the perfect steak after selecting the steak cut that appeals to you the most and there are plenty to choose from follow a few key tips every time you cook steaks and you can t go wrong ensure your grilling surface is hot whether using a pan a cast iron griddle or the bbq we like to use a flat surface to get the best caramelised crust on steaks in our house brush the steak with extra virgin olive oil and season with salt flakes before it goes on the hot surface seasoning the steak will reduce smoke and the salt on the hot surface is where that delicious crust will come from don t crowd your pan it is a common mistake to have too many steaks cooking together or too close to each other a crowded pan will result in stewing and spoil your steaks we won t go too much into how long each side should be cooked here as it depends on the cut and the thickness of the steak but there are tools out there to help you with that steakmate is a very handy mobile app for timing when to turn your steaks based on how you like them this is particularly handy when you are grilling to order for a crowd and have a lot to remember when turning your steak that first time please be sure to turn it onto a clean part of the grill this is so you can let a crust form on the other side if your pan is crowded or too small you won t get that wonderful caramelisation on both sides while turning once isn t a bad rule of thumb it isn t as essential as once thought provided you have a clean dry grill surface to turn onto this is the big one always rest your steak before serving preferably standing on its side we lean our steaks against a handy olive oil bottle or gently clamped at the base in tongs it sounds odd but it will made a difference as the steak is not them sitting on a chopping board in its own pool juices which once again spoils that crust a general rule for cooking all red meats is to rest the cooked product half as long as it took to cook it it is always simpler to factor in resting time into your overall cooking so you re not tempted to throw steaks straight from the pan onto plates for hungry guests resting makes all the difference as the juices settle and the meat will be more tender you also won t have juices leaking into the mashed potato or salad if your steak is well rested there are different breeds production methods preparation styles and even aging techniques that all impact your eating experience it may sound overwhelming but after following our basic tips on how to select and cook different cuts you ll be well on your way to being a beef master feast fine foods hosts butchery classes in adelaide so you can prepare your own steaks at home some of the very best beef in the world is grown here in australia and we think you ll be just as passionate as us about it if you make friends with your butcher and start having some fun in the kitchen traditional meat cuts t bone the t bone is made up of two muscles in the striploin the sirloin and the fillet with the bone kept in this is the true beef lovers choice as you get both steaks and the benefit of cooking meat on the bone cooking tips for this cut of meat best cooked hot and fast on the bbq or fry pan rest the steak before serving standing on the flat of the bone if you can sirloin also known as porterhouse and new york steak this also comes from the striploin but without the bone this muscle can be left whole cooking tips for this cut of meat follow the tips for the perfect steak above and you can t go wrong the sirloin roast is a wonderful thing ideal when you have a crowd to feed eye fillet also known as tenderloin taken from the beef tenderloin this part of the animal does not work as hard so while tender these muscles are usually less flavoursome than others this is a classic cut served often but not a favourite in our house where we prioritise flavour over tenderness cooking tips for this cut of meat cook as per the perfect steak tips above this cut can also be roasted as a whole muscle and sliced into steaks after resting this is the heart of a beef wellington rump steak as its name implies this comes from the rump of the animal one of the most flavoursome steak cuts as the rump muscle works hard on a beef animal in a rump you are getting three muscles so will find a slight difference from one end to the other cooking tips for this cut of meat in our house we usually cook two big rumps and share them between our family of four the trick is to cook the rumps as per our tips we use two pans then slice the steak after resting it is fantastic then as a steak salad blade steak this is taken from the shoulder blade this cut is a little tougher but has great flavour cooking tips for this cut of meat the blade steak is well suited to cooking a little slower over lower heat than your standard steak and taken all the way to medium less traditional meat cuts you may be less familiar with these steak cuts but you should definitely give them a try just ask your butcher they should know them onglet also known as hanger in the usa sometimes also called the butcher s cut because it is that good on the carcass it hangs under the tenderloin and supports the diaphragm it s is one of the most flavoursome steak cuts of all cooking tips for this cut of meat it does require some small tweaks in cooking and is not a steak that suits being cooked past medium this cut is best cooked fast and hot with a good long rest to allow the juices to settle you should be looking to rest it for nearly as long as it was on the hot grill another tip is to make sure you locate the grain of the hanger and slice across it for an even more tender result flat iron also called a feather steak it comes from the oyster blade which is connected to the shoulder blade of the beef some skilled butchery is required of the oyster blade to prepare this cut so ask your butcher once all the silverskin and gristle is removed from an oyster blade it actually becomes a delicious tender often well marbled steak that compares in quality to scotch fillet cooking tips for this cut of meat a flat iron can be cooked as per any other steak and is probably best cooked past rare and as much as medium well done skirt steak a favourite of the south americans skirt steak the skirt steak comes from the diaphragm muscle attached to the 6th through 12th ribs on the underside of the short plate of the carcass it has a tough texture but is prized for its flavour cooking tips for this cut of meat the best way to cook skirt steak could best be described as slow chargrilling over charcoal is the best way to get maximum flavour but taking your time and grilling to medium and slicing across the grain will also add to a truly flavoursome steak experience skirt is probably the toughest of these lesser known steak options but certainly makes up for it in extra flavour brilliant with chimichurri sauce flank steak also known as bavette in france as its name suggests this cut comes from the animal s flank this is a very lean cut that suits slow chargrilling in the same manner as skirt cooking tips for this cut of meat while it is important to slice across the grain the resultant steak is a little more tender than you will find with the skirt best enjoyed medium rare or rare short ribs while not a steak cut we felt we couldn t ignore our household s favourite cut that is so well suited to summer cooking even if no bbq is required on the carcass bone in short ribs sit below the sirloin short ribs are cut either parallel to the bone english style or across the bone flanken style flanken style is the preferred cut for the korean dish kalbi cooking tips for this cut of meat for our favourite dish we go with a korean style of short rib which means cooking low and slow in a master stock don t be alarmed it isn t hard to do you just may need to shop for a key ingredient or two but there are a number of recipes out there preparing a master stock is simple and the ribs will emerge a few hours later lip smackingly good you can reuse your stock too we skim and then freeze ours what could be better sitting outside on a balmy summer evening with cold beers and

and this morning s softer than expected chinese inflation numbers today s us cpi numbers have done little to change sentiment despite coming in at their highest levels in nearly 40 years at 7 perhaps there is a sense that this morning s china numbers which slid back more than expected on both cpi and ppi in december could be a leading indicator that global inflationary pressures might be starting to diminish that seems a little premature however with us cpi coming in as expected it s a compelling narrative on a day when the mood is positive and long term yields have dropped back mining shares

the biggest jump since 1982 this reading will put further pressure on the fed to start tightening policy and the narrative around four rate rises this year is likely to be strengthened said dan boardman weston from bri wealth management but he added inflation will start falling from may june as energy prices start to have weaker impact on the overall level of inflation the economy is in a strong position at the moment and it should be able to cope with four rate increases whether the market will take tighter policy in its stride is another matter but our expectation is that the monetary policy induced volatility will abate and that the strength of the economy will positively impact markets the strong start on wall street has given more support to the ftse 100 which is now up

indices across europe and asia pushing ahead following a similar performance on wall street last night driving confidence were remarks by federal reserve chairman jay powell that the central bank would do everything it could to stop inflation running out of control the ftse 100 traded 0 6 higher with miners dominating the index s top performers the top six risers were all metal producers and this sector is a bellwether for global economic activity risk appetite appears to have returned given how more stodgy companies like bt reckitt benckiser and imperial brands were among the fallers on the ftse instead investors were more interested in bidding up some of the tech plays which have been beaten up recently including scottish mortgage also in vogue were a slew of consumer facing companies riding high after upbeat trading statements these included sainsbury s which upgraded its profit guidance j sainsbury plc lse sbry has lost some of its early gains but is still up 1 43 elsewhere homeware retailer dunelm group plc lse dnlm is up 5 after a record performance in its second quarter with sales up 13 mould said the pandemic has arguably been favourable to dunelm in some respects we re spending more time indoors and are therefore more likely to want to upgrade our furniture bedding or curtains a key plank of the transformation of dunelm under chief executive nick wilkinson has been an improvement and expansion in online sales that has really helped during periods when footfall in its stores has either been reduced or wiped out entirely thanks to restrictions or people s reluctance to go out the fact that dunelm was able to boost profitability in the period despite cost pressures is testament to the quality of its product range and how it is resonating with consumers it has also ensured good product availability by maintaining a high level of inventory 8 28am sainsbury leads the way after strong christmas j sainsbury plc lse sbry is leading the ftse 100 risers after the supermarket raised its full year profit guidance after stronger than expected christmas sales its shares are up 2 97 to 287 6p on the news richard hunter head of markets at interactive investor said while there are some clear reasons for cheer within the update there are also some concerning developments within general merchandise in particular against strong comparatives limited supply and weak demand in some of its key categories general merchandise sales at both argos and within the supermarket have fallen on both a one and two year basis sainsbury has highlighted particular declines in technology gaming and toy market sales with the well reported disruption to supply chain blockages playing its part despite these pressures sainsbury has been making some promising progress at the headline level its focus on price and service resulted in a market share gain over the period which implies some defence against the discounters who arguably provide the largest threat to the bread and butter business at the same time the progress of the company s online capability is clear to see with online grocery sales up by 92 as compared to pre pandemic demonstrating a shift in both consumer behaviour and sainsbury s ability to deliver in all sainsbury may be given the benefit of the doubt structural cost savings and better than expected grocery volumes have resulted in an upgrade to guidance for full year pre tax profit to a figure of 720mln from the previously estimated 660mln also providing support to the market are the miners boosted by hopes the global economy will continue to recover and helped by the comments from fed chair powell bhp group plc lse bhp is 2 24 better while antofagasta plc lse anto has added 1 94 elsewhere the rise on nasdaq has lifted tech investor scottish mortgage investment trust plc lse smt by 1 76 8 19am market back to pre pandemic levels leading shares have hit their highest level for nearly two years adding to yesterday s gains which mainly came in the wake of a turnaround on wall street with investors continuing to worry about inflation and today s us numbers will be widely watched there was some comfort from the comments of federal reserve chair jerome powell at a congressional hearing powell seemed to play down any premature action by the central bank despite recent suggestions of up to four rate rises this year more than previously expected ipek ozkardeskaya senior analyst at swissquote said global equities breathed a sigh of relief yesterday as the federal reserve chair jerome powell said at his congressional confirmation yesterday that he could pull off the hard task of fighting back inflation without damaging the economy he soothed investors nerves saying that the fed is just going to be moving over the course of this year to a policy that is closer to normal but it s a long road to normal from where they are now with that background the ftse 100 has added 43 26 points or

benchmarks find their feet after recent falls ig markets sees london s blue chip benchmark around 51 points higher making the price 7 537 to 7 540 with just over an hour to go until the start of trading the market s attention broadly remains on inflation and the likely central bank responses to rising prices and at the same time the threat of economic stagnation amidst pandemic restrictions the recent decision by the federal reserve to accelerate its tapering program to 30bn a month confirmed that fed officials are now much more worried about inflation than it is about the labour market said michael hewson analyst at cmc markets with a march rate hike now almost a done deal today s us cpi is likely to be a key signpost in the wider discussion on how many more hikes are coming down the pipe as central banks wrestle with a dilemma of rising price pressures the risks of an economic slowdown caused by tighter restrictions and a decline in consumer confidence on wall street stocks

updated january 12 2022 at 4 37 pm et no you re not imagining it some grocery store shelves are bare again conjuring bad memories of spring 2020 for many social media is rife with images of empty supermarket aisles and signs explaining the lack of available food and other items stores such as aldi have apologized to customers for the shortages the reasons for the dwindling stock are numerous according to food industry analysts and include some issues that impacted retailers at the beginning of the pandemic as well as challenges that have cropped up more recently we re really seeing the perfect storm phil lempert editor of the website supermarketguru com told npr lempert said the northeast is facing some of the worst shortages now due in part to recent winter storms that snarled transportation routes but that could change with the weather but nate rose the communications director for the california grocers association said any comparison to march 2020 is not quite right there are some issues with out of stocks but it tends to be a situation where if you go to a store on a tuesday night maybe something s out of stock but by wednesday sometime it s back in store rose told npr everyone s become really reliant on kind of that just in time supply chain he added and i think what we re seeing is things are just behind a little bit right now some conservatives have begun using the hashtag bareshelvesbiden to blame the current administration for the shortages even though grocery stores experienced serious supply problems under president donald trump too here are some of the reasons driving the current supply shortages at your local supermarket the omicron variant the highly contagious new covid 19 variant that s causing record infections in the u s is undoubtedly one of the biggest stressors on the food industry right now grocery store workers are catching the virus in higher numbers and calling out sick making it tougher for markets to keep shelves stocked the stores themselves are finding it harder to source products because of the new strain vivek sankaran ceo of the grocery store chain albertson s said in an earnings call that the company had been hoping to recover from recent supply issues but omicron put a dent in that there are more supply challenges and we would expect more supply challenges over the next four to six weeks sankaran said on tuesday it s more than grocery stores though there are workers all across the food industry supply chain who are getting sick and staying home impacting food production manufacturing shipping and distribution the food company conagra the parent company of brands such as duncan hines and healthy choice is just one seeing a rise in omicron driven absenteeism president and ceo sean connolly said in an earnings call last week it s entirely reasonable for all of us to project that the next month or so could remain strained within the supply chain as omicron runs its course connolly said labor shortages in addition to workers becoming infected with covid 19 there are those who have simply quit lempert said the pandemic has turned grocery stores into battlefields with employees required to work in person throughout the pandemic explain food shortages and new public health measures to customers and try to keep themselves safe and healthy in the process as a result of that a lot of people said hey i don t need this and they ve left their jobs in the supermarket lempert said a recent survey conducted by the national grocers association found that many of its member retail and wholesale grocers reported operating their stores with 50 of their normal workforce supermarkets are beginning to offer higher pay better benefits and even tighter security to attract new applicants lempert said trucking and shipping truckers are also in short supply though there s some dispute about how bad the situation really is trucking companies are offering higher wages to attract workers but employment levels still aren t high enough to meet the demand for ground transport in december the white house announced a plan to bolster the trucking industry including making it easier for drivers to get commercial driver s license or cdls severe weather and climate change climate change isn t a new problem but it s one that s still vexing the food industry severe weather events are becoming more frequent and intense across the world as the planet warms according to lempert growers are yielding less corn and soy to feed farm animals which is having a downstream impact on the price and availability of meat eggs and dairy products in brazil heavy rains are inundating coffee fields and other crops which is limiting production severe weather is also making it harder to move food around recent storms in washington state prompted the closure of major roads and slowed the shipping of food to alaska where supermarkets told customers the one two punch of severe weather and shipping delays were to blame for barren shelves copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
prince andrew is a man who has run out of road he has two stark options drag his family through the mud or pay up the time for denials evasion and waffling has ended after judge kaplan dismissed the duke s attempt to have virginia giuffre s civil case alleging she was forced to have sex with him when a minor thrown out randy andy must make a life changing decision does he conform to his previous pig headed stereotype and hope this messy business will all go away continue to claim he has no recollection of ever meeting miss giuffre even though the world has seen the photograph of his arm encircling her waist persist with a bizarre no sweating alibi as proof he didn t go to a nightclub the night in question even though he s not presented any medical evidence only a truly dumb arrogant individual would do such a thing sadly prince andrew fits that description ms giuffre has been given permission to go ahead and sue for battery and emotional distress she alleges convicted paedophile jeffrey epstein forced her to have sex with his friends including the duke and seeks substantial damages for distress and battery now both sides will prepare their arguments setting out their evidence and who they propose to call as expert witnesses by the end of july a trial date is set for september janet street porter prince andrew is a man who has run out of road he has two stark options drag his family through the mud or pay up to further her case miss giuffre could call prince charles the duke s ex wife sarah ferguson and women who are known to have had a sexual relationship with the prince andrew might manage to evade going to new york in person but he would have to submit to questioning from her legal team about his close friendship with the convicted sex offenders ghislaine maxwell and jeffrey epstein who committed suicide in his prison cell in august 2019 details of his sexual preferences would surely form part of her case the prospect of the wonderfully eccentric i m being kind sarah ferguson testifying in andrews defence could be even more entertaining than the recent episodes of succession fergie is a lovely woman but utterly naïve who can forget she gave the world those toe sucking headlines following her divorce from andrew since then she s tottered from one financial crisis to the next flogging dieting appearing in reality tv shows and writing children s books andrew persuaded jeffrey epstein to help with a 15 000 to pay off a former assistant so that her other debts if 5million could be restructured sarah has since apologised for taking the money saying my judgement was clouded immune to criticism fergie is defending her ex husband to anyone who will listen the couple are close pals even though divorced and share a royal lodge at windsor rented from the crown estate when the queen refused to pay andrew s legal bills he was forced to flog the only home he owned an 18million swiss chalet mind you he had to pay the former owner the 6million he had owed for so long she was threatening legal action airmiles andy and goofy fergie are characters beloved of comedians and dramatists and both seem blissfully unaware of how they appear to the outside non royal world janet street porter after judge kaplan dismissed the duke s attempt to have virginia giuffre s civil case alleging she was forced to have sex with him when a minor thrown out randy andy must make a life changing decision having met them both on several occasions and sat next to andrew at dinner i can confirm their utter lack of social skills sarah is charming and sweet but andrew worryingly dumb the virginia giuffre suit is a real life soap opera but at its heart are extremely serious allegations of sexual abuse and coercion the story of a young girl who says she was groomed to give older rich men pleasure whilst legally a child whatever really happened between virginia giuffre and prince andrew will be decided in court but the damage to his standing is devastating experts in dealing with reputational damage say his gamble to bad mouth giuffre has backfired and now his stock stands at rock bottom if andrew decides to contest the case he could harm the monarchy and it would certainly shine a light on aspects of his personal life and friendship choices no member of the royal family would willingly disclose what s left of his privacy would vanish it s well documented that prince andrew is not the smartest tool in the box that his brain cells barely outnumber the medals and honorary awards he s been given for a life notable for its lack of meaningful achievements following his retirement from the royal navy in 2001 andrew managed to rise to the rank of honorary vice admiral despite spending most of his time on a golf course or on a jet to somewhere hot and far away from the uk janet street porter matters can only get worse for the duke now he must decide whether to cough up and bow out forever any notion of riding out the storm vanished after his disastrous bbc interview with emily maitliss in 2019 when he steadfastly claimed that on the night of the photograph with miss giuffre when she says they visited a nightclub and had sex even though he knew she was 17 he was at home with his family following a visit to a pizza express in woking giuffre s legal team say they can produce a witness who says she saw the prince at tramp that night matters can only get worse for the duke now he must decide whether to cough up and bow out forever given that the palace has just announced a series of national events years in the planning to celebrate his mother s history making 70 year reign my money would be on option two on the 6th of february the queen will be 96 her official birthday is in june but every member of her immediate family will want to wish her well and support her after the lonely months following her husband s death in april last year the platinum jubilee celebrations are designed to whip the nation into a love fest and reignite our love of pageantry and history during a bank holiday weekend in june there will be a birthday parade with 1400 troops followed by an raf flypast beacons will be lit up and down the land there s will be the usual thanksgiving service followed by a day at the derby and a live rock concert from the mall on sunday street parties are planned and to top it all a competition is being held to choose the best platinum pudding to sum up everything that s great about britain and her majesty now where does someone who chose two convicted child sex offenders as his close friends and who took them to his mother s homes and paraded them at race meetings and social events fit in this fabulous extravaganza would you like to see prince andrew at your pudding making competition or dishing out the pies at your local street party i thought not the best thing andrew could do now is negotiate a settlement without admitting liability quietly resign from all his ceremonial roles pack up his golf clubs and find a resort in a nice far flung bit of the british commonwealth or one of his favourite russian satellite states where he can manage bookings for the putting greens and drive his new 300 000 bentley up and down the main street time to bow out sir

updated january 12 2022 at 4 37 pm et no you re not imagining it some grocery store shelves are bare again conjuring bad memories of spring 2020 for many social media is rife with images of empty supermarket aisles and signs explaining the lack of available food and other items stores such as aldi have apologized to customers for the shortages the reasons for the dwindling stock are numerous according to food industry analysts and include some issues that impacted retailers at the beginning of the pandemic as well as challenges that have cropped up more recently we re really seeing the perfect storm phil lempert editor of the website supermarketguru com told npr lempert said the northeast is facing some of the worst shortages now due in part to recent winter storms that snarled transportation routes but that could change with the weather but nate rose the communications director for the california grocers association said any comparison to march 2020 is not quite right there are some issues with out of stocks but it tends to be a situation where if you go to a store on a tuesday night maybe something s out of stock but by wednesday sometime it s back in store rose told npr everyone s become really reliant on kind of that just in time supply chain he added and i think what we re seeing is things are just behind a little bit right now some conservatives have begun using the hashtag bareshelvesbiden to blame the current administration for the shortages even though grocery stores experienced serious supply problems under president donald trump too here are some of the reasons driving the current supply shortages at your local supermarket the omicron variant the highly contagious new covid 19 variant that s causing record infections in the u s is undoubtedly one of the biggest stressors on the food industry right now grocery store workers are catching the virus in higher numbers and calling out sick making it tougher for markets to keep shelves stocked the stores themselves are finding it harder to source products because of the new strain vivek sankaran ceo of the grocery store chain albertson s said in an earnings call that the company had been hoping to recover from recent supply issues but omicron put a dent in that there are more supply challenges and we would expect more supply challenges over the next four to six weeks sankaran said on tuesday it s more than grocery stores though there are workers all across the food industry supply chain who are getting sick and staying home impacting food production manufacturing shipping and distribution the food company conagra the parent company of brands such as duncan hines and healthy choice is just one seeing a rise in omicron driven absenteeism president and ceo sean connolly said in an earnings call last week it s entirely reasonable for all of us to project that the next month or so could remain strained within the supply chain as omicron runs its course connolly said labor shortages in addition to workers becoming infected with covid 19 there are those who have simply quit lempert said the pandemic has turned grocery stores into battlefields with employees required to work in person throughout the pandemic explain food shortages and new public health measures to customers and try to keep themselves safe and healthy in the process as a result of that a lot of people said hey i don t need this and they ve left their jobs in the supermarket lempert said a recent survey conducted by the national grocers association found that many of its member retail and wholesale grocers reported operating their stores with 50 of their normal workforce supermarkets are beginning to offer higher pay better benefits and even tighter security to attract new applicants lempert said trucking and shipping truckers are also in short supply though there s some dispute about how bad the situation really is trucking companies are offering higher wages to attract workers but employment levels still aren t high enough to meet the demand for ground transport in december the white house announced a plan to bolster the trucking industry including making it easier for drivers to get commercial driver s license or cdls severe weather and climate change climate change isn t a new problem but it s one that s still vexing the food industry severe weather events are becoming more frequent and intense across the world as the planet warms according to lempert growers are yielding less corn and soy to feed farm animals which is having a downstream impact on the price and availability of meat eggs and dairy products in brazil heavy rains are inundating coffee fields and other crops which is limiting production severe weather is also making it harder to move food around recent storms in washington state prompted the closure of major roads and slowed the shipping of food to alaska where supermarkets told customers the one two punch of severe weather and shipping delays were to blame for barren shelves copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

president biden and his advisers for months predicted inflation would be only transitory a temporary problem that would fade as the economy rebounded and as supply chain issues were alleviated but new data wednesday challenged the notion of just how long the high prices will last exacerbating the problem inflation has become for the white house with only 10 months before voters go to the polls prices increased 7 percent over the 12 month period that ended in december making 2021 the worst year for inflation since 1982 according to a new report released by the bureau of labor statistics the rise in prices for almost everything from gasoline and groceries to used cars and construction materials could intensify a political crisis for biden and his democratic party inflation has a direct impact on the wallets of everyday people and public opinion experts say risks clouding the way they feel about an economy that by other measures is stable and strengthening advertisement unemployment is low wages are rising and the stock market is healthy but as long as prices rise biden could pay a political price in november s midterm elections which will determine control of both houses of congress this is going to have huge consequences in the fall longtime republican pollster frank luntz said he said that voters in focus groups he has conducted have been increasingly anxious and that while the coronavirus pandemic remains a top concern the rising cost of goods is becoming more dominant of all the economic issues this is number one luntz said and it s number one because whether you are upper middle class or lower middle class you re still affected fifty four percent of americans think the nation s economy is getting worse according to a quinnipiac university survey released wednesday and many are blaming biden some 57 percent said they disapproved of biden s handling of the economy while only 34 percent said they approved voters still remain very very concerned about inflation said celinda lake a democratic pollster and strategist what s important for democrats to do is to say we re making progress and while we re making progress this is not nearly good enough and we have to do more advertisement lake pointed to aspects of biden s signature build back better agenda that are popular with voters and would help bring down inflation such as lowering the cost of child care prescription drugs and elder care but that legislation is stuck in the senate amid resistance from republicans and sen joe manchin iii d w va biden has argued that his infrastructure legislation will improve the nation s transit lines and electric grid preventing future problems with the global supply chain and that if build back better passes it will put more money into the pockets of average americans but there is limited time studies show that attitudes about the perceived direction of the economy tend to harden in may or june of an election year and with negative news tending to linger in its impact compared with positive news democrats view the next few months as crucial advertisement the volatility is so great right now that voters are almost shellshocked lake said adding the way people describe it is they re on a roller coaster and they want to get off for the party in power that can be perilous even as the biden administration does have other strong economic metrics it can point toward it doesn t matter how good everything else is going people really do feel inflation said joe trippi a democratic political consultant most people don t feel 9 million jobs created they don t feel that they feel when it s 10 more to fill your tank up or bread is up they feel it even if they re getting paid more brian deese the director of the white house s national economic council said wednesday that inflation has lingered in part because the unemployment rate fell more quickly than expected and the pandemic has continued to affect the global economy and the supply chain advertisement asked by a reporter what the administration got wrong in calling inflation transitory deese said if we look at the situation earlier in the year a number of projections and forecasts have come differently than we anticipated i think that the nomenclature aside we find ourselves in a position now where we are looking forward and most forecasters are projecting that the price increases will moderate he added aligning the administration with forecasts that inflation will ease over the course of this year biden six months ago pointed to the likelihood of inflation being temporary the overwhelming consensus is it s going to pop up a little bit and then go back down he said on june 24 more recently the president has sought to speak to the concerns share this article share for working people and middle class people it s a big hit he said last month in an interview with ohio station whio the inflation at least for the time being is real inflation is causing rising prices at the gas station and grocery store experts explain what is causing inflation and how long it might stick around video sarah hashemi hadley green the washington post on wednesday biden pointed to a portion of the bureau of labor statistics report that showed gas and some food prices had dropped slightly in december after months of increases saying that it demonstrates that we are making progress advertisement at the same time this report underscores that we still have more work to do with price increases still too high and squeezing family budgets he added in a statement democrats say they welcome a debate over the economy pointing to a lack of firm plans from the gop but republicans argued the new inflation numbers were another sign that biden s policies are not working the average person is confronted on an hourly basis whether it s gas bread anything they buy they re reminded how bad the biden administration is said corry bliss a republican consultant working on house senate and gubernatorial races you ll see a lot of ads on this he added you ll see ads of people at gas stations at the grocery store over the course of the year food energy and shelter costs all rose on average by more than 8 percent those three categories constitute 50 percent of the average household budget said douglas holtz eakin a gop policy analyst who has served as director of the nonpartisan congressional budget office advertisement that s their substantive problem holtz eakin said of the biden administration this is unheard of for 40 years after initially arguing that rising prices would prove short lived the white house has deployed an all of the above approach to inflation officials launched a task force aimed at alleviating supply chain disruptions and worked on boosting the supply of truckers increasing competition in the shipping industry and clearing the backlog of goods at key ports across the country among other measures there are some signs of progress after the white house blasted corporate profits in the meatpacking industry meat prices fell in december following months of increases after the white house coordinated a global release of petroleum reserves gasoline prices ticked down in december as well advertisement i think they re saying about all they can say said dean baker a liberal economist i don t think there s a single thing they can do that will hugely change the story the white house has acknowledged that inflationary pressures are hurting american families but has insisted the economy is still performing well pointing to the low unemployment rate and a record number of job postings but some of those arguments are becoming increasingly hard to make government data released wednesday showed average weekly earnings for most american workers fell by 2 3 percent over the past year when adjusting for inflation meaning salaries are not keeping pace with higher costs that hurts said matthew j slaughter an economist at dartmouth college that s not building opportunity that s not advancing the american dream a senior white house official speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe the administration s position acknowledged that year over year prices are growing faster than hourly pay but pointed to independent forecasts projecting inflation could be halved over the next year if inflation drops from 7 percent to 3 5 percent and wage growth continues at the same pace workers could substantially improve their economic fortunes advertisement the official also pointed out that inflation adjusted earnings rose by 0 1 percent in december but economic experts see continued danger for the administration in the economy s current trajectory some economists have warned of the risk of a wage price spiral in which worker pay and prices skyrocket simultaneously as each tries to catch up with the other that trend could be difficult to arrest without an intervention from the federal reserve that risks plunging the united states back into recession the danger is we re starting to see a dynamic of wage price spiral in which rising wages lead to rising prices which lead to rising prices which lead to rising wages said larry summers who served in senior positions in the clinton and obama administrations but has been critical of biden s 1 9 trillion stimulus package the crucial macroeconomic insight from the experience of the 1960s and 1970s is that an overheated economy leads to not just high inflation but accelerating inflation summers added we currently have an overheated economy and there s not much reason to think anytime soon it s going to cool off the political impact will depend on just how long it takes to do so i think it gets down to is this temporary trippi said if it is there will be time between now and november for that to play itself out in a way that may have no impact in november 2022
the year 2022 brought some changes to government support and policies see how federal government decisions could impact a few tsx stocks government policies and spending have a significant impact on companies and businesses the policies determine funding taxation approvals and other benefits or restrictions in conducting business operations the canadian government has announced several changes for the 2022 tax year among the many changes i ve identified three changes that could positively impact a few stocks the end of public finance for oil and gas development and move it to renewable energy projects the end to the rent freeze for ontario residents the extension of the temporary flat rate work from home deduction to 2023 ending public finance for oil and gas development by 2022 canada is cracking down on fossil fuel funding by signing the cop26 deal along with 25 other countries as part of the deal the federal government will end public finance for coal oil and gas development by the end of this year in simple words no government nor any government agency will fund any fossil fuel projects instead it will channel this funding to renewable energy projects under the deal the government can invest in projects where carbon emissions are abated and carbon capture projects like the 75 billion oil sands pathways to net zero initiative canada s federal natural resources minister jonathan wilkinson said the deal could impact 1 billion in funding from export development canada the agency handles most of the funding for energy companies in canada i believe the deal is positive for suncor energy tsx su nyse su the oil company could secure funding for its carbon capture which is not revenue generating the investment reduction in oil and gas development could fuel an energy crisis and increase oil prices as it did in 2020 when texas wind turbines froze renewable energy production is dependent on weather conditions and that is where oil and gas come to the rescue even as the energy industry goes green oil is here to stay it will be used in jet fuel and as a backup energy source when renewables don t produce sufficient energy suncor stock is currently trading at its high wait for a dip to buy this dividend generating stock ending the rent freeze for ontario residents effective january 1 2022 the government temporarily froze rent increases in ontario to help people with their rent bills but this relaxation ended on january 1 2022 the ontario government has raised the maximum allowable rent increase to 1 2 in 2022 which is better than a 0 increase in 2021 but lower than a 2 2 increase in 2020 this rule applies to residential and commercial units the rent hike bodes well for riocan reit and smartcentres reit ontario is a hot property zone and the two reits have a significant portion of their properties developed and developing in the greater toronto area the two reits have surged over 3 since december 20 2021 reits are a good investment to hedge your portfolio against inflation rent is a major expense in the inflation basket hence an increase in rent pushes inflation upwards and reits benefit from higher rent extending the temporary flat rate work from home deduction another support the government provided canadians during the pandemic is the home office expense tax deduction this tax deduction was always in place but involved lengthy calculations and a lot of hassle as a significant amount of the population started working from home during the pandemic the canada revenue agency cra launched a temporary flat rate method to claim a deduction of 2 day up to 400 in 2020 but the pandemic waves continued with a series of lockdowns and work from home hence the cra has extended this temporary method for the 2021 and 2022 tax years for these two years you can claim up to 500 in home office expense deduction this bodes well for enghouse systems which acquired a video conferencing company before the pandemic enghouse stock surged 27 in 2020 as the pandemic created a sudden surge in demand for video conferencing solutions this is one of the three verticals where the company actively acquired companies however the stock has been in a downtrend since october 2020 removing all the inflated expectations the year 2022 could see some new acquisitions increase its revenue and fuel stock price growth

height of the wave dudlicek said in an emailed statement advertisement article continues below this ad while consumers have been aware of supply chain issues since well before the 2021 holiday season dudlicek said the shortages are not caused by any one thing as we ve seen across the economy product availability and price inflation are being driven by a perfect storm of factors including an ongoing shortage of labor across the entire supply chain an acute shortage of truck drivers increased ingredient inputs and occasional disruptions in product packaging production he said despite lagging supply there is high demand and higher costs information provided by the food marketing institute a trade association reported that almost half of shoppers have some concerns over food cost and out of stock items though such concern has not increased since the summer with grocery store locations in norwalk danbury and newington stew leonard jr is keeping an eye on rising costs in his

ad before the holidays i was talking to the gal that runs our front end and all our cashiers and she said 20 cashiers called in sick leonard said i asked why s that and she said it s because their

week leonard said i have to ask our existing team members to chip in a little bit more he said for example we have a great crumb cake that we sell and make it here at the store we also have an apple crumb cake well guess what we re not spending the time to make the apple crumb cake we re just going to make the regular suppliers staffing levels can also make a difference in what ends up on store

kit kat and niblet were down to one can of wet cat food so stephanie owens ventured out monday to buy their favorite brand she checked the shelves at her local stop shop in middletown n j empty she tried the new shop rite where gleaming shelves held the appearance of abundance bare frustrated owens scoured online retailers a dozen cans of fancy feast were selling for about 40 three times their usual cost owens said she was still searching for cat food wednesday joining countless others who have struggled to find necessities since a confluence of factors wiped out grocery store supplies in many parts of the country as the coronavirus surges and winter storms snarl traffic shoppers are looking desperately for pet food baby formula and dietary staples that are usually easy to access advertisement what are we going to do if months go by owens asked what s going to happen down the road if this problem isn t corrected whatever the problem is regardless of how long the shortages last there are some creative ways to get important items and make do with what you have try creative sources major grocery chains appear to be the most affected by the current shortages but there s no reason your food shopping has to end there independently owned stores grocers centered on foods of a certain ethnicity and specialty shops such as butchers may have more stock because of greater flexibility to work with different producers direct to consumer grocery or meal delivery services such as imperfect foods misfits market or weee may also have a greater supply customers can usually sign up to receive the boxes as frequently as they want said jessica titchenal a certified nutritionist some companies offer recipes with the grocery items and customers generally can pause or cancel their subscriptions whenever they want advertisement leaning on those options titchenal said can make empty grocery stores less disruptive to people already exhausted from nearly two years of pandemic living we ve all been getting very creative but i think a lot of people are so tired already she said they re so burned out and to try to figure out what do i eat now lean on your community if you re looking for something in particular your neighbors may have it or know where to find it facebook marketplace nextdoor local listservs or facebook groups such as neighborhood groups or buy nothing groups might provide options if all else fails many local food banks stock specific items such as baby formula or pet food but when it comes to finding food or medicine for their animals a veterinarian should be a pet owner s first phone call said becky robinson president of bethesda md based animal welfare group alley cat allies vets sometimes have food in stock at their offices and owners can check with other veterinarians if their first inquiry is fruitless advertisement many vets are great at finding comparable medication or prescription food to use making do with what they can get their hands on and finding what will work robinson said share this article share make the best of what s available sometimes when you can t find something you have to revise your plans but if you re familiar with common substitutes for fresh foods that change doesn t have to be intimidating said isabel maples a spokeswoman for the academy of nutrition and dietetics maybe your store doesn t have the cut of beef that you want so you substitute a type of pork with a similar cooking time or maybe the store doesn t have red meat or poultry at all maples said so you turn to frozen or canned fish or plant based options mushrooms beans quinoa and brown rice are alternative sources of protein that might be more widely available advertisement for fruits and vegetables maples said frozen canned or dried options are packed at peak freshness and provide similar nutrition to their fresh counterparts she suggested checking that the produce is packed in water rather than sugary syrup and choosing a no salt added version to keep your sodium intake in check and canned powdered or ultrahigh temperature milk often found in the baking or juice aisles may be acceptable substitutes for refrigerated milks if they re incorporated into a recipe maples said they may be unpalatable on their own titchenal said she tries to improve the taste of second choice ingredients by adding flavor enhancers such as herbs butter lemon juice or apple cider vinegar blending frozen vegetables which often taste different than fresh vegetables into a soup can also help mask their textures advertisement crucially titchenal said consider building your meal plan around a limited number of ingredients simplify your meals as much as possible so you don t have to worry about whether one of your 10 ingredients won t be available and you don t have to think of as many alternatives she said as for pets they can eat some human foods mixed with kibble or served alone said lori bierbrier director of community medicine at the american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals dogs can eat cottage cheese plain cooked grains or oatmeal canned vegetables with the extra salt rinsed off and peanut butter except peanut butter sweetened with xylitol cats bierbrier said can eat canned or cooked fish small amounts of cheese or cooked eggs ground corn brown rice barley or couscous the existence of those alternatives came as a relief to owens who has been feeding her felines only dry food as shortages in her area continue advertisement they ve eaten the last can of the wet she said

updated january 12 2022 at 4 37 pm et no you re not imagining it some grocery store shelves are bare again conjuring bad memories of spring 2020 for many social media is rife with images of empty supermarket aisles and signs explaining the lack of available food and other items stores such as aldi have apologized to customers for the shortages the reasons for the dwindling stock are numerous according to food industry analysts and include some issues that impacted retailers at the beginning of the pandemic as well as challenges that have cropped up more recently we re really seeing the perfect storm phil lempert editor of the website supermarketguru com told npr lempert said the northeast is facing some of the worst shortages now due in part to recent winter storms that snarled transportation routes but that could change with the weather but nate rose the communications director for the california grocers association said any comparison to march 2020 is not quite right there are some issues with out of stocks but it tends to be a situation where if you go to a store on a tuesday night maybe something s out of stock but by wednesday sometime it s back in store rose told npr everyone s become really reliant on kind of that just in time supply chain he added and i think what we re seeing is things are just behind a little bit right now some conservatives have begun using the hashtag bareshelvesbiden to blame the current administration for the shortages even though grocery stores experienced serious supply problems under president donald trump too here are some of the reasons driving the current supply shortages at your local supermarket the omicron variant the highly contagious new covid 19 variant that s causing record infections in the u s is undoubtedly one of the biggest stressors on the food industry right now grocery store workers are catching the virus in higher numbers and calling out sick making it tougher for markets to keep shelves stocked the stores themselves are finding it harder to source products because of the new strain vivek sankaran ceo of the grocery store chain albertson s said in an earnings call that the company had been hoping to recover from recent supply issues but omicron put a dent in that there are more supply challenges and we would expect more supply challenges over the next four to six weeks sankaran said on tuesday it s more than grocery stores though there are workers all across the food industry supply chain who are getting sick and staying home impacting food production manufacturing shipping and distribution the food company conagra the parent company of brands such as duncan hines and healthy choice is just one seeing a rise in omicron driven absenteeism president and ceo sean connolly said in an earnings call last week it s entirely reasonable for all of us to project that the next month or so could remain strained within the supply chain as omicron runs its course connolly said labor shortages in addition to workers becoming infected with covid 19 there are those who have simply quit lempert said the pandemic has turned grocery stores into battlefields with employees required to work in person throughout the pandemic explain food shortages and new public health measures to customers and try to keep themselves safe and healthy in the process as a result of that a lot of people said hey i don t need this and they ve left their jobs in the supermarket lempert said a recent survey conducted by the national grocers association found that many of its member retail and wholesale grocers reported operating their stores with 50 of their normal workforce supermarkets are beginning to offer higher pay better benefits and even tighter security to attract new applicants lempert said trucking and shipping truckers are also in short supply though there s some dispute about how bad the situation really is trucking companies are offering higher wages to attract workers but employment levels still aren t high enough to meet the demand for ground transport in december the white house announced a plan to bolster the trucking industry including making it easier for drivers to get commercial driver s license or cdls severe weather and climate change climate change isn t a new problem but it s one that s still vexing the food industry severe weather events are becoming more frequent and intense across the world as the planet warms according to lempert growers are yielding less corn and soy to feed farm animals which is having a downstream impact on the price and availability of meat eggs and dairy products in brazil heavy rains are inundating coffee fields and other crops which is limiting production severe weather is also making it harder to move food around

the price of gold may have slipped last year but this gold stock climbed higher what happened looking at the performance of a gold focused stock like franco nevada fnv 1 39 in 2021 you d expect to see that the stock had fallen after all there s a strong correlation between the movements in the price of gold and those of stocks that are tied to the yellow stuff but that s not the case with franco nevada which ended 2021 10 3 higher than when it began according to data from s p global market intelligence what motivated investors to add some luster to their portfolios with the royalty and streaming company for one wall street waxed bullish on the stock s prospects throughout the year while the company s consistently strong earnings reports and dividend raises represented additional catalysts so what while franco nevada didn t sparkle in analysts eyes in february stifel and cibc both reduced their price targets wall street turned bullish on the stock as the year progressed through the first half of 2021 franco nevada found itself subject to several upgrades and bulls continued to favor it in the latter part of the year as well in october for example canaccord genuity upgraded the stock to buy from hold and two months later h c wainwright initiated coverage with a buy rating and 167 price target representing upside of about 25 at the time of the analyst s action the allure of a higher dividend provided an additional motivating factor for investors in 2021 in may franco nevada announced a 15 4 increase to its quarterly dividend per share from 0 26 to 0 30 a notably higher raise than the 4 increase to its quarterly payout that it announced in may 2020 consistently exceeding analysts expectations franco nevada reported quarterly earnings throughout 2021 that surpassed the street s estimates besides the bottom line beats that the company racked up in the first six months of the year franco nevada booked surprisingly strong results in the second half of the year the company reported earnings per share of 0 96 for q2 2021 and 0 87 for q3 2021 beating estimates of 0 93 and 0 85 respectively now what whether simply looking to diversify their holdings or seeking to fortify their portfolios against market volatility investors turn to gold stocks like franco nevada for a variety of reasons unlike gold producers this royalty and streaming company acts more like a niche financier providing upfront capital to mining companies that develop projects in exchange for a percentage of the mined mineral or the ability to buy the mined mineral for a preset price a business model that gold hungry investors oftentimes prefer since it represents lower risk than investing in gold mining companies

king of prussia pennsylvania november 26 2021 washington usa us consumer prices increased solidly in december as rental accommodation and used cars maintained their strong gains culminating in the largest annual rise in inflation in nearly four decades which bolstered expectations that the federal reserve will start raising interest rates as early as march the report from the labor department on wednesday january 12 followed on the heels of data last friday january 7 showing that the labor market was at or near maximum employment fed chair jerome powell on tuesday january 11 said the us central bank stood ready to do what was needed to keep high inflation from becoming entrenched in testimony during his nomination hearing before the senate banking committee for a second four year term as head of the bank the high cost of living the result of snarled supply chains because of the covid 19 pandemic is a political nightmare for president joe biden whose approval rating has taken a hit the fed is going to be forced to begin raising rates in march and depending on the political pressure on them from both sides of the aisle they are going to have to raise rates four or more times in this year and potentially more than that next year said chris zaccarelli chief investment officer at independent advisor alliance in charlotte north carolina the consumer price index cpi rose 0 5 last month after advancing 0 8 in november in addition to higher rents consumers also paid more for food though the 0 5 increase in food prices was less than in the prior three months there were big gains in the prices of fruits and vegetables but beef prices fell 2 after recent sharp gains consumers also got a respite from gasoline prices which fell 0 5 after rising 6 1 in both november and october in the 12 months through december the cpi surged 7 that was the biggest year on year increase since june 1982 and followed a 6 8 rise in november last month s inflation readings were in line with expectations rising inflation is also eroding wage gains inflation adjusted average weekly earnings fell 2 3 on a year on year basis in december president biden said virtually every nation was afflicted with inflation as the global economy recovers from the pandemic this report underscores that we still have more work to do with price increases still too high and squeezing family budgets biden said in a statement inflation is well above the fed s flexible 2 target it is also being lifted by budding wage pressures as the labor market tightens the unemployment rate fell to a 22 month low of 3 9 in december markets have priced in an about 80 chance of a rate hike in march according to cme s fedwatch tool economists say the broad nature of inflation appears to have caught fed officials off guard there are concerns that inflation expectations could become entrenched and compel the fed to aggressively tighten monetary policy potentially causing a recession this is the first time the fed has chased instead of trying to preempt a nonexistent inflation since the 1980s said diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton in chicago brace yourselves stocks on wall street were trading higher amid relief that the increase in prices was as expected the dollar fell against a basket of currencies us treasury prices rose bottlenecks easing economists believe the year on year cpi rate probably peaked in december or will likely do so by march there are signs that supply bottlenecks are starting to ease with an institute for supply management survey last week showing manufacturers reporting improved supplier deliveries in december but soaring covid 19 cases driven by the omicron variant could slow progress towards normalization of supply chains excluding the volatile food and energy components the cpi increased 0 6 last month after rising 0 5 in november the so called core cpi was boosted by rents with owners equivalent rent of primary residence which is what a homeowner would receive from renting a home rising a solid 0 4 for a third straight month prices for used cars and trucks accelerated 3 5 after increasing 2 5 in each of the prior two months the surge likely reflects hurricane ida in late august and early september which destroyed thousands of motor vehicles among other property new motor vehicle prices rose 1 marking the ninth consecutive month of gains a global semiconductor shortage has undercut motor vehicle production prices for furniture bedding and housekeeping supplies increased apparel prices jumped 1 7 the largest increase since january 2021 the cost of healthcare rose 0 3 there were also increases in the prices for airline tickets personal care products and tobacco but the cost of motor vehicle insurance fell again as did recreation communication prices were unchanged in the 12 months through december the so called core cpi accelerated 5 5 that was the largest year on year gain since february 1991 and followed a 4 9 advance in november the year on year core cpi rate is seen peaking in february still inflation is likely to remain above target this year inflation will slow in 2022 as supply chains reopen and prices for some items like vehicles and energy decline as supply catches up to demand said gus faucher chief economist at pnc financial in pittsburgh pennsylvania but inflation for many other goods and services will be higher in 2022 than before the pandemic due to higher labor costs and input prices housing will also contribute to high inflation in 2022 rappler com

perfect storm phil lempert editor of the website supermarketguru com told npr lempert said the northeast is facing some of the worst shortages now due in part to recent winter storms that snarled transportation routes but that could change with the weather but nate rose the communications director for the california grocers association said any comparison to march 2020 is not quite right there are some issues with out of stocks but it tends to be a situation where if you go to a store on a tuesday night maybe something s out of stock but by wednesday sometime it s back in store rose told npr everyone s become really reliant on kind of that just in time supply chain he added and i think what we re seeing is things are just behind a little bit right now some conservatives have begun using the hashtag bareshelvesbiden to blame the current administration for the shortages even though grocery stores experienced serious supply problems under president donald trump too here are some of the reasons driving the current supply shortages at your local supermarket the omicron variant the highly contagious new covid 19 variant that s causing record infections in the u s is undoubtedly one of the biggest stressors on the food industry right now grocery store workers are catching the virus in higher numbers and calling out sick making it tougher for markets to keep shelves stocked the stores themselves are finding it harder to source products because of the new strain vivek sankaran ceo of the grocery store chain albertson s said in an earnings call that the company had been hoping to recover from recent supply issues but omicron put a dent in that there are more supply challenges and we would expect more supply challenges over the next four to six weeks sankaran said on tuesday it s more than grocery stores though there are workers all across the food industry supply chain who are getting sick and staying home impacting food production manufacturing shipping and distribution the food company conagra the parent company of brands such as duncan hines and healthy choice is just one seeing a rise in omicron driven absenteeism president and ceo sean connolly said in an earnings call last week it s entirely reasonable for all of us to project that the next month or so could remain strained within the supply chain as omicron runs its course connolly said labor shortages in addition to workers becoming infected with covid 19 there are those who have simply quit lempert said the pandemic has turned grocery stores into battlefields with employees required to work in person throughout the pandemic explain food shortages and new public health measures to customers and try to keep themselves safe and healthy in the process as a result of that a lot of people said hey i don t need this and they ve left their jobs in the supermarket lempert said a recent survey conducted by the national grocers association found that many of its member retail and wholesale grocers reported operating their stores with 50 of their normal workforce supermarkets are beginning to offer higher pay better benefits and even tighter security to attract new applicants lempert said trucking and shipping truckers are also in short supply though there s some dispute about how bad the situation really is trucking companies are offering higher wages to attract workers but employment levels still aren t high enough to meet the demand for ground transport in december the white house announced a plan to bolster the trucking industry including making it easier for drivers to get commercial driver s license or cdls severe weather and climate change climate change isn t a new problem but it s one that s still vexing the food industry severe weather events are becoming more frequent and intense across the world as the planet warms according to lempert growers are yielding less corn and soy to feed farm animals which is having a downstream impact on the price and availability of meat eggs and dairy products in brazil heavy rains are inundating coffee fields and other crops which is limiting production severe weather is also making it harder to move food around recent storms in washington state prompted the closure of major roads and slowed the shipping of food to alaska where supermarkets told customers the one two punch of severe weather and shipping delays were to blame for barren shelves copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

height of the wave dudlicek said in an emailed statement advertisement article continues below this ad while consumers have been aware of supply chain issues since well before the 2021 holiday season dudlicek said the shortages are not caused by any one thing as we ve seen across the economy product availability and price inflation are being driven by a perfect storm of factors including an ongoing shortage of labor across the entire supply chain an acute shortage of truck drivers increased ingredient inputs and occasional disruptions in product packaging production he said despite lagging supply there is high demand and higher costs information provided by the food marketing institute a trade association reported that almost half of shoppers have some concerns over food cost and out of stock items though such concern has not increased since the summer with grocery store locations in norwalk danbury and newington stew leonard jr is keeping an eye on rising costs in his

ad before the holidays i was talking to the gal that runs our front end and all our cashiers and she said 20 cashiers called in sick leonard said i asked why s that and she said it s because their moms and dads didn t want them to come to work in light of covid i can understand that as a parent about 8 percent of the stores workforce or about 200 employees were out sick or in quarantine last week leonard said i have to ask our existing team members to chip in a little bit more he said for example we have a great crumb cake that we sell and make it here at the store we also have an apple crumb cake well guess what we re not spending the time to make the apple crumb cake we re just going to make the regular suppliers staffing levels can also make a difference in what ends up on store shelves regardless of how much supply is available dudlicek noted advertisement article continues below this ad while there is plenty of food in the supply chain we anticipate consumers will continue to experience sporadic disruptions in certain product categories as we have seen over the past year and half due to the ongoing supply and labor challenges he said leonard said his beef supplier told

the company with other companies in the homebuilding industry to the extent they provide similar information however because it is not calculated in accordance with gaap this non gaap financial measure may not be completely comparable to other companies in the homebuilding industry and thus should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating performance and or financial

housing construction and land costs excluding 1 housing inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges as applicable recorded during a given period and 2 amortization of previously capitalized interest associated with housing operations by housing revenues the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is housing gross profit margin the company believes adjusted housing gross profit margin is a relevant and useful financial measure to investors in evaluating the company s performance as it measures the gross profits the company generated specifically on the homes delivered during a given period this non gaap financial measure isolates the impact that housing inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges and the amortization of previously capitalized interest associated with housing operations have on housing gross profit margins and allows investors to make comparisons with the company s competitors that adjust housing gross profit margins in a similar manner the company also believes investors will find adjusted housing gross profit margin relevant and useful because it represents a profitability measure that may be compared to a prior period without regard to variability of housing inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges and amortization of previously capitalized interest associated with housing operations this financial measure assists management in making strategic decisions regarding community location and product mix product pricing and construction pace
updated january 12 2022 at 4 37 pm et no you re not imagining it some grocery store shelves are bare again conjuring bad memories of spring 2020 for many social media is rife with images of empty supermarket aisles and signs explaining the lack of available food and other items stores such as aldi have apologized to customers for the shortages the reasons for the dwindling stock are numerous according to food industry analysts and include some issues that impacted retailers at the beginning of the pandemic as well as challenges that have cropped up more recently we re really seeing the perfect storm phil lempert editor of the website supermarketguru com told npr lempert said the northeast is facing some of the worst shortages now due in part to recent winter storms that snarled transportation routes but that could change with the weather but nate rose the communications director for the california grocers association said any comparison to march 2020 is not quite right there are some issues with out of stocks but it tends to be a situation where if you go to a store on a tuesday night maybe something s out of stock but by wednesday sometime it s back in store rose told npr everyone s become really reliant on kind of that just in time supply chain he added and i think what we re seeing is things are just behind a little bit right now some conservatives have begun using the hashtag bareshelvesbiden to blame the current administration for the shortages even though grocery stores experienced serious supply problems under president donald trump too here are some of the reasons driving the current supply shortages at your local supermarket the omicron variant the highly contagious new covid 19 variant that s causing record infections in the u s is undoubtedly one of the biggest stressors on the food industry right now grocery store workers are catching the virus in higher numbers and calling out sick making it tougher for markets to keep shelves stocked the stores themselves are finding it harder to source products because of the new strain vivek sankaran ceo of the grocery store chain albertson s said in an earnings call that the company had been hoping to recover from recent supply issues but omicron put a dent in that there are more supply challenges and we would expect more supply challenges over the next four to six weeks sankaran said on tuesday it s more than grocery stores though there are workers all across the food industry supply chain who are getting sick and staying home impacting food production manufacturing shipping and distribution the food company conagra the parent company of brands such as duncan hines and healthy choice is just one seeing a rise in omicron driven absenteeism president and ceo sean connolly said in an earnings call last week it s entirely reasonable for all of us to project that the next month or so could remain strained within the supply chain as omicron runs its course connolly said labor shortages in addition to workers becoming infected with covid 19 there are those who have simply quit lempert said the pandemic has turned grocery stores into battlefields with employees required to work in person throughout the pandemic explain food shortages and new public health measures to customers and try to keep themselves safe and healthy in the process as a result of that a lot of people said hey i don t need this and they ve left their jobs in the supermarket lempert said a recent survey conducted by the national grocers association found that many of its member retail and wholesale grocers reported operating their stores with 50 of their normal workforce supermarkets are beginning to offer higher pay better benefits and even tighter security to attract new applicants lempert said trucking and shipping truckers are also in short supply though there s some dispute about how bad the situation really is trucking companies are offering higher wages to attract workers but employment levels still aren t high enough to meet the demand for ground transport in december the white house announced a plan to bolster the trucking industry including making it easier for drivers to get commercial driver s license or cdls severe weather and climate change climate change isn t a new problem but it s one that s still vexing the food industry severe weather events are becoming more frequent and intense across the world as the planet warms according to lempert growers are yielding less corn and soy to feed farm animals which is having a downstream impact on the price and availability of meat eggs and dairy products in brazil heavy rains are inundating coffee fields and other crops which is limiting production severe weather is also making it harder to move food around recent storms in washington state prompted the closure of major roads and slowed the shipping of food to alaska where supermarkets told customers the one two punch of severe weather and shipping delays were to blame for barren shelves copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

martin mcgovern is from dun laoghaire but has lived and worked in massachusetts for the past four decades he lives in mashpee but considers himself fortunate to have had the flexibility to make trips back to ireland like millions of older american workers last year i took stock of my work life balance and made the decision to retire when the pandemic began in early 2020 i was 63 and immersed in my role as director of communications and media relations at stonehill college a catholic liberal arts college in easton massachusetts a scholarship had brought me to the college in 1979 and i went on to serve stonehill as a communicator and spokesperson over four decades roles i really enjoyed while studying political science at university college dublin i had worked nights as a copy boy at the irish press getting a practical grounding in journalism media and communications skills that have served me well in my career in the us read more within six months of the pandemic however i began to think seriously about stepping away from my roles at the college the pace and intensity of being a communicator in a period of non stop crisis had started to tax me like never before private higher education in the us has become a more competitive complex industry than it was when i started in the early 1980s there are fewer traditional college age students but more students with greater need tuition is expensive but it is often discounted which means the quest for funding in support of scholarships better resources and new facilities is relentless many students graduate with significant debt furthermore colleges are not exempt from issues such as gun violence sexual assault town gown relations equity and inclusion challenges protests and more in the age of social media what were once campus issues can now erupt into broader public disputes which the media covers closely increasingly i felt there were so many responsibilities to juggle simultaneously and breaking topics to address all of which had tight turnarounds and deadlines and there was no end in sight to the enhanced demands of the position which is on a 24 7 alert as my head spun my sanity slipped in addition to all this due to the pandemic i no longer physically worked at the college instead i operated remotely from home the upside was not having to commute the downside was a much longer workday stuck in my basement consumed by crisis and wedded to the phone laptop and zoom meetings suffice to say family wise i was hardly a joy to be around i had hit a professional wall and knew it was time to go i remained in my position until july last year soon after i turned 65 and was eligible for social security i made the most of that last stretch at the college which has a great sense of community and stood by me during a battle with cancer in the mid 1990s and also when i needed flexibility and time to help my brother care for our parents in dublin during their final years as sad as it was to leave so many good colleagues and friends and a home away from home where i met my wife helene i welcomed the change in essence the pandemic helped me realise how the job was consuming me to the detriment of health and balance i had completed my shift in retirement i am adjusting to a slower less regulated pace regular and more enjoyable exercise catching up on reading books that i had put aside for future attention getting to know my neighbours better and trying to navigate the us s polarised politics but that s another story altogether if you live overseas and would like to share your experience with irish times abroad email abroad irishtimes com with a little information about you and what you do

photo credit fizkes shutterstock over the last year and a half one of the dominant stories in the u s economy has been the steep increase in the cost of homes in a highly competitive market earlier this year the median sales price of a home in the u s passed 400 000 for the first time up by more than 20 from before the covid 19 pandemic began with unusually low inventory of existing homes for sale throughout the pandemic and new construction struggling to catch up limited supply has been one of the factors driving these increases on the demand side millions of homebuyers have entered the market seeking to take advantage of low mortgage rates increased savings and strong investment returns during the pandemic but one of the more fundamental factors in the demand for homes is demographics millennials currently aged 25 to 40 are now the largest generation in the u s and in the prime age for buying a first or second home according to a 2021 study from the national association of realtors millennials now make up 37 of homebuyers by far the largest share of any generation increased homebuying among younger americans would represent the reversal of a long running decline census bureau data shows that the share of under 35 homeowners has dropped from around 19 in the early 1980s when many baby boomers were still of that age to less than 12 today in the 1990s the declining share could be attributed to the smaller generation x coming of age while more recently millennials were forced to delay homebuying as they suffered the economic consequences of entering the workforce in the post recession era growing debt burdens among younger americans primarily from student loans have also been a barrier to young people saving for a home and obtaining a mortgage recent financial pressures on young americans also help to explain where homeownership is more common among people under 35 areas where the costs of housing are highest like hawaii california and the northeast have the lowest share of young homeowners with rates below the national average of 9 9 in contrast locations in the midwest and mountain west tend to have higher rates of homeownership among young people states like north dakota 15 5 and utah 15 2 offer a combination of more affordable home prices and strong economies that put homeownership in reach for young families the same is true at

by whitney clark click here for updates on this story scottsdale arizona kpho ktvk a scottsdale based tech company trainual says it will offer employees 5 000 to leave their job if they re not totally happy after their first two weeks of work the ceo chris ronzio says it s a way to keep the folks who truly want to be there as companies across the country scramble to fill positions we had in the past hired people that would maybe stick around six months or nine months and take some other opportunity said ronzio so we thought how do we make sure that this is the right opportunity for people he started the firm in 2018 it produces a software platform that allows small businesses to write down and share all of their policies for employees ronzio tells arizona s family that no one has taken advantage of the 5 000 yet but it s an idea that goes back to the pandemic s beginning so it started in may of 2020 and right before we launched this we had a developer an engineer that started and five days into his job he kind of raised his hand and said i think i took the wrong job this isn t for me ronzio said it got ronzio thinking if anyone else feels the same way because over three months six months nine months we re pouring responsibilities onto this person s plate ronzio said and they re becoming a bigger part of the company and so if you pull that person out nine months in it s much more expensive to replace the idea is if employees are thinking short term they might take the money and go and that might be better for everyone of course ronzio hopes to keep folks longer with competitive benefits and stock options from customer support to senior level engineers ronzio says the average salary at the company is 70 000 to 80 000 dave wells the research director for the grand canyon institute says he s never heard anything quite like this before while this may not work for every industry like restaurants where higher pay may pay off turnover may cost a tech company like trainual a lot of money and productivity wells calls the 5 000 a good investment if you re putting time and effort into a new hire i think this is a great example of how the job market has changed and how an employer is being really innovative and trying to adjust to that because employees have a lot more power than they ve had in the past he said ronzio sees this as an important twist companies will have to make to adapt or they will continue to see people leave he says that everyone has the option to work from home and they have about six open positions please note this content carries a strict local market embargo if you share the same market as the contributor of this article you may not use it on any platform

photo credit ugis riba shutterstock world leaders convened in glasgow this november for the 2021 united nations climate change conference facing the intensification of global climate change the negotiators reached an agreement that explicitly commits to reducing the use of coal limiting other greenhouse gas emissions and providing support to developing countries most impacted by climate change the glasgow conference reflected heightened urgency around climate change as the effects of carbon emissions have accelerated and become more severe in recent years a 2021 report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change found that without rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions warming above 1 5 c is almost inevitable this level of warming would have disastrous effects in the form of sea level rise more severe weather events and harm to agricultural systems and human health while there is still much work to do the good news for the u s is that many states and the country as a whole have begun to reverse the growth in carbon emissions government policy to limit emissions and advancements in lower emission technologies across the economy have helped turn the trends in the right direction much of this progress has taken place over the last fifteen years total co2 emissions peaked in 2007 at over 6 billion metric tons but that figure fell to around 4 6 billion metric tons in 2020 one of the big contributors has been decarbonization in electric power generation due to the decline of heavy emitting coal and the rise of clean energy sources like wind and solar over the last decade these factors have reduced co2 emissions associated with electric power generation by around 36 and this trend also contributes to emissions reductions in the main end use sectors transportation industrial residential and commercial that consume electricity residential and commercial have seen the sharpest declines with emissions dropping by more than a quarter since 2010 across both sectors combined encouragingly these declines have taken place even while the u s population and economy have continued to grow from 1970 to the mid 2000s carbon emissions and gdp grew together with the pace of gdp growth exceeding that of carbon emissions more recently the steady upward trajectory of gdp has continued while carbon emissions have ticked downward since 2007 total energy related co2 emissions are down by 23 9 while real gdp has increased by 17 7 in the same span these trends help alleviate concerns that reducing carbon emissions necessarily means limiting economic productivity and many u s states are proving that economic growth in a less carbon intensive economy is possible the data used in this analysis is from the u s energy information administration and the u s census bureau to determine the states with the least carbon intensive economies researchers at commodity com calculated total co2 emissions per gdp states with a lower value were ranked higher in the event of a tie the state with lower per capita co2 emissions was ranked higher here are the states with the least carbon intensive economies u s states with the least carbon

photo credit cryptographer shutterstock the covid 19 pandemic has put unprecedented strain on the u s health system over the last two years with hospitals and providers facing heavy workloads a fractured supply chain and labor shortages the system is continuing to struggle as the omicron variant brings the newest largest wave of covid cases yet these challenges are pushing u s health spending to new heights a recent study from health affairs reported that total health spending in the u s increased by 9 7 in 2020 to 4 1 trillion even as gdp declined by 2 2 one of the biggest factors in that increase was a significant infusion of federal funding for health through covid 19 relief legislation like the 2 2 trillion cares act and the 900 billion coronavirus response and relief supplemental appropriations act these federal dollars provided support to health providers helped strengthen public health infrastructure to manage the spread of the coronavirus and sped the development and distribution of vaccines but while the federal government has spent heavily to navigate the current crisis it is less clear how covid 19 might affect overall health spending in the long term even before covid 19 state and local governments have been spending an increasingly large share of their budgets on health ongoing challenges from the pandemic and efforts to strengthen the health system in the future could further accelerate that growth at the state and local level total spending on health care has more than doubled over the last two decades from 127 3 billion in 2000 to 321 7 billion in 2019 a 70 increase after adjusting for inflation while state and local spending has increased overall health also represents an increasing share of the total in 2000 health care was 8 5 of total spending while in 2019 that figure rose to 9 6 a number of factors are contributing to this increased total some experts cite a reliance on expensive new innovations and technologies in care and administrative complexity of insurers and hospitals as a major contributor to overall costs the aging of the baby boomer generation which totals more than 70 million americans brings greater health needs and increases costs as well amid these other factors the expansion of medicaid under the affordable care act has also increased what states must spend on their portion of the program although it s important to note that most of medicaid spending is categorized as public welfare spending regardless of the reason health care is one of the primary spending categories in state and local budgets at 9 6 of spending health is the third largest state and local government category behind public welfare which includes means tested supports like the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program and represents around 22 3 of state and local spending and k 12 education which makes up 21 5 of state and local budgets but some states spend more on health care than others in total spending high population states like california texas new york and florida lead the nation while california 1 533 is also among the top spending states on a per capita basis many of the other leaders are smaller states like wyoming 2 978 south carolina 1 730 and kansas 1 558 the data used in this analysis is from the u s census bureau s annual survey of state and local government finances

height of the wave dudlicek said in an emailed statement advertisement article continues below this ad while consumers have been aware of supply chain issues since well before the 2021 holiday season dudlicek said the shortages are not caused by any one thing as we ve seen across the economy product availability and price inflation are being driven by a perfect storm of factors including an ongoing shortage of labor across the entire supply chain an acute shortage of truck drivers increased ingredient inputs and occasional disruptions in product packaging production he said despite lagging supply there is high demand and higher costs information provided by the food marketing institute a trade association reported that almost half of shoppers have some concerns over food cost and out of stock items though such concern has not increased since the summer with grocery store locations in norwalk danbury and newington stew leonard jr is keeping an eye on rising costs in his

ad before the holidays i was talking to the gal that runs our front end and all our cashiers and she said 20 cashiers called in sick leonard said i asked why s that and she said it s because their moms and dads didn t want them to come to work in light of covid i can understand that as a parent about 8 percent of the stores workforce or about 200 employees were out sick or in quarantine last week leonard said i have to ask our existing team members to chip in a little bit more he said for example we have a great crumb cake that we sell and make it here at the store we also have an apple crumb cake well guess what we re not spending the time to make the apple crumb cake we re just going to make the regular suppliers staffing levels can also make a difference in what ends up on store shelves regardless of how much supply is available dudlicek noted advertisement article continues below this ad while there is plenty of food in the supply chain we anticipate consumers will continue to experience sporadic disruptions in certain product categories as we have seen over the past year and half due to the ongoing supply and labor challenges he said leonard said his beef supplier told him that while they have a similar herd size to the previous year and would ideally run their processing plants six days per week to meet demand they can only work five days per week they have the same problems we have leonard said there s a worker shortage and a demand surge employee jonta perez of danbury wears a mask while stocking coffee pods at stew leonard s h john voorhees iii hearst

they are weakness he said weakness would follow selling and there s still minimal selling pressure because there just aren t enough bonds available for people to own so things that are scarce are

transition and policymakers are trying to curb inflation that until recently they termed transitory analysts said the surge and broadening of inflation has been a red flag for the federal reserve said grant thornton chief economist diane swonk they have pivoted from being patient to panicking on inflation in record time she expects a march liftoff and balance sheet reduction soon after despite the impact of the omicron variant another change swonk said is variants are now viewed by policymakers as inflationary not disinflationary given the havoc they reap on supply chains yet omicron is forcing some low wage earners to tap savings and business to close temporarily as a result of ill workers she said this is the first time the fed has chased instead of trying to preempt a nonexistent inflation since the 1980s swonk said brace yourselves indeed the consumer price index gained 0 5 in december while the core rate rose 0 6 in the month both a tick higher than projected while cpi jumped 7 0 as expected on an annual basis the fast pace since 1982 and the core climbed 5 5 year over year if cpi inflation is still around 7 heading into the march fomc meeting as we expect it to be it will be hard for the fed to stand by idly said wells fargo securities senior economist sarah house inflation has thus far outpaced nominal wage increases and reduced real wages for broad swathes of the labor force said berenberg capital markets chief economist for the u s americas and asia mickey levy amid a tight labor market in which the balance of power is shifting toward workers nominal wages are expected to accelerate partly to catch up to inflation with wednesday s cpi and a fast tightening labor market jpmorgan funds chief global strategist david kelly and market insights research analyst stephanie aliaga said the federal reserve could increase the fed funds rate four times this year once more than in its december projections with liftoff beginning in march but the economy and monetary policy are transitioning said scott wren senior global market strategist wells fargo investment institute worries of potential fed mistakes and higher interest rates often unnerve investors at this point in the cycle he noted economic and earnings growth concerns come to the forefront covid 19 headwinds also come into play investors should prepare for a more bumpy road than they ve traveled in the past 20 months he said but opportunities exist persistent high inflation rates together with the recent strong labor market data reinforce the hawkish narrative provided by the fed said dws group u s economist christian scherrmann he expects liftoff as early as march although omicron will dictate the fate of the economy in january and maybe in february omicron he said could prevent progress toward maximum employment but it also has the potential to push inflation and therefore inflation expectations up further possibly implying even more rate hikes down the road than the three to four which are currently anticipated by market participants inflation will remain elevated into next year said jim smigiel chief investment officer at sei many investors would have benefited from having a measure of inflation protection in their portfolios in 2021 he said we always believe some exposure to inflation sensitive assets is useful and suspect that may be even more so in the year ahead but 2022 will bring volatility to the markets based on rising interest rates and uncertainty about the path of the pandemic but smigiel doesn t see signs of an impending recession on the horizon and remains optimistic global growth will re accelerate as this latest covid wave fades while inflation has persisted longer than originally expected it should moderate in the next 12 months said nick hayes head of fixed income allocation total return at axa investment managers unfortunately that fuels probably equal amount of hawkish and dovish rhetoric which probably means that we live in a world of heightened rates volatility for the seeable future while the situation has been termed persistently transitory he said that phrase amusingly probably doesn t add much clarity the question of will the fed liftoff has been replaced by how many rate hikes will come hayes said with rate volatility should come risk asset volatility and with it comes opportunities to add risk to create better returns in 2022 than many fixed income investors saw in 2021 but not everyone sees inflation continuing into 2023 the fed is in a real conundrum said ron temple head of u s equities at lazard asset management inflation is likely to recede during the first quarter but the pressure on households from broader inflation metrics is real and intense the fed is walking a tightrope where it might begin tightening just as inflation is falling and economic growth is decelerating although he supports tapering and liftoff he sees inflation falling materially as episodic factors like used cars subside raising questions on the need for further tapering and additional rate hikes the fed should move ahead but cautiously as the outlook is not as clear as it might appear while inflation should decelerate later in the year wage pressure provides an upside risk according to wilmington trust economists key components to watch will be disruption related sectors used and new cars furniture apparel and rent related measures turning to the composition of the fed board luke tilley chief economist at wilmington trust sees the powell renomination as providing continuity but the departure of vice chair richard clarida removes one of only two career economists along with chris waller on the board the board will likely tilt slightly dovish this year and with clarida leaving it probably elevates the voices of waller the board staff and reserve bank presidents on the fomc separately the beige book released wednesday reported modest economic growth with supply chain issues and labor shortages holding back further gains modest gains in employment were seen and prices gained with some deceleration but the outlook has softened although optimism remained high generally several

what might be separate property below are some categories of assets that often will qualify as separate property income earned before marriage that is not commingled with marital funds income earned by either spouse before marriage is clearly separate property but those funds may lose their character as separate property and transform into marital property if they are commingled with marital assets and treated by the parties as marital property consequently depositing premarital earnings in a joint bank account and using that account to pay marital expenses would show an intention to treat the pre marriage income as marital property and therefore it would lose its character as separate property and would be divisible in divorce but whatever wasn t deposited in that account and is still held in one spouse s separate name would remain that spouse s separate property a small amount of commingling however may not transform funds into marital property if the evidence shows that parties intended to keep the funds separate and the funds can be clearly traced back to their separate origins as the court of appeals explained in landry chan v poh huat chan the fact that separate funds were deposited into an account with marital money did not automatically convert the entire amount into marital property where the funds could be directly traced to non marital sources and there was no evidence that the parties intended the funds to be marital property passive appreciation of separate property in contrast to the active appreciation described above purely passive appreciation of a separate asset such as interest on a separate bank account or market gains on a separate stock portfolio that is not actively managed will usually be considered separate property inheritance or gift received during marriage an inheritance or gift received by one spouse during the marriage is generally considered separate property unless commingled and treated as marital as discussed above personal injury proceeds to compensate for pain and suffering the michigan court of appeals has recognized that personal injury lawsuit proceeds are separate property if they are meant to compensate a person for their own pain and suffering by contrast when lawsuit proceeds or for that matter workers compensation benefits are meant to compensate a person for lost wages during the marriage those funds are marital just as the wages would have been next week we ll discuss how one spouse s separate property might be invaded in divorce see cunningham 289 mich app at 206 no 331977 2017 wl 1418052 at 21 mich ct app apr 20 2017 see also powers v powers no 301868 2012 wl 2019081 at 3 mich ct app june 5 2012 in light of the testimony suggesting that the parties always understood that they were inclined to hold their respective assets as separate property the court did not clearly err in concluding that that intention carried over to the condominium see reeves 226 mich app at 497 cunningham 289 mich app at 201 id

morgan conference covid 19 the jittery stock market the future of medicare advantage and recent industry changes the reason i was stuck in my home office for the second year instead of being crushed in the rolling mosh pit of investors executives and analysts from all over the world in the escape room environment of the westin st francis in san francisco is of course covid and specifically the omigod variant sorry couldn t resist we all know that it s really that marvel universe spinoff omicron so let s start there during today s sessions a number of health plans health systems and physician organizations spoke to the current situation with covid 19 centene reported that their december 31 2021 data on a rolling seven day basis showed omicron was running on average at about 60 of the inpatient utilization trend as compared to the delta variant during its surge centene noted that for centene medicare members the inpatient utilization trend was higher than 60 but lower than 60 for medicaid and marketplace members according to lloyd dean commonspirit health ceo commonspirit health s covid census was nearing what it had been at the delta peak agilon health noted modest covid related medicare advantage inpatient utilization partially offset with a pronounced shift to outpatient care based upon agilon s latest data multiple presentations also noted that there did not seem to be a lot of built up deferred medical demand carrying over from 2021 into 2022 healthcare service utilization seemed to be sufficient in 2021 to address much of the 2021 demand and carryover demand from 2020 moderna presented as well today but there were no blockbuster announcements just confirmation from moderna ceo stéphane bancel that moderna s initial data seems to indicate that the moderna vaccine is generally protective against hospitalizations and death pfizer is expecting to release its hybrid booster covering omicron and earlier variants as soon as march moderna is still looking at whether an omicron specific booster is necessary or whether the existing vaccine will work well enough interestingly moderna is working with canada and australia to be followed by other countries on creating in country vaccine manufacturing facilities and shortening the dreaded global supply chain moderna is also considering a 500 million manufacturing facility to be built in africa but the host country has not yet been selected moderna has its eyes on a more comprehensive approach to vaccination using mrna technology moderna aims to create a pan respiratory annual booster that will not only provide protection against covid 19 and hopefully covering any then prevalent variant but will also provide protection against the flu rsv respiratory syncytial virus and other similar viruses although we don t claim to be mrna experts all indications are that mrna technology is an incredibly powerful tool in addressing the vaccination needs of a global population pfizer certainly views mrna as the future of infectious disease treatment and is even working on cancer vaccines based upon mrna technology not to be left out of the conversation sinovac china s leading vaccine manufacturer and producer of an inactivated vaccine for covid 19 as opposed to the pfizer and moderna mrna vaccines had a tremendous 2021 while sinovac primarily addresses the chinese market sinovac has expanded globally and produces the most widely utilized covid vaccine accounting for approximately 40 of all covid vaccine doses administered worldwide sinovac s inactivated covid vaccine has been approved for use in some countries for children as young as 3 and is similar to other common vaccines such as those administered for the flu hepatitis a polio and rabies while all of the covid 19 vaccine manufacturers have had astounding financial success a global customer base will do that the numbers are jaw dropping sinovac went from net income slightly in the red in the first ½ of 2020 to 5 1 billion in net income in the first ½ of 2021 moderna generated sales of 17 5 billion in 2021 unaudited estimate it s generally accepted that covid will not go away and these vaccine manufacturers will continue to produce boosters we can all expect to be receiving over the long haul farewell and hello there also were some ceo shadows over the conference with the recent announcement this past month that michael neidorff of centene will be stepping down as ceo this year s jp morgan conference was the first conference in many years without a michael neidorff presentation sarah london centene s vice chair and drew asher centene s evp and cfo led the centene presentation effectively london also announced that jim murray was transitioning from centene s newly acquired subsidiary magellan health to centene s value creation office london and asher noted as to medicare advantage that centene s health benefit ratio hbr a plan s medical benefit expenses expressed as a percentage of its premium revenue also known as medical loss ratio mlr in a provider context has been stable with medicare advantage membership growth in the latest annual enrollment period as reported during the centene presentation centene anticipates the expansion of medicare advantage margins starting in 2023 moreover centene hopes to have 50 of its medicare advantage members in 4 star plans by then as well at this point you may be asking yourself why are centene s latest medicare advantage results interesting certainly they appear to be solid and expected the answer of course is the other significant shadow that was looming over today s j p morgan conference humana s interesting last week humana stock took a significant tumble last week falling almost 20 after humana reported that its individual medicare advantage membership growth expected for 2022 would only be 150 000 200 000 down from humana s previous growth estimate of 325 000 to 375 000 last thursday at a goldman sachs conference humana s ceo bruce broussard tried to emphasize per media reports that the lowered medicare advantage enrollment outlook was a retention issue as sales were very close to expectations broussard drew attention to the telephonic marketing channel and was reported to say that the marketplace was becoming commoditized humana s announcement and broussard s explanation sent quite a ripple through the stock prices of both medicare advantage health plans and provider organizations as wall street tried to decide if the medicare advantage heyday of the last few years had come and gone already a scary thought given that a significant number of ipos in 2021 were premised on the future growth of medicare advantage enrollment in light of last week s medicare advantage news every single day one presenting company that even knew how to say medicare advantage was asked in some way about the outlook for medicare advantage generally the common answer was pretty rosy which only focused the spotlight further on humana broussard and humana s new cfo susan diamond then stepped onto the stage to set the record straight i have to say i really felt for broussard as he sat there explaining his comments from last week he looked like someone waiting for his life changing lab results to come back repeatedly licking his lips looking pale and at one point clasping his hands together as if in prayer in summary broussard directed his audience to look for a return to humana s value proposition in 2023 as humana had made the decision to conservatively price so as to protect its margin this year 2022 interestingly the member retention issue that triggered the stock drop last week was identified as significantly involving members with one year or less tenure with humana and broussard s comment last week was not that the medicare advantage industry itself was commoditizing and therefore reducing the margin prospects for medicare advantage in the future but that the telephonic sale channel was looking primarily toward pricing and ignoring other value proposition elements such as social determinants of health support or non cash benefits fmo or fomo and that s one of the key takeaways we ve seen in the industry generally in the last few years field marketing organizations fmos e brokers and field marketing agents have been able to rapidly shift for better or for worse medicare advantage membership in and out of plans based upon pricing and commissions their role and importance has continued to grow in the industry although in this case it was humana that got hit with the short end of the stick fmos have the ability to cause similar issues or prop up the membership numbers for other medicare advantage health plans and providers with the pressure that both publicly traded medicare advantage health plans and provider companies have to show medicare advantage membership growth the fmo is one of the industry tools that can be a quick fix for short term membership growth it s an area of the industry with little visibility but a lot of short term impact it s also an area of growing concern for the the federal government as an example oak street health an operator of full risk value based medicare advantage clinics and a presenter on day one of the conference received a civil investigative demand cid from the us department of justice on november 1 2021 per oak street s public filings the doj is investigating whether among other things the oak street health relationship with third party marketing agents may have violated the federal false claims act oak street did not have a substantive update on the cid during its presentation other than to note that its fmo program was new and affected less than 10 of its new patients oak street s presentation focused instead on oak street s center based growth strategy dueling risk models during its presentation oak street reported that it had opened up 50 new clinic centers in 2021 and expected to open another 70 in 2022 oak street also took investors through the center results by vintage year launch year according to oak street its 10 most mature centers were each generating on average about 8 million in margin oak street also reported that its center opening process was accelerating with 2022 centers expected to open two months earlier than earlier vintage centers oak street also featured the clinical results of its model with an oak street physician typically seeing an average of ten patients a day versus the more common 20 30 with average visits of 30 minutes and approximately eight visits per year for their medicare advantage seniors this model was reported to result in a 51 decrease in hospital emergency room visits which obviously drives significant reductions in total cost of care these numbers are credible and are seen in other clinic or center based models other leading operators using this center model include chenmed s dedicated clinics and humana s centerwell clinics formerly partners in primary care in a different clinic approach villagemd has partnered to create full service primary care clinics co located with walgreens locations there are 80 such collocated facilities in existence today and they plan for 1 000 more with close integration of the primary care facility and a brand name pharmacy villagemd has targeted a broader patient population but with a focus on patients requiring treatment for chronic conditions villagemd is now generating 80 of its revenue from value based reimbursement contracts villagemd s aim is to change the care delivery model from clinic based reactionary care to a 24 7 high touch technology driven model villagemd has built its own care team applications and patient applications which allow patients to easily and frequently connect with their providers this ease of access evidently has resulted in happy patients and happy providers villagemd has a 90 patient retention rate and a 98 provider retention rate by facilitating an easy connection between patient and provider villagemd estimates a savings of 2 300 per patient in its high acuity population agilon health takes a very different approach but also has striking results agilon health s strategy is focused on partnering with existing local physician anchor groups rather than building new centers or clinics resulting in a capital lite growth model like oak street agilon focuses on medicare advantage and medicare direct contracting the agilon model involves physicians in governance and aligns with the physicians financially to participate in improved member quality and outcomes and in reductions in total cost of care the agilon model also improves with economies of scale as it allows for more data more integration of specialist referral networks and more management of care touchpoints outside the primary care physician s office agilon has been wrapping around its core offering of member risk stratification and a multi disciplinary care team social workers nurse practitioners pharmacists etc a range of effective initiatives such as placing nurses in emergency departments to evaluate care alternatives identifying the highest quality specialists with higher volume referrals to such doctors establishing end of life programs and conducting data analysis to solve facility specific and or marketwide readmission issues using the akron ohio market as an example agilon was able to identify that it was achieving 90 compliance for cholesterol hypertension and diabetes medication and that the use of high quality tier i cardiologists was resulting in on average 100 per member per month cost savings considering that in many markets the global risk premium in medicare advantage available to providers is in the 825 850 range that type of cost savings is very strong agilon also shared that its ohio market medical margin per member per month savings had moved from 40 in year 1 to a preliminary level of 160 pmpm in year 3 again as compared to an 825 total premium pmpm paid steven sell ceo of agilon explained that under the agilon model the doctors receive half the savings resulting in an effective economic alternative for physician groups that are otherwise considering a sale to a hospital system to a strategic aggregator like an optum or to private equity agilon also reported that the cost of customer acquisition is low in its model approximately 400 per member with such costs being typically recouped in full within the first one to two years so without a clinic model that requires a multi million dollar buildout recruiting physicians to staff new centers as agilon teams with existing physician groups and a low cost of customer acquisition the return on investment can accelerate even privia which uses a non owned multiple line of business management model has started to take full risk announcing that it has approximately 23 000 members in such line of business who s next so with all of these companies competing for the risk dollars is the medicare risk market oversaturated or commoditized the answer today across the board was no mike pykosz ceo of oak street indicated that it would take 10 000 oak street centers to fulfill the demand today for medicare advantage remember that they are opening up 70 centers in all of 2022 agilon s steven sell reminded the audience that 30 million incremental medicare members will need to move into risk or value based care vbc arrangements by 2030 to meet the goal set by cms as humana s bruce broussard shared the market is early on medicare advantage primary care on a risk basis so there s evidently room to run phrase of the day land and expand was the phrase of the day with multiple companies describing that approach to customer acquisition and revenue and ebitda growth telehealth provider teladoc sees the land and expand strategy as well suited for increasing patient engagement and revenue per member teladoc ceo jason gorevic made the interesting point that consumers now expect virtual care to be provided holistically and to be similar to digital experiences in the rest of their lives that thinking drove the acquisition by teladoc of chronic care diabetes management company livongo by teladoc gorevic also reported that health plans are now conceptualizing telehealth and digital health as an entry ramp to chronic care management for many consumers that opportunity then can lead to vbc and risk arrangements for teladoc a relative newcomer in the primary care space carbon health founded by eren bali who previously founded udemy the largest online education platform in the world has a goal of bringing accessible healthcare to the masses in a tech enabled environment carbon is hyper focused on the technology aspects of the healthcare experience building its entire technology platform from the ground up from emr to its own patient facing applications carbon s focus is omnichannel healthcare meeting patients wherever they are by combining clinics and urgent care with a first rate virtual care platform carbon has some lofty ambitions rather than focusing on particular patient populations carbon aims to be a healthcare provider for everyone and has had some early success ramping from 7 million in revenue in 2019 to 225 million in revenue in 2021 interestingly carbon did not talk about any value based care approaches in its presentation the company s payer mix is ¼ self pay it will be interesting to see how carbon is able to utilize what appears to be a first rate patient experience as vbc becomes more ubiquitous in the us healthcare market and since we re talking telehealth commonspirit used day one to report that it is rolling out a virtual nursing program in multiple locations it will be interesting to see the results of that initiative how s the cash a quick check of multiple health system presentations today showed that the presenting health systems successfully were continuing to maintain significant days cash on hand typically at or above 200 to 300 days a word of warning the smaller hospitals were not presenting so don t take this as gospel across the entire hospital sector furthermore while omicron will delay things there still may be a reckoning for the medicare advance payments that still are required to be paid back at some point is there still room for more disruptive companies we have been seeing many interesting and innovative start ups and emerging growth companies in healthcare will large companies continue to want to partner with these potential market disruptors the answer today was yes as presentation after presentation showcased innovation partnerships centene noted that it is using its 29 health plans to pilot programs and test relationships with start up companies that can be useful to the health plan or its members while not discussed at today s conference our firm also has recently seen a wave of health plans investing in start ups and formalizing such investment activities into health plan led venture entities or programs at least someone s tail is wagging animal health company

what might be separate property below are some categories of assets that often will qualify as separate property income earned before marriage that is not commingled with marital funds income earned by either spouse before marriage is clearly separate property but those funds may lose their character as separate property and transform into marital property if they are commingled with marital assets and treated by the parties as marital property consequently depositing premarital earnings in a joint bank account and using that account to pay marital expenses would show an intention to treat the pre marriage income as marital property and therefore it would lose its character as separate property and would be divisible in divorce but whatever wasn t deposited in that account and is still held in one spouse s separate name would remain that spouse s separate property a small amount of commingling however may not transform funds into marital property if the evidence shows that parties intended to keep the funds separate and the funds can be clearly traced back to their separate origins as the court of appeals explained in landry chan v poh huat chan the fact that separate funds were deposited into an account with marital money did not automatically convert the entire amount into marital property where the funds could be directly traced to non marital sources and there was no evidence that the parties intended the funds to be marital property passive appreciation of separate property in contrast to the active appreciation described above purely passive appreciation of a separate asset such as interest on a separate bank account or market gains on a separate stock portfolio that is not actively managed will usually be considered separate property inheritance or gift received during marriage an inheritance or gift received by one spouse during the marriage is generally considered separate property unless commingled and treated as marital as discussed above personal injury proceeds to compensate for pain and suffering the michigan court of appeals has recognized that personal injury lawsuit proceeds are separate property if they are meant to compensate a person for their own pain and suffering by contrast when lawsuit proceeds or for that matter workers compensation benefits are meant to compensate a person for lost wages during the marriage those funds are marital just as the wages would have been next week we ll discuss how one spouse s separate property might be invaded in divorce see cunningham 289 mich app at 206 no 331977 2017 wl 1418052 at 21 mich ct app apr 20 2017 see also powers v powers no 301868 2012 wl 2019081 at 3 mich ct app june 5 2012 in light of the testimony suggesting that the parties always understood that they were inclined to hold their respective assets as separate property the court did not clearly err in concluding that that intention carried over to the condominium see reeves 226 mich app at 497 cunningham 289 mich app at 201 id

pleased to announce our strong results this quarter our quarterly sales of 110 0 million yielded a gross margin of 32 6 and brought our year to date sales to 286 4 million which represents our highest sales volume since fiscal year 2016 the sales volume was achieved thanks to the delivery of large orders dedicated to the petrochemical and oil and gas markets by our north american and italian operations our backlog2 remains high at 543 0 million and our book to bill ratio2 remains at an even 1 00 when we consider the nine month period on the covid 19 front we took the necessary measures in

million or 53 7 for the quarter sales for the quarter were positively impacted by increased shipments by the company s north american and italian operations of large orders primarily destined for the petrochemical and oil and gas markets respectively additionally the company s mro sales for the quarter improved compared to last year in reaction to the higher bookings of such orders recorded in the first half of the current fiscal year bookings 2 amounted to 88 4 million a decrease of 79 2 million or 47 3 for the quarter this decrease is primarily attributable to a generally lower level of bookings coupled with large oil and gas and nuclear orders recorded in the third quarter of the previous year by the company s italian and french operations the decrease for the quarter was partially offset by higher mro orders recorded by the company s north american operations the company is encouraged by the recovery of its mro order bookings which were severely impacted by the global pandemic at the end of the prior fiscal year and ultimately adversely affected the sales of the latter part of the previous fiscal year and the first half of the current fiscal year amounted to 88 4 million a decrease of 79 2 million or 47 3 for the quarter this decrease is primarily attributable to a generally lower level of bookings coupled with large oil and gas and nuclear orders recorded in the third quarter of the previous year by the company s italian and french operations the decrease for the quarter was partially offset by higher mro orders recorded by the company s north american operations the company is encouraged by the recovery of its mro order bookings which were severely impacted by the global pandemic at the end of the prior fiscal year and ultimately adversely affected the sales of the latter part of the previous fiscal year and the first half of the current fiscal year gross profit amounted to 35 9 million an increase of 13 8 million or 62 8 for the quarter the gross profit percentage for the quarter of 32 6 was an increase of 180 basis points compared to last year s third quarter the improvement in gross profit percentage for the quarter is primarily attributable to the higher sales volume which helped to cover the company s fixed production overhead costs more efficiently the company s improved margins are also stemming from the delivery of a product mix with a greater proportion of higher margin product sales as well as margin improvement activities implemented over the course of the past fiscal years within the scope of the v20 restructuring and transformation plan the gross profit for the quarter also benefited from a positive reevaluation of the company s provision for performance guarantees caused by the successful negotiation of a customer claim during the quarter additionally the company s gross profit benefited from favorable movements in unrealized foreign exchange translation primarily attributable to the fluctuation of the u s dollar against the euro and the canadian dollar for the quarter when compared to the prior year finally the increase in gross profit percentage was such that it could more than offset the impact of a lower amount of cews of 1 5 million for the quarter compared to last year the subsidies are allocated between cost of sales and administration costs net income1 for the quarter amounted to 4 5 million or 0 21 per share compared to 9 5 million or 0 44 per share last year ebitda2 for the quarter amounted to 13 3 million or 0 62 per share compared to 13 8 million or 0 64 per share last year the decrease in ebitda1 for the quarter was primarily due to the absence of restructuring and transformation income in the current quarter which totalled 8 1 million last year and resulted mainly from a 9 6 million gain recognized on the disposal of one of the company s montreal plants an integral part of the north american manufacturing footprint optimization plan which was planned in the scope of v20 the decrease was also due to an increase in administration costs of 7 1 million or 37 1 for the quarter which is primarily attributable to a decrease of 1 2 million in cews received by the company compared to last year an increase in sales commissions due to the higher sales volume and a general increase in administration expenses that had been significantly lowered when the global pandemic broke out last year the subsidies are allocated between cost of sales and administration costs on the other hand the decrease in ebitda2 for the quarter was partially offset by an increase in gross profit thanks to the reasons mentioned above the movement in the company s net income1 for the quarter was primarily attributable to the same factors as explained above coupled with an unfavorable movement in income taxes and net finance costs first nine months fiscal 2022 unless otherwise noted all amounts are in u s dollars and all comparisons are to the first nine months of fiscal 2021 sales amounted to 286 4 million an increase of 69 8 million or 32 3 for the nine month period sales for the nine month period were positively impacted by increased shipments by the company s north american and italian operations of large orders primarily destined for the petrochemical and oil and gas markets respectively the company s mro sales for the nine month period were nonetheless negatively affected by the persistent unfavorable market conditions triggered by the coronavirus covid 19 global pandemic which had significantly affected the company s distribution channels bookings in the previous fiscal year the lower distribution channels bookings in the latter part of the prior year translated in lower shipments of such orders in the first half of the current year bookings 2 amounted to 286 4 million a decrease or 59 3 million of 17 2 for the nine month period the decrease is primarily attributable to a generally lower level of bookings in the current quarter coupled with large oil and gas and nuclear orders recorded in the third quarter of the previous year by the company s italian and french operations the decrease for the nine month period was partially offset by higher mro orders recorded by the company s north american operations amounted to 286 4 million a decrease or 59 3 million of 17 2 for the nine month period the decrease is primarily attributable to a generally lower level of bookings in the current quarter coupled with large oil and gas and nuclear orders recorded in the third quarter of the previous year by the company s italian and french operations the decrease for the nine month period was partially offset by higher mro orders recorded by the company s north american operations as a result of bookings 2 being comparable to sales in the current nine month period the company s book to bill ratio 2 was an even 1 00 for the period furthermore the total backlog 2 decreased by 19 5 million or 3 5 since the beginning of the fiscal year amounting to 543 0 million as at november 30 2021 the reduction of the backlog 2 is primarily due to the weakening of the euro spot rate against the u s dollar since the beginning of the fiscal year being comparable to sales in the current nine month period the company s book to bill ratio was an even 1 00 for the period furthermore the total backlog decreased by 19 5 million or 3 5 since the beginning of the fiscal year amounting to 543 0 million as at november 30 2021 the reduction of the backlog is primarily due to the weakening of the euro spot rate against the u s dollar since the beginning of the fiscal year gross profit amounted to 87 2 million an increase of 29 8 million or 51 8 for the nine month period the gross profit of 30 5 represented an increase of 400 basis points compared to the same period last year the improvement in gross profit percentage is primarily attributable to the higher sales volume which helped to cover the company s fixed production overhead costs more efficiently the company s improved margins are also stemming from the delivery of a product mix with a greater proportion of higher margin product sales as well as margin improvement activities implemented over the course of the past fiscal years within the scope of the v20 restructuring and transformation plan the gross profit for the nine month period also benefited from a positive reevaluation of the company s provision for performance guarantees caused by the successful negotiation of a customer claim during the quarter additionally the company s gross profit benefited from favorable movements in unrealized foreign exchange translation primarily attributable to the fluctuation of the u s dollar against the euro and the canadian dollar for the nine month period when compared to the prior year finally the increase in gross profit percentage was such that it could more than offset the impact of a lower amount of cews of 4 6 million for the nine month period compared to last year the subsidies are allocated between cost of sales and administration costs net income1 for the nine month period amounted to 4 4 million or 0 21 per share compared to 2 5 million or 0 12 per share in the prior period ebitda2 for the nine month period amounted to 23 0 million or 1 07 per share compared to 13 9 million or 0 65 per share in the prior period the improvement in ebitda2 for the nine month period is primarily attributable to an improved gross profit largely due to an increased sales volume while reflecting the notably improved product mix and margins resulting from the company s targeted efforts under v20 described earlier the company s gross profit also benefited from favorable movements in unrealized foreign exchange translation for the nine month period when compared to the prior year as well as a favorable reevaluation of the company s provision for performance guarantees the improvement is also attributable to a reduction in other expenses of 3 1 million for the nine month period primarily due to land clean up costs of a former factory incurred in the second quarter of the prior year on the other hand these improvements were partially offset by the absence of restructuring and transformation income in the current nine month period which totalled 5 2 million in the previous year these improvements were also partially offset by an increase in administration costs of 18 3 million or 32 7 for the nine month period primarily attributable to a decrease of 3 8 million in cews received by the company compared to last year an increase in sales commissions due to the improved sales volume for the period a general increase in administration expenses that had been significantly lowered when the global pandemic broke out last year as well as an increase of 1 2 million in the costs recognized in connection with the company s ongoing asbestos litigation the favorable movements in the company s net income1 for the nine month period was primarily attributable to the same factors as explained above coupled with an unfavorable movement in income taxes and net finance costs dividend at the end of fiscal 2020 the

photo credit cryptographer shutterstock the covid 19 pandemic has put unprecedented strain on the u s health system over the last two years with hospitals and providers facing heavy workloads a fractured supply chain and labor shortages the system is continuing to struggle as the omicron variant brings the newest largest wave of covid cases yet these challenges are pushing u s health spending to new heights a recent study from health affairs reported that total health spending in the u s increased by 9 7 in 2020 to 4 1 trillion even as gdp declined by 2 2 one of the biggest factors in that increase was a significant infusion of federal funding for health through covid 19 relief legislation like the 2 2 trillion cares act and the 900 billion coronavirus response and relief supplemental appropriations act these federal dollars provided support to health providers helped strengthen public health infrastructure to manage the spread of the coronavirus and sped the development and distribution of vaccines but while the federal government has spent heavily to navigate the current crisis it is less clear how covid 19 might affect overall health spending in the long term even before covid 19 state and local governments have been spending an increasingly large share of their budgets on health ongoing challenges from the pandemic and efforts to strengthen the health system in the future could further accelerate that growth at the state and local level total spending on health care has more than doubled over the last two decades from 127 3 billion in 2000 to 321 7 billion in 2019 a 70 increase after adjusting for inflation while state and local spending has increased overall health also represents an increasing share of the total in 2000 health care was 8 5 of total spending while in 2019 that figure rose to 9 6 a number of factors are contributing to this increased total some experts cite a reliance on expensive new innovations and technologies in care and administrative complexity of insurers and hospitals as a major contributor to overall costs the aging of the baby boomer generation which totals more than 70 million americans brings greater health needs and increases costs as well amid these other factors the expansion of medicaid under the affordable care act has also increased what states must spend on their portion of the program although it s important to note that most of medicaid spending is categorized as public welfare spending regardless of the reason health care is one of the primary spending categories in state and local budgets at 9 6 of spending health is the third largest state and local government category behind public welfare which includes means tested supports like the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program and represents around 22 3 of state and local spending and k 12 education which makes up 21 5 of state and local budgets but some states spend more on health care than others in total spending high population states like california texas new york and florida lead the nation while california 1 533 is also among the top spending states on a per capita basis many of the other leaders are smaller states like wyoming 2 978 south carolina 1 730 and kansas 1 558 the data used in this analysis is from the u s census bureau s annual survey of state and local government finances

photo credit ugis riba shutterstock world leaders convened in glasgow this november for the 2021 united nations climate change conference facing the intensification of global climate change the negotiators reached an agreement that explicitly commits to reducing the use of coal limiting other greenhouse gas emissions and providing support to developing countries most impacted by climate change the glasgow conference reflected heightened urgency around climate change as the effects of carbon emissions have accelerated and become more severe in recent years a 2021 report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change found that without rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions warming above 1 5 c is almost inevitable this level of warming would have disastrous effects in the form of sea level rise more severe weather events and harm to agricultural systems and human health while there is still much work to do the good news for the u s is that many states and the country as a whole have begun to reverse the growth in carbon emissions government policy to limit emissions and advancements in lower emission technologies across the economy have helped turn the trends in the right direction much of this progress has taken place over the last fifteen years total co2 emissions peaked in 2007 at over 6 billion metric tons but that figure fell to around 4 6 billion metric tons in 2020 one of the big contributors has been decarbonization in electric power generation due to the decline of heavy emitting coal and the rise of clean energy sources like wind and solar over the last decade these factors have reduced co2 emissions associated with electric power generation by around 36 and this trend also contributes to emissions reductions in the main end use sectors transportation industrial residential and commercial that consume electricity residential and commercial have seen the sharpest declines with emissions dropping by more than a quarter since 2010 across both sectors combined encouragingly these declines have taken place even while the u s population and economy have continued to grow from 1970 to the mid 2000s carbon emissions and gdp grew together with the pace of gdp growth exceeding that of carbon emissions more recently the steady upward trajectory of gdp has continued while carbon emissions have ticked downward since 2007 total energy related co2 emissions are down by 23 9 while real gdp has increased by 17 7 in the same span these trends help alleviate concerns that reducing carbon emissions necessarily means limiting economic productivity and many u s states are proving that economic growth in a less carbon intensive economy is possible the data used in this analysis is from the u s energy information administration and the u s census bureau to determine the states with the least carbon intensive economies researchers at commodity com calculated total co2 emissions per gdp states with a lower value

the woodlands texas jan 12 2022 prnewswire huntsman corporation nyse hun issued the following statement in response to the letter and nomination notice the company received from starboard value lp today at huntsman s investor day in november we announced financial targets building on the strongest profit and margin performance the company has ever achieved with its current portfolio of businesses the huntsman board of directors actively oversaw that performance and it continues to oversee the company s announced comprehensive initiatives all of which enhance accountability and alignment with our shareholders including initiating a strategic review process for the textile effects division to continue advancing our focus on portfolio enhancement authorizing new share repurchases of 1 billion over the next three years building on the 682 million of share repurchases huntsman has completed since 2018 over the next three years building on the of share repurchases huntsman has completed since 2018 implementing a multi year incentive compensation program for all huntsman officers and vice presidents that ties the vast majority of their incentive compensation to the achievement of the investor day targets thereby promoting transparency ensuring objective accountability and fostering execution and substantially completing the board refreshment process that began in 2018 by adding david b sewell josé muñoz and curtis e espeland highly qualified and independent directors who were identified by a leading international search firm to a group of diverse and experienced independent directors including four recent additions u s navy retired vice admiral jan tighe who joined the board in 2019 and chairs the board s sustainability committee sonia dulá who joined the board in 2020 and is chair apparent of the compensation committee jeanne mcgovern who joined the board in 2021 and chairs the audit committee and cynthia egan who joined the board in 2020 chairs the nominating and corporate governance committee and serves as non executive vice chair and lead independent director importantly these recent initiatives are the latest steps in the strategy we began executing in 2017 since that time the board has overseen a significant repositioning of the huntsman portfolio that has generated meaningful shareholder value the company has divested 40 of its businesses including the sale of its commodity portfolio to indorama in 2020 for 2 billion the indorama announcement intensified huntsman s focus on differentiated high margin and downstream product lines which led to 105 8 of total shareholder return tsr through january 11 2022 42 4 percentage points better than the performance of the s p 500 over the same period huntsman values the views of all of our shareholders including starboard and maintains an open dialogue with them although our normal policy is not to comment on individual conversations members of our board and the executive management team have held numerous discussions with starboard over the past several months huntsman s engagement with starboard has been frequent and extensive since the outset soon after starboard disclosed their stake we invited starboard to our headquarters to understand their perspectives we previewed our investor day presentation with starboard and incorporated input from them there was and continued to be no misalignment with starboard on the company s objectives and strategic initiatives huntsman has continued to keep lines of communication with starboard open and promptly responded to every outreach they made in particular huntsman repeatedly told starboard that its ongoing board refreshment was moving forward when starboard told us that they had specific director candidates ready more than a month ago on december 9 2021 huntsman immediately asked for those candidates names so that our nominating and corporate governance committee could consider them alongside the candidates previously identified by the independent search firm huntsman immediately asked for those candidates names so that our nominating and corporate governance committee could consider them alongside the candidates previously identified by the independent search firm between december 9 2021 and january 5 2022 huntsman repeatedly sought those names and none were given and huntsman repeatedly sought those names and none were given instead starboard insisted that huntsman s nominating and corporate governance committee surrender its duties appoint starboard s three unidentified candidates and remove two huntsman directors on december 23 2021 instead of providing the requested names starboard asked for the huntsman d o questionnaires a required step towards making nominations and a clear indication of starboard s readiness to engage in a proxy contest instead of providing the requested names starboard asked for the huntsman d o questionnaires a required step towards making nominations and a clear indication of starboard s readiness to engage in a proxy contest given these unconstructive responses from starboard huntsman s board determined that the continuation of our active board refreshment and the expeditious holding of the upcoming annual meeting was in the best interests of our shareholders and appointed three highly qualified independent directors messrs sewell muñoz and espeland and announced the date of our annual meeting only after these announcements on the evening of january 5 2022 did starboard finally share the names of three candidates jeff smith james l gallogly and sandra beach lin within 48 hours the nominating and corporate governance committee had interviewed starboard s two outside candidates james and sandra and did starboard finally share the names of three candidates and within 48 hours the nominating and corporate governance committee had interviewed starboard s two outside candidates james and sandra and following these interviews the company attempted to work constructively with starboard to reach an agreement and avoid a proxy contest despite huntsman s multiple good faith attempts to reach an amicable outcome in the best interests of all huntsman shareholders an agreement could not be reached we are deeply disappointed that starboard is forcing huntsman and its shareholders through the cost and distraction of an unnecessary proxy contest starboard is more concerned with installing their handpicked candidates on huntsman s board than allowing the board and management team to create shareholder value through our multiple initiatives that starboard supports the board expects shareholders will appreciate the independence experience and expertise of huntsman s refreshed board of directors and they will benefit from a relentless and undistracted focus on clear financial targets designed to generate transparency and accountability for three successive years of record improved performance huntsman s board has determined that it is in the best interests of shareholders to let them resolve this situation expeditiously huntsman continues to welcome constructive insights from our shareholders and remains committed to taking decisive actions to drive sustainable value creation shareholders are not required to take any action at this time the board will review the nomination notice pursuant to established policies and present its recommendations with respect to the election of directors in the company s definitive proxy statement which will be filed with the securities

radnor pa jan 12 2022 prnewswire nrx pharmaceuticals nasdaq nrxp filed a lawsuit on monday against relief therapeutics six rlf otcqb rlftf rlfty its former collaboration partner in new york state supreme court the counterclaim details relief s breach and repudiation of the collaboration agreement highlights the false nature of relief s claims to have worldwide rights to aviptadil to have engaged in phase 3 research using aviptadil and to having any human grade drug available to treat patients the lawsuit details a past pattern of collusion by raghuram selvaraju and members of relief s management and associates in matters that have led to criminal investigations sanctions fines and in one case incarceration nrx seeks 185 million in reliance damages as well further punitive damages associated with the libelous and extortionate behavior nrx regrets relief s decision to delay the scheduled december mediation to late february and looks forward to resolving this dispute with relief as soon as possible notwithstanding nrx advised relief today that the collaboration agreement is no longer in effect given relief s breach and repudiation of the agreement nrx advised relief s leadership to cease misrepresenting itself as nrx s collaboration partner in communications such as those offered at this week s h c wainwright bioconnect virtual healthcare conference and in recent filings before the us securities and exchange commission nrx believes that it is the shareholders of relief and the patients in europe who need access to this medicine who are the primary victims of relief s claims to have a drug which they call rlf 100 to offer patients from nrx s perspective the chief priority should be saving lives in the middle of a public health emergency now that our counterclaim is filed we hope to get back to the business of saving lives the phase 3 trial sponsored by the national institutes of health has enrolled more than two thirds of its participants and is now starting its international phase we have just submitted data to the fda documenting that patients treated with zyesami aviptadil after failing to recover on remdesivir have a 3 fold increased odds of recovery from the icu compared to those treated with placebo and a 4 fold increased odds of surviving to day 60 said prof jonathan javitt md mph chairman and ceo of nrx just last weekend we were involved in airlifting our medication under the federal right to try act to the bedside of a patient in washington d c who is turning the corner as we speak last week dr jacobo elgozy published his first person experience of a last minute recovery in a miami newspaper also last week we received a report from a small hospital in texas where 17 of 19 patients treated with our drug under the right to try program survived and returned to their families it s this mission on saving lives that keeps us going 24 7 and drives us as a company we continue to pursue regulatory clearance to distribute zyesami under right to try laws we look forward to restarting enrollment next month for our breakthrough drug nrx 101 for suicidal bipolar depression particularly since suicide rates have doubled with the stress of the public health emergency as we shared earlier this week we look forward to starting a trial of the brilife vaccine as a booster injection to prevent some of the variants that have circumvented the mrna vaccines nrx regrets the necessity of terminating the collaboration agreement and answering our former collaboration partner in court in order to expose the true nature of its management s actions relief callously breached its contract obligations by failing to fund the research and clinical trials as obligated relief has continued to mislead the public and shareholders by claiming via mr jack weinstein s presentation at this week s h c wainwright bioconnect virtual healthcare conference ownership over nrx s expanded access programs participation in the nih clinical trials and development of commercial scale manufacturing and distribution programs undertaken solely by nrx that relief refused to fund and in which relief did not participate the myriad of facts in the counterclaim paint a picture of relief s management refusing to fulfill its commitments under the collaboration agreement the main purpose of which was to develop and trial a potentially lifesaving treatment for covid 19 this behavior is not only a contractual breach but is shameful the counterclaim spells this out in great detail the unique circumstances of this case underscore why we chose to be represented by a former united states federal prosecutor and an attorney who has been effective in prosecuting malicious foreign enterprises while we at nrx are confident that we will prevail against our former collaboration partner we are deeply offended by the baseless and libelous accusation of relief s management that we somehow harmed patients in europe by withholding clinical data required for its regulatory submission the simple fact is that relief never manufactured a drug to distribute to patients and attacked us in order to obscure that deception the written record shows that we offered relief our full cooperation despite its breach of contract and even offered to manufacture zyesami to european standards for relief only to be rebuffed and ultimately sued certainly nobody has benefited from this behavior on the part of our former collaboration partner least of all patients in europe and the united kingdom nrx has now manufactured zyesami according to the good manufacturing practices required by the european union and the united kingdom and has retained regulatory counsel in both jurisdictions to make actual drug product immediately pending regulatory approval dr francis collins formerly of the national institutes for allergy and infectious diseases niaid recently identified zyesami as one of the few drugs still under study for the very sickest patients with covid 19 those in the icu on ventilators we have recently reported to the fda an observed 10 fold increase in odds of survival among patients who remain at risk of death despite treatment with remdesivir and other approved therapies we are similarly horrified that relief s management attempted to coerce nrx into using relief s patented formulation of aviptadil in critically ill patients despite relief s knowledge that the formulation was ineffective because the peptide aggregates and becomes denatured much like frying an egg even though relief knew its formulation had failed in clinical trials more than 10 years ago dr selvaraju demanded that nrx use this formulation in order to maintain the charade that relief had worldwide patent rights relief s complaint that began this litigation alleges that we somehow harmed relief by refusing to use this ineffective formulation despite repeated written warnings to both nrx and relief from relief s former chief medical officer and the inventor on their patent we are confident that the new york state supreme court will mete out the penalty merited by this offensive behavior in fact we believe relief s conduct is so egregious as to warrant the imposition of punitive damages under the law punitive damages may be awarded when reprehensible and malicious conduct is directed not only at the plaintiff but at the public nrx intends to donate any punitive damages awarded by the court to assist covid survivors as they are the true victims of relief s actions about nrx pharmaceuticals nrx pharmaceuticals nrx draws upon more than 300 years of collective scientific and drug development experience to bring improved health to patients the company is developing the brilife covid vaccine developed by the israel

h r mcmaster ph d us army ret the 26th united states national security advisor about zyesami aviptadil aviptadil is a synthetic form of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide vip first discovered by the late prof sami said in 1970 and zyesami is named in his honor although primarily concentrated in the lung it was first purified from the intestinal tract vip binds specifically to the alveolar type ii cell atii in the air sac alveolus of the lung where it has been shown have potent anti inflammatory anti cytokine activity in animal models of respiratory distress acute lung injury and inflammation most importantly vip stimulates atii cells to make the surfactant that must coat the lining of the lungs in order for them to exchange oxygen with the blood loss of surfactant causes respiratory failure and alveolar collapse which are hallmarks of covid 19 covid 19 related respiratory failure is caused by selective infection of the atii cell by the sars cov 2 virus the atii cells are vulnerable because of their ace2 surface receptors which serve as the route of entry for the virus coronavirus infection of the atii cell shuts down surfactant production triggers the formation of inflammatory cytokines and causes cell death cytopathy vip is shown to upregulate surfactant production block coronavirus replication in the atii cell block cytokine synthesis and prevent viral induced cell death cytopathy other than zyesami no currently proposed treatments for covid 19 specifically target this mechanism of action cautionary note regarding forward looking statements this

updated january 12 2022 at 4 37 pm et no you re not imagining it some grocery store shelves are bare again conjuring bad memories of spring 2020 for many social media is rife with images of empty supermarket aisles and signs explaining the lack of available food and other items stores such as aldi have apologized to customers for the shortages the reasons for the dwindling stock are numerous according to food industry analysts and include some issues that impacted retailers at the beginning of the pandemic as well as challenges that have cropped up more recently we re really seeing the perfect storm phil lempert editor of the website supermarketguru com told npr lempert said the northeast is facing some of the worst shortages now due in part to recent winter storms that snarled transportation routes but that could change with the weather but nate rose the communications director for the california grocers association said any comparison to march 2020 is not quite right there are some issues with out of stocks but it tends to be a situation where if you go to a store on a tuesday night maybe something s out of stock but by wednesday sometime it s back in store rose told npr everyone s become really reliant on kind of that just in time supply chain he added and i think what we re seeing is things are just behind a little bit right now some conservatives have begun using the hashtag bareshelvesbiden to blame the current administration for the shortages even though grocery stores experienced serious supply problems under president donald trump too here are some of the reasons driving the current supply shortages at your local supermarket the omicron variant the highly contagious new covid 19 variant that s causing record infections in the u s is undoubtedly one of the biggest stressors on the food industry right now grocery store workers are catching the virus in higher numbers and calling out sick making it tougher for markets to keep shelves stocked the stores themselves are finding it harder to source products because of the new strain vivek sankaran ceo of the grocery store chain albertson s said in an earnings call that the company had been hoping to recover from recent supply issues but omicron put a dent in that there are more supply challenges and we would expect more supply challenges over the next four to six weeks sankaran said on tuesday it s more than grocery stores though there are workers all across the food industry supply chain who are getting sick and staying home impacting food production manufacturing shipping and distribution the food company conagra the parent company of brands such as duncan hines and healthy choice is just one seeing a rise in omicron driven absenteeism president and ceo sean connolly said in an earnings call last week it s entirely reasonable for all of us to project that the next month or so could remain strained within the supply chain as omicron runs its course connolly said labor shortages in addition to workers becoming infected with covid 19 there are those who have simply quit lempert said the pandemic has turned grocery stores into battlefields with employees required to work in person throughout the pandemic explain food shortages and new public health measures to customers and try to keep themselves safe and healthy in the process as a result of that a lot of people said hey i don t need this and they ve left their jobs in the supermarket lempert said a recent survey conducted by the national grocers association found that many of its member retail and wholesale grocers reported operating their stores with 50 of their normal workforce supermarkets are beginning to offer higher pay better benefits and even tighter security to attract new applicants lempert said trucking and shipping truckers are also in short supply though there s some dispute about how bad the situation really is trucking companies are offering higher wages to attract workers but employment levels still aren t high enough to meet the demand for ground transport in december the white house announced a plan to bolster the trucking industry including making it easier for drivers to get commercial driver s license or cdls severe weather and climate change climate change isn t a new problem but it s one that s still vexing the food industry severe weather events are becoming more frequent and intense across the world as the planet warms according to lempert growers are yielding less corn and soy to feed farm animals which is having a downstream impact on the price and availability of meat eggs and dairy products in brazil heavy rains are inundating coffee fields and other crops which is limiting production severe weather is also making it harder to move food around recent storms in washington state prompted the closure of major roads and slowed the shipping of food to alaska where supermarkets told customers the one two punch of severe weather and shipping delays were to blame for barren shelves copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
