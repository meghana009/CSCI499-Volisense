following the november ballot that saw washington state voters approve a sweeping gun control initiative democrats will be pushing for further regulation during the upcoming legislative session washington attorney general bob ferguson has released his legislative requests for the 2019 session which include three provisions on gun regulation these included restrictions on magazine size banning the sale of assault style weapons and prohibiting untraceable guns and guns that cannot be detected by a metal detector democrats have already pre filed bills in both the house and the senate to address magazine size and untraceable guns similar bills in legislature are proposing to ban the sale of high capacity magazines which can hold more than 10 rounds standard magazines for rifles like the ar 15 or ak 47 often hold 30 rounds while novelty magazines can hold up to 100 rounds if the bills are passed owners of high capacity magazines will have their existing ones grandfathered in and will be allowed to keep them as long as they are locked up bills in both chambers have also been filed by democrats to ban untraceable guns commonly known as ghost guns these are firearms assembled from untraceable parts often bought online or by parts created with a 3d printer firearms would also be required to contain enough metal to register on a metal detector the house bill defines an undetectable firearm as one that is made of polymer plastic and does not contain at least 3 7 ounces of steel or steel alloy this was supported by 45th district sen manka dhigra d who said it is designed to keep people from printing guns with blueprints available online i think a lot of the problem is we actually don t know how many people and who all received the blueprint on how to print them she said dhingra is also hoping to introduce a new bill dealing with domestic violence it would give law enforcement the ability to remove weapons and ammunition during a domestic violence call that results in an arrest she is also planning on re introducing another bill she sponsored last year would ban people with a history of violence and a mental health diagnosis from buying a gun she s hoping to file them by dec 14 at the latest no bills had been submitted as of jan 4 dealing with an assault style weapons ban supported by the attorney general ferguson has been requesting a sales ban on assault style weapons since at least 2017 the ban would bar the sale of weapons that use a telescoping stock pistol grip foregrip high capacity magazines or muzzle attachments like a flash suppressor assault weapons are semi automatic rifles with at least one military style feature making the weapons easier to fire more accurately and rapidly than a typical hunting rifle his request read the 2019 state legislature session begins jan 14 and runs through april 28 both senate measures were supported by dhingra who made gun restrictions a main point of her campaign in the house democratic reps javier valdez and tina orwall of the 46th and 33rd districts respectively sponsored both bills along with other representatives democrats won a majority in both chambers of the legislature during the november 2018 election and saw support for gun control after the passage of i 1639 i 1639 raises the age to purchase semi automatic rifles to 21 mandates safe storage of firearms statewide and requires enhanced background checks and approval from local law enforcement before an assault style weapon can be sold additionally it requires that law enforcement check that an owner of assault style weapons is eligible to keep owning the firearm each year however even with majorities dhingra said she wasn t sure if the legislature would be able to pass additional gun regulations not all democrats are identical so we have democrats who have different ideas and they represent different districts so they have to represent their constituents she said nationally eight states have bans on magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds high capacity magazines were banned nationwide between 1994 and 2004 under the federal assault weapons ban weapons with two or more components including a telescoping stock pistol grip flash suppressor bayonet mount or grenade launcher were barred from being sold ferguson s proposal to classify a weapon as an assault style weapon with only one of these elements would be stricter than the 1994 law
three d s top 30 movies of 2018 another year has come and gone 2018 is a year i wish wouldn t have ended simply because of the plethora of cinematic pleasure that it offered the majority of the films on my best of the year list possessed an unceasing pursuit to locate and dissect deflated masculinity crushed egos and saying goodbye to the thing one loves most surprisingly female directors had an enormous year in 2018 and they were at the forefront at perceiving that masculinity was in peril films such as western the rider you were never really here zama and private life all of which were directed by women gave us a glimpse at what happens to a man when their masculinity is wounded egos were also susceptible to directors probing cameras this year ripe for endless rumination how can a priest continue to maintain a strong image when he s slowly loosing his faith in first reformed the women in the favourite care tremendously about their image and position and will do whatever it takes to maintain it an aging director in the other side of the wind does things only his way hardly listening to anyone within his circle and the results are catastrophic and the madman at the center of the house that jack built has the biggest ego of all which eventually paves his way to enter hell here are my top 30 movies of 2018 30 eighth grade directed by bo burnham 29 the tale directed by jennifer fox 28 minding the gap directed by bing liu 27 sollers point directed by matthew porterfield 26 support the girls directed by andrew bujalski 25 burning directed by lee chang dong 24 disobedience directed by sebastian lelio 23 claire s camera directed by sang soo hong 22 thunder road directed by jim cummings 21 mandy directed by panos cosmatos 20 the death of stalin directed by armando iannucci 19 cold war directed by pawel pawlikowski 18 sweet country directed by warwick thornton 17 mission impossible fallout directed by christopher mcquarrie 16 blackkklansman directed by spike lee 15 annihilation directed by alex garland 14 custody directed by xavier legrand 13 you were never really here directed by lynne ramsay 12 private life directed by tamra jenkins 11 the ballad of buster scruggs directed by joel and ethan coen 10 happy as lazzaro directed by alice rohrwacher italian film director alice rohrwacher chases the sublime and somehow captures its transcendent magic with a tale that s equally bizarre as it s beautiful initially she presents a keen observation on peasant existence in a pastoral and archaic village called inviolata an abundance of detail is looked at from the way these individuals sleep eat and change light bulbs rohrwacher highlights their grim existence studiously making her viewers think her film is strictly confined to this narrative that all changes though once royalty arrives to the village and the marchesa s son luca chikovani strikes up an odd lifelong friendship with lazzaro adriano tardiolo a hardworking young man who the village constantly takes advantage of happy as lazzaro doesn t prepare you for what happens in its second half it s lyrical and mystical transcending its original narrative in favor of a newer one that boggles the mind a depiction of a young man who may or may not be a saint there s a biblical quality to the film as it tries to comprehend a friendship that was squashed early but refuses to parish 9 first man directed by damien chazelle once again director damien chazelle captivates his audience with a character consumed by an unceasing passion and propelled forward by an unerring ambition burning within we ve seen this premise work gloriously before with chazelle s whiplash and la la land both films obsessed with music and the entertainment business with first man he s working on a much grander scale death haunts his newest film it s so conscious of it that it impetuously envelops the film quickly rendering it a meditative experience rather than a by the books story about space exploration the space travels explored here with apollo 11 take a back seat as chazelle is unceasing in his probing of ryan gosling s stoic portrayal of neil armstrong and the mortality that pervades his personal life and work life chazelle is honing in on the inner anguish plaguing armstrong which in turn causes the astronaut to pursue his own remedy the feat of becoming the first man to walk on the moon first man shrewdly and wisely uses the apollo 11 mission merely as a stage to depict one man s harrowing journey to thwart the anguish weighing on him and to steer him away from a debilitating emotional malaise toward a thing not on earth that can help him achieve self healing 8 the favourite directed by yorgos lanthimos whether it s with a concerto by vivaldi or a string quartet by beethoven director yorgos lanthimos has a penchant for subverting the divine into the dreadful in his newest film the favourite there s an odd feeling that the film emits it s hard to shake and it reminds one of the calculated coldness of a stanley kubrick film a sense of uneasiness washes over the film s viewers as we watch queen ann olivia colman and her two right hand ladies rachel weisz and emma stone vie for her attention and more importantly her affections the characters played by weisz and stone are wicked in their cunning attempts to keep queen ann from preferring one over the other fisheye camera lens creating ultra wide angles is used frequently by lanthimos here to create a warped view of 19th century england allowing the queen s estate and everything in it to subsume an air of dislocation as it jars our perception of royalty and exposes elegance as debauchery the favourite seems to be saying that within these fine confines of the castle individuals leave their morality at the door those present here are truly rotten to the core thanks to their prominent place in royalty willing to lie cheat and connive their way to achieve their deepest desires but lanthimos reminds us in a haunting final scene that there s always a hierarchy that maintains order thankfully lanthimos unique vision remains hardly untarnished as he maintains his signature macabre and somewhat comedic tone despite this film being released to a much wider audience than his previous films have been exposed to 7 the house that jack built directed by lars von trier endless arguments will be made regarding the levels of extreme wretchedness and ruthlessness evident in lars von trier s newest film the house that jack built the film s deployment of heinous murders violence and other violent grotesque acts has never been seen before in cinema but somehow miraculously von trier transcends them by allowing his viewers ceaseless access into the bewildering thoughts of his ocd driven psychopath played brilliantly and with confidence by matt dillon as he recounts a few of his murders to a man named verge bruno ganz some viewers may have no interest in encountering these rumination after perceiving the acts committed on screen stick with it the film is a confessional and an attempt to fathom the inner rumblings of a man rapidly spiraling down into the depths and circles and layers of hell von trier s latest is equally disturbing as it is ambitious as it s one of the few films brave enough to depict hell itself with imagery that s beyond what s expected from a film when attempting to fathom evilness with clips from glenn gould practicing piano excerpts from william blake s poetry and images from nazi concentration camps von trier isn t absolutely a sadist but a fearless director who isn t timid to examine the deprived and abject tendencies prevalent within our society 6 western directed by valeska grisebach western charts with exact precision a german construction crew building a hydroelectric plant in a remote village in bulgaria and the cultural clash that inevitably ensues western resembles a tempest that has been brewing for days waiting to erupt at any given moment grisebach directs her film perfectly as she knows how to curb temptations to showcase violence and bloodshed in exchange for thoroughly investigating masculinity and what makes it tick her film is a slow burning one that observes every single emotion glance word gesture poured beer and lit cigarette with the utmost care because these are the tings that govern humanity and our relations with others witnessing the film s hero meinhard neumann a german construction worker begin to make enemies with his own workers while making friends with the local bulgarians is astonishing to behold as grisebach paints a vivid portrait of how hatred and friendships undoubtedly arise despite two groups of people separated by language but not by impulsive emotions 5 roma directed by alfonso cuaron one of the most visually stunning film s one is likely to see roma embraces the ordinary and extraordinary that life continuously provides miraculously imbuing each subsequent scene with a dreamlike aura that s mesmeric in its beauty from simple images such as dirty water washing away the grim on a pavement and trickling into a drain to an airplane passing overhead through clear skies to a brief stunning exchange in a furniture store between two people who shared a sexual experience to jaw dropping camera pans roaming around devouring city night life roma distinguishes itself immediately as a monumental expansive piece of art alfonso cuaron s latest film has an insatiable appetite for life as his camera is irresistibly compelled to a specific time and place in 1970 s mexico i believe films that are concerned with the daily routines of life and so firmly placed in reality are the hardest to make films that hope to capture the minute and grand details of life itself can be an arduous task but with cuaron s consummate craft he extinguishes all doubts as he s determined to dissect a young woman s yalitza aparicio in a stunning debut role journey through many ups and downs during a single year the films from past cinematic masters such as fellini and bergman spring to mind while watching cuaron s roma simply because they exalt humanity and revel in the ordinary and extraordinary that we re always being exposed to 4 zama directed by lucrecia martel i do for you what no one did for me i say no to your hopes this quote is uttered by zama daniel gimenez cacho towards the end of lucrecia martel s film he s been marooned for years stationed in a small south american city zama wishes to be relocated with his family in buenos aires the only thing he needs is the kingdom s permission he continues to wait and wait and wait and wait and zama is an unforgettable journey that miraculously perceives the futility of some people s desires perfectly directed beautifully photographed martel s film is lyrical and damning effortlessly evoking the dramatic comedic horrifying and surreal that pervade our waking moments somehow though manipulating them to emulate our dreams 3 the other side of the wind directed by orson welles orson welles formidable new film is masterful the other side of the wind was thought to be lost after scholars and film industry leaders attempted to piece together the film s broken remains we get a picture that shows how advanced and radical welles directorial skills were getting the bulk of the story takes place during a party at an aging director s home played forcefully by john huston where members of the film world and critics and actors come to pay their respects a cinematic whirlwind that tears apart the film industry and the individuals involved in it the other side of the wind mimics a documentary type style while also staying true to a somewhat linear narrative that eventually gives way to a movie within a movie that dazzles in its ability to tell a tale of tortured lovers who never fulfill their emotions welles was light years ahead of his time a no holds barred approach is what he goes for stripping away the glossy veneer of previous behind the scenes films and holds a camera smack in hollywood s face revealing many inadequacies desperate yearnings and false dreams his vision is extraordinary as his camera zooms around flexing its unmatched creativity showcasing its insane film editing satirizing european film masterpieces from the 1960s and hopping between disparate screen ratios and film stock for different portions of the film creating a sense of profound yet strangely coherent madness 2 first reformed directed by paul schrader paul schrader s transcendent film captures the tumultuous days of a reverend on the verge of loosing his faith as things begin to fall apart it s a living nightmare when what you devoutly believed in begins to get interrogated and slowly starts unraveling leaving you to start questioning the foundation of your faith these are the days any person of faith dreads let alone someone who has dedicated their life to knowing god this tempest is brewing within reverend toller ethan hawke s best performance to date it s a wicked storm ready to devastate his very existence and consciousness schrader suffuses his film with profound sorrow that recalls austere cinematic masterpieces by robert breton and ingmar bergman that unabashedly probed the mysteries of faith first reformed can hold its own with those films 1 the rider directed by chole zhao it s so much darker when a light goes out than it would have been if it had never shone john steinbeck the winter of our discontent how do we expect to cope when presented with an existence we never suspected this is the dilemma at the core of chole zhao s masterpiece as a former rodeo champion brady jandreau playing a real life version of himself must refrain from getting back on his horse due to a tragic brain injury and attempt to make a new existence without his lifelong passion taking place in the badlands and showcasing south dakota s stunning vistas that tend to dwarf mankind and our problems when pitted against them masculinity an uncertain future and family brady s real life family portray themselves too are topics that the rider inspects with poetic precision not only is the film one of the most immersive cinematic experiences in recent years it s also a distinguished work of art that wrestles with the bleak fact of coping without what one ultimately loves zhao directs a splendidly breathtaking film that beholds a single existence in south dakota that can be about the lives of anyone of us

cnn millions of low income americans could have a harder time affording food if the partial government shutdown continues into february funding for food stamps school lunches and nutrition for pregnant women and young children is expected to run out next month if the impasse isn t resolved experts say the largest benefit at risk is the supplemental nutrition assistance program or snap the formal name for food stamps nearly 38 6 million americans depended on this aid to augment their grocery budgets in september according to the us department of agriculture s latest data the agency said last month that the program is funded through january but it has only 3 billion in reserves to cover february that s less than two thirds of food stamps 4 8 billion cost in september what the agency would do next is unknown if the 3 billion reserve were distributed evenly that would translate into a roughly 90 cut for the 19 4 million households that receive an average of 245 a month according to the left leaning center on budget and policy priorities that would put a huge hole in the budget every month for families that have very low incomes and would likely result in severe hardship and hunger said dottie rosenbaum a senior fellow at the center a program that provides food assistance to more than 7 million low income pregnant women new mothers and young children is similarly threatened the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children also has federal funding to last only through january according to the national wic association an advocacy organization the average cost of a monthly wic food package is just under 41 per person last week the agency s food nutrition service division said it intends to allocate all remaining carryover and unspent funds to state agencies according to the rev douglas greenaway the association s president federal officials are working with state agencies to see what other unspent money might be available for reallocation how much is available and how long the program can continue operating will vary by state but these actions together would push the cutoff date into february it becomes a make or break moment likely in mid february greenaway said at that point it s possible states might not sign up new clients or might stop providing benefits to women who recently gave birth or older children greenaway said they might also provide only one month of benefits instead of the typical three months child nutrition programs including school breakfasts and lunches and after school meals will continue into february according to the usda while states partner with the federal government on many food assistance programs they do not have the funds to cover the federal portion during the shutdown said james weill president of the nonprofit food research action center the usda did not respond to requests for comment if federal nutrition aid does run dry next month it will put a big strain on the nation s food banks which provide groceries to tens of millions of americans through the federal emergency food assistance program donations from the food industry and charitable contributions the usda paid for its shipments through march before the shutdown took effect said carrie calvert managing director of government relations at feeding america the nation s largest domestic hunger relief organization however the federal agency is no longer reimbursing states for storing and distributing the products which costs 5 3 million a month so far no problems have been reported but calvert is concerned that the funds will dry up if the shutdown is prolonged another issue if low income americans stop receiving their food stamps and other benefits more will turn to food banks for help many of which don t have the resources to handle the additional crush of people the capital area food bank which annually serves half a million people in the washington metro area through 450 pantries is already planning to boost its stocks since it expects to see more clients soon both federal workers and contractors who are losing their paychecks and low income residents who are losing their government aid it s already getting queries from the food pantries and soup kitchens it serves about whether they can get more supplies the shutdown comes at a bad time because the food bank typically has less inventory in january and february since it receives fewer donations after the holiday season ends the nonprofit agency is talking to grocery and corporate partners to see if they can hold food drives in coming weeks we just need to be able to provide more said radha muthiah the food bank s ceo

by angela fritz washington post ostensibly the partial government shutdown does not affect national weather service operations related to its mission to protect lives and property the agency is considered critical and the staff continue mission essential functions according to a spokeswoman but there are less obvious ways in which the shutdown does affect the weather service even its operations forecasters and managers are not getting paid weather models are not being maintained launched or improved emergency managers are not being trained effects could stretch well beyond when the government reopens the national weather service is a 24 hour operation with often grueling shift work not getting paid to do that job makes it even more stressful one manager of a national weather service office who wished to remain anonymous to speak openly said the lack of empathy from the people in their community and the government is like a slap in the face federal employees care about what they do the manager said as much as we can repeat in our minds it will be okay eventually you can t tell your body to stop worrying one employee got two hours of sleep last night after going through all his bills trying to figure out where to start we constantly hear you ll get paid eventually right said the manager well we have to pay bills today the national weather service is also responsible for the forecast models it uses on a daily basis from the massive global forecast system to the narrowly focused hurricane models forecasters partner with researchers to improve those systems or bring them back online when they fail suru saha a union steward at the environmental modeling center in college park maryland said the main impact has been on the national weather service s new global forecast model which was scheduled to go live in february but will surely be delayed because of the shutdown but in the meantime the current global forecast system or the gfs the united states premier weather model is running poorly and there s no one on duty to fix it there was a dropout in the scores for all of the systems on dec 25 saha said of the scoring system used to rank how the forecast models are performing all of the models recovered except for the gfs which is still running at the bottom of the pack not only does that mean the day to day weather forecast is worse she said it s a national security risk saha thinks it has to do with the data format the model brings in data from all over the world from dozens of different countries which are now standardizing the format to adhere to new regulations the environmental modeling center was working to adjust for the new formats when the shutdown started saha said that even though they re getting the data the gfs doesn t recognize the format so it can t use it and a model forecast is only as good as its input data once the gfs scores start to go bad it impacts everything saha said transportation the energy sector national security agriculture the stock market extreme weather there are about 50 full time federal employees at emc and 150 contractors only one person is working during the shutdown she said a manager who does not work on data or the models things are going to break and that really worries me because this is our job we are supposed to improve our weather forecasts not deteriorate them i m sorry saha said i m just really passionate about this to be sitting at home watching scores go down it feels terrible we owe taxpayers the best winter happens to be a critical time for hurricane model updates said eric blake the national weather service union steward at the national hurricane center in november and december researchers look back at the storms of the previous season to see how the models did and try to tweak them to perform better next season they use the months from january to june to make improvements you evaluate what happened and you use that to push forward blake said almost none of that is happening because of the shutdown they also use this time to train emergency managers from texas to maine before the start of the next hurricane season that s not happening and it s not clear whether the week long sessions will be made up when the government reopens saha said that even without pay she would be working if she could the last thing she and her colleagues want is an obvious failure in the forecast models this is what we do this is what the public never sees saha said we work day and night to make sure it never becomes apparent

the legacy achievements of gov dannel patrick malloy are like the man himself contentious after eight years in office malloy on wednesday will surrender executive power to his fellow democrat ned lamont the state malloy passes to his successor still faces considerable challenges a projected deficit of 1 7 billion looms for the first budget lamont must prepare pension and debt obligations outstrip projected revenues yet the outlook for lamont is far better than the one malloy faced in january 2011 when malloy took office connecticut was still in recession now the economy is growing to keep the state going the legislature had exhausted the rainy day fund and borrowed 1 billion beyond that the state malloy inherited was broke lamont conversely inherits a rainy day fund projected at 2 1 billion but while things are better malloy s success on fiscal and economic policy is checkered at best the connecticut business climate in terms of burdensome regulation the high cost of operation and a poor transportation infrastructure improved little during the malloy years his administration s drive to create jobs by providing government incentives be it through the first five plus program for corporations or small business express grants still left connecticut lagging behind neighboring states even with recent job growth connecticut has only recovered 91 3 percent of the jobs lost in the great recession according to comptroller kevin lembo malloy s call for a massive investment in transportation improvements went largely ignored by the legislature but in the closing days of his administration voters did approve a constitutional lockbox provision intended to assure money collected for transportation needs be it a gas tax or the implementation of tolls will be used for that purpose and while malloy unlike his predecessors insisted the legislature make the actuarially required payments to the pension system and refinanced pension debt to make it more manageable the problem of underfunded pension plans particularly for teachers persists malloy s administration negotiated concessions largely for newly hired workers that in the long term will vastly improve the state s ability to meet its pension obligations yet the burden of past lavish pensions will remain an anchor on state government for many years it is outside the areas of fiscal and economic policy where malloy s legacy of change is clearer but as noted at the start of this editorial also contentious criminal justice reforms were transformative and in our opinion largely on target malloy a former prosecutor took the position that our state was putting too many people in prison for nonviolent crimes not giving inmates the skills they needed to function once released from prison and failing to address the substance abuse issues at the core of much criminal conduct during his time in office possession of small amounts of marijuana was decriminalized more defendants were diverted to treatment programs eliminated were mandatory prison sentences for school zone drug possession violations which disproportionately affected those living in urban centers prisoners now earn reduced time for entering programs aimed at lowering recidivism these changes will have a profound legacy the prison population has dropped from 18 000 to 13 000 and the trend continues but though crime is at a 50 year low critics says malloy pushed too far and his policies are putting criminals on the streets who should be locked up to the detriment of public safety also controversial were the gun safety reforms passed after the dec 14 2012 mass shooting at sandy hook elementary school that took 26 lives including 20 children during malloy s tenure and at his urging the legislature voted to ban all military style assault weapons large capacity magazines and bump stocks individuals subject to restraining orders must now surrender their firearms background checks are more expansive applauded by our editorial board the laws placed connecticut as a leader in gun reform opponents however say they unfairly infringe on the second amendment rights of lawful gun owners no one can dismiss malloy as a caretaker governor he sought and achieved change whether they were good or bad changes individuals and history will judge the day editorial board meets with political business and community leaders to formulate editorial viewpoints it is composed of president and publisher timothy dwyer executive editor izaskun e larraneta owen poole copy editor and lisa mcginley retired deputy managing editor the board operates independently from the day newsroom

canadian pacific has hired a senior executive away from rival canadian national railway to be its second in command and a likely successor to ceo hunter harrison who came out of retirement last year to reform the underperforming cp canadian pacific has hired a senior executive away from rival canadian national railway to be its second in command and a likely successor to ceo hunter harrison who came out of retirement last year to reform the underperforming cp keith creel will become president and chief operating officer starting on tuesday he had been an executive vice president and the coo at montreal based canadian national since 2010 he was also previously at burlington northern sante fe another of north america s top tier railways harrison is widely credited with transforming canadian national into what has become regarded as the most efficient of north america s big six railways he was hired as cp s ceo last summer following a bruising proxy fight led by activist investor bill ackman s hedge fund pershing square capital management ackman had hand picked harrison as the right man to turn around canadian pacific which has lagged its peers harrison said the calgary based railway tsx cp will benefit from creel s strong leadership and operational expertise as it continues its transformational journey to becoming the best railroad in north america i have worked with many talented operating people in this industry over the last four decades and keith is by far one of the best young operating talents that i have ever seen harrison said in a statement creel 45 obtained a marketing undergraduate degree from jacksonville state university and has completed the advanced management program at harvard business school he served with the u s army in the persian gulf war stationed in saudi arabia harrison 68 has said he does not see his tenure lasting more than three or four years and that grooming a successor would be a priority on a conference call to discuss the company s fourth quarter results last week harrison signalled the coo announcement would be coming shortly canadian national tsx cnr acknowledged creel s departure in a separate announcement and said it has resolved a legal dispute that arose after harrison joined cp as part of the settlement cp has agreed not to hire certain cn employees until dec 31 2016 other terms of the deal are confidential cn spokesman mark hallman declined to say if the deal reinstates almost 40 million in future pension and other benefit payments to harrison that the railway cancelled last year as it accused him of breaking non compete and other agreements he signed when he retired in 2009 at the time cn said harrison s restricted stock units are calculated to be worth more than 17 8 million and the value of his pension is approximately 20 6 million ackman whose new york based fund bought a major stake in canadian pacific in 2011 to become its largest shareholder had said cp would cover the amount harrison loses in pension and benefits from cn cn said monday that it has a deep bench of executive talent and would announce creel s replacement shortly we wish keith success in his new role and are pleased to turn the page with respect to the matter of cp s hiring of cn s former ceo hunter harrison stated cn president and chief executive claude mongeau the settlement arrived at today will allow cn and cp to focus on their respective agendas and create value for their customers and shareholders creel s appointment did not come as a surprise to analysts walter spracklin of rbc capital markets said it s likely creel will be the next ceo since he s been named president and cp chief marketing officer jane o hagan will report to him spracklin said the legal settlement between the country s two large railways is good for both companies because it eliminates a distraction for harrison and reduced a further poaching risk for cn over the next while the announcement is a positive for cp in that it gives a very clear sense of longevity to the ceo role at cp and mr creel s strong qualifications and high calibre provides a further sense of comfort he added a negative would be the price cp paid to lure creel away from cn and any potential financial implication from the legal settlement desjardins securities analyst benoit poirier agreed that creel s appointment had been expected by the market nonetheless from a trading perspective we would still expect a slight positive reaction in the shares given we see the news as a potential indication of further significant changes to cp s senior management team he wrote harrison s and creel s departures could have a positive impact of around 25 million on cn s first quarter results mostly from a pension settlement poirier added neither analyst expects cn s operations to be harmed by creel s exit and both see the railway replacing creel quickly likely with mike cory senior vice president of the western region or jim vena head of the southern region we have met both executives in the past and both have solid experience in the operations role we would consider both to be very strong and capable candidates for the coo role at cn said spracklin on the toronto stock exchange cp s shares closed down 2 24 at 113 54 monday while cn s shares were off 55 cents at 95 15 note to readers this is a corrected story an earlier version said harrison is 67

download this article in pdf format as 2018 came to a close the economy in the united states continued to be strong the roller coaster stock market withstanding employment is officially high but many people are under employed and salaries and wages generally haven t risen with the cost of living the u s federal reserve kept the prime lending rate near zero for seven years to stimulate the economy with low cost lending only raising it in december 2015 through 2017 and 2018 the rate rose to 2 25 pushing residential mortgage rates to nearly 5 from a prior low of near 3 5 in china the economy has been strong and growing although it may be leveling off now for europe and much of the rest of the world some countries have good economies while others are struggling while the authors previous annual outlooks have noted politics click here and here in 2018 executive action and policy influences intensified with various forms of social responsibility also causing unforeseen disruption in the digital world a surge of nationalism has citizens and politicians wanting to topple the established world order part of the united kingdom decided it wanted to brexit the european union that doesn t sound very united but that may or may not take place smoothly separately the executive branch of the united states is deep sixing existing alliances and trade agreements putting up walls against neighboring countries and threatening stiff tariffs on certain goods from specific countries this is initiated by someone who fancies himself to be a master negotiator but may not have a good understanding of how normal business or washington is run other countries many with authoritarian heads of state are responding in kind at least japan very important in the electronics world seems to be staying low key one signal of the economy s strength is the stock market which in the u s has surged on the order of 30 over the last two years however volatility of the stock market has increased significantly with huge almost daily swings reflective of dramatic changes initiated in the political arena that greatly alter the business environment especially with trade wars between nations arising in a way not seen for decades with no resolution of these tensions in sight corporate leaders must craft their business strategies factoring in greater risk risk that s outside of their control technology will advance high tech continues to march forward dependably as it always has faster better cheaper higher integration today the advance of technology is one of the few things that can be counted on in a positive light the protection of intellectual property ip rights remains vital to the ongoing investment in research and development in high tech however ip abuse is contentious and an impediment to fair and open markets corporate consolidation is slowing a bit with a number of companies in the electronics industry having already merged some acquisitions have been blocked slowed or otherwise withdrawn the global nature of our industry can make government approval difficult alliances and partnerships between companies are vital with technology standards benefitting all who make use of them the reach of android has grown tremendously while some parts of the business have disaggregated many companies pursue further vertical integration with nearly all engaging more heavily in software be responsible it may seem far upstream from semiconductors and most electronic hardware but the proliferation of fake news hate speech directed at groups or beliefs and personal attacks shaming over social networks has revealed a new dark side of the wide open internet electronic social networks and the press media this has subjected many companies and their executives to a good grilling by lawmakers government bodies the wrath of the public the initiation of monitoring systems to detect and control nefarious activities and potential revenue downsides from users and advertisers on one hand some governments or corporations might want to restrict or capitalize on the content their citizens or users can access over its wires for good and for bad on another hand there s little agreement on who should say what qualifies as acceptable content since the internet is expected to be a real time network with content that can be anything from simple ascii text to encoded streaming high definition video computers running sophisticated algorithms are the only systems that could possibly monitor all of the traffic at speed artificial intelligence would have to be something more than a marketing term for such computers to stay ahead of the moment by moment trends let alone the social media bots that may flood the network the exploitation of consumers rights and privacy has been questioned as more and more data on these end users has been surreptitiously collected for vague purposes in may 2018 the european union s eu general data protection regulation gdpr became effective requiring more than a tacit your use of this site implies caution but an explicit agreement by the person on whom the data is collected the eu acted but few other countries have followed suit moreover corporations drag their feet embracing such policies because of the revenue and marketing value they can derive from the data consumers young enough to understand what the word means might just shrug meh a pound of flesh ultimately most of these new social imposed issues layering over the normal market driven supply and demand factors that impact the next few years outlook place new burdens on the companies providing the services sought by the user they consume additional resources software and computing power to mitigate this new noise and distraction the effort and cost add to the overhead of a business much like the need for a legal team building maintenance or an accounting department however it also joins issues like security that are likely to become ever more sophisticated as bad actors try to overcome the defenses that are erected it would be hard to say these issues make companies or society more productive although they will take more manpower peoplepower and computational bandwidth to detect and manage infractions perhaps these are opportunities for services offered by third parties to handle however like security it s just one more moving target that s difficult to assign an effectiveness or quality number to the defense mechanisms likely involve sophisticated algorithms for pattern matching and quirks of human behavior and therefore could increase demand for computing resources good for semis but this isn t likely to support a new fab and is far more nuisance than energizing memory losses an objective analysis of the dram and nand flash memory markets gives valuable insight to how the greater semiconductor market will fare in 2019 when revenues from these two technologies grow or collapse the rest of the semiconductor market reacts the same only more modestly without the extraordinary gyrations suffered by nand and dram because dram and nand flash are undifferentiated commodities systems can replace any provider s product with any other provider s product so buyers largely choose suppliers based on price in a commodity market an oversupply results in a price collapse and that s where the market was going late in 2018 the figure shows the lowest weekly dram and nand flash spot market prices for the past two years thus it s clear that nand flash prices red line right axis have already declined significantly and that dram prices black line left axis have just begun their downturn

the members page of the hollywood foreign press association website lists no members instead it contains a single paragraph which states what the organization is in general terms a group of international journalists based in southern california that attend countless movie and television screenings and put on the annual golden globe awards the membership page goes into zero detail about the makeup of the hollywood foreign press association like where the members are from or who they write for it doesn t even say the exact number of members the group has about 90 is as specific as it gets this is something that should be kept in mind when watching and discussing the golden globes this is not the work of a large group of movie industry professionals nor is it even a tight knit group of local critics whose membership is transparent and readily available the globes are the product of about 90 anonymous people whose whims and reasoning is completely unknown when they do something like name green book and bohemian rhapsody as the two best movies of the year and that is totally fine i mean i completely disagree with both of those choices and don t think they could have picked worse in either category given the nominees they had to choose from but it s their group they have the right to celebrate whatever movies they want from whatever filmmakers they want i just don t think the rest of us should really care about them or put a bit of stock into the results but people do for years the globes have been treated like the junior varsity oscars the all important preliminary step on the road to the academy awards and sure they re usually an entertaining couple of hours of television thanks to snarky hosts although this year s andy samberg and sandra oh were almost disturbingly nice a glitzy guest list and a heavy supply of alcohol to help lubricate the unpredictable wheels of live television i m all for it on those terms give me a good boozy hatewatch where celebrities miss their acceptance speeches because they were in the bathroom any day of the week the weird part is that the globes are beloved for all the slip ups and weirdness and also as this important prognosticator of the oscars even though the two shows have zero overlap in terms of voters and little overlap in terms of taste the globes are treated as this crucial bellwether despite numerous alleged stories of hfpa members being wined and dined by studios and then mysteriously inexplicably and totally unrelatedly giving those same studios movies tons of awards like the time producers of the musical burlesque flew golden globes judges to las vegas for an all expenses paid trip which included luxury hotel accommodation free meals and a private concert performed by the film s star cher burlesque wound up with 3 golden globe nominations including best picture and won the best original song prize the film s rotten tomatoes score 36 again this doesn t necessarily bother me what bothers me is that we know all this and still take the globes relatively seriously some oscar voters today are looking at the results and reconsidering their own attitudes towards green book and bohemian rhapsody and maybe towards other movies that didn t fare so well at this year s globes like a star is born it bums me out to think that deserving films might have their chances at oscars hurt because of this that doesn t seem right the globes are a hell of a party and a lousy awards show so why do we pretend it s not

in june 2005 i published a cover story in the atlantic how we would fight china i wrote that the american military contest with china will define the twenty first century and china will be a more formidable adversary than russia ever was i went on to explain that the wars of the future would be naval with all of their abstract battle systems even though dirty counterinsurgency fights were all the rage 14 years ago in june 2005 i published a cover story in the atlantic how we would fight china i wrote that the american military contest with china will define the twenty first century and china will be a more formidable adversary than russia ever was i went on to explain that the wars of the future would be naval with all of their abstract battle systems even though dirty counterinsurgency fights were all the rage 14 years ago that future has arrived and it is nothing less than a new cold war the constant interminable chinese computer hacks of american warships maintenance records pentagon personnel records and so forth constitute war by other means this situation will last decades and will only get worse whatever this or that trade deal is struck between smiling chinese and american presidents in a photo op that sends financial markets momentarily skyward the new cold war is permanent because of a host of factors that generals and strategists understand but that many especially those in the business and financial community who populate davos still prefer to deny and because the u s china relationship is the world s most crucial with many second and third order effects a cold war between the two is becoming the negative organizing principle of geopolitics that markets will just have to price in this is because the differences between the united states and china are stark and fundamental they can barely be managed by negotiations and can never really be assuaged the chinese are committed to pushing u s naval and air forces away from the western pacific the south and east china seas whereas the u s military is determined to stay put the chinese commitment makes perfect sense from their point of view they see the south china sea the way american strategists saw the caribbean in the 19th and early 20th centuries the principal blue water extension of their continental land mass control of which enables them to thrust their navy and maritime fleet out into the wider pacific and the indian ocean as well as soften up taiwan it is similar to the way dominance over the caribbean enabled the united states to strategically control the western hemisphere and thus affect the balance of forces in the eastern hemisphere in two world wars and a cold war for the united states world power all began with the caribbean and for china it all begins with the south china sea but the americans will not budge from the western pacific the u s defense establishment both uniformed and civilian considers the united states a pacific power for all time witness commodore matthew perry s opening of japan to trade in 1853 america s subjugation and occupation of the philippines starting in 1899 the bloody marine landings on a plethora of pacific islands in world war ii the defeat and rebuilding of japan following world war ii the korean and vietnam wars and most important washington s current treaty alliances stretching from japan south to australia this is an emotional as well as a historical commitment something i have personally experienced as an embed on u s military warships in the western pacific in fact the u s defense department is much more energized by the china threat than by the russia one it considers china with its nimble ability as a rising technological power unencumbered by america s own glacial bureaucratic oversight to catch up and perhaps surpass the united states in 5g networks and digital battle systems silicon valley is simply never going to cooperate with the pentagon nearly to the degree that china s burgeoning high tech sector cooperates with its government china is the pacing threat the u s military now measures itself against this american refusal to yield blue water territory to china is championed by liberal hawks who will likely staff any incoming democratic administration s asia portfolios to say nothing of the republicans both pro and anti president donald trump as for the so called restrainers and neo isolationists when you boil it right down they are really about getting american ground troops out of the middle east something that may actually strengthen the u s position against china and as for left wing democratic progressives when it comes to a hard line on trade talks with china they are not too far away from trump s own economic advisors remember that the democratic candidate hillary clinton was forced to publicly disown the trans pacific partnership free trade agreement because of pressure from her own party the fact is since president richard nixon went to china in 1972 u s policy toward the pacific has been notably consistent whatever party has held the white house and the turn against china has likewise been a bipartisan affair and thus unlikely to be dramatically affected by any impeachment or presidential election regarding the trade talks themselves what really riles both the trumpsters and the democrats moderates and progressives alike is the very way china does business stealing intellectual property acquiring sensitive technology through business buyouts fusing public and private sectors so that their companies have an unfair advantage at least by the mores of a global capitalistic trading system currency manipulation and so on trade talks however successful will never be able to change those fundamentals china can adjust its business model only at the margins and because economic tensions with china will never significantly lessen they will only inflame the military climate when a chinese vessel cut across the bow of an american destroyer or china denied entry of a u s amphibious assault ship to hong kong as happened last fall this cannot be separated from the atmosphere of charged rhetoric over trade with the waning of the liberal world order a more normal historical era of geopolitical rivalry has commenced and trade tensions are merely accompaniments to such rivalry in order to understand what is going on we have to stop artificially separating u s china trade tensions and u s china military tensions there is also the ideological aspect of this new cold war for several decades china s breakneck development was seen positively in the united states and the relatively enlightened authoritarianism of deng xiaoping and his successors was easily tolerated especially by the american business community but under xi jinping china has evolved from a soft to a hard authoritarianism rather than a collegial group of uncharismatic technocrats constrained by retirement rules there is now a president for life with a budding personality cult overseeing thought control by digital means including facial recognition and following the internet searches of its citizens it is becoming rather creepy and american leaders of both parties are increasingly repelled by it this is also a regime that in recent years has been imprisoning up to a million ethnic uighur muslims in hard labor camps the philosophical divide between the american and chinese systems is becoming as great as the gap between american democracy and soviet communism keep in mind that technology encourages this conflict rather than alleviates it because the united states and china now inhabit the same digital ecosystem wars of integration where the borders are not thousands of miles but one computer click away are possible for the first time in history china can intrude into u s business and military networks as the united states can intrude into theirs the great pacific ocean is no longer the barrier that it once was in a larger sense it has been the very success of decades of capitalist and pseudo capitalist economic development throughout the pacific that has generated the wealth required to engage in such a high end military cum cyber arms race truly the new age of warfare would be impossible without the economic prosperity that has preceded it the glass is half empty precisely because it is half full this is a theme of yale professor paul bracken s prescient 1999 book fire in the east the rise of asian military power and the second nuclear age the good news is that all this may not lead to a bloody war the bad news is that it well might i believe the chances of a violent exchange are still nowhere near the 50 percent baseline where warfare becomes probable rather than merely possible nevertheless the chances have increased significantly this has to do with more than merely the famous thucydidean paradigm of fear honor and interest it has to do with just how emotional the chinese can get over an issue like taiwan for example and how easy it is for air and naval incidents and accidents to spiral out of control the more the countries fight over trade and the closer chinese and american warships get to each other in the south china sea over time the less control the two sides will actually have over events as we all know many wars have begun even though neither side saw it in its interest to start one and a hot conflict in the south or east china sea will affect the world financial system much more than the collapse of iraq syria libya or yemen what kept the cold war from going hot was the fear of hydrogen bombs that applies much less to this new cold war the use of nuclear weapons and the era of testing them in the atmosphere keeps receding from memory making policymakers on both sides less terrified of such weapons than their predecessors were in the 1950s and 1960s especially since nuclear arsenals have become smaller in terms of both size and yield as well as increasingly tactical moreover in this new era of precision guided weaponry and potentially massive cyberattacks the scope of nonnuclear warfare has widened considerably great power war is now thinkable in a way that it wasn t during the first cold war what we really have to fear is not a rising china but a declining one a china whose economy is slowing on the heels of the creation of a sizable middle class with a whole new category of needs and demands is a china that may experience more social and political tensions in the following decade a theme of the late harvard political scientist samuel huntington s 1968 book political order in changing societies is that as states develop large middle classes the greater the possibility is for political unrest this will encourage china s leadership to stoke nationalism even further as a means of social cohesion while skeptics particularly in the world business community see the south and east china seas as constituting just a bunch of rocks jutting out into the water the chinese masses don t see it that way to them almost like taiwan the south china sea is sacred territory and the only fact that prevents china from becoming even more aggressive in the east china sea is the fear that japan could defeat it in an open conflict something that would so humiliate beijing s leadership that it could call into question the stability of the communist party itself so china will wait a number of years until it surpasses japan in naval and air power beijing s rulers know how closely their strategy dovetails with the feelings of the chinese masses indeed this new cold war is more susceptible to irrational passions fueled by economic disruptions than the old cold war in the second half of the 20th century the united states and the soviet union each had internal economies of scale however different from each other that were far better protected from the destabilizing forces of globalization than the american and chinese economies are now it is precisely the fusion of military trade economic and ideological tensions combined with the destabilization wrought by the digital age with its collapse of physical distance that has created an unvirtuous cycle for relations between the united states and china the geopolitical challenge of the first half of the 21st century is stark how to prevent the u s china cold war from going hot preventing a hot war means intensified diplomacy not only from the state department but also from the pentagon american generals talking and visiting with chinese generals in order to create a network of relationships that are the equivalent of the old cold war hotline this diplomacy must avoid the temptation of reducing the american chinese relationship to one contentious theme be it trade or the south china sea it can mean playing hard on trade but always keeping the public rhetoric cool and reasoned passion becomes the real enemy in this competition because in the megaphone world of global social media passion stirs the impulse to assert status which has often been a principal source of wars and it means most of all stealing a concept from the american diplomat george kennan s playbook on containment be vigilant but be always willing to compromise on individual issues and in crises wait them out because in a very different way than the old soviet system the chinese system the more authoritarian it gets is over time more prone to crack up than america s

a second amendment advocate fighting against a constitutionally questionable gun ban and certification ordinance in the city of boulder colorado says he and his daughter have been targeted and bullied as his case winds through the court system the city last may passed an ordinance requiring gun owners to certify their assault weapons or remove their firearms from city limits those who didn t could face fines jail and confiscation and destruction of their firearms the next day attorneys from the conservative mountain states legal foundation sued the city on behalf of jon caldara boulder resident and president of the independence institute the boulder rifle club inc a colorado nonprofit corporation a member of the university of colorado shooting team and others the foundation argues that the ordinance violates multiple provisions of the u s constitution and the state constitution and at least two state statutes the foundation asks two key legal questions regarding whether a municipality can undermine the exercise of fundamental and unalienable rights and ignore the u s constitution and controlling supreme court precedent additionally it questions if the city can legally ignore its state constitution and state law by infringing upon and criminalizing an individual s unalienable and natural right to self defense and the right to keep and bear arms city ordinance 8245 banned the sale and possession of guns in the city defined as assault weapons in addition to bump stock devices and large magazines and banned the sale and possession of weapons to anyone under age 21 gun owners of such magazines had until july 15 2018 to either sell or dispose of these items the ordinance includes a grandfather clause that permits owners of these firearms to keep them in their possession if they receive a certificate from the local sheriff s office proving their ownership and certifying their firearms the law also bans them from openly carrying their rifles and shotguns my hope is that we will see more bans at the state level and one day at the federal level so these weapons will no longer be available city councilman aaron brockett said after the ordinance passed but dudley brown executive director of rocky mountain gun owners told watchdog org the boulder gun control ordinance is yet another dive into fantasy by a city already deep into socialism two groups not a part of the lawsuit the colorado state shooting association and boulder based gunsport of colorado say the ordinance is invalid because it conflicts with state law police and city officials have said that there is little they can do to enforce the ordinance the boulder police department has issued 87 certificates since the ban passed in may plaintiff jon caldara does not have one i did not comply by my very core principles i cannot comply he told watchdog org caldara added that no city or law enforcement authorities have contacted him but his daughter has been bullied at her school because of his position this is a very divisive issue where people have very strong feelings city attorney tom carr told the daily camera the folks who oppose these kinds of bans some of them suggest they re not going to cooperate i can t predict what people are going to do but i respect the feelings in an op ed caldara wrote that was published in numerous colorado publications he argued that any other member of the public who is not a gun owner would never be subjected to such restrictions he said they would never be forced to self identify to government authorities to submit to inspection to be registered and made to pay fees to keep your core beliefs my strong belief in my second amendment rights is core to who i am because he owns a long gun with a pistol grip and a detachable magazine caldara said he was required to self identify to the police present himself for investigation and his gun for inspection and pay fees in order to receive a police issued certification or potentially go to jail pay a fine and have his firearms confiscated and destroyed but caldara has not been charged with committing a crime since he took his public stand against the city of boulder caldara says his daughter has been bullied at her school the one with posters celebrating tolerance and diversity all over the walls teachers have criticized his stand on the second amendment to entire classes and students ganged up on his daughter telling her that her father is a murderer in september the u s district court for the district of colorado deferred to the colorado court system to determine whether the city had the authority to enact the ordinance at all while we will always support the principle of federalism this decision forces the people of boulder to wait to vindicate their rights under the u s constitution cody j wisniewski the lead attorney on the case said we will not give up the fight to defend the constitutionally protected rights of the people of boulder originally published on watchdog org

updated at 6 29 p m et facing staggering liability costs for its potential culpability in a series of deadly wildfires the parent company of california s largest utility is exploring whether to sell off a major part of the company npr has learned internally pacific gas electric has dubbed this strategy project falcon under the plan the company would sell its natural gas division this spring after years of deadly errors and safety violations the utility giant is looking for ways to cover liability costs and avoid bankruptcy a senior company official and a former employee with knowledge of the plan tell npr all net proceeds from the sale of pg e s gas division would be used to set up a fund to pay billions of dollars in potential claims from wildfires the sources said they requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly the company also is exploring selling key real estate assets including its san francisco headquarters and moving its operations elsewhere in the bay area the sources say on friday the company announced it would be reviewing structural options to best position the company to meet customer and operational needs in addition pg e said it is searching for new directors for its board to augment its existing expertise in safety pg e declined to make any senior leaders available to comment on project falcon a written statement from spokesman andy castagnola said safety is and will continue to be our top priority as we work to determine the best path forward for all of our stakeholders pg e remains fully committed to helping our customers and the affected communities recover and rebuild and to doing everything we can to reduce the risk of future wildfires wildfire damages in june the state s fire agency cal fire determined that pg e power equipment was responsible for sparking at least a dozen major fires across northern california in 2017 and now regulators are investigating whether pg e equipment sparked november s camp fire the deadliest and most destructive in state history the company could end up having to pay billions from legal action stemming from the 2017 and 2018 wildfire seasons equity analysts project that pg e s damages from the wildfires could exceed pg e s market value and its insurance coverage one citigroup analyst estimates the company could be on the hook forup to 15 billion in damages insurance companies allstate state farm and usaahave filed lawsuits against pg e blaming the utility for the camp fire the gas sale strategy would have to be approved by the state regulatory agency the california public utilities commission which has already expressed deep concerns about pg e s shoddy safety record lack of transparency and past efforts to pass liability costs on to the state s ratepayers so far state regulators and lawmakers have been kept out of pg e s planning loop for project falcon named for a group of peregrine falcons nesting on the roof of the company s headquarters the current and former pg e officials say they re speaking with npr out of concern that senior management is not acting in the best interests of ratepayers safety and the state there s a public trust element in being a utility monopoly said the senior company official bailout pg e is under no legal obligation to disclose its internal discussions about ways to stave off bankruptcy but given the potential impact on ratepayers and taxpayers if the utility eventually needs a bailout michael wara a lawyer and research scholar at stanford university calls the lack of transparency extremely disappointing they need to be thinking very hard about how to create safety for californians rather than how to make money for shareholders when they re not being totally transparent especially in the current context where there s a lack of trust and so many people that have been harmed by pg e s infrastructure wara said what california urgently needs and wants from its utilities right now is hard thinking about how to better protect communities from fire and it s hard to see that going on wara added what california urgently needs and wants from its utilities right now is hard thinking about how to better protect communities from fire and it s hard to see that going on wall street wants to see hard thinking too steve fleishman senior utilities analyst and a managing director at wolfe research said pg e s plan for dealing with fires in the future is unclear they clearly seem to be more at risk for that fleishman said this kind of risk profile is not sustainable pg e s stock is down about 50 percent since the camp fire broke out on nov 8 consumer watchdog groups want any big move done with transparency anything pg e wants to propose should be done in an open public manner and include a comprehensive coherent wildfire mitigation strategy says mark toney the executive director of the utility reform network there is widespread anger in the state over pg e s shoddy safety record protests broke out at recent public oversight meetings and at the company s san francisco headquarters where environmentalists and activists read the names of the more than 100 people combined who died in the camp fire and 2017 s wildfires in napa and sonoma counties at one customer service center the company has installed bulletproof glass serious safety problems in late december state regulators said they were considering several proposals in response to ongoing concerns about the utility s role in a deadly gas explosion in 2010 and in the more recent wildfires pg e has had serious safety problems with both its gas and electric operations for many years the california public utilities commission said in a statement possible changes put forth by the commission include splitting up the gas and electric divisions and either making the company a public utility or making the company s return on equity contingent on safety performance we must be careful and practical the commission s president michael picker said in a statement last month this process will be like repairing a jetliner while it s in flight crashing a plane to make it safer isn t good for the passengers the commission declined further comment for this story a spokesman said only that state regulators are looking at a range of options for the utility we must be careful and practical this process will be like repairing a jetliner while it s in flight crashing a plane to make it safer isn t good for the passengers in a separate development the state s top law enforcement official attorney general xavier becerra said in a court filingin late december that pg e could face criminal charges up to murder if it s found liable in any of the recent deadly california wildfires pg e was convicted of felony safety violations in a gas line explosion in 2010 in a san francisco suburb that killed eight people and destroyed a neighborhood the federal judge overseeing the utility s five year criminal probation in that case had asked becerra s opinion on whether pg e s possible role in the recent wildfires constitutes a probation violation the stakes a sale would have big implications for the company which supplies electricity and gas to more than 5 million california households and has more than 20 000 employees pg e s natural gas assets account for between 20 percent to 30 percent of the company the company sources who spoke to npr and provided supporting documents say the planning for project falcon began shortly after the 2017 wine country fires and picked up again in earnest this past june when cal fire determined that pg e was responsible for at least a dozen northern california fires the planning the sources say has accelerated since the camp fire the sources also said the company would like to present its own plan before one is imposed by regulators california applies inverse condemnation to utilities meaning they can be held liable for damage even if they are not found negligent structuring the deal pg e shareholders and institutional investors may welcome a gas sale as a way to cover at least in part wildfire liabilities as part of the gas sale plan all gross proceeds from the sale would go into the wildfire fund with no direct shareholder benefit from cash according to the pg e source but shareholders could get new shares in the company that purchases the gas arm regulators and lawmakers may argue that a deal should be structured to solely benefit wildfire victims and that any deal should come with protections for ratepayers we need to be asking ourselves hard questions as a state as to whether a settlement in bankruptcy might be better than something we get through this gas sale warns wara the stanford researcher the inside sources say the company is hoping to get between 10 7 billion and 15 5 billion for its gas assets given the company s safety liability and political challenges including new allegations last month that the company violated safety regulations analysts say it s not at all clear they would get that on the open market in mid december state regulators found that pg e had systematically falsified safety documents and broke safety rules related to its natural gas operations over a five year period at the time pg e spokesman matt nauman said in an emailed statement to npr that the company is committed to accurate and thorough reporting and record keeping and we didn t live up to that commitment in this case this comes on the heels of a 1 6 billion finefrom regulators the largest in state history and six felonyconvictions related to 2010 san bruno explosion travis miller senior utilities equity strategist at morningstar is skeptical that a potential gas sell off would fly with regulators or wall street he said he doesn t think another utility would step forward to buy the gas assets you may get a good price but it also carries with it a lot of regulatory and political risk miller says there s no good outcome for ratepayers under any scenario and not an ideal outcome for shareholders either project falcon and the camp fire the company s fiscal woes deepened in the wake of november s camp fire in butte county calif which killed at least 85 people and displaced tens of thousands who continue to face a desperate housing crisis paradise and neighboring towns were all but wiped out the cause of the fire is still under investigation by the state s fire agency cal fire pg e has told state regulators that it experienced problems on two sections of its electric system near where the camp fire erupted the company faces nearly two dozen lawsuits from fire victims over its possible culpability for the camp fire including allegations of possible equipment failures and poor maintenance in one lawsuit residents accuse the company of prioritizing advertising spending over fire and public safety now it s clear there are problems on both sides of the business says steve fleishman an analyst with wolfe research referring to the gas and electric divisions fleishman says a gas sale and new management on the electric side might allow pg e leaders to focus solely on improving safety i think the company is willing do anything structurally if they think it can help with safety fleishman says analysts warn that the company risks running out of access to capital not just because of present liability but also because of the risk of future catastrophic fires a specter sharpened by climate change and a century of fire suppression policy in the nation s forests the company in november said it had exhausted its revolving credit lines and the ratings agencies moody s investor service and s p have downgraded the company s credit rating to near junk status approval process will be complicated internal pg e planning documents on the potential sale labeled privileged and confidential show that company officials are concerned about regulatory approval the cpuc approval process will be complicated and lengthy so phasing the proceeding to obtain early decisions on matters that are crucial to the viability of the transaction is desirable one document reads while the gas sale would cover some liabilities the legislature also may be asked to step in state lawmakers partially shielded the company for liability claims in 2017 with a bill that critics called a bailout analysts and consumer advocates worry that lawmakers may expand that protection for this year and beyond putting taxpayers and ratepayers on the hook ultimately we re going to be left holding the bag says michael wara of stanford university if pg e can t pay all of these costs then it s the california taxpayer that ultimately will but some lawmakers are already balking state sen bill dodd who originally supported shielding pg e from liability costs related to fires in 2017 has lost patience with the company pg e has demonstrated a pattern of poor management and illegal conduct that has shattered lives across california dodd said in an emailed statement he called for systemic change which must include change on the board of directors and in the executive suite

morgan stanley and stifel s price targets for asset light brokerages c h robinson and echo global logistics are at odds over whether chrw and echo are stocks worth buying we ve reported previously on investment banks divergent views of the transportation sector but this morning two new releases from stifel financial corporation sf and morgan stanley ms clarified exactly how the analysts differ in brief morgan stanley likes asset based carriers while stifel prefers asset light 3pls the spreads between the banks price targets for the shares of publicly traded companies tell us how far apart the banks are one of the largest price target disagreements between morgan stanley and stifel is c h robinson chrw north america s largest 3pl morgan stanley s 12 month price target is 67 while stifel s is 104 as we write chrw is trading at 82 90 that means that morgan stanley calls for a 19 percent downside and stifel projects a 25 percent upside for the stock the wide spread between chrw target prices may be due to a deeper disagreement about risk factors to the core north american surface transportation business specifically c h robinson s exposure to spot market volatility morgan stanley s ravi shanker said that decelerating spot rates would hurt chrw stifel s bruce chan had a more sanguine view we are slightly below cons for chrw in 4q18 shanker wrote dat dry van spot rates ex have decelerated from 3q s 16 y y to 2 y y in 4q contract rates decelerated from 19 to 11 y y assuming chrw s spot exposure remains consistent from 3q 40 nast revenue growth should decelerate sequentially meanwhile stifel s bruce chan was more optimistic in a note on chrw from november c h robinson s core north american surface transportation nast division continues to drive not just growth but increasingly profitable growth via incrementally better technology and process improvements chan wrote meanwhile moderating capacity costs are helping gross margins learn more today anecdotally competing brokerages have told freightwaves that c h robinson started off bid season by coming in with aggressively low rates in a play for volume to us it sounds like analysts can t decide whether a softening spot market helps or hurts c h robinson and therefore there s a wild swing in the 12 month target prices there s a similar confusion about chicago based brokerage echo global logistics inc echo morgan stanley s price target is 22 5 percent upside while stifel has echo at 34 63 percent upside the stock is currently trading at 20 84 we are below cons for echo in 4q18 shanker wrote spot rates decelerated significantly from 3q echo s revenues were 8 in october vs 27 y y in 3q and while contract margins will benefit from low spot rates the benefit could be mostly offset due to less high margin spot volumes we expect gross margin to be flat sequentially in 4q consistent with seasonality it should be pointed out that stifel has been lowering its price target for echo from 40 to 38 to 34 but analyst bruce chan thinks that even a cooling freight market with flat gross revenues could help echo expand its margins but in our view difficult y y comps have been a known quantity chan wrote in an october 25 note on echo and on an absolute basis spot rates remain healthy due to structural supply tightness which we believe continues to drive demand for echo s service offering moreover easing rates are typically beneficial for gross margins and the company continues to pull the technology and efficiency levers on other expense line items a systematic comparison of price targets for asset based truckload and less than truckload carriers also reveals philosophical differences between morgan stanley and stifel aside from a few carriers like heartland express inc htld and saia inc saia morgan stanley has higher price targets than stifel nearly across the board there are particularly wide spreads on u s xpress usx which is trading at 5 84 today morgan stanley has usx at 22 while stifel set the target at 15 while usx is the extreme case both banks agree that most trucking stocks are underpriced to some extent the question is just how much knight swift knx for instance which is trading at 27 36 could go to either 43 or 51 depending on whether you listen to morgan stanley or stifel respectively the difference comes out to a 57 percent upside versus an 86 percent upside want more content like this click here to subscribe permalink

gone through uncorrelated periods beginning in january 2010 when td ameritrade started tracking the imx the index rose with equity markets until april 2010 when it peaked at 5 40 in may 2010 investors experienced the flash crash and the imx began a sharp downward trend the imx didn t reach 5 00 again until the s p 500 was well above april 2010 levels the index eventually peaked at 5 56 in june 2011 this peak was immediately followed by a plunge in equity markets and in the imx as the media was dominated by the u s debt ceiling debate s p downgrade of u s debt and european debt concerns the s p 500 began to recover in the fall of 2011 but the imx continued to decline until it reached a new low at the time in january 2012 as the s p 500 began to sustain an upward trend in early 2012 the imx started to rise in 2013 as economic conditions improved and the s p 500 climbed to record levels the imx rose to the high end of its historical range finishing 2013 at 5 62 and continued to rise in 2014 amid geopolitical tensions related to ukraine and the middle east until seeing slight declines in october and november by the middle of 2015 the imx had seen increases as equity market volatility had reduced to near historical levels while the market continued its upward trend as 2015 ended its third quarter volatility had returned to markets as global economic concerns and speculation around the timing and trajectory of federal reserve rate increases seemed to rattle overall equity markets this uncertainty continued to play a role in the equity markets through the fourth quarter of 2015 and into early 2016 the volatility accompanying this uncertainty abated in the second quarter of 2016 and remained low until late in the third quarter just as it had in 2015 the imx saw increases mid year during the period of lower volatility the imx continued to climb into the fourth quarter reaching 5 83 in october 2016 its highest point in two years a brief spike in volatility during november timed around the u s presidential election coincided with a slight pull back in the imx which then ended 2016 at the high end of its historical range the imx started 2017 with an upward trend and reaching an all time high in march before pausing in april as lower volatility lead to a decrease in the imx the momentum resumed in may with the imx breaching 7 0 for the first time ever in july of 2017 the imx took another brief pause in september before following markets higher and breaching 8 0 for the first time ever in november and ending 2017 at an all time high volatility returned to the

washington the partial government shutdown is spotlighting the limitations of president donald trump s erratic negotiating style with the impasse over trump s demand for border wall funding dragging into a third week the president s zigzag tactics and messaging have angered democrats and frustrated even some republicans struggling to help find him an off ramp and while trump s blend of bluster and bullying is hardly new and at times can produce results his self professed dealmaking skills are now facing a bigger test against newly empowered democrats so far trump is standing firmly with the loyal supporters who want him to fight for his promised wall along the u s mexico border but that stance carries considerable risk the midterm elections revealed a deeply divided republican party and saw major democratic gains in states that trump will need to win re election in 2020 always his own biggest booster trump declared himself very proud of what i m doing after a meeting with congressional leaders on friday that produced no breakthrough trump s allies say he is simply keeping a longstanding campaign promise and they frame his focus on his base as a smart strategy since he will need to energize those supporters for his re election campaign some suggested that trump s true believers aren t even interested in a negotiated compromise i guarantee polling wise with his base he is right in the sweet spot said former campaign aide barry bennett if he cut a deal now it would hurt him but trump will need a broader swath of support than those base voters to prevail in 2020 getting dollars for a border wall was always going to be an uphill task for trump but after democrats took control of the house in the midterm elections the president s leverage ebbed and his unreliable maneuvers have only aggravated the situation in recent weeks trump declared he would own the shutdown then instead blamed democrats his border demands have gone back and forth between a concrete wall to steel slats he s insulted democrats confused republicans and offered little empathy for the hundreds of thousands of federal workers without paychecks and his twitter feed and public pronouncements have produced a steady stream of inaccuracies about what he refers to as the crisis on the border trump s fitful style is hardly a surprise in a previous budget showdown senate democratic leader chuck schumer likened bargaining with trump to negotiating with jell o back in march trump threw lawmakers into a panic when he threatened an 11th hour veto of an agreed upon spending bill only to be talked out of it by advisers just a few weeks ago lawmakers thought they had a solution to the standoff with a short term agreement to keep government open the white house had signaled it would consider the plan but then trump changed course after coming under intense pressure from conservative allies since then he has repeatedly said he won t sign a spending deal that lacks money for the wall though he s signaled some flexibility on just what constitutes a wall a further complication trump s long practice of contradicting his aides makes it difficult for anyone else to negotiate on his behalf in recent days trump has rejected his own administration s previous offer to accept 2 5 billion for the wall after a round of staff level talks saturday vice president mike pence tweeted that the session had been productive only to have trump later tweet not much headway made today on sunday trump said that he was not expecting much to come from further talks held by pence undercutting him before the session even began if there has been a constant in fact it is the mixed messaging in a rambling rose garden appearance on friday trump described his meeting with congressional leaders as productive after democrats claimed otherwise he said much of the wall had been built though it hasn t he said mexico would pay for the wall through a new trade deal though there are no such terms in the still unratified deal he wrongly claimed that he d never called for the wall to be concrete and he claimed without evidence that some ex presidents had told him to push for the wall trump the author of the art of the deal promised during his campaign that he could bring unmatched dealmaking skills to the white house but navigating complex legislation trade issues and foreign policy matters is vastly different from executing real estate transactions so far trump s presidential dealmaking has had mixed results a massive tax cut muscled through in his first year was a major legislative win though it was done with just republican support a meeting with north korea s kim jong un yielded only a vaguely worded commitment on denuclearization and a trade clash with china that has rattled world markets has yet to be resolved republican consultant alex conant said that in trump s dealings so far he hasn t drawn many concessions from his adversaries nor has he

this article will examine a popular topic for many investors the cheapest blue chip stocks blue chips stocks are often considered core holdings in long term diversified portfolios the general idea is that these are legacy companies that are quality investments leaders in their field and have massive market capitalizations most blue chip stocks pay a dividend and probably raise that dividend frequently while also returning capital to shareholders by repurchasing oodles of stock you ll find blue chip stocks in most every large cap mutual fund or etf and almost all of them will have names you recognize blue chip stocks are often major components in the major indices like the s p 500 or nasdaq composite and are often synonymous with the term safe investment what s the cheapest blue chip stocks for 2019 if you re in a hurry below are our picks for the lowest priced blue chips stocks as of this writing apple despite its market cap it remains cheap on a valuation basis alphabet the high flying search engine company has sold off enough to make it a bargain visa part of an oligopoly that has gigantic market share keep reading and you ll find out more about these inexpensive blue chip stocks and my thoughts on each what are blue chip stocks the idea of blue chip stock has not changed over the years but i would argue that the name should be changed generally blue chip stocks are considered to be large stable and financially solid famous companies that are household names and probably are leaders in their sectors they have many years of growing and reliable earnings have huge market and are often considered core portfolio holdings they also tend to have higher profit margins than competitors because of their history and market share and often carry more cash than debt they also usually pay a dividend for all those reasons they are considered safe i disagree about this term safe though many blue chip stocks have been soaring as investors piled into them from bonds seeking to replace the yields that bonds no longer offered as a result many blue chips stocks aren t safe because they are expensive fortunately many aren t and i have some choices in this article that i believe are the cheapest blue chip stocks how do you determine what qualifies as the cheapest blue chip stocks the cheapest blue chip stocks have at least two of these three characteristics a very high cash position an adjusted peg ratio of 1 5 or less strong growth with limited competition high cash position having a lot of cash in the bank is not always a good thing for a company shareholders want to see cash put to use however the truth is that having a strong cash position gives a company flexibility if it blew all its cash it wouldn t have it if the economy suddenly turned bad it also wants cash if there s a strategic purchase it can make it also allows investors to back out that net cash position in a valuation calculation so investors can see what the business itself is truly worth adjusted peg ratio of 1 5 or less the peg ratio is the p e ratio of a stock divided by its earnings growth for me a peg ratio of 1 0 or less means the stock is a bargain however i make up to four adjustments i permit a 10 premium for companies with a strong cash position another 10 for companies with world class brand names and 10 for companies with very strong cash flow if a company is growing earnings at 15 or more i permit a peg ratioof up to 1 5 that s because the company is considered a growth stock and growth stocks are generally not going to be considered value plays as well strong growth with limited competition sometimes stocks even blue chips can be cheap for a reason perhaps business is terrible maybe the company is losing its competitive edge maybe execution isn t as good as it used to be that s why the company needs to have strong relative growth so that those elements don t come into play i also want to see a business that is such a leader that it crushes its competition here s a video that provides some additional information on investing in blue chip stocks apple what is it apple is of course known for its computers and iphones as well as its ipad icloud services apple pay itunes and numerous other computer centric products what makes it a cheap stock apple is one of strangest stocks i ve ever invested in it has performed incredibly well over the past twenty years and at one point has a market capitalization of over a trillion dollars yet almost every time i run a valuation check on it apple stock always seems to be cheap its growth in earnings has been so phenomenal its cash flow so tremendous and its balance sheet so perfect that the stock never really gets too far ahead of itself apple s cash position is insane it has 143 billion in net cash after backing out long term debt its market cap net of that cash position is 660 billion with 59 5 billion in net income in the last twelve months it thus trades at a p e ratio of 11 yet analysts project 13 annualized earnings growth over the next five years giving it a peg ratio of just about 0 8 and that s before giving it the 30 premium for having all the elements listed above that s not only a cheap stock it s one of the cheapest blue chip stocks in the entire market read also our apple stock price prediction alphabet what is it alphabet is primarily known for and driven by online search engine advertising it is essentially a digital billboard while it does have other divisions advertising is really its bread and butter what makes it a cheap stock alphabet stock is very similar to apple in that it frequently remains an undervalued stock despite its meteoric rise let s point out that the google search engine has effectively wiped out any competition it has maintained about 90 market share for years with bing only at 4 with that kind of monster market share it can charge advertisers extraordinary rates nobody can compete with google search traffic alphabet has 113 billion in net cash after backing out debt that s incredible when we subtract that from the market cap we find alphabet s business is worth 630 billion just a bit less than apple alphabet made about 29 billion in net income over the past year after adjusting for the additional taxes that resulted from the trump tax legislation that means alphabet s business trades at 21x earnings analysts project a 5 year annualized growth rate of 15 2 however alphabet gets a 30 premium for its great cash position world class brand name and great cash flow about 23 billion last year thus the adjusted growth rate is 19 7 alphabet comes in with a adjusted peg ratio of 1 07 that also makes it one of the least expensive blue chip stocks visa what is it most people think of visa as a credit card processor which it is however these days it is better to think of it as a transferor of value and information between merchants consumers businesses and governments what makes it a cheap stock visa is part of an oligopoly a small number of companies that control an entire market there are very few payment processors out there and visa is killing it with 52 7 market share next in line is mastercard with 21 9 then american express with 21 8 and finally discover with a mere 3 8 visa has very little competition and dominates the market visa also has a massive cash position of 15 7 billion that s because visa s business is not at all capital intensive it is essentially a cash generation machine and you can see that in its cash flow statement it s astonishing to see that visa generated about 6 47 billion in free cash flow in 2015 and ran it up to 12 billion this year visa generated net income of 10 3 billion in the past year it trades at 30x last year s earnings and 25x next year s earnings analysts project a five year annualized earnings growth rate of 18 visa gets the 30 premium mentioned above which means a reasonable growth rate would be 23 4 as a growth stock i permit a peg ratio of up to 1 5 and it s peg ratio is only 1 1 making it one of the cheapest blue chip stocks

pharmaceutical stocks are both growth and income plays so today i ll look for the cheapest pharmaceutical stocks in the stock market by cheapest i want stocks that sell at a discount to intrinsic value that can be challenging in this market because many pharmaceutical stocks pay dividends and investors have been chasing dividend stocks since the fed cut interest rates so drastically the other pitfall of pharmaceutical stocks right now is that they are perceived as safe blue chip stocks as a result they get bid up higher than their intrinsic value but carry additional risk for being overpriced simply because of their perception of safety so we need to be circumspect in our choices and find those pharmaceutical stocks that are in solid financial shape have good cash flow to pay dividends but which are not overpriced so we must be vigilant and remind ourselves that we are looking for both the cheapest pharmaceutical stocks and ones that are not subject to the above pitfalls what s in this guide the cheapest pharmaceutical stocks for 2019 if you re in a hurry below are our picks for the most lowest priced pharmaceutical stocks as of this writing pfizer a legacy player in the midst of a second wind teva pharmaceutical a beaten down player with big turnaround potential novartis a leader in biosimilars the next big thing in drug making keep reading to learn more about these inexpensive pharmaceutical stocks and my thoughts on them what are pharmaceutical stocks pharmaceutical stocks are companies that can do any or all of the following research new drugs develop new drugs and manufacture market and distribute drugs pharmaceutical products can take up to ten years or more to develop and put to market that s because it takes enormous scientific and capital resources to understand why a disease afflicts humans target the bodily mechanisms that cause it and then figure out how to manipulate those mechanisms with different therapies then they have to be tested endlessly for both safety and effectiveness then they have be run through an entire marketing analysis about 90 of drugs fail because the food and drug administration has a high barrier to hurdle to prove that drugs work and are safe there s also the issue of determining which diseases to put money into to find a cure not all diseases have a big base of consumers not only that the ones that do are subject to competition from other pharma companies the cheapest pharmaceutical stocks will be that way because they are growing at a solid rate and investors haven t quite bid them up high enough read also what re the cheapest dividend stocks how do you determine what qualifies as the cheapest pharmaceutical stocks the cheapest pharmaceutical stock shave these three characteristics trading at a peg ratio of 1 5 or less long history of strong cash flow substantial new product pipeline peg ratio of 1 5 or less if you are going to invest in the cheapest pharmaceutical stocks then those stocks must sell at a price to earnings ratio that is no more than 50 higher than their long term projected earnings growth rate that s because stock prices follow earnings and if the price is too far ahead of earnings then the stock is overvalued in most cases i consider cheap stocks to be those with a peg ratio of 1 0 or under however because few pharma stocks actually trade at that low a peg ratio because they tend to be growth companies that permit higher multiples so i permit these stocks to at a premium with a peg ratio i take the company s total cash position subtract long term debt and then subtract that net from the company s total market cap i also permit a 10 premium for companies with a substantial cash position 10 for world class brand names and 10 for companies with long term and robust free cash flow long history of strong cash flow cash flow isn t a direct component of an earnings valuation calculation however it is a requirement for overall company health and a general indication about overall value there are ratios that measure stock price to free cash flow while what is considered cheap can vary with this metric the more cash flow a company has the smaller that ratio is and smaller is better new product pipeline diversification is king in just about every business all pharmaceutical companies not only need several drugs in the market but also several in development thanks to the high failure rate a pipeline provides both future cash flow and future earnings if a pipeline is weak then the company could face earnings and cash flow shortfalls in a very competitive market this is a version of portfolio theory and is critical in providing flexibility as far as a company s overall long term strategy here s a video that helps you with investing in pharmaceutical stocks that are heading for fda consideration pfizer what is it pfizer is a pharma company with two major divisions innovative health and essential health the former focuses on the development and sale of medicines and vaccines as well as consumer healthcare products in many therapeutic areas the latter offers products that have lost patent protection which includes branded generic products generic sterile injectable products and anti infection drugs pfizer has several blockbuster drugs to its credit including prevnar lipitor lyrica celebrex viagra and enbrel what makes it a cheap stock pfizer had been struggling for a number of years as drugs went off patent and its pipeline was weak it also made a bad move in purchasing wyeth which burdened the company with tons of debt but pfizer has bounced back partially because it was supported during the bad times by guess what strong free cash flow pfizer has pegged a lot of success in its essential health segment through the development of biosimilars generic drugs have provided life changing pharmaceuticals to americans for years at a discount of as much as 90 off the brand name price and created a multi billion dollar generics industry generic drugs are effectively identical to their branded counterparts and created through specific chemical processes resulting in a fixed molecular structure thenew creation called biosimilars are essentially the generic version of biologics to date more and more are coming to market making life saving cancer and autoimmune biologics available at discounts according to ims health u s biologics spending hit 92 billion in 2013 the rand corporation collated estimates suggesting that consumers would spend as much as 40 less on biosimilars over time putting as much as 44 billion back into citizen s pockets there s more than just affordability at stake aside from making these drugs more affordable biosimliars represent a desperately new source of revenue for biotech and pharmaceutical companieslike pfizer pfizer trades at a peg ratio of 1 4 factoring in 10 premiums for meeting all the criteria mentioned earlier its free cash flow is simply fantastic and has been for decades routinely generating between 13 billion and 16 billion annually read also what re the best income stocks teva pharmaceutical what is it teva in an israel based company that is the worldwide leader in generic drug manufacturing marketing and distribution it also creates some original drugs its flagship drug is copaxone which treats multiple sclerosis it also created austedo for symptoms associated with huntington disease it has several products for the respiratory market including proair qvar cinqair and aerivio it also has several products in the oncology market what makes it a cheap stock teva has subsidiaries all over the globe however it has had some struggles forty states and several generic drug companies are suing teva for alleged price fixing copaxone is now off patent the ceo had to vacate his position in 2017 because the doj was looking into alleged bribery claims teva also made a very poor acquisition in actavis which loaded more than 20 billion of debt onto the company lost in all of this is that teva is a cash generating profitable business and the biggest generics manufacturer in the world all of this bad news will eventually go away and none of it has to do with the business itself except digesting the actavis deal free cash flow has always been robust with more than 4 billion generated every year although that is down to 2 6 billion this past year i was said to see it suspend its dividend but it will return at some point and the cash is useful for the business right now more importantly it continues to have operating profits and it is trading at a price not seen since 2002 i consider teva to be at the top of the list of cheapest pharmaceutical stocks novartis what is it novartis probably has the most diverse lineup of therapies of these three stocks they work in pharmaceuticals biosimilars and biotech they hit all the big disease arenas immunology dermatology oncology neuroscience respiratory cardiovascular the list is endless what makes it a cheap stock novartis is the classic pharmaceutical stock that is running at full speed it has boatloads of drugs both in the market and in its pipeline is fully diversified both in terms of product and geography and it makes enormous profits novartis has generated over 52 billion in net income since the start of 2014 that s incredible along with that free cash flow remains consistent coming in between 2 2 billion and 3 6 billion each year the great strides novartis is making is what qualifies it as one of the cheapest pharmaceutical stocks
today i ll look at the cheapest bank stocks in the market cheapest has a different meaning in the world of bank stocks we normally measure the value of stocks based on earnings and growth rates that s somewhat true of bank stocks but we look at several different metrics unique to banks as well that s because bank earnings fluctuate a lot from quarter to quarter and year to year so much depends on how consumers are using money and credit and how the banks other divisions perform bank stocks were destroyed in the mortgage crisis thanks to so many of them having toxic loans on their books almost all of them are well beyond that phase now and back on track bank stocks offer modest growth and modest income via dividend payments they tend to have lower volatility the cheapest bank stocks can be found across many different subdivisions from large multinational corporations to local savings and loans even better the banking sector is in a bear market creating lots of opportunity what s in this guide the cheapest bank stocks if you re in a hurry below are our picks for the most lowest priced bank stocks as of this writing bank of america likely has the most long term upside j p morgan chase a diversified player with excellent growth synchrony financial a solid and profitable lender with a strong book keep reading to learn more about these inexpensive bank stocks and my thoughts on them what are bank stocks we all know what banks are and right now banks are not in favor in the stock market bank stocks represent companies that provide a large variety of financial services we tend to think of banks mostly as places to store our money and where to get large loans but with the advancement of technology banks now offer a huge range of other services that meet the needs of millions of americans in ways they didn t use to this includes things like cash management investment banking advisory services wealth management capital raising risk management brokerages research security fiduciary duties trustee services insurance asset management treasury services liquidity solutions payment processing and so much more how do you determine what qualifies as the cheapest bank stocks the cheapest bank stocks have two of these three characteristics solid net interest income growth competitive ev to revenue ratio diversification solid net interest income growth if a bank is really a solid bank it will not only charge interest on its loans but competitive interest rates that result in growth over time we want a bank to make more and more performing loans so it generates more and more interest income on those loans notice that i say performing loans net interest income will grow if the loans a bank writes perform nii may grow very quickly at a fast rate if a lot of bad loans are written they ll perform for a little while and earn more interest but then principal will be lost upon default competitive ev to revenue ratio i don t really like to use p e ratio for bank stocks because net income fluctuates a great deal with bank stocks growth is also difficult to peg on an ongoing basis so this ratio is a bit more apples to apples the cheapest bank stocks have a low ratio ev is short for enterprise value and it is calculated by taking market capitalization preferred shares minority interest debt total cash diversification diversification is essential in banking today while some banks are experts in lending and have built fantastic businesses on writing solid performing loans with few defaults a bank s best chances of success are to diversify into all those different services i mentioned above that way if the economy is such that loans dry up the bank isn t entirely dependent on that revenue source if people suddenly move away from wealth management as happened with wells fargo it has many other sources to generate revenue here s a video with warren buffett who talks about several sectors including banking bank of america what is it bank of america is a 4500 branch name brand bank all across america that has the diversification i mentioned the bank serves consumers businesses institutional investors and governments all over the world through four divisions and this will give you an idea of the level of diversification i look for the consumer banking segment offers your traditional checking and savings accounts cds and iras investment accounts credit and debit cards mortgages home equity loans and all kind of personal loans the gwim division handles investment banking brokerage wealth management and trust services the global banking division offers commercial loans leases credit lines trade finance asset based lending foreign exchange debt and equity underwriting and merger services the global markets segment offers market making financing securities clearing settlement and custody services and mortgage products what makes it a cheap stock bank of america is finally firing on all cylinders after a tough recovery period it s been routinely generating well over 6 billion in quarterly net income on revenue increases of around 4 let s remember this was one of the worst players in the toxic mortgage world and had to write off tens of billions of dollars this is quite the comeback net interest income a metric we focus on has been growing between 4 and 5 and also enjoying about a 3 increase in non interest income loans deposits and assets are the source for growing income so we want to see these growing and they have been at an average run rate of about 5 3 and 15 respectively i also mentioned that loans need to be performing and they are we find this number listed as charge offs and that number has been stable with very little fluctuation over the past year averaging about 900 million per quarter bac stock is also in good shape because as interest rates rise it makes more money on its loans finally bac enjoys a competitive ev to revenue ratio of 2 31 wells fargo which i consider to be in a lot of trouble is at 2 7 all these factors make bank of america one of the cheapest bank stocks read also what re the best dividend stocks j p morgan chase what is it j p morgan is very similar to bank of america but it has a longer history of being in the investment banking side and dealing with global markets the company was originally two separate firms j p morgan was pretty much a legacy investment bank with global recognition and reputation to go along with it it merged with chase a money center bank a number of years ago to form this powerhouse what makes it a cheap stock jpmorgan chase is a phenomenally successful diversified operation and has generated almost 28 billion in net income over the past twelve months and that will be about a 20 jump over the previous period that will come on the back of some 102 billion in revenue the company is increasing performance in virtually every metric in 2015 jpmorgan chase generated 44 6 billion in net interest income that s an astonishing number by any measure but then leap to 51 4 billion in 2017 this year is likely to end up between 54 billion and 55 billion this 7 increase in net interest income is joined by a lot of gravy another 7 increase in noninterest income with the economy booming and americans addicted to debt to begin with jp morgan chase has also been enjoying robust growth in its credit card revenue the company excels at marketing and chase cards are generally considered to have the bestrewards programs jp morgan also holds the top spot as credit card issuer co branded credit card issuer and with credit and debit payments volume the stock market has also seen a lot of volatility in 2018 and that is good news for the company s trading division while volatility makes investors queasy it also makes them react which means they trade more and the bank thus makes more commissions meanwhile jp morgan chase has been leading the sector with 9 deposit growth over the past three years i think it s difficult to find a more solid investment add in the 3 19 dividend and you have a real winner and one of the least expensive bank stocks synchrony financial what is it synchrony financial is one of those banks i mentioned that has a big lending business and skews more toward personal financial products than the other businesses it is very big in the credit card business but has other creative approaches to credit it offers financing for installment loans health and personal care procedures and has a network of credit products that tie into national and regional retailers local merchants manufacturers buying groups industry associations and healthcare providers in this way it s kind of an odd duck and that s one thing i like about it what makes it a cheap stock synchrony is growing at a faster rate than the other banks it has a loan portfolio that is approaching 100 billion growing at more than 13 annually meanwhile the banking side soaked up another 8 billion in new deposits a key element to synchrony s success is that its credit cards are tied into those local merchants and national stores these tend to carry higher interest rates than most credit cards so its net interest income is growing at a rate exceeding 10 while its ev to revenue ratio is high at 3 87 the stock itself is almost 50 off its 52 week high despite earning almost 2 3 billion in the past year which is in the same range its always had that makes it a very enticing selection for the category of cheapest bank stocks

amazon has eclipsed microsoft as the most valuable publicly traded company in the u s as a see sawing stock market continues to reshuffle corporate america s pecking order the shift occurred monday after amazon s shares rose 3 percent to close at 1 629 51 and lifted the e commerce leader s market value to 797 billion meanwhile microsoft s stock edged up by less than 1 percent to finish at 102 06 leaving the computer software maker s value at 784 billion it marks the first time amazon has held the top spot and ends microsoft s brief return to the pinnacle after it surpassed apple in late november the repositioning has been triggered by mounting concerns that the trump administration s trade war with china and rising interest rates will bog down the worldwide economy if that were to happen it s likely to slow the growth of companies in technology and other industries that generate a substantial chunk of their revenue outside the u s that s one reason most technology stocks are well off their peaks amazon for instance remains 21 percent below its high reached in september when the company s stock value stood above 1 trillion apple was worth even more back then but its stock has plunged by 37 percent since early october to erase about 400 billion of its market value apple confirmed some of investors worst fears last week when it warned that disappointing demand for iphones especially in china caused its revenue for its most recent quarter to fall well below the projections of its management and industry analysts
healthcare stocks are some of the best long term performers in the market so let s take a look at the cheapest healthcare stocks by cheapest we want to own stocks that sell below what they are worth in the long term we ve seen a 20 market correction so that means we should be able to find some value among a plethora of great stocks there is one pitfall with healthcare stocks right now which is the decision by a texas judge ruling obamacare unconstitutional may create some near term uncertainty we don t mind that because uncertainty means lower prices however we have to keep an eye out as to how these developments play out to see how they may affect healthcare stocks what s in this guide the cheapest healthcare stocks for 2019 if you re in a hurry below are our picks for the lowest priced health care stocks as of this writing unitedhealth a leading diversified healthcare company ventas a top tier healthcare reit vanguard health care mutual fund one of the best performing mutual funds i can find keep reading to learn more about these inexpensive healthcare stocks and my thoughts on them what are healthcare stocks healthcare stocks don t really have a firm definition they can involve everything from hospitals to pharmaceutical companies to biotech to insurers to senior living facilities to reits that lease property to any of those types of companies yet here is the fundamental concept about healthcare stocks they are investments that are tied to the core experiences of being a human being there are certain investments that are just wrapped into our dna to the point that without them we simply could not exist energy is one such sector another is health care just like energy it is a human requirement it requires repeat purchasing and innovation it s obviously important otherwise the country wouldn t be torn apart over legislation involving it and because it s big business human beings the world over need health care and all it encompasses from drugs to doctors to hospitals to technology to logistics you name it how do you determine what qualifies as the cheapest healthcare stocks the cheapest healthcare stocks must have these three characteristics a peg ratio or similar that is at 50 or less of its historical valuation range a leader in their field diversification read also what re the best stocks under 20 bucks peg ratio 50 less than historical range if you are going to invest in the cheapest healthcare stocks then those stocks must sell at a valuation that is closer to the cheaper end of its historical range than its expensive end most stocks trade in a valuation range depending on how its earnings growth relates to price most analysts just look at a range of p e ratios the problem with that is that a stock can have a very low p e ratio because it hit hard times or a high one because the stock got ahead of itself i look at a range of peg ratios which shows a range of p e ratios in relation to expected earnings so it will create less volatility in that range field leader the cheapest healthcare stocks might sometimes be cheap for a bad reason such as faltering earnings or cash flow or a lack of drugs in a biotech pipeline or a failed clinical trial that s why i will only choose stocks that are one of the leaders in its particular field i want the experts i want the proven performers i want the companies that have shown they can withstand all types of good times and bad times diversification i talk about diversification in almost every article but it s one of the top two most important elements i usually demand in a stock diversification is crucial so that a company is not relying on just one good or service if it is it can be upended by competition or by failing to execute with multiple services goods properties products or whatever the company is involved in the likelihood of catastrophe is substantially reduced here s a video that helps you with investing in healthcare stocks that also have dividends unitedhealth what is it you want diversification unitedhealth is the stock for you it has four different divisions that all offers different products the unitedhealthcare division offers all manner of health insurance products from consumers to employers to people age 50 and older and children s health insurance program plans the optumhealth division is best described as a user facing infrastructure provider which provides access to networks of providers health management services and financial services the optuminsight segment is the tech side of the company providing software and information products to the health care industry optumrx provides pharmacy care services and programs what makes it a cheap stock using both acquisitions and organic operations unitedhealth is now a massive national provider of all kinds of healthcare services it has a network of over a million doctors and more than 6 000 hospitals and other facilities unitedhealth built strongly on the obamacare mandate despite the mandate being removed by an act of congress unitedhealth still has seen exploding profits and a very reasonable valuation considering its growth 5 8 billion in net income in 2015 popped to 7 billion in 2916 and then exploded to 10 56 billion last year in the past twelve months it hit 12 5 billion with a p e ratio of 17 earnings growth of 20 a peg ratio of 0 85 is actually well below the median peg ratio the stock has traded at over the past ten years making unitedhealth one of the cheapest healthcare stocks in the market that s also experiencing strong growth ventas what is it ventas is a change of pace for healthcare selections it s a real estate investment trust that leases space to healthcare providers that gives my three selections diversification in the sector ventas has about 1 200 properties spread across north america and the uk including senior housing communities medical office buildings life science centers rehab facilities and skilled nursing facilities it also handles a la carte management leasing marketing facility development and advisory services to u s hospitals here s the beauty of ventas healthcare tenants usually sign long term leases meanwhile there s low turnover and the revenue is reliable because healthcare is always in need what makes it a cheap stock diversification in ventas portfolio is key with about 40 of assets in senior housing 32 in triple net leases and 28 in medical offices ventas stock has been selling off which we love because investors are looking too closely at net operating income and that it has been trailing off what they re missing is that new senior housing starts are slowing that s good news because it means less supply which means higher demand for ventas properties then net operating income as well as occupancy rates will perk back up ventas stock is nearly 33 off its all time high and on the lower end of its historical peg ratio range it s also a leader in the healthcare reit field not only because of its 1200 properties but exceptional management that has navigated a very uncertain healthcare real estate market vanguard health care fund what is it i m cheating a little because this isn t a stock but a mutual fund it s also one of the best long term performers in the mutual fund universe the fund describes itself perfectly biopharmaceutical innovation an aging population and growth from developing markets make the health care sector an attractive longer term investment offsetting these powerful tailwinds is the issue of the affordability of health care it s more crucial than ever that we stay true to our disciplined investment process and seek high quality health care companies at a lower cost what makes it a cheap stock the fund carries 75 holdings many of which you have heard of over the years with a 45 concentration in pharmaceuticals since its 1984 inception it has returned a remarkable 16 48 on an average annual basis despite its many advantages vanguard keeps the expense ratio at a very low 0 37 but here s the most important metric regarding vghcx its risk profile is excellent compared to most of the rest of the market over the past 15 years it has an average annual return of 12 with a standard deviation of 12 that means in any given year there is a 95 certainty that it will return between 12 and 36 that s right even a concentrated sector fund has better risk metrics than the s p 500 which has a 15 year return of 9 8 with a standard deviation of 13 22 meaning in any given year it has a 95 certainty of delivering a return between 16 6 and 36

ostensibly the partial government shutdown does not affect national weather service operations related to its mission to protect lives and property the agency is considered critical and the staff continue mission essential functions according to a spokeswoman but there are less obvious ways in which the shutdown does affect the weather service even its operations forecasters and managers are not getting paid weather models are not being maintained launched or improved emergency managers are not being trained effects could stretch well beyond when the government reopens the national weather service is a 24 hour operation with often grueling shift work not getting paid to do that job makes it even more stressful one manager of a national weather service office who wished to remain anonymous to speak openly said the lack of empathy from the people in their community and the government is like a slap in the face federal employees care about what they do the manager said as much as we can repeat in our minds it will be okay eventually you can t tell your body to stop worrying one employee got two hours of sleep last night after going through all his bills trying to figure out where to start we constantly hear you ll get paid eventually right said the manager well we have to pay bills today the national weather service is also responsible for the forecast models it uses on a daily basis from the massive global forecast system to the narrowly focused hurricane models forecasters partner with researchers to improve those systems or bring them back online when they fail suru saha a union steward at the environmental modeling center in college park maryland said the main impact has been on the national weather service s new global forecast model which was scheduled to go live in february but will surely be delayed because of the shutdown but in the meantime the current global forecast system or the gfs the united states premier weather model is running poorly and there s no one on duty to fix it there was a dropout in the scores for all of the systems on dec 25 saha said of the scoring system used to rank how the forecast models are performing all of the models recovered except for the gfs which is still running at the bottom of the pack not only does that mean the day to day weather forecast is worse she said it s a national security risk saha thinks it has to do with the data format the model brings in data from all over the world from dozens of different countries which are now standardizing the format to adhere to new regulations the environmental modeling center was working to adjust for the new formats when the shutdown started saha said that even though they re getting the data the gfs doesn t recognize the format so it can t use it and a model forecast is only as good as its input data once the gfs scores start to go bad it impacts everything saha said transportation the energy sector national security agriculture the stock market extreme weather there are about 50 full time federal employees at emc and 150 contractors only one person is working during the shutdown she said a manager who does not work on data or the models things are going to break and that really worries me because this is our job we are supposed to improve our weather forecasts not deteriorate them i m sorry saha said i m just really passionate about this to be sitting at home watching scores go down it feels terrible we owe taxpayers the best winter happens to be a critical time for hurricane model updates said eric blake the national weather service union steward at the national hurricane center in november and december researchers look back at the storms of the previous season to see how the models did and try to tweak them to perform better next season they use the months from january to june to make improvements you evaluate what happened and you use that to push forward blake said almost none of that is happening because of the shutdown they also use this time to train emergency managers from texas to maine before the start of the next hurricane season that s not happening and it s not clear whether the week long sessions will be made up when the government reopens saha said that even without pay she would be working if she could the last thing she and her colleagues want is an obvious failure in the forecast models this is what we do this is what the public never sees saha said we work day and night to make sure it never becomes apparent a pedestrian walks through new york city s snow covered central park credit photo by astrid riecken for the washington post
statewide iowa iowa farmers will not be seeing some usda crop reports that would normally be released at this time of year usda chief economist rob johansson says the reports that were set to be released on january 11th will be delayed because of the partial government shutdown the delayed documents include the monthly world agricultural supply and demand estimates or wasde crop production reports grain stocks and rice stocks according to johansson it will take about a week to release the reports once funding resumes this hold up is different than the delay in 2013 where usda report data was missing johansson says that is not the case this time and the reports will be released as soon as possible
this is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated millions of low income americans could have a harder time affording food if the partial government shutdown continues into february funding for food stamps school lunches and nutrition for pregnant women and young children is expected to run out next month if the impasse isn t resolved experts say the largest benefit at risk is the supplemental nutrition assistance program or snap the formal name for food stamps nearly 38 6 million americans depended on this aid to augment their grocery budgets in september according to the us department of agriculture s latest data the agency said last month that the program is funded through january but it has only 3 billion in reserves to cover february that s less than two thirds of food stamps 4 8 billion cost in september what the agency would do next is unknown if the 3 billion reserve were distributed evenly that would translate into a roughly 90 cut for the 19 4 million households that receive an average of 245 a month according to the left leaning center on budget and policy priorities that would put a huge hole in the budget every month for families that have very low incomes and would likely result in severe hardship and hunger said dottie rosenbaum a senior fellow at the center a program that provides food assistance to more than 7 million low income pregnant women new mothers and young children is similarly threatened the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children also has federal funding to last only through january according to the national wic association an advocacy organization the average cost of a monthly wic food package is just under 41 per person last week the agency s food nutrition service division said it intends to allocate all remaining carryover and unspent funds to state agencies according to the rev douglas greenaway the association s president federal officials are working with state agencies to see what other unspent money might be available for reallocation how much is available and how long the program can continue operating will vary by state but these actions together would push the cutoff date into february it becomes a make or break moment likely in mid february greenaway said at that point it s possible states might not sign up new clients or might stop providing benefits to women who recently gave birth or older children greenaway said they might also provide only one month of benefits instead of the typical three months child nutrition programs including school breakfasts and lunches and after school meals will continue into february according to the usda while states partner with the federal government on many food assistance programs they do not have the funds to cover the federal portion during the shutdown said james weill president of the nonprofit food research action center the usda did not respond to requests for comment if federal nutrition aid does run dry next month it will put a big strain on the nation s food banks which provide groceries to tens of millions of americans through the federal emergency food assistance program donations from the food industry and charitable contributions the usda paid for its shipments through march before the shutdown took effect said carrie calvert managing director of government relations at feeding america the nation s largest domestic hunger relief organization however the federal agency is no longer reimbursing states for storing and distributing the products which costs 5 3 million a month so far no problems have been reported but calvert is concerned that the funds will dry up if the shutdown is prolonged another issue if low income americans stop receiving their food stamps and other benefits more will turn to food banks for help many of which don t have the resources to handle the additional crush of people the capital area food bank which annually serves half a million people in the washington metro area through 450 pantries is already planning to boost its stocks since it expects to see more clients soon both federal workers and contractors who are losing their paychecks and low income residents who are losing their government aid it s already getting queries from the food pantries and soup kitchens it serves about whether they can get more supplies the shutdown comes at a bad time because the food bank typically has less inventory in january and february since it receives fewer donations after the holiday season ends the nonprofit agency is talking to grocery and corporate partners to see if they can hold food drives in coming weeks we just need to be able to provide more said radha muthiah the food bank s ceo
watch now patient investors might want to consider buying shares of micron technology as things slowly turn positive for the chipmaker cnbc s jim cramer said monday as micron s stock pulled the semicondcutor cohort higher shares of micron mounted a long awaited recovery in monday s turbulent trading session after bmo capital markets analysts upgraded the stock to buy from hold saying that its price had gotten too low to ignore cramer host of mad money said investing in the cheap and steady intel the well managed broadcom the recently downtrodden advanced micro devices or the similarly

failure has separated the strongest players from the rest of the pack cramer said speaking after the first day of annual healthcare conference in san francisco not long ago the longtime stock picker

will ultimately come to value pharmaceutical companies that focus on curing diseases rather than treating them ceo vas narasimhan said monday speaking at the 37th annual j p morgan healthcare conference in san francisco narasimhan told cnbc that novartis may have to start separating itself from the idea that profitable medications which are often lucrative because they manage chronic diseases rather than curing them is one of the few ways to be successful in the pharmaceutical space we re getting into gene therapies and cell therapies that could cure patients of disease and my belief is there are a lot of diseases we could tackle with these technologies and really provide cures narasimhan who took over as ceo in feb 2018 said in an interview with cramer what we re really finding out is that society wants that and that ultimately they will value it he continued my conviction is that we ll figure out those challenges but if you re a company that could consistently bring

advertisement apple has a big and misleading ad on display in las vegas during this year s ces convention the ad states what happens on your iphone stays on your iphone the ad is literally untrue much of what users do on their iphones and the data they generate doesn t stay on their devices iphones leak data to wireless carriers websites app developers and to apple s own servers and services apple benefits directly and indirectly from the information that can be gleaned off of users iphones give me a break apple complimentary tech event transform talent with learning that works capability development is critical for businesses who want to push the envelope of innovation discover how business leaders are strategizing around building talent capabilities and empowering employee transformation know more that s a cute ad you have in las vegas for the ces tech convention what happens on your iphone stays on your iphone is both a good dig at your rivals and a clever restating of sin city s popular catch phrase but it s literally a lie what s happens on customers iphones doesn t stay on them and you know it advertisement all kinds of data leaks off of iphones much of it with user permission to the numerous software developers who offer the apps that make your devices so useful but plenty of it also goes to your own servers and services that s something you both encourage and make money off of in some cases in ways that aren t all that different from the companies your ad is implicitly deriding read this apple trolled google with a massive billboard at the world s biggest tech show which it s not even attending paul manafort knows what s on iphones doesn t stay there to cite one prominent example of how data on iphones doesn t actually stay on them take the case of paul manafort president trump s former campaign manager who was recently convicted of multiple federal crimes part of what got him in trouble were some whatsapp messages he sent from his iphone that may seem strange at first whatsapp is renowned for offering a secure messaging service with end to end encryption which blocks anyone but the sending and receiving parties from reading messages iphones are also renowned for their own security and everything stays on an iphone right wrong manafort backed up his whatsapp messages to your icloud service a common practice what he apparently didn t realize is those backups aren t secure that you have the keys to them and can access them when federal prosecutors ask you to advertisement other companies do the same thing of course businesses are legally obliged to hand over customer information when they receive a subpoena from law enforcement unless they choose to legally challenge the subpoena as apple and others do from time to time manafort s case may also be the one of the more extreme and justified examples of how the things people do on their iphones don t actually stay on them but it s certainly not an isolated one iphones regularly leak all kinds of information even at a very basic level iphones leak information it s not a bad thing it s just the nature of phones and networked computers when users make a call or access the internet they are providing information via the cell towers or wireless routers they are connecting through to carriers or website operators about where they are and in many cases who they are connecting with that kind of metadata absolutely doesn t stay on users iphones but you as a company also get all kinds of data off iphones your maps app and its real time traffic conditions service relies on data you glean from iphone users many iphones are customized to automatically send you diagnostic and other data so you can identify bugs in your operating system when iphone users asks questions of siri their devices submit those queries to your servers and you use that information to get a better idea of the kind of information users are looking for you ve made a big deal about how the iphone has built in encryption and advanced authentication technology such as your face id facial recognition system to protect the data stored on users devices and for the most part the iphone s built in security technology is pretty robust advertisement but as the manafort case illustrates the locks you ve put on people s devices are irrelevant when you ve left open a huge back door in the form of your icloud service icloud is a big back door to users iphones it used to be that most customers backed up their phones to their home computers via your itunes software assuming they backed them up at all now the default is to back up to icloud something you ve been pushing customers to do it s true that the icloud backup service is a lot easier and user friendly than itunes but you make money off it you charge customers who want more than the pittance of storage you offer all that data including sensitive things like chat and email messages is copied to your computers through icloud while your policy may be to not access user data it s factually incorrect to claim that the data stays on a customer s iphone it s a particularly dangerous illusion to perpetuate for people who may not be technically savvy enough to know any better and who are foolish enough to take you at your word just look at what happened to jennifer lawrence advertisement like many people lawrence used your iclould photos service which stores on your servers the pictures users take on their iphones the service is great i use it to backup all my digital photos and to access them on my numerous apple devices the downside of icloud photos though is that photos are no longer just on users devices and they too can leak out that s something that lawrence and several other celebrities found out to their dismay several years ago when malicious actors were able to figure out their icloud passwords gain access to their photo libraries and post on the public web some of the risque pictures they found there apple benefits from google searches and facebook s app in recent years as your iphone sales have started to stagnate and even fall you ve been touting your services business according to analysts one of the biggest and most profitable money makers in that business is your deal with google that deal ensures that google is the default search engine in the iphone s safari web browser a position which ends up sending likely billions of search requests to the company every year that s a significant data leak in and of itself google uses those searches to glean lots of information about iphone users and to precisely target them with ads that s the core of google s business a business you implicitly are deriding in your ad and you help enable it for a huge chunk of change how exactly are you better than google again besides google the other big target of your pro privacy campaign has been facebook but users must have a device of some kind to access facebook most of them these days get to the service using their phones and in the united states and many other countries a large portion of those mobile users are getting to facebook via their iphones another way of saying that is that what users do on facebook on their iphone isn t staying on their iphones advertisement sure you re not collecting the data but you benefit from facebook s app being available for the iphone and indirectly from the data it collects after all facebook s app has long been one of the most popular apps in the iphone app store it s quite possible that if it weren t available for the iphone at all or only offered a fraction of the features as the android version features after all that are often enabled or powered by the data facebook collects a significant portion of your user base would buy an android phone instead but it s not just facebook s app that leaks data off of users iphones a huge portion of apps in your store do that and you know that because you designed ios the operating system underlying the iphone to do just that you built in hooks that allow developers to access and use all kinds of information off users phones including their location their photos their contacts in their address books even their health and fitness information yes there are good reasons to allow that access and you do offer some relatively good settings in ios to give users some measure of control over who has access to that information and how it s used but it s absolutely false to suggest to users that such information stays on their device iphone apps are finely tracking users locations what s more even with the tools you offer users still sometimes have little control or even knowledge of how data collected from their iphones is being used in a report last month the new york times found dozens of companies that collect consumers location data via their mobile phones including iphones although the data was collected anonymously the companies databases often contained enough information about the comings and goings of particular phones to identify individuals and their patterns of behavior what s more the report found that at least some affected consumers were unaware that their location information was being used for purposes other than the explicit features of the apps that gleaned it some were also unaware that in many cases their location information such as what stores they visited was being sold or passed along to other companies including hedge funds advertisement look apple i appreciate your commitment to privacy as a consumer one of the things i like about being a customer of yours is that your business isn t dependent on tracking my every move so that you can sell ads i understand and appreciate that you make efforts to anonymize the data i and other users send to you i also like the fact that in many cases you have given me choices about what data i share and with whom but iphones aren t closed boxes much that happens on them sometimes all of it definitely doesn t stay on them and to suggest that it does is dishonest and a disservice to your customers get the latest google stock price here
