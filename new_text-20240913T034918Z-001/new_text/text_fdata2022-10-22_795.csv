during a worsening housing affordability crisis new york city landlords are keeping tens of thousands of rent stabilized units off the market a phenomenon tenant activists call warehousing an internal state housing agency memo obtained by the city shows that the number of rent stabilized homes reported vacant on annual apartment registrations rose to over 61 000 in 2021 nearly doubling from less than 34 000 in just a year as the city emerged from covid lockdown that s higher than the official count in the nyc housing and vacancy survey conducted in 2021 by the u s census bureau on behalf of the city s housing agency which tallied 42 860 vacant and unavailable rent stabilized apartments citywide rent stabilized apartments represent nearly half of all rental housing in the city and are among the most affordable places to live in new york rents in stabilized buildings are often lower even than those offered as income restricted affordable housing the data memo also reports an 8 drop from 2019 to 2021 in the number of apartments registered as rent stabilized 927 753 registered units in 2019 and 857 791 units registered for 2021 as of the march 2022 deadline as late registrations come in this number may shrink but it s matched by a roughly equal drop in the number of apartments reported as rent stabilized on property tax bills between 2019 and 2020 an analysis by the city found it was the largest such decline in 15 years altogether the state numbers show a loss of over 95 000 stabilized apartments for rent after 2019 the year a major overhaul in albany of the state s rent laws blocked landlords from significantly jacking up rents on vacant units when letting them to new tenants advocates are sounding the alarm about the growing number of empty rent stabilized apartments the coalition to end apartment warehousing a collective of tenants and 15 community organizations has been calling attention to the trend claiming that landlords are fabricating housing scarcity to manipulate legislative changes in albany creating fake scarcity to raise prices is not a fair way to run the housing market and it deprives new yorkers of needed housing coalition members wrote in a recent op ed the nonprofit community service society compares the withholding of stabilized housing to political ransom by the landlord lobby landlords say that the current price restrictions on stabilized housing robs them of the capital needed to make necessary repairs in older housing stock they also have their eye on a federal lawsuit filed by two major industry groups community housing improvement program chip and the rent stabilization association rsa challenging the entire rent regulation system as unconstitutional that case is currently before the u s court of appeals for the second circuit and could ultimately go before the supreme court and if the highest court undermines rent stabilization could potentially reward landlords who ve kept apartments vacant legal success for the landlords is a long shot but some property owners say they ll wait it out closed loopholes for more than two decades beginning in 1997 landlords benefited from state laws that empowered them to boost rents after a vacancy above and beyond annual increases allowed for all stabilized apartments set by the city rent guidelines board in certain circumstances they could deregulate apartments entirely which led to the removal of over 345 000 apartments from rent stabilization during the early to mid 2000s alone any time a tenant vacated landlords received a vacancy bonus that let them increase the rent of the unit by up to 20 and once an apartment s rent reached a certain dollar amount most recently 2 774 a month the unit left the rent regulation system entirely allowing the landlord to rent it at any price the housing stability and tenant protection act of 2019 hstpa repealed both vacancy bonuses and vacancy decontrol it also sharply limited how much landlords could pass along the costs of renovations to tenants through rent increases practices that housing advocates and lawmakers criticized for spiking rents and fueling displacement prior to 2019 landlords could make a lot of money by emptying out rent stabilized apartments hstpa essentially revoked any financial incentive to do so one exception to these restrictions known as the frankenstein loophole has allowed some landlords to combine adjacent rent stabilized apartments into one apartment and jack up rents however proposed legislative amendments would put restrictions on these apartment conversions setting new rents at the combined legal rent for both previous housing accommodations but landlords are still legally permitted to keep their rent stabilized apartments empty indefinitely vacancy cost effective chip the trade association of rent stabilized owners claims the revamped rent laws are directly responsible for the jump in apartment vacancies the 2019 restrictions make it more cost effective to keep an apartment vacant by keeping rents too low to justify repairs chip executive director jay martin said that s especially true when tenants move out or die after many years echoed vito signorile vice president of communications at rsa another landlord group he asserted that currently vacant apartments have some of the lowest rents of any rent stabilized units due to previous tenants living in these units for decades without boosts from vacancy bonuses yet the data memo from the state s housing agency homes and community renewal or hcr suggests a different picture the 2020 median monthly rent for vacant stabilized apartments is 1 912 49 higher than the overall median rent of 1 280 for rent stabilized units that year apartments vacated after 2019 would bring in more revenue for landlords than the typical stabilized apartment not less one factor elevating rents on vacant apartments may be the 421 a program a recently expired tax abatement criticized by policy experts as an enormous waste of public money the program provides tax incentives for developers of new housing and requires some or all units to be rent stabilized many renting for thousands of dollars a month the rent laws normally apply only to those apartments built before 1974 and chip has sought to call attention to the condition of those older apartments claiming that more than 20 000 apartments need costly overhauls that currently permitted rent levels can t cover renovating those units the landlords claim would cost more than the amount renting them out would recoup but those numbers also raise questions about landlords claims chip s spokesperson michael johnson told the city in an email that every apartment occupied before 2000 likely needs a gut renovation because the nyc council passed local law 1 of 2004 the lead law but fixing lead paint issues alone does not require a gut renovation according to ken wray executive director of the parodneck foundation who has experience renovating older housing in manhattan wray told the city that lead encapsulation would cost a few thousand dollars if testing shows lead abatement is even needed at all tenants left some tenants assert that their landlords are deliberately pushing out rent stabilized tenants and keeping those apartments vacant you can t live in the city as long as i have and not have issues says craig martin roseberry referring to the 29 years he s lived as a rent stabilized tenant of 336 w 17th st in manhattan craig martin roseberry in his chelsea rent stabilized apartment of 29 years credit ben fractenberg the city an artist manager with roots in the 1980s downtown club scene martin roseberry lived peacefully in his chelsea apartment until it changed ownership in august of 2016 according to martin roseberry the building s new landlord michael besen began systematically emptying apartments denying market rate residents new leases and offering buyouts to rent stabilized tenants to get them to vacate it s easy to kind of browbeat people offer them what appears to be lucrative or helpful but really isn t martin roseberry says martin roseberry also recalls nonstop construction which he claims the landlord carried out without appropriate permits as of this month the landlord still has two work without a permit violations open with city enforcers according to department of building records today tenants report that only four of the 15 apartments at 336 west 17th st are occupied they can easily scare you out martin roseberry says and most people feel that having to endure having to get a lawyer court cases paperwork it s just easier to leave plastic sheets with a zippered entrance covered a stairwell in a chelsea apartment building credit ben fractenberg the city across town tenants at 225 e 26th st witnessed 44 out of their building s 89 units go vacant following a change in management in 2019 one tenant recalls what appeared to be construction as harassment on his floor filling hallways with dust and potential toxins from within the walls and pushing several rent stabilized families to move out tenants also reported living without gas for six months from february to june of 2020 hpd issued seven different class c immediately hazardous housing violations at the building for inadequate supply of gas the owners of the two buildings besen partners and trihill did not respond to requests for comment from the city millions in profit landlords have also cited covid repercussions including an eviction moratorium lease breaking and widespread nonpayment of rent as adding to their pain numbers compiled by the staff of the city rent guidelines board suggest that by and large they re doing just fine or better the board s 2022 income and expense study reports that landlord profit fell by 7 8 between 2019 and 2020 in buildings that contained rent stabilized units but that adjusted for inflation net operating income had increased 46 6 since 1990 including more than a 20 increase between 2010 and 2020 alone six out of 10 buildings that contain rent stabilized units also contain market rate apartments an analysis by the city found a typical rent stabilized apartment yielded 6 540 of net profit in 2020 and 8 652 in manhattan the rent guidelines board found and those landlords are typically big ones an analysis of property owner registration data by the nonprofit group justfix showed that landlords with 1 000 or more units own the majority of nyc s rent stabilized housing stock and landlords with 100 or more units own 88 of all rent stabilized housing the author of this article previously worked at justfix the typical owner of rent stabilized property would have made over 6 million of post expense income in 2020 alone the rgb s numbers indicate or more depending on how much of their portfolio was market rate none of that is stopping landlords from pursuing rollbacks of the 2019 laws chip is drafting bill language that essentially allows an owner to reset a rent on vacancy says martin bringing back a version of the vacancy bonus abolished in 2019 as head of an association of 4 000 owners of rent stabilized property across the city martin claims his organization could bring 25 000 apartments back to market in six months after negotiating with lenders and contractors to jacob udell director of research and data at the university neighborhood housing program in the bronx landlord groups holding thousands of affordable rentals off market brings about an antitrust concern the housing crisis in nyc has never been more severe and these landlords are openly holding an essential good off market in the hopes of forcing policy more favorable to them udell said affordable rental units with strong tenant protections are exactly the type of housing most in need right now and withholding them has undoubtedly exacerbated the affordability crisis city councilmember carlina rivera d manhattan has proposed a bill that would require registration and inspection of vacant dwelling units by the city department of housing preservation and development making unit level data on warehousing data available through the nyc open data portal in albany assemblymember linda rosenthal proposed the end warehousing act of 2021 which would fine landlords who hold apartments vacant beyond three months and use money collected to fund vouchers for homeless people we have a crisis we have part of the solution to the crisis and we have a class of people who refuse to extend themselves rosenthal told the city as for martin roseberry of west 17th street organizing with his tenant association has been the most effective way to combat displacement in his building by bringing their landlord to court martin roseberry s association was able to fix some of the building wide issues that led to apartment vacancies in the first place you are not going to be able to run me over and get rid of me and that is the sum of it all he says we will fight you if you ve noticed vacant apartments in your rent stabilized building we want to hear from you write to us

after the wall street journal detailed concerns some fed policymakers have voiced about the relentless pace of rate hikes mortgage rates relentless climb another daily rate index compiled by mortgage news daily shows mortgage rates retreating slightly from thursday to friday the federal open market committee which sets short term interest rates has raised the short term federal funds rate five times this year although fed policymakers started with a 25 basis point increase in march they quickly escalated the pace of rate hikes to 50 basis points in may and 75 basis points in june july and september having seen few signs that inflation is moderating while another 75 basis point increase in the federal funds rate on nov 2 is seen as inevitable bond market investors who fund most mortgages are now focused on the committee s dec 14 meeting the cme fedwatch tool which monitors futures contracts to calculate the probability of fed rate hikes puts the odds of a 75 basis point increase in november at 92 percent but futures markets put the odds of another hike of the same magnitude in december at less than half several fed policymakers have hinted that they d be open to a smaller 50 basis point increase in december if there are signs that inflation is starting to ease those policymakers include fed vice chairwoman lael brainard chicago fed president charles evans and kansas city fed president esther george the wall street journal s nick timiraos reported but dovish policymakers who might favor a less aggressive approach are in the penalty box and will have a hard time convincing their more hawkish colleagues to back off as they ve been wrong about inflation at key turning points over the last 18 to 24 months renaissance macro economist neil dutta told timiraos i imagine we will have a very thoughtful discussion about the pace of tightening at our next meeting fed governor christopher waller said in an oct 6 speech at the university of kentucky while housing seems likely to continue contributing to high inflation in the near term in the medium term higher mortgage rates should slow the housing component of inflation as housing demand cools waller said but for now he said i anticipate additional rate hikes into early next year and i will be watching the data carefully to decide the appropriate pace of tightening as we continue to move into more restrictive territory fed policymakers will pay close attention to an upcoming report on worker compensation the employment cost index eci to be released on oct 28 timiraos reported the market is torn between those who hope the worst will soon be in the past and those who believe the fed will tighten policy further at a time when the strong dollar is increasing global tensions reuters reported citing rbc global asset management s andrzej skiba we re not sure that relatively strong economic data and elevated inflation will allow them to in the near term skiba told reuters jared bernstein an economist who s a member of the white house council of economic advisers tweeted friday that he sees signs that supply chains are unsnarling and this is taking some pressure off of inflation but some economists worry that if the u s is already in a recession and the fed waits too long to ease or reverse its tightening it will be too late to head off a downturn the last time the fed paused in a recession there was no pivot rally piper sandler chief investment strategist at michael kantro tweeted in another twitter thread steno research ceo andreas steno larsen suggested that current mortgage rates imply a 20 percent drop in residential home prices over the next 9 to 12 months unless central bankers admit to this outlook soon it is safe to say that a pretty deep recession is unavoidable larsen tweeted i don t think they will admit to it before it is too late why a soft landing is very unlikely a mortgage bankers association survey showed demand for home loans last week hit the lowest level since 1997 as rates continued to rise in a research note pantheon macroeconomics chief economist ian shepherdson agreed that the abrupt rise in mortgage rates will hurt home sales but that a recession is not inevitable the plunge in demand is now pushing home prices down despite very low inventory of existing homes but inventory of new homes is high and when homebuilders cut prices private sellers have to follow shepherdson wrote we think prices will fall by 15 to 20 percent from their peak by the middle of next year housing and related activity account for less than 10 percent of gdp so the housing sector like manufacturing can be in recession while the rest of the economy is not the current housing shock is nothing like 2006 to 10 given the absence of resetting adjustable rate mortgages and the lack of housing equity withdrawal in recent years if the fed s efforts to combat inflation do lead to a recession interest rates are likely to come back down giving many homeowners taking out loans today the opportunity to refinance at a lower rate widening spread between treasurys and mortgages that s one factor driving mortgage rates up even faster than yields on 10

this is the second of what might end up being a series of high end desktop humidor reviews over the years i ve gawked at prometheus humidors in various places whether at trade shows or when i see them in offices so i knew that if we were going to do a high end humidor series i wanted to include prometheus prometheus has sold a lot of different humidors over the years especially if you include the ones released through fuente aged selection a joint project between the company and arturo fuente these have ranged from boxes that are promoted as travel humidors to models like the one being reviewed today and even to more elaborate cabinet style humidors it also has the milano and octagon series which are the company s two more affordable lines of desktop humidors what is it both prometheus and i describe the platinum series as the company s flagship offering but it s also sort of the standard model many of those fuente aged selection or other limited edition prometheus humidors appear to be modified versions of the platinum series it s a very wide desktop humidor that measures 20 inches x 9 25 x 5 75 there are currently five different finishes offered but prometheus has made the aforementioned limited edition versions in other finishes one peculiar thing about those limited edition versions is that they tend to incorporate some sort of lock and key something that isn t present on the standard versions of the humidor the humidors are made in france which is similar to both elie bleu and davidoff what i would consider the two direct competitors to prometheus especially here in the american market each humidor comes with a prometheus hygro 3 digital hygrometer which measures both relative humidity and temperature has a date time display and even an alarm function the 150 model comes with a single prometheus optima humidifier whereas the 200 comes with two optima humidifiers both the hygrometer and humidifier s are detachable via preinstalled magnets how much does it cost 1 995 it s offered in five finishes macassar ebony blue sycamore red sycamore yellow sycamore and carbon fiber a larger 200 count version the platinum series 200 is available in all of these finishes for 2 495 what s included humidor four removable adjustable dividers prometheus hygro 3 hygrometer prometheus optima humidifier two batteries for the humidifier instructions how large is it inside i measured the humidor to be 18 25 inches x 7 5 x 4 375 on the inside for a total of 598 8 cubic inches of interior volume that doesn t take into account any lost space for things like the humidifier or hygrometer per humidor discount s humidor calculator this is good for 128 robusto cigars what makes it special this may be more unique than special but this is one of the few desktop humidor models that is elevated thanks to the use of four brass feet i m not sure this provides any functional benefits but it does provide a more luxurious feel halfwheel s humidor testing process 2022 revision after having some issues with the previous series of humidor reviews i made some revisions to how humidors are tested first i am now using two sensorpush devices per humidor to try to overcome any issues where one of the sensorpush devices fails or runs out of battery second the process that each humidor goes through has been modified boveda seasoning packs for 14 days weigh before and after use moisture meter before and after boveda packs for 13 weeks weigh before and after measure with moisture meter after optional reseasoning included humidifier for eight weeks optional refill at 28 days measure with moisture meter after optional reseasoning two weeks inside of the dry cabinet measure with moisture meter after during each of these steps with the exception of the optional refill during the included humidifier part the humidors are closed the only times a humidor is opened are when i m moving from one step to another and need to switch out the humidification elements and use the moisture meter in addition the humidors are pretty much empty during these tests inside there are the two sensorpush devices the humidification element s and the included dividers and or trays but no cigars or anything else i finally got boveda to give me a more precise way to determine how many boveda packs each humidor should receive in short i m told that for every 200 cubic inches of volume you should use one 60 gram pack and to round up to the nearest 200 cubic inches for this humidor i am using three packs for both the seasoning and testing processes the results of some of this testing are above for this humidor there was only one seasoning process and no reseasoning was required seasoning prometheus says that once the humidor has reached 70 percent relative humidity it s ready for cigars to be placed inside of it i didn t follow those instructions but the humidor seemed in a good place after two weeks of seasoning as shown in the chart above the seasoning nearly doubled the moisture meter readings boveda this shows just 30 days of performance the same length of time i did with the elie bleu the prometheus platinum series did pretty well but not as well as the elie bleu and the bovedas were getting close to the point of needing replacement after 13 weeks interestingly if i followed the standard boveda approach of one 60 gram pack per every 25 cigars in the humidor and took prometheus at its word that this is a 150 count humidor that would result in me placing six boveda packs inside instead i placed just three as boveda s more technical guidelines are one 60 gram pack for every 200 cubic inches i suspect the chart above would look much better with six packs included humidifier despite what i originally thought prometheus uses a foam humidifier though the foam is very different than the typical florists foam the foam is much denser much more brittle and prometheus uses a thicker amount of foam than most humidifiers i ve seen prometheus also provides much more detailed instructions than most companies including the recommendation that the humidifier is filled until it weighs about a half pound which gives me a much better idea about when i need to refill the humidifier and how much distilled water to put inside of the humidifier the end result is a foam based humidifier that performed much better than pretty much any other foam humidifier i ve ever used to the point where i wondered if it was even a foam humidifier the humidifier comes pre filled and in a sealed plastic bag to prevent the moisture from escaping or leaking prometheus s recommendation is to have the humidifier weigh a half pound around 226g when i opened the humidifier it already weighed 294g so i skipped prometheus recommended procedure to fill it four weeks later i opened the humidor and weighed the humidifier at 269g still above the recommended weight so i opted not to refill it at the end of the eight week test it weighed 253g and two weeks later it weighed 246g dry cabinet i thought there was a chance that i d be able to fit the prometheus platinum series humidor in the dry cabinet at a weird angle but it was too wide this test was not performed the good very good performance while not as good as a recent elie bleu s performance the prometheus platinum series performed about as good as any non elie

most helpful ones are the ones related to the weight of the humidifier though the instructions about refilling and when to use the humidor solution are also helpful beyond that there s a full page of detailed instructions about how to use the hygrometer there are instructions about what happens if the humidity level is too high and even advice about how to remove stains from the interior of the

about how to remove stains from the interior of the humidor hint it involves sandpaper while i didn t use most of the procedures outlined in these instructions i found many of them helpful a much better foam humidifier my preference is still to use pretty much anything other than foam but prometheus foam is better than most not only is it different foam but i think the fact that it comes pre soaked in a sealed bag is a much better approach than most furthermore the detailed instructions about how to use it specifically the part about how much the humidifier should weigh make this a lot better solution than others still foam humidifiers are not the most modern approach to humidifying cigars my preference is still to use pretty much anything other than foam but prometheus foam is

advanced hygrometer the hygrometer can measure temperature and relative humidity but also has a date and time function an alarm function which could be helpful for reminders to refill as well as a max min function while i don t need any of these features it s the most feature packed hygrometer i ve seen in a humidor review in a few years the hygrometer can measure temperature and relative humidity but also has a date and time function an alarm function which could be helpful for reminders to refill as well as a max min function while i don t need any of these features it s the most feature packed hygrometer i ve seen in a humidor review in a few years quality metal hardware i m impressed by the hardware used for this humidor the feet and the lid lip are the two that stand out because of their locations on the exterior but the thickness of the hinges is what stood out to me i m impressed by the hardware used for this humidor the feet and the lid lip are the two that stand out because of their locations on the exterior but the thickness of the hinges is what stood out to me fit finish in general the humidor we purchased is excellent i ve always admired the high gloss finishes that prometheus humidors have and the interior is generally no slouch either the literal weight of the humidor nearly 12 pounds helps to add a real sense of quality to the humidor one that i think is earned the bad a small wooden piece on the lid fell off prometheus has this small piece of wood that is placed between the humidifier and the hygrometer this piece is glued on but our humidor showed up with it already dislodged i m not overly concerned with using this piece of wood but the end result is a two inch long glue stain i think prometheus should make this piece magnetic which would avoid this problem in the future prometheus has this small piece of wood that is placed between the humidifier and the hygrometer this piece is glued on but our humidor showed up with it already dislodged i m not overly concerned with using this piece of wood but the end result is a two inch long glue stain i think prometheus should make this piece magnetic which would avoid this problem in the future it s a magnet for fingerprints both the metal hardware and the glossy wood finish attracted fingerprints a lot more than most humidors i find glossy humidors to be hit or mess when it comes to attracting fingerprints this was clearly in the lots of fingerprints category both the metal hardware and the glossy wood finish attracted fingerprints a lot more than most humidors i find glossy humidors to be hit or mess when it comes to attracting fingerprints this was clearly in the lots of fingerprints category it s very wide part of the appeal of this humidor is its unique width but that could end up being annoying for some customers because of how it limits where the humidor can be placed part of the appeal of this humidor is its unique width but that could end up being annoying for some customers because of how it limits where the humidor can be placed foam humidification while i found this to work better than pretty much every other foam humidifier i still wish prometheus used a different humidification method in the end even it acknowledges that the foam will need to be replaced due to declining performance over time prometheus charges 20 for the replacement foam which it says will need to be replaced as frequently as once every two years and another 5 for the humidor solution my math says it would cost 48 per year to use boveda in these humidors which is a lot more expensive than the cost of maintaining the prometheus foam but also is 48 per year in the grand scheme of a 2 000 humidor the competition the direct competitor is obviously the larger size platinum 200 series which i imagine is rather similar to this humidor except for its sizes i wish that i had more experience with prometheus octagon and milano humidors but i have essentially none like with the recent elie bleu review i figure it s probably more useful to describe the companies that might compete with prometheus platinum series humidors versus specific models elie bleu i recently reviewed one of elie bleu s 110 count humidors and was impressed with the craftsmanship the nearly flawless exterior of the humidor and the raw performance of the box itself there s one glaring issue with elie bleu it uses florists foam humidifiers some of the elie bleu models might be less expensive than the platinum series but most are going to be more expensive than the prometheus i don t think you can go wrong with either brand i recently reviewed one of elie bleu s 110 count humidors and was impressed with the craftsmanship the nearly flawless exterior of the humidor and the raw

company i previously thought of as exclusively a cabinet humidor company it s designed to go inside a drawer but it could be used as a standalone item most notably it includes a built in electronic humidification system which is relatively rare for a desktop humidor we have a vigilant reliance 2000 here at the halfwheel office and i have no complaints about the humidor there s a very good chance this smaller vigilant humidor will get reviewed in 2023 should you buy it yes i think prometheus offers a nice spot in between the high end savoy and daniel marshall humidors and elie bleu and davidoff what you get is a humidor that performs well and really makes a statement due to its exterior appearance as with most high end humidors i don t think this is going to make your cigars taste any better this is really a matter of aesthetics which is something i particularly like about prometheus for 2 000 you are getting from start to finish a more elevated experience than the 500 1 000 humidors whether it s the included accessories like the humidifier or hygrometer the detailed instructions that impressed me so much or the beautiful box you won t confuse this with a standard humidor which i think is the point the humidor for this review was purchased by halfwheel overall score

lesson he learned from the pastor at his first parish assignment in 1962 newly ordained as a priest of the roman catholic archdiocese of washington then father bazan was assigned as a parochial vicar at holy cross parish in garrett park which was led by msgr w louis quinn the founding pastor since the parish was established two years earlier one thing he emphasized and did himself was visiting all

studying to be a priest he prayed that he would get a good assignment and those prayers were answered for him at holy cross and in the other parishes where he has served during his priesthood they the people there were wonderful he said that example of priestly presence from msgr quinn who later served as the rector of the cathedral of st matthew the apostle and who was the archdiocese s longest

opinion editor s note star tribune opinion publishes letters from readers online and in print each day to contribute click here in mark osler s commentary endorsing mary moriarty for hennepin county attorney moriarty brings hope not fear to prosecutor s role opinion exchange oct 19 he cites his work with heals 2 0 the task force focused on reducing violent crime convened by hennepin county attorney mike freeman we also serve on heals 2 0 and like mark osler we are proud to see our work to reduce violent crime starting to pay off homicides and shots fired in minneapolis are both down slightly from the record high we saw in 2021 and we are heading in a good direction that work would be impossible without coordination between justice partners and law enforcement on the city county state and federal levels moriarty s positions on policing prosecution and her inability to work productively with justice partners to improve overall community safety in her previous role as a public defender makes her the less than ideal candidate for hennepin county attorney if we want to continue to reduce violent crime moriarty has said she would not charge gun and drug cases that result from traffic stops from our conversations with the hennepin county sheriff s office traffic stops focused on gang hot spots are responsible for the majority of the illegal guns that we are removing from the streets it is critical that we have a county attorney who will prosecute these cases further moriarty stated in 2021 reasons that she did not believe the minneapolis police department needed more officers despite it having one of the lowest per capita staffing levels of any city in the country her opponent martha holton dimick has a balanced approach that emphasizes reform adequate police staffing and effective prosecution for these reasons and others dimick has overwhelming support among hennepin county mayors law enforcement and the partners involved in heals 2 0 this letter was signed by edina mayor james hovland minneapolis downtown council president and ceo steve cramer hennepin county commissioner jeffrey lunde the rev jerry mcafee and safe streets now for a better tomorrow founder julie wicklund inflation not convinced by gop s proposals because of inflation i m voting for democrats this november i made this decision after listening to the republican proposals for solving the inflation problem republicans have talked about three solutions first pass another tax cut bill for millionaires and billionaires a scheme that has been tried over and over with disastrous results always spiking the deficit second make cuts to social security and medicare some republicans have advocated eliminating these two programs completely others say congress should vote up or down each year making these programs political footballs people who depend on social security and medicare and who have paid into these programs all their working lives wouldn t know from year to year whether they had sufficient income or health care third cut wages for workers republicans who have proposed this idea claim higher wages are driving inflation so workers need to be willing to cut their pay none of these so called solutions are defensible president joe biden and the democrats keep working to eliminate inflation and cushion the pain caused by rising prices i will vote for politicians who have real solutions ruth thorstad dresser wis federal reserve chair jerome powell seeks to lower inflation by raising interest rates assuming that if borrowing becomes more expensive then demand for goods and services will drop which will then allow corporations and businesses to hire fewer workers essentially creating a buyer s market for labor which will then allow them to reduce wages assuming that will drive corporations and businesses to reduce their prices for said goods and services very rube goldberg it has been shown that corporations are making record profits while also while raising prices well beyond inflationary pressures incurred with supply problems and source scarcity and what have they done with these gouged profits they have used them to line the pockets of their ceos will they be included in the fed s wave of increased unemployment and buy back stock shares to inflate the values of their companies certainly wage increases have not kept pace with inflation generated in large part by corporate greed and corporations have shown no signs of reducing their prices or intending to share their new wealth with their employees and there is nothing to make them lower prices should the fed s remedies actually be effective it makes absolutely no sense to take jobs away from and money out of the pockets of working people who are finding it difficult to make ends meet as it is in the hope that price gouging businesses and corporations will somehow behave and lower their prices because of theoretically low wages will the ceos see a corresponding reduction in their pay prices can come down right now to levels that more accurately reflect true inflationary pressures yes they are real that will allow businesses and corporations to garner a healthy profit and keep the rich rich without throwing people out of work if businesses and corporations had instead of their own self interest the will and best interests of our nation at heart the two are not mutually exclusive gordon b abel minneapolis health care an 18 jump really did anyone else become angry upon reading the article unitedhealth group s q3 earnings increase to 5 26b oct 15 the article explains that unitedhealth group has a profit of 5 26 billion for the third quarter i m all for companies earning a profit but when the business regards an essential service and basic human need for health care that is ridiculous this is the same company who jacked up my husband s business s health insurance rate by 18 without any regard to the previous year s cost experience because we have fewer than 50 employees why is a health company making a profit of 5 26 billion increasing rates for small businesses who are struggling after the pandemic and during a recession without regard to health cost experience health insurance companies are making ridiculous profits while dictating what medical costs are covered which ultimately controls medical choices for patients our health care system is fundamentally flawed when insurance companies make this kind of money at the expense of people s health and doctors autonomy laura neuman eden prairie mississippi river what

by matt egan cnn president joe biden took a victory lap on friday for the biggest one year drop in the federal deficit in american history that s despite the fact that deficits remain historically high and all of the record breaking 1 4 trillion deficit drop is driven by the fact that emergency covid spending has lapsed hours later biden championed his student debt forgiveness program a program that completely wipes out the modest deficit savings created by the inflation reduction act the dueling narratives from biden perplexed some budget watchers who remain deeply concerned about america s mountain of debt it does strike me as contradictory dan white senior director of economic research at moody s analytics told cnn on friday on net the policies of the administration have increased the deficit not reduced it maya macguineas president of the committee for a responsible federal budget a deficit watchdog group said besides the inflation reduction act the biden administration has made the fiscal situation worse not better the white house is knowingly twisting the facts to tell a very different story than a fair and accurate one macguineas told cnn on friday asked about the optics of cheering deficit reduction hours before highlighting the student debt program macguineas was baffled it seems a little insulting to the audience she said as though you could trick us by taking claim for fiscal responsibility which isn t warranted and separate it from this huge deficit busting executive order that is costing hundreds of billions of dollars the white house did not respond to a request for comment on the criticism but david kelly chief global strategist at jpmorgan funds said the biden administration does deserve credit for a strong economy that has helped boost tax revenue the economy has fully recovered from the pandemic and that is helping push the deficit down kelly said drop in the bucket the inflation reduction act is projected to slash the federal deficit by 238 billion over 10 years according to the congressional budget office however most of those savings are slated to hit during the back of the decade and that is relatively small savings relative to america s 31 trillion in debt two hundred thirty eight billion dollars is really a drop in the bucket white said in any case biden s student debt relief which will help millions of borrowers will more than offset those savings the cbo projects the student debt forgiveness will increase the deficit by 400 billion the good news is that deficits are indeed shrinking and shrinking faster than many imagined possible that should lower the risk of a debt crisis or pressure from financial markets that forces draconian budget cuts the treasury department said the annual budget shortfall plunged to 1 4 trillion during the fiscal year that ended september 30 that is a massive improvement from the record high of 3 1 trillion in fiscal 2020 the bad news is deficits remain very high surpassing that of any year except during the peak of covid and during the great recession the covid emergency is over and it s important to understand why the deficit is down so sharply it s not because the government has gotten massive spending programs like social security or medicare and medicaid on a sustainable path it s because emergency covid spending that drove up the deficit to new heights has lapsed the bailouts for airlines stimulus checks and forgivable loans are in the rearview mirror thankfully that is the only reason white from moody s said if the biden administration should take credit for anything it s not making things even worse than they were the committee for a responsible federal budget estimates that more than 100 of the deficit reduction for fiscal 2022 is due to shrinking or expiring covid relief the group estimates that biden s actions to date have increased deficits by 4 8 trillion through 2031 i d love to give the white house credit unfortunately their record doesn t give you anything to cheer about macguineas said biden vs trump on debt and deficits biden correctly noted during his speech friday that deficits increased throughout the tenure of his predecessor former president donald trump the self proclaimed king of debt the federal deficit went up every single year in the trump administration every single year he was president biden said it went up before the pandemic it went up during the pandemic those increases reflected not just the covid emergency spending by the controversial tax cuts that failed to live up to the hype on my watch things have been different biden said the deficit has come down both years that i ve been in office macguineas agreed that trump had a terrible record on the deficit and yet struggled to say that biden has done a better job on this issue both of them during times of economic strength continued to borrow in fiscally reckless ways macguineas said neither of them demonstrated an iota of fiscal responsibility other than eight days after biden signed the inflation reduction act borrowing costs rising fast looking ahead us policymakers still face a serious challenge in getting the fiscal situation on a stronger footing kelly the jpmorgan executive is encouraged by the fact that the debt to gdp ratio a closely watched figure appears to have peaked for the moment at least we are in a better place but we really need to make policy in a logical way to meet the actual needs of the economy not just in a way to get votes kelly said both parties are guilty of that macguineas is more concerned pointing to the fact that uncle sam s borrowing costs have gone up because the federal reserve has sharply raised interest rates to fight inflation this is the moment we have all been worried about macguineas said white similarly said the united states remains on an unsustainable fiscal trajectory especially looking out 30 years into the future the problems that i thought would be my grandkids problems he said are now going to be my kids problems the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warner bros discovery company all rights reserved
a much ballyhooed instacart ipo has been put on the shelf as tech companies that boomed during the pandemic are now suffering a cruel correction one of the odd unexpected financial consequences of the covid 19 pandemic was that tech companies made money hand over fist while unemployment otherwise skyrocketed in every other sector and the broader national economy tanked and being tech companies they figured these trees would grow to the sky that there would never be a correction and so they bet the farm their new revenue from the shut in economy would never run dry but of course it did run dry the latest victim is san francisco based grocery delivery app instacart as reuters reports the company is calling off its planned 2022 ipo and it s a pretty stunning development as according to reuters instacart had planned to reveal their ipo filing in the coming days moreover instacart had just pulled a round layoffs last month specifically in hopes of looking leaner and meaner to investors if you got laid off at instacart just to help their standing for an ipo that is now not happening oh my dms are open though in fairness reuters reports that instacart has not ruled out an eventual ipo at some point down the road but certainly now is not the time as the downturn in the ipo market is staggering last year according to reuters ipos pulled in a record 154 billion in 2022 that figure is a little over 7 billion so far this year and it s almost holiday time when ipos don t typically happen so the clock is running out on this year those of us who do not work in tech could perhaps care less about the tech stock downturn after all the unemployment rate is still a historically low 3 5 and we can sit and mock investors whose tech stocks and crypto investments are completely tits up right now but remember that the pandemic tech boom and its tax windfall is pretty much why the state of california and the city of san francisco are riding on substantial surpluses at the moment if the city or state finds dwindling tax revenue puts us back in deficit territory the collateral damage could be calamitous for all of us related meta is downsizing its offices prefers to call this vibe planning image marques thomas via unsplash

in a recent and much anticipated earnings call netflix announced a new strategy for the company s shareholders changing the focus from subscriber growth to revenue and profit kim masters and matt belloni discuss what this means plus they look into the future of dc films netflix s new strategy revenue and profit kim executed a 180 pivot for a long time they were all about subscriber growth although they did add a couple million plus subscribers subscriber growth is no longer the thing the thing is revenue and profit which they do have at last netflix throws shade at the competition kim and by the way their competitors are pathetic and losing money i will note when they threw some shade towards streaming services like disney and hbo max those companies do have other businesses and netflix doesn t but they still made some hay out of the fact that they believe those people are losing money matt it s pretty ridiculous the fact that they are pivoting here when the comps are favorable to them this is a company that for the past 10 years has dined out every quarter on their subscriber growth regardless of how much money they were losing to get to that and now when they ve gotten there they are trying to switch the narrative netflix has added 2 4 million subscribers matt i don t know people are going to follow that wish i think people are still going to report about their subscriber numbers but this quarter their subs were actually pretty good 2 4 million ads which is about two and a half times what they predicted kim although these are not the most lucrative subscribers matt no not necessarily a lot of the growth was in asia and not necessarily the markets where they charge more like the us which only gained about 100 000 subscribers but it s certainly about face from the past two quarters where they lost subscribers and did not meet their expectations and they are saying that they re going to add about 4 5 million subscribers in this last quarter which will be down from last year but still the arrow is pointing in the right direction the launch of its advertising tier matt now we re going to get this advertising tier that s launching on november 3 and netflix really hopes that that supercharges the subscriber growth while not cannibalizing the revenue from those subscribers too much kim we ll see how many people want to go for that 7 ad version i think people want to go for that from what i hear rising tide kim in fairness to them they ve had a great run with this dahmer a huge hit around the world brian murphy bet paying off and he has the watcher right behind it which seems to be doing well their stock shot up quite a lot in the aftermath of this call and i think it heartens other companies even though netflix wants to throw shade because they are growing that s why netflix want to talk about subscribers because disney is adding much faster at this point they re still growing only been in this business a much shorter time than netflix matt all of these companies are now considered streaming companies by wall street so when netflix does well disney and all these other companies stock goes up too kim that s good for everybody rising tide plus dc films head exits kim walter hamada who had been running the dc films has exited the building there is now a bit of a race as black adam comes out that s a movie made under the old regime but sold by the new warner bros discovery regime they are very much hoping to get dc relaunched they ve had their difficulties matching marvel which has kevin feige who is a unicorn who runs it now kim i predict that mike de luca and pam abdy who now run the studio but are not supposed to run dc will continue to have a hand in dc they re acting in that capacity now de luca is being re marketed as the comics guy even though that was not david zaslav original intent matt no and they got a very public no from dan lin a producer of the lego franchise that they wanted to come in and run dc that didn t work out so now they re back to square one maybe that works matt they re looking for this magical executive that they believe exists out there somewhere i don t think they re gonna find this person so then it becomes a question of whether they just give it to de luca and abdy or whether they just bring in someone that they don t love but who can tread water and do this job kind of kim i think they will bring that person in with de luca and abdy involved and i think a lot of that will be a version of this world where a lot of big filmmakers like todd phillips matt reeves and james gunn maybe have a piece of that world it s going to be maybe a different model maybe that works
s1 california wildfires emerge as a leading source of greenhouse gases s2 you have it happen year after year and you can see how intense the wildfires are and you can see how frequent they are s1 i m maureen cavanaugh this is kpbs midday edition search edina reflects on his term as mayor of imperial beach s3 this is not anywhere else you got to be cool and funky and grassroots and community and that s what works here s1 and a new amphitheater marks its opening weekend at uc san diego that s ahead on midday edition california s groundbreaking efforts in the last two decades to reduce carbon emissions seems to have been undone by one season of raging wildfires a new study by climate researchers finds that the record breaking series of wildfires in 2020 released twice the amount of emissions then were saved by carbon reduction efforts since 2003 up until now emissions from wildfires have not been taken into account when assessing the progress of the state s carbon reduction efforts but they may soon be included in california s climate projections joining me is rajendra sahota deputy executive officer of the california air resources board and rajendra welcome to the program s2 good morning and thank you for having me s1 s2 and then that target was set it was to focus on the root cause which was let s reduce those emissions from those sectors what we didn t know in 2006 was that the impacts of climate change would be more intense and more frequent in the next decade and so when you fast forward to 2015 2016 2017 you have one year of bad wildfire emissions and you re like oh my gosh we re seeing the first major symptom of climate change in california but then you have it happen year after year and you can see how intense the wildfires are and you can see how frequent they are and that is now the new norm along with the droughts s1 the u n climate panel now says all sources of emissions must be considered in efforts to achieve carbon neutrality s2 and that was the 2020 target which we achieved years before we were mandated to but in that climate change scoping plan we now include wildfire emissions forest natural landscape emissions and the industry and fossil emissions that have always been present in our inventory crop does post both wildfire emissions and the fossil fuel side emissions but right now we are planning for carbon neutrality in 2045 but that means working with intention to change some of our sustainable management practices allowing wildfire to happen in a managed way to mimic what would happen in a natural cycle and also continuing to reduce the fossil fuel emissions that we have in the in the economy s1 we all know that we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels by things like driving electric cars and cutting oil production but how do we stop this new kind of massive wildfire in california forest management we ll release carbon anyway into the atmosphere s2 so right now we have a buildup of excessive carbon in our forest that is not a natural state for our forests we also need to do some fire management and so cal fire local agencies will be working to think about how to target that and in some instances how to manage some of the existing fires that we know will happen to make sure that we re not really managing to always put the fire out but to make sure that it is helpful to reaching a natural state in those landscapes there are regions that absolutely need some attention right now or otherwise they will continue to have these large large impacts in carbon emissions s1 one of the long term effects outlined in the study is after these climate driven wildfires the trees that store carbon dioxide are often not growing back isn t that regrowth essential to carbon capture in the future absolutely s2 but i think we need to also recognize that when we have a wildfire in california it doesn t wipe out all the trees in california it wipes out a region where the fire happened and we ve had more regions with wildfires and those may continue but we still have a significant amount of forest in california that it continues to remove carbon from the atmosphere even today and regrowth will happen and we know it won t be automatic it s a very different timescale and i think that s maybe part of the reason that we just have to acknowledge that we re going to see a longer time for our forests to go from a wildfire source overall sink in the economy even though today they are still pulling carbon out of the atmosphere s1 i have been speaking with rajinder sahota deputy executive officer of the california air resources board rajendra thank you very much s2 thank you s1 imperial beach residents will welcome a new mayor to city hall next year eight years after winning his first term in office by just 43 votes surge dna is stepping down and returning to his environmental activism roots kpbs environment reporter eric anderson has details s4 the imperial beach library holds a special place in surge to dana s heart the mayor grew up in the old library spending a lot of time there so renovating this building has been a centerpiece of his effort to renovate his hometown s3 everybody got it you don t need to make it fancy but you need to make it accessible colorful warm and friendly and a resource for everybody s4 county officials businesses community advocates all brought in and spent millions to turn this community hub into something special s3 and it helped us fuse everything that we did in imperial beach over the last eight years to really renovate and just restore this beautiful dynamic we have an imperial beach the ocean and the community and doing things that make the city better for every every part of the city and that s what this is about s4 energy and ability to build coalitions exemplified how san diego s southernmost beach community changed during his tenure businesses invested in the beach town s front door the pier is a fixture and the surrounding area exudes life too dina implored those with resources to invest in the city not just their businesses s5 he s been a great voice for the city s4 kim frink is an imperial beach resident so s5 he s very much i would say an activist mayor s4 frank says passion for community building and grassroots organizing put him at the forefront of her effort to open a co op grocery store in a city that didn t have a supermarket when he took office but there is one issue that dominated dina s two terms in office frank says it s cross border sewage s5 it s a serious public health issue an environmental disaster and it s really impacts people s lives you know and yet i know in the time that i ve been here the number of days that it s closed has really increased s4 dina has pushed hard to fix an environmental disaster that has pummeled imperial beach for both of his four year terms in 2018 the city sued the federal government and an emotional dina took stock s3 it s been a long fight and you know what me and my kids and our community has been suffering from me personally i m very emotional morning for me vivid memories of taking my kids to the emergency room s4 that lawsuit focused attention on the issue other south county governments joined so did clean water groups to deena lobbied federal state and local officials for a solution as he watched the problem get worse in april of 2020 he chided public officials for not acting s3 the river flowing that you want a river should be zero gallons a day during dry weather today it is 60 million gallons a day that s a minimum flow the entire sewer system of tijuana has collapsed s4 the first major break came in 2018 when 300 million was included in the usmca trade deal giardina lobbied officials at all levels of government by november of last year federal officials crafted a 630 million plan to deal with the issue on both sides of the international border earlier this year mexico promised to add 147 million to fix tijuana sewage issues a solution is finally in sight indefatigable david gibson is the head of the regional water quality control board s6 never ceasing constant and that s what i think that s took this issue has been going on for a very long time so what was different about it now i think surge offered that kind of perspective to elected officials in mexico as well as in san diego in california and washington d c s4 gibson says dina s drive and passion for a safe place to surf off the coast of imperial beach fueled the change it finally has the south county beach town in reach of reopening ocean waters for recreation and cardenas says the journey was uniquely imperial beach s3 this is not anywhere else you got to be cool and funky and grassroots and community and that s what works here s4 four people are running to replace the incumbent and whoever the next mayor is will find themselves surfing into deena s wake eric anderson kpbs news s1 this is kpbs midday edition

u s shale oil executive matt gallagher this week took a poll on twitter to gauge sentiment toward president joe biden s offer to stock the u s emergency oil reserve at prices around 72 a barrel to give producers an incentive to drill more the result nearly 80 of respondents said they did not expect oil futures next year will fall to a level that would trigger any u s purchases negating any boost from what analysts called the u s put or using proposed strategic petroleum reserve buys to set a minimum price for new oil production that announcement was making it appear like he was throwing a bone to the oil industry said tricia curtis ceo of consultancy petronerds who dismissed the offer what if oil does not fall to that price do we just keep our reserves low she asked the release of the last of a 180 million barrel sale coupled with a repurchase price was biden trying to walk a fine line between supporting his green base and trying to lower fuel prices and he did neither said curtis a u s department of energy spokesperson was not immediately available to comment oil is now selling for about 85 a barrel and the about 70 offer is a price where there is no supply growth said abhiram rajendran a director at consultancy energy intelligence u s oil prices hit 120 per barrel this year and did not trigger a production boom because of shortages and high costs for labor and equipment said hunter kornfeind oil market analyst at rapidan energy group rebecca babin senior energy trader at cibc private wealth said tight oil supplies have pushed up price expectations into 2024 but that occurred apart from the spr offer she said oil futures through mid to late 2024 are trading about 72 a barrel meaning oil producers can lock in the sales price of future production around the level set for spr purchases said kornfeind if the biden administration wants to boost oil supplies it should change its policies around producing more oil and gas in the united states said frank macchiarola a senior vice president at trade group american petroleum institute by arathy somasekhar in bangalore stephanie kelly in new york writing by gary mcwilliams editing by robert birsel

long nguyen can am mick schumacher s fate is just days away steaming at him head on his career hanging plainly in limbo schumacher s success or failure at this weekend s grand prix in austin and in the final three races of the 2022 season may dictate not only schumacher s future with haas but his future in formula 1 both ruin and glory are on the menu if he wants to stay with us he s got to show us that he can score some more points team boss gene haas said just this week further pressurizing the situation it feels like an almost monumental task the haas car leapt from the blocks early this season but hasn t scored any points in the last seven races whether it s schumacher or his teammate kevin magnussen at the wheel it will take luck and some extra special sauce from schumacher to turn that trend around mere days before the us grand prix in austin the mounting pressure doesn t seem to faze schumacher we re sat at a homey plastic picnic table on the schumacher family ranch near gordonville texas a sprawling haven among the grasslands north of dallas the sun is high the sky a faultless cobalt a thin breeze runs its fingers through the dry gold stubble it s unfathomably serene how could any of the world s concerns reach you here long nguyen can am schumacher was waiting for us to arrive lingering near a row of modded can am side by sides joking around with the haas staff in formula 1 a word of spit shine polish six figure wristwatches and athletes who must personify their sponsors as much as broadcast their own humanity schumacher appears in striking relief today a well worn black hoodie pit viper shades helmet hair you almost couldn t pick this f1 driver out of a lineup of down home mud spattered farm boys almost only his jeans so european in their sensibility out mick as a german on texan soil is it okay if i wear my sunglasses for the interview he asks me as we sit down and face one another across the table it s your place brother you make the rules i reply yeah it s just that some people might perceive it as rude he says because you can t see my eyes even with the shades on schumacher broadcasts a sense of ease and transparency that s uncommon among the pro shoes i ve interviewed it felt like joining your neighbor for a backyard dinner it makes sense he d feel comfortable this is schumacher country after all the 400 acre property we re sat on operates as a fully functional horse ranch a world class facility for breeding and raising competition horses owned by mick s mother corinna schumacher mick s sister gina a world class equestrian herself also trains here long nguyen can am schumacher and your humble author the family bought this place in 2012 back when bobcats and deer roamed its grounds the property had sat for twenty years untouched before the schumacher s took over since then it s been a place of business but also a spot for mick to decompress with regularity of course this being a schumacher property decompression includes more than riding horses behind the back forty sits another back forty devoted to the art of driving faster than hell swaddled by a broad bank of deciduous trees there s a dirt course that must be a half mile long curling and twisting wide as a texas two lane there are several jumps one of them in the middle of a flat out right hander plus a mix of hairpins sweepers and elbows it s a carnival ride for adrenaline junkies the stuff of wistful redneck fever dreams as a son of eastern washington state i m well equipped to qualify these matters you know whenever i get the chance i come out and visit when she s here and train schumacher says we are really happy around here especially when we can do stuff like this go out with the buggies we built our own race track he reiterates motioning to the track over his shoulder long nguyen can am mick invited some of the haas staff and members of his personal team out to the ranch as a thank you for their efforts this season he wanted to treat them to lunch and a session spent ripping around on the property s dirt track in a fleet of can am side by sides it was an opportunity for the gang to slam the pressure release valve ahead of the season s final test a baptism in the mud and dirt of course track ownership has its own perks before we sat down for the interview schumacher took to the course in his own side by side a can am maverick x3 x rs gussied up with a robust full roll cage billet tie rods and a arms uprated shocks wheels tires and every other trick in the go fast playbook he swung the can am through each corner a mile high rooster tail rising behind with the dirt track bedded in i folded myself into the passenger seat for some hot laps with mick one great pleasure of this job is access to batshit metal another one is the opportunity to sit in the proverbial office with some of the most talented drivers on earth every moment beside an f1 pro is informative even on dirt maybe especially on dirt schumacher doesn t draw many parallels between his work on the f1 grid and the driving out here even if one skill in abstract can enrich the other long nguyen can am it s just just another way of driving and you kind of get a feeling for it he said about ringing out the can am you know you just drive out there you put it sideways and you just get a different feel for it hence i kind of feel like if i do end up going to a rainy session or whatever that i ll be able to maybe deal with the conditions just that bit better and even if it doesn t help me still it s a hell of a lot of fun if it s on dirt or if it s on ice there s always an aspect of getting to know how to drive a car and how to handle a car and again it s just about that those different feelings that you get while driving it and and how can i improve how can i go quicker that s very much the same aspect because you always want to go quicker at the end of the day though work is work play is play schumacher says he can have fun out here at the ranch but after a long enough stint he wonders aloud what s the point if there s no competition you can only enjoy flinging mud so much can am the sentiment brings the coming weekend and its stakes into razor sharp focus with the dust settled and the adrenaline still buzzing in my stomach we settle into a longer conversation about the state of schumacher s season the pressures at haas are nothing new he said they re an expectation at racing s highest level the targets are clear it s obvious we want to do the best we can and if that s points then obviously we re shooting for the points schumacher says flatly still it s a tall task for a driver in just his second full year in formula 1 the series constitutes a quantum leap in complexity from open wheel feeder series like formula 2 and formula 3 schumacher explains how your skillset has to take flight with little runway even the feeder series can t prepare you for f1 fully you must simply land on your feet and get to sprinting or else get left behind you just start driving on big tracks start working with engineers mechanics so basically you run through those in formula 3 and formula 2 then try and be as complete as possible going to formula one but still formula one is definitely the biggest step you will do in that ladder it does take time and i mean a lot of people know that it ll take time before you are at your best he says williams boss jost capito is one of those who understands that development takes time he has openly entertained the idea of hiring schumacher in interviews should his seat at haas evaporate capito acknowledged it often takes three seasons for a young driver to acclimate to the levels of speed and professionalism required in f1 he cited mercedes driver george russel as an example who despite fits and starts became consistent and quick enough by his third season to land a top seat in the sport long nguyen can am that s part of schumacher s catch 22 at the moment his development requires the patience of mechanics teams and engineers but at a small team like haas there s simply not enough time or resources for that development results are vital to the team s continued survival in the sport besides haas s patience has often been tested by schumacher a series of serious crashes this year have likely strained haas s budget which pales in comparison to financial behemoths mercedes or red bull that might accept a few balled up chassis as the logical cost of sharpening fresh talent while schumacher has developed and whittled away the gap in qualifying times with his teammate over the course of this year even out qualifying and out racing his veteran teammate at times this season magnussen has scored more points and cost haas far less in damages if magnussen offers more points with less cost to haas what hope does schumacher have to stick around i ask schumacher for his impressions about open wheel racing in america hoping to tease out a backup plan maybe he d follow the glut of european talent who have fallen out of the f1 ladder only to find success in indycar maybe he d be interested in stock car racing or ferrari s bid for wec next season as he s still a driver in ferrari s development team for now but schumacher is resolute in his focus i see a lot more people that maybe don t necessarily get into formula 1 cuz of one reason or another moving towards indycar and they say they absolutely love it they say the competition is high they say that the racing s fun the car is difficult to drive so yeah it s definitely interesting to see some people moving from europe to indycar to the states schumacher says on the other hand i have to say that it never really crossed my mind i m really set on formula 1 as i wanna race against the best people in the world and in and the fastest cars it s the attitude required in moments like this when one is hemmed in on all sides if you shift focus even minutely and quietly acknowledge an exit plan you ve already lost i m definitely consistent in my approach schumacher says i don t wanna adapt or change cuz then ultimately it would probably would make me slower obviously we want to be as quick as we can and yeah i ve always been good with dealing with pressure it doesn t necessarily mean i want more pressure but you know i m not a i m not gonna crumble underneath it there are more than glimmers of hope however schumacher has placed in the top ten this season he scored crucial points for haas f1 learning exactly what it takes over the course of a race weekend to earn the results which may save his seat the points were absolutely critical to his development obvioulsy once you taste blood you kind of want to go for it schumacher says it s been kind of frustrating cause every time we did have a car capable of scoring points through racing luck or whatever we ve always had something that didn t quite work out if it was a strategy or a safety car or whatever so you know these things are not really in our control i think we should have had at least 15 points added to our account from all the races we had long nguyen can am the results then in these final four races of the season and especially at austin this weekend will both exercise schumacher s patience with himself and haas s patience with their young driver schumacher notes that if you try and force results to happen they tend to go the other way by keeping his head clear he managed back to back points finishes and a meticulous performance in austria this season expectation will always fill a driver s mirrors schumacher says the only thing he can do is maintain focus and stay joyous behind the wheel it s an oddly existentialist approach to racing from one of the elite drivers on this planet you know the question that i would ask is why did we choose this job it s because we love it i feel like with without enjoyment you won t get far hence you know i really love this sport he says for me it s the only thing i wanna do absolutely and and so yeah enjoyment is a huge factor in performance our conversation winds to a close with some nervous body language from haas pr there s another interview to be done lunch is served schumacher is now another 30 minutes closer to the race weekend that may determine his fate in the sport he loves singularly long nguyen can am you d hardly notice after another round of laps in his can am schumacher swings close the the picnic table where his team are sat eating burgers i can almost see the grin beaming through his helmet as schumacher streaks past the table and pins the throttle a huge braaaap issues from the can am as a streak of grass and mud spray across his team who are still laughing and hollering when bounds out from the driver s seat the pressures of formula 1 don t seem to find mick schumacher out here on his texas ranch among the cobalt sky the stubble and the horses whether that s folly or genius we ll find out soon enough

everything to slow down our food exports i believe that with these actions russia is deliberately inciting the food crisis so that it becomes as acute as it was in the first half of this year today more than 150 ships are in the queue to fulfill contractual obligations for the supply of our agricultural products this is an artificial queue it arose only because russia is deliberately delaying the passage of ships every day that ships with food spend in the queue means an increase in social and political tension in the countries that consume our agricultural products here are just some of the states to which food exports are delayed due to russia egypt tunisia algeria morocco lebanon iraq china bangladesh indonesia our partners the un türkiye and others are fully informed about this situation during the operation of our grain initiative due to the russian slowdown we under exported about 3 million tons of food this is the annual volume of consumption for 10 million people russia is doing everything to ensure that at least hundreds of thousands of these people become forced migrants who will seek asylum in the same türkiye or eu countries or die of hunger and we together with our partners must do everything so that the grain initiative is not only preserved but also works at 100 capacity the right to food and to life without hunger are fundamental rights for absolutely every person on earth and that is why russian attempts to exacerbate the food crisis are also aggression against every person on earth i held a meeting today with representatives of the u s congress who arrived in kyiv i thanked them for their continued bipartisan support and for the tremendously powerful things america is doing to help us protect freedom we discussed the key issue for today anti aircraft and anti missile defense we also talked about financial support about our political interaction about what new anti european and anti democratic steps to expect from russia and its

white writer given free house in detroit that was taken from black woman and sold off without her consent when anne elizabeth moore was given a free house in 2016 as part of a writer s residency programme in detroit it felt too good to be true however as she learned more about how the property arrived in her life it came to feel more like a racist true crime story the home had been sold out from under a 47 year old woman named tomeka langford against her will part of a trend in wayne county of municipal authorities aggressively seizing homes from black detroiters and selling them at foreclosure auctions during the height of the financial crisis in 2010 ms langford a mother of four bought the home for 700 after a previous owner experienced mortgage default advertisement advertisement at the time she knew she could face a back tax bill on the property for up to 10 000 and began a payment plan on the tax bill while investing roughly 8 000 dollars in fixing up the house and furnishing it hoping to leave the property as a gift to her kids one day then the county stepped in in the spring of 2012 while ms langford was casually browsing the county s property auction site she saw her own house for sale that s how she learned wayne county considered the home foreclosed for being thousands behind on back taxes seeming to defy a process that was normally supposed to take three years and involve multiple notices the city said it served ms langford in person and left written notices but she said she never received these warnings or any guidance from the county treasurer that she was facing foreclosure advertisement advertisement according to a guardian investigation ms langford s home was assessed and given a resulting tax bill at a value 2 500 per cent greater than the price she bought it for going against a state constitutional requirement that assessment rates couldn t rise above 50 per cent of the purchase price of the home the constitutional provision suggests her tax bill should ve been something like 30 for 2010 but was 1 800 instead you can t harbor stuff she told the paper you can t believe it but when you re the little person what can you really do you don t have anything to fight with the county insists it followed proper procedure advertisement advertisement the foreclosure is part of a larger trend in the city whose numerous foreclosed and abandoned homes became an emblem of the financial crisis between 2002 and 2016 roughly 143 000 homes were foreclosed in the county over a third of the total property stock most of them for unpaid taxes according to an analysis from regrid during that time detroit likely overtaxed between 55 and 85 per cent of properties according to the aclu of michigan leading 100 000 families to lose their homes many of them low income people of colour with home values below 9 000 all told the city of detroit may have over taxed homeowners by as much as 600m between 2010 and 2016 leading to an estimated 100 000 homeowners most of them black losing their properties according to the detroit metro times meanwhile wayne county made 421m in interest and fees on back taxes during the financial crisis bridge michigan reports advertisement advertisement according to ms moore the writer who is white she only learned ms langford had a title on the house when she eventually sought to move out and sell the home entering into a legal battle to quiet the title to the property not knowing that the now defunct writer programme bought it from the county amid such turmoil this isn t a story about gentrification at least not how we usually think about it she wrote in the guardian it s a story of a black woman losing her home to municipal greed and a white woman benefitting from her loss it s a story about the racial wealth gap and how the median white american household accrues almost eight times the wealth of most black american households city council president mary sheffield is pushing the mayor and others for a full reparations programme for people kicked out of their homes we are working diligently and very hard to find solutions she told the metro times this summer we don t just want to put a band aid on it and not get to the core of what happened advertisement advertisement housing advocates in detroit have suggested giving displaced people tax credits cash compensation home repair grants public housing vouchers employment opportunities or property itself from the city s holdings the phenomenon in detroit is part of a larger legacy of black people getting unequal access to the us housing market the major form of financial uplift and wealth creation for most families in the country federal officials intentionally kept black homeowners and neighbourhoods out of midcentury loan programmes to encourage home ownership in a process called red lining while jim crow segregation and vigilante violence targeted black families and further hampered equal housing

sea gods is a canadian paddle brand fairly new to the market founded in 2017 2022 was the first season we tested any of its sups very quickly we realized its style is the best part support us gearjunkie may earn a small commission from affiliate links in this article learn more each time i slid the sea gods paddle board out of its bag and carried it down to the shore passersby paused to ask questions about the eye catching artwork which is truly unlike that of any other paddle board from budget friendly to high end sups there s no shortage of choices in colors patterns or designs many sups tend to have water river or mountain type graphics while some have stripes or lines there are even a few that have camo patterns or even faux wood wraps but when it comes to the most beautiful sups on market sea gods may take the cake in short we tested two different paddleboards plus accessories from sea gods to get a feel for this brand s board performance and style the boards are great have good stability and there are a ton of different sups that cater to everyone from beginners to experts while the construction is sound and the on water performance was good the actual design and craft of each board far and away are what sets sea gods apart sea gods paddleboard artwork why are sea gods sup boards so unique the brand uses custom artwork designed by independent artists similar to custom topsheets on skis the time quality and unique custom nature of each board are what caught our eye you can support and provide exposure to an independent artist of your choice and get a quality board whether that s an all arounder one for yoga or one for ultralight adventures and the artist series change every year so there s only a certain number of boards with each artwork design once they re gone they re gone sea gods 2022 diatom review i tested out this board over the course of 5 months this summer and early fall in half a dozen different flat water lakes around colorado in my opinion this sea gods sup is just as great for all around intermediate paddling as several other inflatable sups we ve tested and the artwork is just a bonus specs materials 1 7mm pvc with heat molded seams 12800 m2 drop stitch fabric 1 7mm pvc with heat molded seams 12800 m2 drop stitch fabric size 10 feet by 34 inches by 6 inches 10 feet by 34 inches by 6 inches psi 14 18

spacious deckpad stability quality carbon paddle cons limited on deck storage limited on deck storage best use all around flatwater paddling lakes river paddling what we loved of course this is gearjunkie so in testing it s not really about looks this board is made well i always check the drop stitching seams attachment points and overall sup for any wonky construction the two boards we tested the 11 foot skylla and the diatom reviewed here were really lightweight 20 24 pounds minus any accessories the fin box is universal and the inflation connection supports most electric pumps if you choose to use one one of the things i noticed early on is the sea gods sup comes with a really nice carbon paddle one of the best paddles we ve seen so far included with a stock sup package it s a three piece carbon fiber shaft with a nylon blade and it s got great rigidity and is performance quality finally i also enjoyed this brand s board bags they have roller wheels on one side so they re easy to transport from a home to car such as in an urban setting like on a sidewalk but the bags also are covered in grab handles and pack down well so they are easy to transport backpack style too about the artist sea gods 2022 diatom markovka is a russian based surface designer who creates unique ornaments detailed floral designs and various other nature inspired illustrations her patterns are dreamy and full of tangled lines and fantasy plants markovka has a passion for nature and color that distinguishes her work writes sea gods the detailed floral patterns in mandala style on the diatom grace not just both sides of the board but also the eva deckpad as well every square inch pops with pattern and color and the artist even incorporated the mermaid and trident sea gods logo sea gods sup conclusion we had a blast testing out the sea gods 2022 diatom and skylla sups over the course of this summer and fall if you haven t yet found a sup on the market that fits your personality sea gods probably has a sup for you some have called them the best looking sups in the industry but along with that we found they perform great as well if you are more of an occasional paddler we recommend the diatom which the brand touts as the top isup in canada if you are more of an intermediate or like paddling longer distances go for the touring model the skylla its artist series designs change every season and based on the current artist series and the fun we had on our first sea gods boards we can t wait to see what s coming in 2023

which would move several fentanyl variants to the schedule i category and increase penalties on possession and distribution homelessness giving out free money to homeless individuals leads to more drug overdoses instead we should fund organizations with a proven track record of getting people off the streets and successfully rehabilitating them infrastructure most infrastructure decisions

increased drug usage has created a larger homeless population we should provide shelters for the homeless but those shelters need to be contingent upon not allowing drugs or violence within them

carry on the job and more funding should be sent to mental health services in schools guns militant groups we need increased background checks for people under 21 and strict enforcement of red flag laws the threat of far right violence is over exaggerated the biggest threat for most people is petty crime environment the federal government should provide additional firefighting resources to limit strain on state budgets droughts occur naturally but they are exacerbated by overpopulation due to immigration fentanyl instead of increased penalties for possession we need a more heavily guarded southern border and more counseling services for addicts up to and including forced rehab for drug offenders homelessness those who are homeless purely due to financial reasons should get free temporary housing but those with addictions or mental illnesses should be relocated away from big cities and rehabilitated by state programs infrastructure state governments need to be encouraged to divert funding away from nonessential areas and into infrastructure illegal immigration deteriorates infrastructure due to overpopulation so heavier border control will help the infrastructure crisis

guns militant groups i have worked hard on gun reform legislation in our house and greatly look forward to carrying that work to the federal level where i believe we can effect the most comprehensive

lot more to do expanded safe storage laws legislation to hold gun owners partially responsible if their weapon is used in the committing of a crime and how insurance can play a role in creating more safety for guns and gun owners as a veteran i can attest to the infiltration of our military and not only law enforcement by extremists and extremist groups this must be examined and questioned to decipher the depth of infiltration and at a national level not just local environment our legislature did good work on addressing wildfires and how to support victims of such this last session but we

approach equity 5 i support parents choice because every child is different 6 some charter schools have a chartering entity that is for profit they have management companies that help run them 7 in colorado we receive some federal funding state funding and local funding money could be tied to the child without strings attached from the government i think all of us are looking very closely at what s going on in arizona to see if that experiment works 8 we have science based health and sex education there should be a parental right to opt in or out and or provide instruction at home 9 the

durham refused interview university of colorado regents 1 what are your highest priorities if elected reelected 2 how would you define the purpose of higher education 3 what is your view of affirmative action and the scotus case that will be argued this fall 4 colorado funds higher education at one of the lowest rates in the nation only 6 states are worse how can the system increase revenue or control expenses 5 the regents have been widely criticized for the cu presidential searches can that process be improved 6 do you believe free speech restriction is a problem on colorado college campuses d d endorsed 1 higher education should be a pathway to success from a traditional four year student learning from great books at one campus to an older adult gaining new skills for career advancement at another 2 diversity diversity diversity as the first black woman on the board of regents in more than 4 decades i wish to see the diversity of our state reflected in the student body faculty and administration 3 it is a shame that affirmative action is threatened this campaign dates back to the carter administration when ward connerly a black regent in the university of california system began a long crusade to eliminate affirmative action which he saw as a form of racial discrimination 4 i believe we are 49th or 50th unfortunately there is little that regents can do but work with the legislature to encourage more support 5 i support the appointment of todd saliman the recent searches have been well conducted if there had been more transparency the public perception problems might have been avoided 6 the political rhetoric around this issue is not supported by real experience i m not aware of any student whose conservative viewpoint has been repressed in the classroom r r qualified qualified 1 higher education is to help build better people to allow them to experience things that they haven t experienced in their lives 2 my top priority is to make sure that we have diversity of thought and experience throughout the system we need to prioritize the athletics program to make sure that it s resourced at the very highest levels 3 students benefit from learning from others experiences we share help make us better people diversity makes for a stronger university system 4 it is important for the legislature to better fund our education system it is the largest unprotected pot of money in the state budget regents must make the case well and make it loudly 5 i was involved in the presidential search that recommended mark kennedy partisans outside of the board got a hold of that nomination and decided to sink him i don t think that the process is fundamentally flawed 6 cancel culture exists on college campuses conservatives are the ones most concerned regents need to set an example that we can have productive respectful discussions of philosophical ideas that example should carry through to the administration the faculty and the students d d 1 the purpose of higher education is to enhance people s abilities to function in our society become better contributing members of society 2 to make sure that the people are taking care of the students the faculty and the staff i m going to be considering the effect on people more than i will be on political expediency 3 as long as there has been and are still roadblocks or gatekeeping done to keep minorities from accessing the same services and resources as others we do need some way of balancing 4 since i haven t gotten to the position yet i can t speak specifically on any point 5 my opponent had been heavily involved in forcing through the previous president who was basically run out of town on a rail i would try to bring in as many of the varying community leaders to seek out candidates so that we could have a larger candidate pool of qualified people regardless of their race sex creed or religion 6 it really is more of a legal question as to what kind of limits can the university put in place on any kind of speech being funded by the government r r qualified qualified 1 higher education is there to not only establish specific skills based on a major but it s also there to foster one s ability to make decisions based on critical thinking skills 2 the cost of education making sure the money that is provided to the university is moving to the areas that are most important reaching more students within our state 3 it s not just about people of color or people of a certain identity but it s also about political thought and representation from rural communities farming communities and places that are harder to reach 4 only 5 5 or 5 7 percent of our budget comes from state funding and that has a significant impact on the cost that gets passed on to the students our donor levels are at all time highs when you have a 5 2 billion operating budget there will be opportunities to evaluate expenses 5 it s very difficult for anyone to come out of a contentious search it was unfortunate for president kennedy to go through that this time i think we ended up in a pretty good place 6 i m a strong proponent of free speech if you believe in free speech you ve got to believe that it offers the same opportunity for everybody r r endorsed 1 to prepare students minds for all the awesome possibilities life offers education should provide good value as students move on to work and life after college 2 the highest priority is to make higher education more affordable as i have had a career in higher education i know the value of a strong advising system and this should be a priority 3 affirmative action has been a crude tool with good intentions if affirmative action is not permitted co might look to workable strategies developed elsewhere i e programs that guarantee admission to the top tier of students at all high schools 4 even if co reached the median it would be only about 2 400 more per student we might lower costs by partnering with 2 year colleges to reduce the time and expense at cu administrative costs can be reduced 5 the biggest credibility gap arose from having only one final candidate 6 restriction of

investing washington the u s energy department on thursday announced 36 million for projects addressing toxic waste expected to come from a new generation of nuclear reactors plants the biden administration sees as a crucial to fight climate change the 11 projects funded through the department s arpa e program supporting energy research into high risk but potentially transformational projects aim to accelerate technologies to tackle waste from advanced reactor fuel cycles as the administration aims to launch their deployment the new reactors would likely produce less but more concentrated radioactive waste than today s plants department officials said the projects are trying to get ahead of the waste issue before the reactors become commercial which they hope will happen sometime in the 2030s developing novel approaches to safely manage nuclear waste will enable us to power even more homes and businesses with carbon free nuclear energy said energy secretary jennifer granholm told reuters in a statement the biden administration has sought to spur deployment of the reactors to generate virtually emissions free power and supplement intermittent power sources like wind and solar as states strive to cut emissions causing climate change it also hopes to export the technology one of the recipients of the grants is terrapower an venture founded by billionaire bill gates that hopes to build a 4 billion advanced reactor demonstration plant in wyoming with support from the energy department the venture will receive more than 8 5 million to work on a method for safely recovering uranium from used nuclear fuel that handles the volatility of chloride salts used at high temperatures another project by the idaho national laboratory nyse will get 2 million for demonstrating metal fuel recycling while a project called oklo in california will get 4 million to study the viability of a used nuclear fuel recycling facility other projects include one that turns waste into a dense cement and one that seeks to bury waste deep into the ground many of the projects involve reprocessing waste a technique that not been practiced in the united states for decades due to expense and proliferation concerns an arpa e official said it is not the department s call on whether reprocessing will take place but the projects will help policymakers know what s possible the united states has been competing with china and russia which also hope to build and export advanced reactors nuclear energy accounts for half of the clean electricity generated in the united states some advanced reactors would be fueled by uranium enriched up to 20 a far higher level than today s fuel and which some non proliferation experts say could be a target for militants seeking to make radioactive weapons

legal missouri 2022 the primary group advocating for legal recreational marijuana in the state on friday said it had removed footage of a missouri state highway patrol trooper from a campaign ad after the agency claimed the video violated state law the decision came after the highway patrol sent a cease and desist letter to legal missouri demanding it stop using the footage the agency said the footage included its emblem which has a service mark highway patrol legal counsel kayla kemp wrote in the letter that the agency s registration of its emblem as a service mark prohibits anyone other than the owner of the service mark from using the mark without the patrol s consent as the use of any images featuring the patrol s emblem is unauthorized and a violation of state law legal missouri 2022 needs to immediately cease and desist its use of the patrol s name and emblem in its advertising or any other publication kemp wrote the letter dated oct 19 contained no threat of legal action by the highway patrol the agency would almost certainly run into significant first amendment obstacles in any lawsuit over legal missouri s campaign speech on friday afternoon legal missouri campaign manager john payne indicated the group was removing the footage after saying on thursday that it had licensed the video amendment 3 will allow our missouri law enforcement to focus on fighting serious and violent crime by becoming the 20th state to legalize marijuana obviously the ad we released this week was highly effective in driving that message home but out of respect to the patrol we have swapped out the 3 stock footages they identified in their letter payne said in a statement the missouri state highway patrol sent a cease and desist letter to legal missouri 2022 the first amendment likely would have allowed legal missouri to continue using the footage jefferson city based attorney chuck hatfield said the service mark law isn t meant for using a mark in a first amendment context like this the highway patrol would likely have a stronger argument if its emblem was being used to sell merchandise it s all more bark than bite hatfield said kemp didn t cite the particular law she alleged had been violated kemp ended the letter by writing that the highway patrol respectfully requests that all references including imagery to the patrol be immediately removed from any past and future advertisements legal missouri s ad which has 15 second and 30 second versions argues amendment 3 a proposed amendment to the state constitution to legalize recreational marijuana will aid law enforcement in the ad the words support the police appear on screen as a trooper rides on a motorcycle and a narrator calls the amendment a vote to let the police focus on serious crimes the ad also says the proposal will generate funding for veterans health care and clear non violent marijuana offenses from criminal records missouri will vote on amendment 3 during the nov 8 election
