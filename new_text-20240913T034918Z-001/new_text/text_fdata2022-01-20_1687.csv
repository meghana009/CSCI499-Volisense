milwaukee today wisconsin u s senate candidate alex lasry called for every member of congress and every senate confirmed appointee to be required to either divest or put their assets in a blind trust i agree with the proposals to ban individual stock trades by members of congress but i don t think that they go far enough and leave glaring loopholes said lasry for example many mutual funds focus on specific sectors and subsectors of the economy that move the same way as individual stocks and that would effectively defeat the individual stock trading ban sens mark kelly of arizona and jon ossoff of georgia recently introduced the ban congressional stock trading act that would require congress members their spouses and dependent children to either divest or put their investments into a blind trust within 120 days of assuming office putting assets in a blind trust solves these problems because you have no ability to direct any trades continued lasry i have already committed to putting all of my assets in a blind trust as a member of the senate and i believe all members of congress should be required to as well the democratic primary election for the united states senate will be held tuesday august 9th 2022 for more information about alex lasry s campaign visit www alexlasry com
the board of directors of bawat water technologies ab bawat or the company intends to list the company s shares on the nasdaq first north premier growth market in stockholm and carry out a new issue of units the offering in q1 2022 the proceeds from the offering will be used to support the global commercialisation of bawat s patented heat based solution for the treatment of ballast water to reduce the environmental impact of international shipping bawat was founded in 2011 as a danish greentech engineering company to create an environmentally friendly solution to the problem of ballast water treatment the company s mission is to be the recognized global leader in heat based water treatment technologies for maritime aquacultural and other relevant applications in 2017 bawat received a eur 3 million horizon 2020 eu grant in recognition of the pressing environmental need and innovative nature of the company s solution bawat s patented heat based system to treat ships ballast water received type approval from the international maritime organization in 2019 and recorded its first commercial sale the same year in 2020 the system was also approved by the united states coast guard thus making bawat the first and still only company to receive type approvals from both these regulatory bodies for a heat based ballast water treatment system bawat has transitioned from a start up to a scale up company and is a high growth case based on current order inflow and a solid pipeline for retrofitted solutions to existing ships new ship builds and land based systems the company expects its intake of new orders in 2022 to be at least eur 5 million bawat will provide further guidance in connection with the h1 2022 interim report marcus p hummer bawat s ceo says the public listing of bawat on first north premier is a logical next step for us and is supported by recent news late last year the u s department of transportation chose bawat ahead of some of our largest competitors to set up a land based ballast water reception facility for a test period of one year in the great lakes region this is a stamp of approval from the u s authorities who are looking for better technologies to protect the largest fresh water system in the world this is all the more encouraging because the idea of treating ballast water on shore is a cornerstone in our growth strategy it is a market where we are uniquely positioned because of our technology and one where we can offer ballast water treatment as a service to achieve strong recurring revenues just a few weeks ago we established a new u s based joint venture with bwms reception specialist monstrant viam llc specifically to exploit what we believe are significant opportunities for offering ballast water treatment as a service to marine vessels in the gulf of mexico we also recently received purchase orders for retrofitting our heat based system on two large cruise ships the first orders in a series for the customer as well as two retrofitting purchase orders from a singapore containership owner one of our repeat customers all this comes on top of an otherwise rapidly expanding sales pipeline both for retrofits new ship builds and mobile solutions the proceeds from the ipo will allow us to make the most of this momentum and further strengthen our international sales and marketing presence the problem with ballast water since the introduction of steel hulled vessels water has been used as ballast to stabilize ships at sea when the ship is travelling without cargo or only partially laden it takes in ballast water as additional weight to enable it to operate effectively and safely once new cargo is loaded ballast water is discharged this practice reduces stress on the hull provides stability improves propulsion and manoeuvrability and compensates for weight changes in various cargo load levels and or due to fuel and water consumption however just one cubic metre of ballast water can contain up to 50 000 zooplankton specimens and 10 million phytoplankton cells since most marine species include a planktonic phase in their life cycle there are effectively thousands of different marine species carried in ships ballast water basically anything that is small enough to pass through the water intake pumps this also includes disease causing cholera enterococcus and e coli bacteria when the ship discharges ballast water also called deballasting these transferred species may survive to establish a reproductive population in the new environment often the invader has no natural predator in the new habitat and the original species become extinct thereby disrupting the entire marine ecosystem and reducing local biodiversity the international maritime organization estimates that up to 10 billion tonnes of ballast water are transferred between marine ecosystems each year with an individual ship carrying anything from a few thousand litres to more than 130 000 tonnes depending on the size and purpose of the ship therefore recognising the growing threat to marine ecosystems around the world the imo has adopted the ballast water management convention which aims to prevent spread of harmful aquatic organisms from one ecosystem to another the full implementation of the convention from september 2024 effectively means that all new merchant ships today approximately 1 700 new builds worldwide per year will be delivered with a ballast water treatment system on board another 40 000 existing ships will need to have a ballast water treatment system retrofitted over the coming years furthermore as a result of the implementation and increasing national enforcement of the ballast water management convention bawat believes harbours around the world will see an advantage in being able to offer port side ballast water treatment services for ships that for one reason or another cannot comply bawat is active in all three market segments which the company estimates represent a combined market opportunity of at least usd 10 billion william h burroughs founder and ceo of montrant viam says bawat s solution most ballast water treatment system today are based on land based technologies subsequently adapted for onboard maritime use the current market leading systems employ uv light disinfection or electro chlorination both relatively complex and energy consuming technologies which rely on filtration to be effective against larger organisms such as zooplankton this makes them expensive to operate on a ship and prone to failure furthermore independent studies show that discharged ballast water from electro chlorination systems often contain high residual levels of toxic chemicals in contrast bawat s system used excess heat from the ship s engine to pasteurize ballast water pasteurization is a virtually fool proof way to disinfect and not surprisingly all third party certification tests have confirmed bawat s system to be highly efficient equally important the system does not need filters and is constructed from well known marine components such as standard plate heat exchangers water tanks and pipes this makes the system easy to operate and maintain for crews and provide for significantly lower total cost of ownership over the system s lifetime we are excited about our joint venture with bawat to develop the u s market for ballast water reception and treatment as a service we see growing customer interest as we prepare to deploy equipment and launch service offerings later this year we project that one or more of our barge or shore based facilities will be providing services in every u s port in the coming years and as opposed to other ballast water treatment technologies bawat s system works with a single pass this gives operators freedom to choose whether to treat the ballast water on intake during the voyage or in connection with deballasting klaus nyborg bawat s chairman of the board of directors says our system is by far the most environmentally friendly out there we use virtually no electricity and no chemicals at all but what is probably even more important from a commercial point of view is that our system is the only to be effectively deployed from shore as a result we will launch a business model none of our competitors currently have access to namely ballast water treatment as a service demand is already here and from talks with potential customers there are numerous instances where instead of installing a ballast water treatment system on each ship it would be both easier and cheaper for the operator simply to buy the required ballast water treatment as a service for all his her ships therefore from the end of this year you will start to see floating bawat facilities to treat ballast water in major harbours and maritime hubs around the world the offering in brief should bawat proceed with the ipo the units will be offered to the general public in sweden denmark norway and finland as well as to institutional investors in the nordic countries and abroad the offering is expected to consist of units of new shares and warrants in bawat corresponding to

massimo giachetti istock editorial via getty images this article is part of the charlie munger s portfolio series in which i dive into the legendary investor s top long term investments following my recent coverage of wells fargo company wfc and alibaba group holding limited baba which ranks second and third in munger s portfolio it s about time to explore munger s most significant investment in the bank of america corporation nyse bac the analysis explores the favorable market outlook in 2022 and how the bank s specific orientation supports my buy rating i also have introduced comparisons with the bank s closest peer wfc where necessary as they share similar characteristics results appear to be strong after a depressed 2020 bac stock is currently trading at about 47 up more than 60 from its 52 week low of 29 5 beating the 23 of s p 500 by a wide margin even though the bank has missed its consensus revenue target estimate by 130 million compared to consensus estimates bac in mrq reported better than expected eps at 0 82 in the mrq total revenues have slightly dropped marginally due to a rise in noninterest expense despite the 542 million improvements in credit losses due to the more favorable macroeconomic environment bac is one of the largest banks in the us as it currently maintains 3 17 trillion in total assets and in the last quarter the bank has increased total deposits by 5 reporting a figure of 2 96 trillion unfavorably the bank s efficiency ratio has slightly increased in q4 to 67 from 63 but still considering the improvement in the market outlook it is reasonable to expect that the anticipated boosted revenues will push the efficiency ratio closer to 60 levels in the foreseeable future last but not least the bank has decreased the headcount for a consecutive year and the continued digital transformation is expected to drive operating expenses to new lows which is also reflected by the 46 increase in consumer and small business digital sales favorable outlook for the bank in 2022 with rising inflation and a more robust economic activity the steepening yield curve increases interest rates as a result the banking outlook throughout 2022 remains positive with at least three interest rate hikes anticipated by the federal reserve however the three interest rate hikes as noted by the fed might not be enough and according to jpmorgan s jpm ceo jamie dimon seven hikes might be the number to beat higher interest rates negatively affect valuations earnings and stock prices except in the financial sector a few days ago in a recent tweet i emphasized the s p 500 s 30 year historical patterns which tend to perform strongly as the economy approaches the rate hike cycles which are about to enter early in march bac s net interest income nii which is the spread between its interest income and expense essentially the profit of the bank is expected to be well above 2021 for the current year bac s high asset sensitivity will drive earnings both banks bac and wfc are high asset sensitive banks and are expected to earn a higher yield on their assets loans than their peers however as i have analyzed in an earlier article bac s closest peer wfc is constrained by asset cap regulation and it cannot grow its asset portfolio over the 1 95 trillion limit mark even though wfc still has room to grow its loan base the deposits restriction is a real issue that may affect wfc s lending activity but create a competitive advantage for bac data by ycharts luckily the bank s target market is structured around the consumer segment with 71 of the deposit accounts being non interest bearing which gives the bank substantial float to lend out at higher interest rates at no cost additionally an increase of 1 in short and long term interest rates will boost the bank s net interest income by 6 5 billion as a result banks can borrow money at lower interest rates than they lend expanding their net interest margin even though the company showed yoy growth of banking fees sales and trading revenue over the same period as well the nii is a much more sustainable stream and is likely to be the major contributor to the company s positive outlook the increasing deposit and loan numbers are also strong indicators of the proposed nii growth however it s uncertain what portion of those non interest bearing accounts will leave the bank chasing higher interest or cds it s inherently difficult to make assumptions regarding the stickiness of deposits due to the highly complex interconnections between deposit accounts other banks products consumers relationship with the bank consumers decisions the timing of reaction and other unknowns nevertheless i don t expect this to happen anytime soon unless we see multiple rate hikes at meaningfully higher levels average deposits loans investor bankofamerica com overweight bac over wfc buffett s second largest position locates with bac currently accounting for 14 6 of the overall berkshire hathaway portfolio many analysts have criticized buffett s decision two years ago to sell major stakes in wells fargo company wfc goldman sachs group inc gs jpmorgan chase co jpm and reinvest the proceeds to bac fast forward today comparing the banks performance since april 2020 the s p regional banking etf kre is leading the market whereas wfc and gs follow thus i cannot infer with certainty why buffett entered this move however considering that the master has a long term view i wouldn t be surprised if bac outperforms its peers in the following years data by ycharts buffett s long time friend and business partner charlie munger has also built a strong position in the stock since berkshire s through his vehicle daily journal corp djco he has allocated approximately 40 of the total portfolio s assets in bac owning the stock since 2013 charlie has entered this investment very early and paid an estimated average price of around 15 57 which suggests an unrealized gain of nearly 300 and a cagr of roughly 15 buffett and munger are both known for holding stocks for decades and considering the improved earnings environment i don t expect them to sell anytime soon charlie munger s portfolio daily journal corp whalewisdom com valuation seems high on a relative basis at the time of writing bac is fairly traded at almost 47 leading the banking sector along with jpm in terms of p b valuation multiple specifically the bank s multiple of 1 56x remains 18 7 higher than the industry s median of 1 34x however considering the promising earnings outlook throughout 2022 the stock is about to break at new highs bac s target price of 57 implies a 22 upside to determine the fair value fv of the bank i used a five year dual valuation model and below are the critical assumptions used in my model the first part incorporates the annual book value per share and i have applied a 4 yearly growth rate after that similarly for annual deps i have used a conservative earnings growth of 7 5 for the next five years finally by assigning equal weight 50 each i arrive at an fv estimate of 57 which implies a 22 upside from current share price levels for the medium term bac fair value valuation model created by author using data from seeking alpha and ycharts ycharts com share buyback program remains strong bac for 2021 returned over 31 7 billion as part of the company s initiative to return shareholders excess capital breaking into 25 1 billion in share buybacks and another 6 6 billion in dividends paid as a result this will decrease its outstanding shares and increase its eps and resource utilization ratios such as roe and rotce additionally the company also has declared a quarterly dividend of 0 21 per share for common stockholders and 1 75 per share on the 7 cumulative redeemable preferred stock series b adding further attractive values for potential future investors during the goldman sachs us financial services conference in december the company s ceo brian moynihan said that bac is back in growth mode as the pandemic has eased and the overall market is back on track one more thing bac s track record of increasing revenues at a greater rate than its expenses is a testament to its ability to achieve and enhance operational efficiencies with the worldwide industrial digital transformation underway bac may leverage cloud based technology to introduce further efficiency into its operations and reach even better cost effectiveness bac s partnership with ibm is likely to be a critical factor in this regard as over 70 of the company s clients are already actively using digital channels conclusion the two macro catalysts for bac to start breaking into new time highs are the economic recovery becoming evident and interest rates increasing as the economy recovers the bank would benefit from the more robust earnings environment the wider net interest margins and the improvement in the credit outlook reaffirming my buy rating for bac in the medium term

continuously soaring pulp futures prices on the shanghai bourse and disruptions to supply have spurred suppliers to seek big hikes for bleached softwood and hardwood kraft pulp bsk and bhk in china over the past two weeks canadian northern bsk nbsk has seen the most aggressive movement with pricing apparently escalating on the heels of bsk futures bsk futures levels for the most traded may contract sp 2205 settled at rmb 6 278 per tonne on thursday equivalent to 857 per tonne after deducting 13 vat and rmb 120 per tonne logistics costs that is a surge of rmb 312 per tonne 49 per tonne from early january domestic resale bsk whose prices have been pegged to futures have climbed rmb 340 per tonne clocking in at rmb 6 392 per tonne that is equivalent to 866 per tonne minus vat and rmb 150 per tonne logistics costs with futures levels shooting up suppliers priced canadian nbsk this week at 830 870 per tonne with the product not designated for futures delivery sold toward the low end of the spread and those accepted for delivery priced at 850 870 per tonne nordic nbsk standstill may not last long prices for canadian nbsk hit 830 850 per tonne up 60 90 per tonne over the past two weeks nordic nbsk has remained at 740 780 per tonne as major producers have not yet decided prices for the next round s offers the mid point for nbsk has thus come to 800 per tonne up 40 per tonne however the standstill for nordic nbsk may not last long the ilim group raised russian bsk prices 70 per tonne earlier this week taking the list level for the grade to 840 per tonne surveyed russian bsk has closed at 800 840 per tonne a jump of 60 70 per tonne on friday arauco followed suit announcing the same 70 per tonne rise for radiata pine taking its list price to 840 per tonne as well radiata pine has been steady so far at 740 770 per tonne the chilean producers have also raised 50 per tonne for bhk and 20 per tonne for unbleached softwood kraft pulp pulp buyers seek opportunities on futures market contacts indicated that most of the buyers who paid current prices for nbsk tonnage were seeking arbitrage and hedging opportunities on the futures markets rather than planning to use it for the production of end products the same pattern has been seen for russian bsk which is sold entirely to chinese traders when nbsk prices exceeded 800 per tonne we were skeptical said a merchant continuously rising pulp prices have worsened the mismatch between pulp and paper prices traders have no incentive to stock up on such expensive pulp for selling on to end users he added that deep pocketed large mills are still capable of getting volumes as they are still receiving bsk cargoes they ordered previously when prices were lower in october last year bsk prices plunged by more than 100 tonne in the wake of crumbling futures consequent to mandated downtime across the country as the chinese government sought to curb energy consumption the low price window lasted for about a month and then pulp prices rebounded in force end users who missed the boat are now facing a harsh situation the virgin fiber based paper and board p b market is plagued with overcapacity and fundamental demand is weak lamented a major tissue producer it is not likely manufacturers can implement p b price increases especially for tissue products in the near future to absorb extra pulp costs and i believe pulp prices will get increasingly volatile going forward most major p b producers are keeping a close watch on the futures market but are not keen to participate in it traders have been more active in futures activities as they find it useful in managing risk suzano hikes bhk other suppliers expected to follow on thursday brazilian juggernaut suzano announced a 50 per tonne rise for bhk in china and other asian markets other suppliers are expected to follow suit the increase would bring bhk levels most sellers offer from 600 per tonne to 650 per tonne price talks are underway south america bhk levels have been steady so far standing at 580 600 per tonne while futures have been giving momentum to bsk prices the bhk segment has been affected chiefly by late deliveries of cargoes from south america the logistics problems take place on both ends of shipment in brazil and in china a brazilian producer pointed out at the brazilian ports where our pulp cargoes are loaded onto the vessels the queuing time is seeing an extra two weeks due to congestion in china the queuing time for vessels to unload cargoes at port also needs an additional two weeks due to the country s strict measures on containing civid 19 for example a harbor pilot who boards an inbound vessel to steer it for docking at a berth is required to be quarantined for two weeks as the vessels are considered foreign territory so port operations in china face staffing problems and are less efficient as a result of the delays south america suppliers have been dealing with current delivery troubles and also with backlogs that have built up since they started the bhk we are selling this month is supposedly for february shipments but the reality is that it is likely to be shipped out in march the supplier contact added but meanwhile large previously ordered amounts of south american bhk have been arriving in china and getting unloaded at various ports a welcome relief for buyers

with the ossoff kelly bill forcing violators to forfeit their congressional salary and the hawley bill requiring them to forfeit their investment income to the treasury all of the bills allow lawmakers to put their assets in a blind trust rather than divest from their stocks ethics experts see the blind trust as the best way to effectively end stock trading without forcing lawmakers to sell their assets but they warn that without robust enforcement it could lead to the worst case scenario where the public doesn t know what the investments are but the member does lawmakers will have to decide which bill is the most effective at addressing the problem and convince congressional leaders to get on board pelosi recently directed rep zoe lofgren d calif chairwoman of the house

for four years the phrase infrastructure week was a punchline a metaphor for the abysmal failure that was supposed to be donald trump s signature legislative achievement it took joe biden less than a year to make good on a transformational piece of legislation that will reshape america s cities towns and communities if biden achieved little else for the rest of his term the enactment of the bipartisan infrastructure investment and jobs act would be enough to cement his record for tangibly improving the lives of americans and yet i can t help but think that biden has been short changed in how his first year has been framed by the mainstream media which has largely been guided by the playbook of politics as usual advertisement in the 2016 campaign the media gave trump the equivalent of 2 billion in free media coverage during his presidency the white house press briefings when they happened were aired live on every cable news network despite the fact that they were littered with outright lies and deceptions the very few times that trump managed to restrain himself he was rewarded with embarrassing praise for the better part of the summer and fall of 2021 the beltway press bombarded audiences with inside baseball process stories parsing every twist and turn of the infrastructure legislation fanning the flames of the democrats in disarray narrative as the focus shifted to the build back better plan and voting rights legislation the media narrative largely gave the republican party s unanimous obstruction a free pass the jan 18 edition of politico s playbook led with the phrase senate democrats resume their doomed push on voting rights and election reform axios featured the headline biden s epic failures biden s forceful speech on voting rights in atlanta was overshadowed by the media s fixation on the gop s faux indignation what the media needs to remember is that the only reason why they are issues in the first place is because of the republican party a party that has made the conscious decision to withdraw from democracy i am not suggesting that the mainstream media adopt the propaganda level machinations of the gop media sphere but i do think media institutions have huge influence in shaping public perception and how that perception is weaponized by the anti democratic forces in america consider this passage from an associated press story that was published recently former president donald trump who regularly pilloried the media did 92 interviews in his first year in office more than two dozen of those with friendly interlocutors at fox news but trump also held lengthy sessions with abc news the associated press the new york times reuters and other outlets whose coverage he impugned throughout his presidency missing from this analysis the fact that during his four years in office trump made more than 30 500 false or misleading claims otherwise called lies by this point in his presidency trump had made 2 140 false or misleading claims advertisement would biden be better off with the media if he did 92 interviews each and every one of them full of blatant lies is there a single person in this country who worries about how many interviews biden has done or is it more likely that americans care about the roads they drive on every day and the pipes carrying their drinking water for decades we ve heard the familiar refrain it s the economy stupid so let s look at the economy under biden jobless claims are at their lowest levels since the 1960s the 2021 job increases were the largest on record unemployment dipped below 4 a historic drop from the 6 2 rate biden inherited just a year ago the s p 500 the metric the last guy used to measure success hit new record highs 70 times finishing up 29 the dow jones and nasdaq were up 19 and 21 respectively economists are predicting that the growth will continue at the fastest pace since 1984 of course inflation is concerning but the way the media is framing things you would think that our economy is mired in a great depression when we ve come through the biggest job creation in a year in the country s history there is no question that we live in challenging times a growing economy doesn t overshadow the assault on democratic processes or the continued and changing covid pandemic there are clearly times when biden and his administration will fall short either because he fails to read the desires of the broad electorate or because he can t get enough support for popular policies through the bitterly partisan narrowly divided congress his missteps and failures are fair targets of media criticism but the media needs to understand that the republican party s obstruction of biden policies cannot be severed from its embrace of trump s big lie about the stolen election the gop isn t engaged in policy debates about how to benefit american lives instead its leaders both at the state and federal level are spending much of their time trying to weaken democratic processes every media story that fails to come to grips with this reality helps promote that anti democracy agenda advertisement kurt bardella is a contributing writer to opinion he is an advisor to the democratic national committee and the democratic congressional campaign committee he is a former senior advisor to republicans on the house oversight committee

accurate affordable and deceptively lightweight when used in the field this could be the ideal workhorse estate rifle reckons bruce potts the ideal workhorse estate rifle the vanguard range from weatherby rifles was born from the need to produce an affordable version of roy weatherby s mark v actioned magnum rifle howa from japan was assigned to manufacture the new vanguard action and it continues to be an utterly reliable and accurate estate rifle in its own right today often seen as a poor man s weatherby it is actually no such thing this vanguard action adorns a whole range of rifles in the weatherby range and they all come with a sub moa less than 1in at 100 yards accuracy guarantee take a look at our list of the best binoculars for hunting this new high country incarnation is clearly american with its classic monte carlo stock design of new polymer construction to cope with any weather it carries a slimline fluted barrel profile so has been designed as a rifle ready for hard use and long treks in the high country this is coupled with a new 6 5prc precision rifle cartridge from hornady designed for flat shooting long range shots so what relevance for the british shooter then the price point of 1 199 offers good value for money considering weatherby howa s proven track record of durability and accuracy it handles nicely and with the ultra durable flat dark earth cerakote finish on the metalwork and synthetic stock it s certainly a working rifle a reliable estate rifle perhaps finally the combination of the 6 5mm bullet with the short magnum cartridge case is equally as useful in britain for shots on the hill in windy conditions and for making some of the heavier lead free bullets expand reliably on british deer species need to know manufacturer weatherby model vanguard high country type bolt action overall length 44½in barrel length 24in ½ inch unef muzzle thread length of pull 13¾in weight 7 15lb finish cerakote to all metalwork read what is cerakote calibre 6 5prc precision rifle cartridge stock sporter synthetic magazine 3 shot detachable scope mounts none drilled and tapped for mounts talley used on test trigger two stage adjustable price srp is 1 199 importer raytrade ltd 01635 253344 in depth that stock instantly sets the visual appeal and handling characteristics it feels extremely natural with the 7 15lb weight evenly distributed even when fitted with a scope and moderator as the pivot point is right on the front of the magazine the stock design is classic weatherby monte carlo with a hard polymer cheekpiece adding to the longevity and in field durability while remaining rigid and lightweight both ideal hunting rifle traits the right side palm swell and textured forearm add grip but the deep bordering groove to these panels does bite your hand under recoil i like the soft rubber recoil pad to help with magnum recoil and the black background with tan and green accents to the stock is effective as overall camouflage too interestingly the stock is not cut to fully float the barrel and has a pressure point at the tip common to this range of rifles and keeps a constant pressure point for accuracy the hammer forged barrel is slim number 2 profile 0 600in at the muzzle hence the high country designation for long treks without fatigue it is a sensible 24in needed for the new 6 5prc cartridge velocities and has a 1 in 8in rifling twist rate to handle all bullet weights and guaranteed sub moa accuracy from a cold barrel i like the six fluted barrel design to further reduce weight and allow cooling best of all is the flat dark earth cerakote finish that surrounds the action offering an ultra tough barrier to water and dirt with good scratch resistant properties too the vanguard one piece forged and machined action offers an integral recoil lug for strength and uniform bedding the machined bolt body has a recessed bolt face fully encapsulating the cartridge for additional safety the bolt has two opposed locking lugs and a large m16 style extractor that never fails weatherby has even thought about fluting the bolt for a smoother operation due to less bearing surface quickly detachable the three shot polymer magazine in 6 5prc cartridge has a small but effective release catch set into the stock at the front i also like the trigger and safety system with a three way safety catch with the middle position allowing a safe position but bolt operation to clear the chamber the trigger is adjustable but set at the factory this two stage unit broke cleanly at a sensibly safe 3 75lb field test with the gpo evolve scope and sound moderator fitted the high country still handled and balanced well and when slung on the shoulder was hardly noticeable the 6 5prc ballistics are for a 143 gr bullet at 2 960fps and 2 782ft lb and can be seen as a magnum version of the 6 5 creedmoor round offering 200fps and 250fps more velocity factory 6 5prc ammo is hard to come by but i had some hornady 143 gr hunter eld x and hornady 147 gr match which shot 2 835fps 2 553ft lb and 2 696fps 2 372ft lb respectively and all groups offering round the moa mark i found it a tad low on velocity so i bought some reload dies and started to pep up the loads a little best were the 100 gr fox lead free with 60 grains of norma 204 powder for 3 336fps 2 471ft lb and inch groups while 120 gr gmx lead free bullets shot 0 95in at 100 yards with a load of 56 0 grains of n555 powder for 3 101fps 2 563ft lb and 143 gr eld xs shot sub moa with a load of 55 grains of ramshot hunter for 2 929fps 2 724ft lb we had some chinese water deer to sort over christmas during the rut so zeroed 1in high at 100 yards we knew this weatherby would be a capable flat shooter on the long buckinghamshire fields sure enough an absolute cracking buck emerged chasing a doe across the cereal field at 225 yards no problem my son jake braced on his knees to keep above the vegetation height and dropped the medal buck in his tracks first blood to the high country and new 6 5prc round conclusion i was impressed both with the accuracy and handling of the high country especially in the field where muddy conditions and cold weather did not hamper its progress i also liked the new 6 5prc cartridge which could offer some interesting possibilities for tough stags at longer range with suitable lead free 6 5mm bullets

american century investments has announced the launch of the american century global small cap fund in australia via a unit trust structure the global investment manager which manages nearly 3 billion on behalf of institutional and intermediary investors in australia said the fund uses a fundamental bottom up investment process that aims to provide superior risk adjusted returns over the long term it will provide local wholesale investors with additional investment opportunities they may not otherwise be able to access according to senior portfolio manager trevor gurwich we utilise a distinct approach to growth investing which we believe takes advantage of persistent market inefficiencies and opens up a broader set of opportunities than a traditional growth approach he said it is an opportune time to be launching the fund in the australian market particularly given the positive outlook for small cap earnings growth and attractive small cap valuations relative to large caps the actively managed portfolio is predominantly composed of listed global small cap equities and uses the msci acwi small cap net aud index as its benchmark with a minimum suggested investment time frame of at least five years american century which recently hired a new head of esg said that material esg issues and corporate governance practices are taken into account by the fund it seeks to avoid companies that fail to meet fundamental responsibilities in areas such as human rights labour environment and anti corruption and those with exposure to controversial weapons cluster munitions and tobacco mr gurwich said the small cap sector continued to provide attractive stock selection opportunities as the stay at home theme became less prevalent global small caps poised to benefit from the return to normality include travel and leisure companies albeit the emergence of the omicron variant has created hesitancy he said we also see continued demand for robust it spending with companies realising that it investment is critical to their success in a hybrid world

debate among kansas city council members grew heated wednesday during a finance governance and public safety committee meeting over a proposed ordinance to continue funding development projects in midtown using tax increment financing tif sponsored by at large councilwoman katheryn shields and councilman eric bunch the ordinance directs city manager brian platt to use surplus money generated by tif to support midtown developments including a 105 million project by chicago based developer mac properties along main street and armour boulevard councilwoman melissa robinson who represents the 3rd district took issue with that part of the proposal which would help offset the costs of 385 apartments along the expanded streetcar route instead robinson introduced a committee substitute that would direct two thirds of the available funds to the city s housing trust fund a program meant to preserve and increase the city s affordable housing stock we neglected to do that she said instead we re giving one developer the exclusive opportunity to utilize the city s dollars to displace poor residents who are unable to afford mac properties rent in the end the committee moved to allocate a third of the tif funds to the city s housing trust fund which shields said she supported the updated ordinance was approved by a 3 2 vote and now moves to the full council for debate robinson said she was unhappy with the outcome of the meeting which at times led to heated exchanges at one point shields was heard to utter a barnyard epithet we re writing checks to developers who refuse to ensure properties are affordable robinson said i am incensed at what happend at city council today the midtown redevelopment tax increment financing plan was approved in december 1992 with the goal of eliminating blight growing the city s tax base increasing employment preserving existing housing and constructing new residential housing generally tax increment financing or tif uses property and other taxes generated by a new development to pay for construction and improvement costs it s one of several tax incentive programs that developers can apply for to offset the costs of their proposed development projects the midtown redevelopment plan expires in april 2023 when that happens kansas city will be able to collect property and sales taxes generated from the midtown tif district amounting to about 1 8 million the ordinance offers guidance on how the city should use that money one third would go to the city s rehabilitation assistance for midtown properties ramp program which provides financial assistance to homeowners to maintain and rehabilitate their homes using tif funding another third would go toward the development of new residential units within the midtown tif district the ordinance proposes that city manager platt use the planned industrial expansion authority a tax incentive agency to help fund the proposed mac properties development the ordinance proposes contributing no more than 526 051 per year over 20 years amounting to about 10 5 million under the original ordinance the remaining third of the money would have been used to subsidize renters living in the tif district that section of the ordinance was replaced with language to direct a third of the money to the housing trust fund opposition to the ordinance robinson said the city is continuing to make it more difficult for people to afford to live in kansas city she said that continuing to invest in the kind of development mac properties is proposing is a slap in the face to unhoused residents in the city we continue to vote in ways that are incongruent to how we say we want our city to grow and what we want our city to be and what the identity is of kansas city robinson said the tenant union kc tenants has criticized shields ordinance for proposing to give more money to mac properties which already owns many apartment buildings in midtown it s money that comes from taxpayers money said briana van deusen a member of kc tenants referring to the use of tax incentives to fund the mac properties development we re basically funding our own displacement and none of the apartments that they re building are going to be truly affordable we re not going to be able to live there van deusen a midtown resident for most of her adult life was one of several kc tenants members who attended the committee meeting she said kc tenants supported robinson s committee substitute to divert funds to the housing trust fund we don t want another developer coming in and displacing the people that actually make midtown what it is she said

but because esg risks tend to be evaluated and understood at the individual security level it can be challenging for multi asset managers to address esg considerations while still maintaining returns and portfolio diversification the reality is that each asset class carries very different esg related risks and characteristics complicating the portfolio construction process a key question for investors is how much esg risk reduction can be achieved through asset allocation alone to help come up with an answer we created a model portfolio with volatility traditional risk similar to a typical 60 40 balanced portfolio we focused only on the equity allocation as this is arguably the key driver of multi asset portfolio return the equity universe also has much broader esg coverage than fixed income with ratings widely available across capitalisation ranges styles and geographies we then varied the desired esg risk exposure and evaluated the resulting return penalty to a series of efficient portfolios since our goal was to show what asset allocation alone can do to mitigate esg risk we didn t adjust further to account for sector allocation geography and security selection modest allocation changes helped reduce esg risk first we found it is possible to reduce the portfolio s esg risk using asset allocation alone in other words without considering the esg risks or benefits of any individual securities the model portfolio s esg risk could be reduced without giving up much return potential for example a 10 per cent esg risk reduction considered a reasonable portfolio construction goal is achievable with a modest return give up however the allocation changes aren t inconsequential and more significant esg risk reduction undoubtedly requires more substantial allocation changes for instance when decreasing the esg risk the model portfolio shifted from value equity into core and then into growth and there was also a preference for real estate investment trusts reits over other equities this reflects the more attractive esg risk profiles of reits and us large cap growth equities relative to value interestingly a position in emerging markets equities eme is maintained until the esg risk reduction goal becomes quite high so while eme looks unattractive in esg terms in isolation its return profile is compelling relative to its esg risk the result is that for all but the most esg risk averse portfolios eme may provide an attractive trade off for the exposure taken the graphic below illustrates the trade off in return versus esg risk for a given level of volatility standard deviation it shows the extent to which reducing esg risk using asset allocation strategies alone increasingly penalises portfolio return figure 1 reducing esg risk through asset allocation requires a return trade off source american century investments hypothetical illustration results not intended to represent any actual investment strategy past performance is no guarantee of future results as above the graphic depicts a hypothetical equity allocation in an efficient 60 40 stock bond portfolio created using american century s own capital market risk and return assumptions and sustainalytics esg asset class scores this graphic illustrates the return trade off required to achieve a given degree of esg risk reduction notably the trade off is nonlinear initially a modest reduction in esg risk allows some asset substitutions such as introducing reits in place of other equities which carry little return penalty specifically we see that we can realise a 10 per cent improvement in esg risk with relatively modest allocation changes while giving up only 11 basis points of return this is designated portfolio b however as we seek to lower esg risk more meaningfully we must introduce less favourable trade offs such as forcing out mid cap equity and eme as a result the efficient frontier in figure 1 steepens penalising return at an increasing rate as we lower esg risk see points designated portfolios c and d the shape of this curve highlights the extent to which naïve attempts to reduce esg risk through asset allocation alone may be undesirable the implication is clear asset allocation presents opportunities to fine tune portfolio level esg risk which can be modestly reduced through allocation adjustments with comparatively little return give up but more aggressive esg risk reduction requires increasingly severe asset substitution and return penalties as a result an integrated approach that includes individual security and manager selection is the best way to reduce esg risk rich weiss cio multi asset strategies at american century investments want to hear more about esg secure your place at the investordaily 2022 esg summit now
federal courts closed out 2021 with a flurry of securities decisions in the month of december in this update we discuss two decisions involving claims under section 10 b of the securities exchange act of 1934 and rule 10b 5 based on i alleged channel stuffing a company s practice of shipping excessive product to its distributors and recognizing revenue at the time of and on such shipments when it believes the distributors will not be able to sell all such product in the particular period and ii an allegedly over hyped covid 19 vaccine candidate in in re hain celestial group inc securities litigation the u s court of appeals for the second circuit revived section 10 b claims based on allegations that a company defrauded investors by making public statements attributing growing sales to strong consumer demand without disclosing that it achieved its sales through unsustainable channel stuffing the court below dismissed the claims determining that the channel stuffing was legitimate and non fraudulent as the court explained plaintiffs failed to plead that the company offered distributors an absolute right to return products therefore the company did not improperly book sales achieved through channel stuffing as revenue according to the court the company had no obligation to disclose legal sales incentives simply because plaintiffs alleged that they were unsustainable the second circuit however reversed based on a perceived flaw in the district court s reasoning its failure to consider whether although there was no actionable allegation of channel stuffing in violation of rule 10b 5 a and c the company should have disclosed that its high sales volume was achieved in part through unsustainable channel stuffing to avoid rendering statements attributing its sales to strong consumer demand misleading in violation of rule 10b 5 b hain is notable for its exposition of the subsections of rule 10b 5 as well as the possibility that future plaintiffs may wield the decision to advocate for a broadened duty to disclose unsustainable business practices contrary to prior second circuit precedent in in re vaxart inc securities litigation the u s district court for the northern district of california allowed section 10 b claims to survive a motion to dismiss based on allegations involving two press release headlines one about a company s purported selection for operation warp speed the other about a third party s ability to manufacture and distribute a billion or more doses of vaccine even though the text of the releases clarified the assertions the court concluded that in light of the presentation a reasonable investor would have been misled into believing the company was on the precipice of developing a successful covid 19 vaccine the decision illustrates the liability risks that may arise from undue emphasis and gloss in public statements nonetheless the court arguably erred in brushing aside the significance of clarifying information and disclaimers contained in the text of the press releases i in re hain celestial group second circuit revives section 10 b claims based on non fraudulent channel stuffing a background channel stuffing generally refers to a company s practice of flood distribution channels by employing incentives to induce customers into purchasing their products in large quantities creating a short term bump in revenue and excess supply in the distribution chain channel stuffing may involve efforts to move sales to an earlier quarter by offering distributors incentives such as discounts or favorable credit terms to take on extra inventory the practice is not inherently fraudulent or illegal because a seller might have a realistic hope that stuffing the channel of distribution would incite his distributors to more vigorous efforts to sell the stuff lest it pile up in inventory as some courts have recognized channel stuffing is fraudulent only when used to book revenues on the basis of goods shipped but not really sold because the buyer can return them in that situation the sales are effectively sales on consignment which accounting rules do not permit to be booked as revenue hain involved alleged channel stuffing at the hain celestial group inc a publicly traded company that manufactures and markets organic and natural products in the mid 2010s hain was struggling to meet revenue targets and wall street projections due to increased competition in response hain allegedly sought to ramp up quarterly sales by offering distributors discounts and financial incentives to take on more product as well as an absolute right to return any unsold goods the following quarter hain ceased its practices of channel stuffing in mid 2016 after an audit identified it as a potential accounting issue in august 2016 hain announced it would be delaying release of its 2016 financial results and not meeting revenue targets after which its share price fell by 26 and in november 2016 the company announced that its audit committee had completed an internal review into concessions with respect to certain distributors in the united states although the review found no evidence of intentional wrongdoing in connection with financial statements the company announced it had begun to implement a remediation plan to strengthen its internal controls and organization in the course of these events hain investors filed putative class actions alleging securities fraud which were consolidated before the late judge arthur d spatt of the u s district court for the eastern district of new york on august 4 2017 lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint asserting claims against hain and its current and former executives under sections 10 b and 20 a of the exchange act and rule 10b 5 among other things plaintiffs alleged that defendants misled investors by failing to disclose that they were misclassifying inventory forced onto distributors as revenue and their conduct constituted a device scheme or artifice to defraud and act practice or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit in violation of subsections a and c of rule 10b 5 the defendants moved to dismiss evaluating the motion the district court concluded that plaintiffs did not allege sufficient facts with particularity to support an inference that hain offered its distributors an absolute right to return the products a prerequisite for channel stuffing to constitute a fraud further the court found that the value of the returns if any was quite insignificant hain s 2016 10 k disclosed that any accounting errors were immaterial therefore this was not a situation where a material amount of sales were improperly booked as revenue concluding that hain s channel stuffing was neither fraudulent nor illegal the court dismissed the claims but granted plaintiffs leave to amend on may 6 2019 plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint adding details about hain s subsequent settlement with the sec and information from confidential witnesses plaintiffs also changed their primary theory of liability from alleging a fraudulent channel stuffing scheme under rule 10b 5 subsections a and c to alleging that the defendants failed to disclose purportedly unsustainable business practices in violation of section 10 b and rule 10b 5 b under their refined theory plaintiffs alleged that defendants misled investors by among other things making public statements attributing hain s high sales volume to strong consumer demand while omitting that its sales volume was achieved in part due to the offer of unsustainable channel stuffing incentives despite the twist the court held that plaintiffs failed to remedy the fatal defect of the prior complaint i e failure to adequately allege that distributors had an absolute right of return to the contrary hain s settlement with the sec exonerated defendants failing to mention any distributor return right and concluding that one of the incentives offered by hain to distributors was improper and he vast majority of the products ultimately sold through to retailers in the court s view defendants had no duty to disclose wholly legal sales incentives simply because plaintiffs alleged those incentives to be unsustainable the district court thus dismissed the complaint a second time this time with prejudice plaintiffs appealed b the decision a panel of the second circuit reversed as the court explained subsections a b and c of rule 10b 5 prohibit three different things subsections a and c are similar in that they prohibit the employ any device scheme or artifice to defraud and engag in any act practice or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit respectively subsection b by contrast focuses not on schemes devices or practices but on statements made rendering it unlawful o make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made not misleading unlike a and c subsection b does not require that the defendant have used a fraudulent or otherwise illegal device scheme artifice act practice or course of business rather ts focus is on whether something said was materially misleading either because it included a false statement of a material fact or because it omitted to state a material fact which omission rendered the things said misleading the flaw in the district court s analysis the second circuit explained was that it mistakenly imported the requirement of clauses a and c of a fraudulent scheme or practice into clause b which includes no such requirement it was not enough for the lower court to conclude that the channel stuffing itself was not a fraudulent or deceptive device scheme artifice act or practice under subsections a and c because subsection b still may require disclosure of non fraudulent acts to avoid rendering other statements materially misleading in this case the company s statements attributing its sales growth to strong consumer demand the success of such a complaint in alleging a violation of clause b does not depend on whether the alleged channel stuffing practices themselves were fraudulent or otherwise illegal in light of the perceived error the court remanded the case directing a newly assigned judge to consider afresh whether the complaint adequately stated a claim under rule 10b 5 b c implications the takeaway from hain is that a company may need to disclose legal non fraudulent conduct which constitutes neither a device scheme or artifice to defraud nor an act practice or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit to avoid running afoul of rule 10b 5 b at first blush this result may appear surprising in light of the supreme court s 2019 decision in lorenzo v sec which held conversely that conduct that does not violate subsection b nonetheless may violate subsections a and c in lorenzo the court suggested that subsections a and c are broader than b explaining that they capture a wide range of conduct and are sufficiently broad to encompass deceptive conduct that does not fall within the scope of b such as dissemination of a false statement made by another person the supreme court in lorenzo however did not address whether there may be instances in which legal non fraudulent conduct must be disclosed to prevent the corporation s other statements from being misleading indeed it is well established in the second circuit and elsewhere that hen a corporation does make a disclosure whether it be voluntary or required there is a duty to make it complete and accurate nonetheless the second circuit in hain arguably misconceived the decision below by characterizing it as import the requirement of clauses a and c of a fraudulent scheme or practice into clause b rather the district court directly addressed plaintiffs allegations under subsection b explaining that defendants were under no generalized obligation to disclose wholly legal sales incentives simply because the lead plaintiffs allege those incentives to be unsustainable the district court explained that a company has no duty to paint its conduct in a negative light up to a point companies must be permitted to operate with a hopeful outlook and one has no duty to disparage its own competitive position in the market where it has provided accurate hard data from which analysts and investors can draw their own conclusions about the company s condition and the value of its own stock previously embracing these principles the second circuit once easily rejected the theory of fraud advanced in hain refusing to impose liability based on a company s alleged failure to acknowledge the long term unsustainability of its business model as for the contention that hain was required to disclose its channel stuffing because it publicly attributed its sales to other factors such as consumer demand the district court disposed of that argument as well the court explained that companies are not required to disclose all information concerning the source of success every time they put the topic of the cause of financial success at issue where a company puts at issue the cause of its financial success it may mislead investors if the company fails to disclose that a material source of its success is the use of improper or illegal business practices in this case there was nothing improper or illegal to disclose the second circuit did not address these points nor did it purport to abrogate the precedent cited in the district court s analysis rather the court reversed solely on a perceived and debatable flaw in the district court s reasoning in import the requirements of subsection a and c into b and remanded so that a newly assigned judge could consider the motion to dismiss afresh thus hain could be a mere bump in the road on the way to ultimate dismissal of plaintiffs claims and its significance should not be overstated still it is possible that future plaintiffs may attempt to wield hain more broadly for example by arguing that it expands an issuer s duty to identify allegedly unsustainable business practices despite precedent to the contrary therefore how other courts approach the decision including the district court on remand will be worth watching ii in re vaxart district court permits section 10 b claims based on hyped covid 19 vaccine candidate a background vaxart inc a publicly traded vaccine development company struggled for years to bring a vaccine to the market that ostensibly changed after the onset of the covid 19 pandemic with vaxart announcing a program to develop a covid 19 vaccine based on a proprietary oral vaccine platform apparently buoying vaxart s prospects the federal government announced in may 2020 operation warp speed an effort to support multiple covid 19 vaccine candidates to speed up development by early june news reports identified multiple companies selected to receive federal funding under operation warp speed including pfizer and moderna and speculation mounted as to which other companies such as vaxart could be next in line amid the speculation vaxart doubled down on publicity touting its vaccine development progress on june 15 2020 the company announced the appointment of a new ceo to accelerate advancement of covid 19 and other programs and touted its development of what could be the most effective and most convenient covid 19 vaccine on june 24 vaxart trumpeted the addition of its stock to the russell 3000 index as well as its ongoing effort to disrupt the vaccine industry by developing a transformative oral covid 19 vaccine the next day vaxart announced a memorandum of understanding with attwill medical solutions to manufacture and distribute its vaccine which according to the press release headline enable production of a billion or more covid 19 vaccine doses per year on june 26 the company issued a press release titled vaxart s covid 19 vaccine selected for the u s government s operation warp speed the text of the release however stated only that its vaccine candidate had been selected to participate in a non human primate nhp challenge study organized and funded by operation warp speed vaxart s stock price rose 28 after the announcement the wave of positive publicity soon came to an end on july 25 the new york times published an article stating that ome officials at the department of health and human services have grown concerned about whether companies including vaxart are trying to inflate their stock prices by exaggerating their roles in warp speed the same day the department of health and human services hhs sent out a tweet clarifying that it had entered into funding agreements with certain vaccine manufacturers and was negotiating with others but either is the case with vaxart over the next three weeks the vaxart s stock price dropped 18 shareholder litigation ensued in the u s district court for the northern district of california with plaintiffs alleging that vaxart and its executives made materially misleading statements about vaxart s prospects in violation of sections 10 b and 20 a of the exchange act and rule 10b 5 the defendants moved to dismiss b the decision the district court hon vince chhabria denied the motion to dismiss as to vaxart and its executives at the outset the court explained that whether a statement is materially misleading in violation of rule 10b 5 should be evaluated through a fisheye not a telescope words cannot be viewed in complete isolation rather they must be read in light of all the information then available to the market to decide if they conveyed a false or misleading impression thus statements that are literally true on their face may nonetheless be misleading when considered in context circumstance setting and even manner of presentation all matter applying these principles the court ruled that plaintiffs plausibly alleged a section 10 b violation based on the announcement that vaxart had been elected for the u s government s operation warp speed the court acknowledged that the full press release clarified that vaxart was selected to participate in a primate study it did not mention receipt of federal funding yet in the court s view the headline alone would have plausibly misled a reasonable investor just as words matter so too does manner of presentation the court moreover inferred that defendants intentionally deceived investors because vaxart allegedly knew the truth long before the press release and later toned down its public description of its involvement in warp speed stating only that it had been selected for a preclinical program the court also found that the complaint adequately pled loss causation a causal link between the misrepresentation and economic loss because vaxart s stock price dropped soon after the new york times article and hhs tweet confirming the company s failure to receive federal funding furthermore the court held that the headline about the attwill relationship that it enabled manufacture of a billion or more doses per year independently supported section 10 b liability according to the court plaintiffs plausibly alleged that attwill lacked the capacity due to regulatory shortcomings and limited staff to produce even one dose never mind one billion the court considered the headline deceptive despite the fact that the press release accurately disclosed that the parties had entered only into a memorandum of understanding an agreement to agree and thus a sophisticated investor could have discerned that the relationship was not as big a deal as it seems the court also found it difficult to imagine that a fledgling firm like vaxart a firm that has never taken a successful vaccine to market would fail to do basic diligence on its key partner in developing a crucial product as for loss causation although the new york times article and hhs tweet did not mention attwill the court held that they served as corrective disclosures just the same they rendered some aspect of the attwill release false or misleading by making clear that vaxart was nowhere near producing a single dose of the coronavirus vaccine and certainly not well positioned to take on the likes of pfizer moderna or j j the court thus permitted plaintiffs section 10 b claims to proceed to the class certification stage c implications vaxart illustrates that attention grabbing press releases with headlines that may appear misleading on their own can be risky as the court explained statements that are literally true on their face may be deemed materially misleading if when considered in context they convey a false or misleading impression circumstance setting and even manner of presentation all matter thus emphasis and gloss can in the right circumstances create liability in this case the court concluded that vaxart crossed the line taking advantage of a public interest in covid 19 vaccine developments and exaggerating its own prospects in an effort to boost its stock price the court however downplayed potentially fatal deficiencies with respect to the elements of a section 10 b claim an essential element of a section 10 b claim is a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant and a case can be made that the headline about operation warp speed was neither while the headline was not the picture of clarity the body of the press release revealed the truth vaxart was selected to participate in a primate study under operation warp speed that context matters as the supreme court has recognized investors read each statement in an sec filing whether of fact or of opinion in light of all its surrounding text including hedges disclaimers and apparently conflicting information and faced with a substantially similar situation involving another company inovio pharmaceuticals the u s district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania dismissed the section 10 b claim there as in vaxart inovio s press release announced that its vaccine candidate had been selected for the u s government s operation warp speed noting that the full release accurately disclosed that it was chosen to participate in a non human primate nhp challenge study however that court rejected that a reasonable investor with access to all this information would have thought inovio would receive government funding for its vaccine as for the headline about attwill even if it was misleading plaintiffs arguably failed to establish the essential element of loss causation as the ninth circuit has recognized to plead loss causation based on corrective disclosure a plaintiff must show that the disclosure revealed in whole or in part the truth concealed by the defendant s misstatements but here the purported corrective disclosures the new york times article and hhs tweet addressed solely whether vaxart was receiving federal funding neither mentioned attwill let alone its lack of manufacturing capabilities thus the court s assessment that the disclosures rendered some aspect of the attwill release false or misleading may be a stretch a plaintiff cannot state a section 10 b claim by mixing and matching elements for two different statements it must specifically allege why each statement meets each element of section 10 b and rule 10b 5 including the misrepresentation made it remains to be seen whether the vaxart defendants will seek permission to challenge the dismissal through an interlocutory appeal 1 20 f 4th 131 2d cir 2021 2 f

medora n d the horses that wander theodore roosevelt national park add splashes of animated color to the craggy buttes and grassy draws they call home bands of horses have long been a fixture of the park s south unit officially they serve as hoofed reminders of the open range days when ranch horses helped cattle wranglers in the park s little missouri river badlands but critics including three prominent western historians all of them former career park professionals complain that the national park service persists in ignoring persuasive evidence that some of the horses are descended from ponies surrendered by sitting bull s followers in 1881 a historical paper trail traces sitting bull s ponies in a series of transactions beginning with the surrender of about 350 horses at fort buford to the purchase of 60 mares from that herd by a ranching baron in 1884 whose unfenced spread included the southern north dakota badlands despite that documented sequence and other evidence amassed by a harvard ethnographer who wrote a history of the park s horses the national park service refuses to acknowledge evidence three historians have called persuasive or overwhelming unless confirmed by dna samples linking horses in the park to those once held by sitting bull s people ernest quintana the park service s regional manager maintains that nothing short of scientific evidence is needed to confirm any link between horses in the park to those once owned by sitting bull s band or other tribes advertisement one of the most outspoken critics of the national park service s refusal to actively work to preserve mustangs with characteristics matching those used by plains indians is robert utley once the agency s chief historian and sitting bull s most influential biographer clearly nps wants to be rid of the ponies partly for environmental reasons partly because they just don t want to be bothered utley wrote in an e mail message to the forum the dna gambit is clearly ridiculous as anyone who gives it a second thought knows as a practical alternative to dna testing which might be impossible because no genetic samples were taken of sitting bull s ponies another former park historian proposed combing archival military records of horses confiscated from lakota surrendering in 1880 81 some horses at theodore roosevelt national park in the north dakota badlands have a famous pedigree a lineage to sitting bull s ponies according to some researchers three western historians all former career park service professionals are urging the national park service to try to preserve horses with traits of mustangs descended from plains indian tribes patrick springer the forum jerome greene a career park service historian who has written extensively about the sioux wars said there were as many as 19 separate surrenders during that period totaling 5 694 people greene who said existing research makes a persuasive case for the link between horses that came from the park and sitting bull s ponies nonetheless said the park service needs to tighten the knowledge by obtaining records from the national archives in a letter to the park service he listed records groups that could shed more light nine months later greene has yet to receive a response he said advertisement it s dumbfounding to me that the park and the regional director just close their eyes to it greene said the dna requirement he added is an unreasonable standard it just boggles my mind the lineage of park horses to war ponies once ridden by sitting bull s people and other plains indian tribes is living history that would be a major attraction for theodore roosevelt national park greene said it just seems to me that the park service is missing an opportunity he said visitation up there would probably go up because so many people are interested in horses it s just a no brainer that the park should be open to exploring the evidence compiled by castle mclaughlin a harvard ethnographer who wrote a detailed history of the park horses almost 20 years ago and has continued to research the horses castle mclaughlin has the evidence utley wrote she is right and it is insulting that the tr theodore roosevelt staff will not give so distinguished a scholar the courtesy of at least having her come to the park and make her case they don t want to hear it even though its evidence is the only way to get at the question related mclaughlin while an interpretive ranger for the park service in north dakota in the 1980s spent three years researching the badlands horses combing historical accounts and photographs as well as interviewing numerous ranchers and american indians another career park service professional and historian paul hedren also is convinced of the park horses lineage and dismayed by what he sees as wrongheaded bureaucratic intransigence a smart manager it seems to me would invite castle mclaughlin to hear her case they don t seem to be interested advertisement an archival search might better document the disposition of confiscated indian ponies said hedren who has written about sitting bull s surrender and the great sioux war his own research has unearthed documents of the transfer of sitting bull s horses to post traders near fort buford many of those horses later were purchased by the marquis de mores a french nobleman who failed as a cattle baron in the badlands around medora which he founded the chain of history has been proven said wally owen who for years ran the trail riding concession at the park another horse preservation proponent the rugged badlands terrain at theodore roosevelt national park became a refuge that isolated a distinctive group of wild horses descended from plains indian ponies according to a harvard researcher the horses were a hybrid from indian mustangs and early ranch stock patrick springer the forum patrick springer the forum the public feud between former park service historians including utley and the agency flared up last fall after a roundup of the horses ended with the crash of a helicopter that was used to herd the animals into sorting corrals where they were to be culled to reduce their numbers to prevent overgrazing some horse advocates including those involved with a foundation working to preserve the horses complained that a proper roundup should have employed horse riders trained in moving horses as did almost all previous roundups in the park in tandem with a helicopter last year utley wrote park officials asking that they work with a group that is working to preserve the mustang type horses used by plains indians advertisement members of the nokota horse conservancy supporters of a breed name for the hybrids once predominant in the park maintain a breeding herd of horses in pastures near linton n d drawn from wild horses removed from the park in the 1970s and 1980s in 1993 the north dakota legislature designated the nokota horse as the official state equine declaring the nokota breed may well be those distinct horses descended from sioux chief sitting bull s war ponies that official stature supporters once hoped would help protect the feral horses in the park which once had been targeted for total eviction from the park in the 1950s and 1960s then around 1970 the policy shifted to accommodate a demonstration horse herd in the interest of historic accuracy theodore roosevelt when ranching in the badlands in the open range years of the 1880s wrote of seeing wild horses presumably strays from indian tribes and ranches descendants of wild horses roam the south unit of theodore roosevelt national park near medora n d pat springer the forum but in the 1980s the park removed dominant wild stallions and replaced them with popular domestic breeds including quarter horses and an arabian horse park officials cited concerns about possible inbreeding as the reason for introducing horses but a horse expert concluded that inbreeding wasn t a problem we re managing the herd as a cultural demonstration herd biologist mike oehler said we re not managing the herd to preserve some genetic line that s been purported we re not a horse park in other words advertisement bill whitworth the park s chief of resources said rangers strive for a good mix of horses in color appearance age and gender we re managing populations instead of individuals he said they re not managed as sitting bull s horses he added there are other people who actually do that we think the horse is best represented in private sources in the 1970s members of the north dakota congressional delegation and state tourism office wrote park officials to ask them to preserve and protect the horses but officials have been silent in more recent years i thought we won the battle said tracy potter executive director of the fort abraham lincoln foundation and a former state tourism director he d assumed that the nokota s status as the state horse would help assure its future sara otte coleman north dakota s tourism director considers the park horses an asset i haven t ever chimed in formally she said i think it s something we need to follow and preserve today following years of the systematic removal of the nokota type the bloodlines of the park herd have been diminished to the point that only a few horses in the park have the distinct traits and conformity of the wild ponies that once roamed the badlands mclaughlin said to me it s a tragedy she added i felt i got a glimpse at a lost world just before it went under those first horses were wild

this is the story of andy trouardâ s triathlon bike you may wonder who andy trouard is heâ s 27 years old and iâ ll write more about him later perhaps in a story that includes u s olympic silver medalist in triathlon morgan pearson andy is the newest u s male of interest in olympic tri joining kevin mcdowell matt mcelroy the aforementioned morgan pearson seth rider and some others i will only say this about andy to give you a sense as a sophomore in high school he was on the state meet podium in arizona in swimming he also won the ncaa division i indoor 3000 meters in 2018 thatâ s in running heâ s a 3 58 miler and has a track pr of 13 21 so thereâ s some promise back to the bike which is a triathlon bike because andy is turning directly and for now only to draft legal olympic style racing i got a call from usa triathlonâ s joe maloy in late november joe is a former olympian who usat tasked to mine the diamonds in the collegian rough he hunts for uniquely talented men and women just like andy champion runner former swimmer joeâ s been after andy for some time as you might imagine and triathlon finally landed him back to that call from joe â we want to set him up with a good bike fit â and then see if we can get a bike that fits with parts that work and so on likewise the wetsuit helmet shoes andyâ s current ride is a 2010 something or other that has basically no handlebar tape barely roadworthy andy came up to the compound from his hometown tucson for a fit session in early december and please don t scrutinize this photo it was not the finished position though the pics of the bike you see are matched to the fit coordinates achieved during the fit session the result of that session created a conundrum because road bike makers have largely vacated a geometry that i find useful itâ s what you could call cervelo geometry not long and low not â enduranceâ in my own riding i can barely get a cervelo r series bike low enough but i just can thatâ s the geometry iâ m talking about specialized has lowered the front end of its tarmac and venge in line with a lot of other bike makers thereâ s a kind of conformity around in my size 58cm a stack and reach of 580mm x 400mm respectively that works okay for me and qr cannondale canyon and a lot of others are making that geometry in their road bikes or they jack the front end way up and pull it back toward the bottom bracket few bikes these days are in between andy has a saddle height â saddle top to bb center â of 77 5cm on a 5â 11â frame iâ m riding a saddle height of 75 5cm on a 6â 2â frame that means all things equal i need a bike thatâ s a bit longer in reach and lower in stack long and low if thatâ s whatâ s right for me it canâ t be right for andy he ended up with a pretty conventional fit but he just needs a taller narrower frame because of his morphology while i can ride a cervelo just barely andy rides a cervelo perfectly so i got cervelo on the line and while they wanted to help those bikes are long sold itâ s been hard getting hold of any bikes or the parts that go on them and look i wasnâ t on the hunt for freebies i had my credit card out itâ s just hard getting bikes it was not easy to meet all my imperatives beyond geometry i wanted a top quality frame without internal hydraulic cable routing that used easily changeable stem and bars because the fit session notwithstanding where the hoods sit in space for a new rider like andy is likely to change in any direction by 10mm or 15mm and i needed this bike to be easy to pack for air travel itâ s hard to find a top quality frame that doesnâ t have an integrated front end again thereâ s cervelo and i bought an r5 last year for all the reasons i list above there was a bike that checked all the boxes if i could only get it the time alpe dâ huez 01 has a stack of 581mm in a size l and a reach of 392mm in other words itâ s a size i could ride height wise â which andy needs â but itâ s shorter in reach a bit short for me but good for andy it was also a top quality frameset it turns out time bicycles is owned by a friend of mine tony karklins and i tracked him down he was vacationing on a boat in the middle of the caribbean â yes i have that frame â he told me between pina coladas or tequila sunrises or rum punches â but youâ ll need to source the parts â i had the beginnings of a shimano 9200 groupset and i needed only to fill in the blanks calling in every favor i had making an ornery pest of myself waterboarding every friend i had in the business buying the odd part here and there with some big time help from shimano it took me a couple of weeks but i got almost everything in i really wanted andy to be on that groupset dura ace 9200 or ultegra 8100 because i wanted absolutely bombproof electronic shifting on a bike that was easy to assemble and travel friendly andyâ s mentor as he embarks on his draft legal journey is former pro bike racer and national class duathlete paul thomas paul also understands andy as a runner as paul was a california state meet champion in the mile with high school prs of 4 08 and 8 53 eventually andyâ s old bike gave out so heâ s on one of paulâ s gravel bikes right now with road wheels and tires learning not just how to be a triathlete but how to race bikes i did the build on the time alpe dâ huez myself wrenchwork is not a core competency of mine but i didnâ t do the built on my own 9200 dura ace bike shimano did i wanted to understand the parts on my own bike how it went together and i needed some more experience with the etube app and the adjustment and config of the parts using that app the tires were a bear to find i wanted tubeless and i wanted fast and durable tires i was again making life hard for myself and i could not find the schwalbe pro ones my choice for all around speed and durability i needed them either in 28mm or 30mm as andy was going to spend a lot of time on the bike and i wanted a comfortable safe tire not finding them i just took a set of 28mm tires out of my own stock and theyâ re a nice match with the dura ace wheels â and what you see here are the new dura ace wheels just launched in august of last year how hard was i scraping the barrel for parts i had to unwrap the tape off a set of handlebars i used in my bike fit studio to wrap the bars on this bike there are 172 5mm cranks on this bike 52x36 and 11 30 in the back 12 speed the saddle and the handlebars are pro which is a shimano brand for the stem i chose zipp service course sl specifically because i like the zipp quickview itâ s my favorite mount for head units and another good reason for choosing a frame that takes a standard stem the quickview is a faceplate that mates with certain zipp stems on that mount is a wahoo elemnt bolt which i had and it was hard giving that up i have a roam that i use most of the time so iâ ll survive if you look at those water bottle cages yes they look a lot like xlab gorilla cages they are basically it turns out thereâ s a lot of cross compatibility between tri and gravel tech for example gravel figured out pretty quickly that the idea that triathletes had for where to stick food â on the top tube â was a big improvement on the jersey pocket road racers are a little too precious for top tube storage so this tech jumped from tri right over road and into gravel gravel and bikepack enthusiasts also like the idea of bottles not jumping out of cages while riding as do triathletes so much of what xlab made for tri had utility for gravel but gravel needs its own brand hence dawn to dusk a brand that has a lot of curiously xlabby like products it may take an extra few newton meters or watt fractions to pull a bottle out of this cage but for andyâ s use i just want the bottle to stay put so a kaptive 14 bottle is on both down and seat tubes itâ s speedplay pedals on this bike because both paul and i are speedplay devotees for road and andy wouldnâ t dare ride anything else the bike weighs 16 6 pounds and thatâ s with pedals zippâ s system for mounts and with the bolt and the cages if andy doesnâ t make our next olympic team iâ m determined it not be the bikeâ s fault rounding out andy trouardâ s new equipment is a lazer road helmet shimano tr9 tri shoes roka maverick wetsuit which i ll write about next week and a selection of goggles i swim in the f1 but to each his or her own i may have the opportunity to write a little more about this process as it unfolds andy has not actually seen the bike yet in person it gets delivered to him this week if the whole thing is a bust iâ ll let you know if it works out iâ ll let you know iâ m as excited as anyone to see if he likes the bike and where his triathlon journey will take him

photo credit photo smoothies shutterstock as workers continue to leave their jobs en masse the phenomenon known as the great resignation seems to be far from over according to data from the bureau of labor statistics quits totalled 4 5 million in november a record high and have been trending upward since april 2020 the quit rate defined as the number of monthly quits as a percentage of total employment rose to 3 0 in november tying september s record historically job openings hires and separations have tracked each other however the covid 19 pandemic has disrupted this pattern at the beginning of the pandemic in march 2020 total separations rose to a record 16 3 million as businesses across the country laid off workers and shut down separations were also high in april 2020 but then returned to more typical levels and have been trending upwards ever since at the same time job openings have been climbing rapidly reaching near record levels in october 2021 amidst widespread labor shortages as businesses across the country struggle to hire workers continue to quit in droves both total quits and quit rates have been rising since the spring of 2020 causing quits to account for an increasingly large share of total separations the pandemic has caused many workers to reassess their priorities and look for jobs that offer more flexibility as well as better pay and benefits fortunately for them the current labor market puts workers in a good position to make headway on these goals job openings currently total 10 6 million and with 6 9 million unemployed workers there are about 1 5 jobs per every unemployed worker while quits tend to be higher in lower paying sectors quits have been rising across nearly every industry the accommodation and food service industry which includes restaurants bars and hotels had the highest average monthly quit rate for 2021 at 5 7 additionally the industry had the greatest increase in its quit rate from 2020 to 2021 at 1 5 percentage

republicans blast pete buttigieg and biden administration for sleepwalking through the botched process of rolling out 5g technology republicans slammed the administration for it s disastrous 5g roll out nstead of leading the white house has sleepwalked through this botched process a gop group in transportation and tech committees wrote at t and verizon launched their new 5g network across america on wednesday turning on 4 500 new towers but the disastrous roll out led to flight cancelations nationwide leading to blame on the administration and transportation secretary pete buttigieg telecoms giants agreed at the last minute on tuesday to halt the rollout near airports but not before international airlines already canceled dozens of flights many of the airports have buffers to protect against the frequencies but boston newark memphis atlanta are among major airports that do not have buffers emirates president tim clark blames the biden administration for not doing more to stop the chaos republicans are blaming transportation secretary pete buttigieg and the administration s lack of leadership in the long awaited yet disastrous rollout of 5g technology gop members of transportation and technology related congressional panels released a joint statement wednesday claiming the biden administration sleepwalked the process the biden administration has failed to provide any leadership to find a solution to this spectrum issue the statement reads the u s government has hardworking experts who can address any outstanding technical issues but instead of leading the white house has sleepwalked through this botched process by lurching from one arbitrary deadline to the next with no clear plan or strategy for resolution this administration s negligence continues to delay finding a lasting solution that improves our everyday wireless communication while protecting aviation safety the letter was signed by four republicans transportation and infrastructure committee ranking member sam graves from missouri aviation subcommittee ranking member garret graves from louisiana energy and commerce committee ranking member cathy mcmorris rodgers from washington and communications and technology subcommittee ranking member bob latta from ohio at t and verizon launched their 5g network across america on wednesday morning switching on 4 500 towers to bring faster wireless to their customers they had to hold back on ten per cent of the towers 500 that are near airports because the frequencies the towers emit could interfere with the signal on some planes some airline passengers who were unaware of the fiasco showed up at airports ready to board their flights but were told they had been canceled in total 239 flights to from and within the us have been canceled as of wednesday afternoon it s unclear if all have been scrapped because of 5g but the network launch is causing major issues texas republican representative beth van duyne tweeted of the disaster the airline industry has been hit hard by authoritarian vaccine mandates and staffing shortages the last thing it needs is failed leadership on the 5g rollout buttigieg and the administration also faced some backlash from within their own party for the fiasco democratic representative sharice davids tweeted wednesday glad to see that verizon and at t have agreed to delay 5g deployment around key airports our main priority as congress is safety and this solution allows the vast majority of wireless deployment to continue while protecting passengers and cargo from delays and disruption a group of republicans who head up the minority in transportation and technology related committees and subcommittees slammed the administration for it s disastrous 5g roll out they wrote the u s government has hardworking experts who can address any outstanding technical issues but instead of leading the white house has sleepwalked through this botched process republican rep beth van duyne slammed the administration for failed leadership leading to a slew of flight cancelations due to the roll out federal communications commission commissioner brendan carr also blasted biden on wednesday the biden administration s botched handling of c band 5g offerings highlights a failure of competent leadership he wrote on twitter the white house walked back a biden brokered infrastructure agreement after just two weeks this is a bad deal he assured the biden administration could have stood up and sided with science carr continued they didn t their silence paved the way for a pressure campaign timed to maximize the chances that administration officials would cave they did running a dysfunctional process does not promote air safety or america s 5g leadership the president of emirates has slammed the 5g fiasco as the most delinquent irresponsible mess he has seen in his 50 year aviation career and blamed it on transport secretary pete buttigieg who he says knew about the impending chaos but failed to warn anyone in time to stop it eighty eight airports now have buffers to protect against it but some major airports like denver atlanta boston memphis do not in the most recent faa announcement on wednesday afternoon the government said 62 percent of flights could operate safely leaving nearly half to reschedule sir tim clark the president of emirates appeared on cnn wednesday that american airlines knew about the risks before the rest of the world and that it forced them to scramble to cancel flights then bring them back once it was safe american airline ceos who have lucrative contracts with the government are praising it for reaching a negotiation with the telecoms giants and reserving all criticism of why it took so long let the truth be known we were not aware of this until yesterday morning to the extent that it was going to compromise the safety of operation of our aircraft and just about every other 777 operator to and from the united states and within the united states it came to a head it was known by the us operators probably a little bit more than we knew we have evidence of letters being written to the secretary of transport in the us government alerting that group to what was likely to happen and its consequences i need to be as candid as i normally am and say this is one of the most delinquent utterly irresponsible issues i ve seen in my aviation career because it involves organs of government manufacturers science clark said tim clark the president of emirates appeared on bloomberg wednesday to blame the shambolic situation on the biden administration which greenlit the 5g rollout without addressing the safety fears of the aviation industry first transport secretary pete buttigieg has not been able to offer a solution to the fiasco and the airlines say they weren t even made aware of the risks until monday buttigieg who took two months of paternity leave late last year has not issued a comment on the fiasco since yesterday when he said the government was aware which flights have been canceled or changed already delta delta said in a statement that it expects some flights to be canceled but the airline will not say which flights or why telecom companies agreed tuesday to limit the scope of wednesday s planned 5g deployment and will delay implementation around certain u s airports while this is a positive development toward preventing widespread disruptions to flight operations some flight restrictions may remain the airline said in an announcement emirates all emirates flights to and from these airports are indefinitely canceled boston chicago dallas fort worth houston miami newark new jersey orlando florida san francisco and seattle the airline s flights to l a x new york city and dulles are still operating all nippon 20 passenger and cargo flights scheduled on boeing 777s from haneda and narita airports in japan to the us through thursday all nippon said it would also be changing the boeing 777 aircraft used on some u s flights the airline is advising passengers with tickets to check if they have been rescheduled to a flight on a different aircraft japan airlines japan airlines has canceled three passenger and five cargo flights on wednesday air india all flights between delhi and from new york san francisco and chicago and between mumbai and newark are canceled until further notice british airways british airways cancelled a handful of flights from heathrow to boston chicago los angeles new york and san francisco on wednesday the carrier said some flights due to be operated by boeing 777s are using different larger aircraft such as the airbus a380 to ensure people can still fly on the same day they booked cathay pacific hong kong s cathay pacific said it is deploying different types of airplanes where necessary to the affected airports and that its flights to the united states have not been affected so far korean airlines korean air lines south korea s biggest airline switched four passenger planes from boeing 777s to 787s and two cargo planes from 747 8s to 747 400s overnight and will continue to avoid operating 777s and 747 8s at affected u s airports austrian airlines austrian airlines scrambled to switch their aircraft from their usual boeing 777 service germany s lufthansa lufthansa also swapped out one kind of boeing 747 for another on some u s bound flights advertisement the notion that for instance the united states government should sell its franchise for all the frequencies for a large amount of money somebody should have told them at the time that the risks and the dangers they placed in certain frequency uses around field airfields metropolitan fields that should have been done at the time sir tim fumed we were aware of a 5g issue okay we are aware that everybody is trying to get 5g rolled out after all it s the super cool future of whatever it may be communication and information flow we were not aware that the power of the antennas in the united states have been doubled compared to what s going on elsewhere we were not aware that the antenna themselves have been put into a vertical position rather than a slight slanting position which when taken together compromise not only the radio altimeter systems but the flight control systems on the fly by wire aircraft so on that basis we took that decision late last night to suspend all our services until we had clarity delta chief of operations john laughter in a statement on wednesday reserved criticism of the us government we re continuing to work with the faa the fcc and the telecom industry to find a practical solution that will allow for the rollout of 5g technology while preserving safety and avoiding flight disruptions united said we re pleased the biden administration reached a compromise with at t and verizon to avoid mass cancellations across the aviation industry we look forward to a higher level of coordination between the regulators telecom companies and the aviation industry to ensure that customers are not faced with disruptions going forward british airways emirates all nippon and japan airlines had canceled dozens of their scheduled flights to and from the us or put people on different flights using different aircraft air india canceled flights on tuesday and are yet to put people on other services jageish rathor who was due to fly to delhi from newark this morning arrived at the airport to learn the flight had been canceled they say the flight is canceled until further notice i traveling to deli air india they say the flight is canceled until further notice they re saying some kind of 5g network the agent told me the flight canceled they want to charge me 400 extra to get on a flight tomorrow i am from new jersey i spent 70 on an uber to come here i didn t get an email or message i just found out when i got here i m supposed to go to my niece and nephew s wedding two days after today and i can t get there he was among dozens of people in the same position now as a result of the halt the airlines which are based in different time zones and heard the news at varying times throughout the night are scrambling to resume boeing 777 flights the result is a thickening headache at airports where the chaos is playing out in cancelations staff shortages and a lack of the right planes in the right place at the right time united airlines has canceled 20 flights in and out of newark already on wednesday british airways canceled all its 777 flights to new york boston and l a x from london putting passengers on different aircraft the airline is now working to resume those flights safety is always our priority we are monitoring the situation in the us closely and will continue to review our schedule in the next few hours we re disappointed that some of our customers are facing potential disruption and will update them as soon as possible on any changes to their travel plans a spokesman told dailymail com japan airlines announced that it is working to resume flights to the us a day after issuing a blanket cancelation on all of its services on january 18 2022 boeing has notified us that 5g signals for u s mobile phones which will begin operating in the u s on january 19 may interfere with the radio wave altimeter installed on the boeing 777 based on that information we were forced to cancel some flights to the u s mainland on january 19 which airports don t have buffers the government will not provide a full list of the major airports that normally welcome 777s but won t be able to without a 5g buffer they have issued a list of the airports that do have buffers from which these airports are missing boston memphis atlanta denver honolulu new orleans advertisement today on january 19 we have received confirmation from the faa federal aviation administration that there is no longer a problem with the operation of the boeing 777 and we will resume service to the u s mainland with boeing 777 from january 20 we will continue to monitor the situation closely and if there is any impact on our flight operations we will promptly announce it on our website the airline said in an announcement on its website emirates which had canceled all flights to nine us airports indefinitely has now shortened that list it will still not operate flights to chicago dallas fort worth miami newark orlando and seattle but some flights to san francisco and boston are back on the schedule verizon will temporarily not turn on about 500 towers near airports sources told reuters or less than 10 percent of their planned deployment while the carriers and the administration work on a permanent solution sources briefed on the matter said but details of the agreement including the length of the pause for the rollout and a solution were not disclosed lacking an immediate solution passengers and airlines are bracing for further delays and cancellations as the travel chaos shows no sign of stopping scores of people have now been left stranded at airports with many complaining on social media about their flights being cancelled due to the 5g rollout one passenger identified as siddhartha on twitter complained that he and other passengers were not happy that their air india flight from delhi to san francisco had been cancelled travelers were seen crowded together at indira gandhi international airport as they waited for more news another passenger identified as kausi on twitter was left frustrated after they were told their emirates flight to chicago had been cancelled as soon as she landed in dubai kausi complained that she and other passengers were not left stuck in airports meanwhile delta air lines and united airlines warned passengers of cancellations and long delays as a result of the 5g rollout delta said they are planning for the possibility of weather related cancellations caused by the deployment of new 5g service in the vicinity of dozens of u s airports starting as early as wednesday people at the air india customer service desk after a delhi flight was cancelled at jfk airport queens new york on wednesday stranded passengers who were due to fly to delhi on an air india flight from newark arrived at the airport on wednesday morning to learn it had been canceled an empty check in at the british airways counter at jfk the airline had to scrap its 777 flights to the us on wednesday morning and put those passengers on other flights a spokesman told dailymail com the airline was disappointed by the disruption caused to the service cancellations are seen on boards at jfk airport queens new york january 19 2022 all nippon airways canceled all its us flights on tuesday to heed the faa warning then announced on wednesday that some were being brought back the british airways flight to heathrow tonight was canceled this graphic shows how the wireless spectrum used by 5g networks could interfere with altimeters which measure a plane s altitude and is especially important for low visibility operations the ceos of the airlines have asked officials that the 5g be implemented everywhere in the country except within the approximate 2 miles of airport runways at some key airports timeline of 5g travel chaos monday airline ceos beg biden administration to intervene in at t and verizon s rollout citing safety fears that 5g tech will interfere with radio altimeter technology on boeing 777s tuesday morning boeing issues warning to international airlines that 5g signal will interfere with their planes airlines like emirates japan airlines and all nippon make arrangements to cancel their 777 flights bound for america or put people on different aircraft tuesday afternoon at t and verizon agree to halt the rollout of some of their towers near some airports they won t say which airports or how long they have agreed to pause it for wednesday 5g launches across america excluding near some airports airlines overseas scramble to get the 777 jets they d grounded back up and running the chaos results in delays and disruption in other airports and airlines advertisement united airlines told customers on a flight from denver to houston that a three hour delay was a result of the new 5g systems according to a notice on its website it also suggested customers with any concerns reach out to the federal communications commission a major issue for airlines has been their use of the boeing 777 model a long range wide body aircraft which is said to be particularly affected by the 5g signals it has prompted cancellations and a mad dash to change the aircrafts japanese major airline all nippon airways said it would be cancelling some of its flights and changing the boeing 777 aircraft used on some u s flights but on wednesday morning the airline announced the flights would be resumed as the launch of the 5g service in the u s has now been partially postponed operation of ana flights from jan 20 will follow the normal schedule based on faa notification that there is no safety issue with the operation of boeing 777 aircraft to the u s airports that we serve we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused to our customers they said meanwhile british airways opted to switch aircraft on its daily flight to los angeles to an airbus a380 from the usual boeing 777 service two people familiar with the matter told reuters and korean air lines south korea s biggest airline switched four passenger planes from boeing 777s to 787s and two cargo planes from 747 8s to 747 400s overnight and will continue to avoid operating 777s and 747 8s at affected u s airports spokeswoman jill chung said germany s lufthansa also swapped out one kind of 747 for another on some u s bound flights hong kong s cathay pacific said it is deploying different types of airplanes where necessary to the affected airports and that its flights to the united states have not been affected so far taiwan s eva air also said it had taken contingency measures to ensure flight safety without elaborating the airlines said they were acting in response to a notice from boeing that 5g signals may interfere with the radio altimeter on the 777 leading to restrictions industry sources said boeing had issued technical advisories noting potential interference but that flight restrictions were in the hands of the faa which has for now limited operations at key airports unless airlines qualify for special approvals but air france said it planned to continue flying its boeing 777s into american airports it did not explain why it didn t change its aircraft as many other carriers have all nippon airways has resumed flights to the us after canceling them due to the 5g security fears japan airlines is resuming flights on 777s to the us as a result of the telecoms giants halting the launch of 5g near some airports at the last minute how does 5g affect planes at t and verizon have spent tens of billions of dollars to license the 3 7 to 3 98 ghz frequency range for the new high speed c band 5g service the c band is a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum in the microwave range of frequencies ranging from 4 0 to 8 0 gigahertz ghz although the us federal communications commission has designated 3 7 4 2 ghz as c band too the problem is that wireless spectrum used by 5g networks could interfere with radio altimeters which measure a plane s altitude especially important for low visibility operations airlines fear that c band 5g signals will disrupt planes navigation systems particularly those used in bad weather this interference with radio altimeters which measure a plane s altitude could lead to the loss of radar altitude information or worse incorrect radar altitude information unknowingly being generated they say it is not seen as a problem in britain or europe according to the uk s civil aviation authority ofcom and eu aviation safety authority all three insist there is no evidence 5g interferes with aircraft systems however in europe 5g networks work in the 3 4 3 8ghz spectrum so regulators on this side of the atlantic don t appear as concerned about it being close to the 4 2 4 4ghz band for radio altimeters it seems the basis for us airlines fears is that mobile networks traffic from the top edge of 3 98ghz might bleed into the neighbouring altimeter band the issue is that the c band frequency used for 5g in the us is a little bit close to the frequencies used by altimeters roslyn layton vice president at strand consult told tech monitor the radio altimeter is a critical aviation safety technology that indicates the airplane s height and supports safe landing it operates in the 4 2 4 4 ghz spectrum band cell phones are currently not permitted to operate in that band or any nearby band to prevent interference however if telecommunication authorities reallocate the 3 7 4 2 ghz band for 5g the risk of interference could increase the airlines want 5g signals to be excluded from the approximate two miles of airport runways at affected airports as defined by the faa on 19 january 2022 this would ensure that no airplanes are affected by the 5g interference they say there have been fatal accidents associated with incorrect radar altitude most recently turkish airlines flight 1951 in amsterdam in 2009 the faa has warned that potential interference could affect sensitive airplane instruments such as altimeters and make an impact on low visibility operations so this threat could compromise key safety systems and result in suspended passenger and cargo flights for passengers flights may be cancelled or have to be diverted to other airports if 5g towers are deployed too close to airport runways but most aviation regulators are content the risks posed by 5g to planes are low according to layton this whole thing is unhelpful for the world s airport regulators she said they have blessed this technology years ago so what does it look like when the faa all of sudden says there s a problem it s really inconvenient and a bit embarrassing at t and verizon have agreed to buffer zones around 50 airports to reduce interference risks in the uk ofcom said the country had had 5g deployments and other services in the bands near to radio altimeters for years and there have been no known cases of interference similarly other countries are already using these frequencies for 5g and other wireless services with no reported incidents of interference to aviation equipment the issue in the us is that it s about to deploy these services so there s concerns of the effects deployment may have advertisement a spokesman for boeing had no immediate comment similar 5g mobile networks have been deployed in dozens of other countries sometimes with concessions like reducing the power of the networks near airports as france has done but in the u s the issue has pitted the faa and the airlines against the federal communications commission and the telecoms companies the 5g service uses a segment of the radio spectrum that is close to that used by radio altimeters which are devices that measure the height of aircraft above the ground and help pilots land in low visibility the fcc which set a buffer between the 5g band and the spectrum that planes use determined that it could be used safely in the vicinity of air traffic at t and verizon have said their equipment will not interfere with aircraft electronics but faa officials saw a potential problem and the telecom companies agreed to a pause while it is addressed at t and verizon on tuesday agreed to temporarily defer turning on some wireless towers near key airports in a bid to avert further disruption to u s flights president joe biden hailed the agreement saying it will avoid potentially devastating disruptions to passenger travel cargo operations and our economic recovery while allowing more than 90 percent of wireless tower deployment to occur as scheduled verizon will temporarily not turn on about 500 towers near airports sources told reuters or less than 10 percent of their planned deployment while the carriers and the administration work on a permanent solution sources briefed on the matter said details of the agreement including the length of the pause were not disclosed both verizon and at t will launch 5g on wednesday elsewhere in the country bringing faster speeds to tens of millions of people the row erupted on monday when us airline ceos begged the biden administration to stop at t and verizon from rolling out their c band 5g technology the telecoms giants had been planning to launch the technology across the us on wednesday turning on 5 000 towers across the country that will bring americans faster internet speeds including 500 which the airline industry say pose a threat to flight safety both at t and verizon have reluctantly agreed to halt turning on those towers of concern until a resolution can be found in order to avoid a mass cancelation of flights across america and travel chaos that would up end the already distressed supply chain and scupper consumer travel it seemed to appease domestic airlines but did not calm international fear the faa has said it will allow planes with accurate reliable altimeters to operate around high power 5g but planes with older altimeters will not be allowed to make landings under low visibility conditions part of the problem according to the faa are the signal strength of the 5g towers and the orientation of their antennae base stations in rural areas of the united states are permitted to emit at higher levels in comparison to other countries which may affect radio altimeter equipment accuracy and reliability the faa said in december the fcc s chairwoman said in a statement that the 5g deployment can safely co exist with aviation technologies in the united states just as it does in other countries around the world emirates has now canceled flights to boston chicago dallas fort worth houston miami newark orlando san francisco and seattle in its announcement emirates cited the cancellation as necessary due to operational concerns associated with the planned deployment of 5g mobile network services in the u s at certain airports we are working closely with aircraft manufacturers and the relevant authorities to alleviate operational concerns and we hope to resume our u s services as soon as possible the state owned airline said the united arab emirates successfully rolled out 5g coverage all around its airports without incident like dozens of other countries but in the u s the federal aviation administration worries that the c band strand of 5g could interfere with aviation equipment of particular concern in the 5g rollout appears to be the boeing 777 a major workhorse for emirates which only flies that model and the airbus a380 jumbo jet its mideast competitor qatar airways anticipates minor delays on return flights from the u s but says otherwise its dozen u s routes are operating as scheduled all nippon and japan airlines have canceled all of their boeing 777 flights to the us and they say they did so at the request of boeing boeing has announced flight restrictions on all airlines operating the boeing 777 aircraft and we have cancelled or changed the aircraft for some flights to from the u s based on the announcement by boeing a statement from all nippon airways said all nippon cancelled 20 flights to the u s over the issue to cities such as chicago los angeles and new york japan airlines similarly said that it had been informed that 5g signals may interfere with the radio altimeter installed on the boeing 777 we will refrain from using this model on the continental united states line until we can confirm its safety and we regret to inform you that we will cancel the flight for which the aircraft cannot be changed to the boeing 787 the airline said eight of its flights were cancelled on wednesday three passenger trips and five for cargo boeing has not confirmed that it has given the order to airlines to ground their us 777s it s unclear exactly how many flights have been canceled so far or how many more will be the 777 last year was the second most used widebody plane on flights to and from u s airports with around 210 000 flights behind only the 767 according to data from flightradar24 industry sources said boeing had issued technical advisories noting potential interference but that flight restrictions were in the hands of the faa which has for now limited operations at key airports unless airlines qualify for special approvals radio altimeters give precise readings of the height above the ground on approach and help with automated landings as well as verifying the jet has landed before allowing reverse thrust air india which serves four u s destinations with boeing 777s has canceled flights to and from delhi to and from new york san francisco and chicago and between mumbai and newark due to deployment of the 5g communications equipment it said it would try to use other aircraft on u s routes as well choi jong yun a spokeswoman of asiana airlines a south korean carrier said the company hasn t been affected so far because it uses airbus planes for passenger flights to the u s and doesn t use the affected boeing planes to transport cargo however choi said airlines have also been instructed by the faa to avoid automatic landings at affected u s airports during bad weather conditions regardless of plane type asiana will redirect its planes to nearby airports during those conditions she said transport secretary pete buttigieg has been unable to offer a solution

allied pilots association spokesperson dennis tajer echoed the airlines concerns and urged the cellular companies to push back the 5g rollout this is reckless it s dangerous and it s got to stop tajer told the today show on tuesday take a pause this is about a cellphone signal and we re focused on protecting lives the warning comes after airline international airports and airlines have also begun warning customers to check if their trips to the u s will be cancelled or delayed due to the 5g launch although the faa approved 48 of the 88 airports most directly affected by 5g to use two radio altimeters to avoid confusion on sunday it ultimately issued an order to all pilots to avoid using the instruments because they could still face issues the buffer zones call for the 5g towers to be located at least two miles away from airports and to limit the towers heights even with the approvals granted by the faa u s airlines will not be able to operate the vast majority of passenger and

delta air lines united airlines and southwest airlines as well as officials from fedex express and ups airlines wrote a letter to government officials urging them to pause the launch of 5g the ceos warned that a significant number of widebody aircrafts will become unusable and could potentially strand tens of thousands of americans overseas unless our major hubs are cleared to fly the vast majority of the traveling and shipping public will essentially be grounded the ceos wrote the harm that will result from deployment on january 19 is substantially worse than we anticipated for two key reasons they explained the ceos also argued that because radio altimeters provide critical information to other safety and navigation systems in modern airplanes multiple modern safety systems will be deemed unusable airplane manufacturers have informed us that there are huge swaths of the operating fleet that may need to be indefinitely grounded the ripple effects across both passenger and cargo operations our workforce and the broader economy are simply incalculable the ceos wrote as they asked officials that 5g be implemented everywhere in the country except within the approximate 2 miles of airport runways at some key airports immediate intervention is needed to avoid significant operational disruption to air passengers shippers supply chain and delivery of needed medical supplies the carriers added they urge action to ensure 5g is deployed except when towers are too close to airport runways until the faa can determine how that can be safely accomplished without catastrophic

faa said on sunday it had cleared an estimated 45 of the u s commercial airplane fleet to perform low visibility landings at many airports where 5g c band will be deployed and they expect to issue more approvals before wednesday the airlines noted on monday that the list did not include many large airports the ceos of major airlines and boeing chief executive dave calhoun held a lengthy call with buttigieg and dickson on sunday to warn of the looming crisis officials told reuters the ceos of some of the nation s largest airlines wrote to federal officials on monday warning about the potential negative effects of 5g altimeter s are a key tool for pilots landing in low visibility conditions the evolution of mobile broadband up to 5g the evolution of the g system started in 1980 with the invention of the mobile phone which allowed for analogue data to be transmitted via phone calls digital came into play in 1991 with 2g and sms and mms capabilities were launched since then the capabilities and carrying capacity for the mobile network has increased massively more data can be transferred from one point to another via the mobile network quicker than ever 5g is expected to be 100 times faster than the currently used 4g whilst the jump from 3g to 4g was most beneficial for mobile browsing and working the step to 5g will be so fast they become almost real time that means mobile operations will be just as fast as office based internet connections potential uses for 5g include simultaneous translation of several languages in a party conference call self driving cars can stream movies music and navigation information from the cloud a full length 8gb film can be downloaded in six seconds 5g is expected to be so quick and efficient it is possible it could start the end of wired connections by the end of 2020 industry estimates claim 50 billion devices will be connected to 5g advertisement but the issue doesn t just affect airplanes they could also have a negative effect on the nation s helicopters including lifesaving medevac choppers under u s law all commercial helicopters must have a working altimeter in order to fly without them officials warn landing in remote areas or on hospital landing pads will be near impossible helicopter association international petitioned the faa in october asking for medevacs to be exempt from the law when 5g rolls out and the faa granted it last week for areas where 5g c band interference could affect the radio altimeter airlines for america the group that organized the letter declined to comment the ceo s also complained that given the short time frame and the exigency of this completely avoidable economic calamity we respectfully request you support and take whatever action necessary to ensure that 5g is deployed except when towers are too close to airport runways until the faa can determine how that can be safely accomplished without catastrophic disruption the faa said it will continue to ensure that the traveling public is safe as wireless companies deploy 5g the faa continues to work with the aviation industry and wireless companies to try to limit 5g related flight delays and cancellations the other government agencies did not comment the u k caa the mobile phone industry and ofcom released statements earlier this month in response to u k concerns they said they did not share the worries of that in the u s at this stage a spokesperson for the caa the uk equivalent to the faa said we are aware of reports that suggest that the frequency band being used for 5g in a number of countries could potentially pose a risk of interference with aircraft radio altimeters there have been no reported incidents of aircraft systems being affected by 5g transmissions in u k airspace but we are nonetheless working with ofcom and the ministry of defense to make sure that the deployment of 5g in the u k does not cause any technical problems for aircraft a spokesperson for ofcom said we

tariff hike but the commerce ministry spokesman who made the comment thursday didn t mention washington and said those exporters are not the mainstream the threatened u s tariff hikes are in response to complaints beijing steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology commerce ministry spokesman gao feng said at a regular briefing a few companies have increased the number of short orders to avoid risks however this is not the mainstream ap the united states has reached a deal with chinese telecommunications giant zte corp that includes a 1 billion fine according to us commerce secretary wilbur ross the associated press reports the fine comes on top of the roughly 1 billion zte has already paid for selling equipment to north korea and iran in violation of us sanctions ross speaking on cnbc on thursday said that zte also must put 400 million in escrow which will be forfeited if there are any violations of the agreement ross also said that a compliance team picked by the us will be embedded at zte and that the chinese company must change its board and executive team in 30 days us president donald trump s hard line views on trade a staple of his message long before he entered politics are beginning to collide with the cold realities of global geopolitics the associated press reports trade talks on china and the north american free trade agreement have hit stumbling blocks posing a challenge for a president who vowed to make trade deals more equitable for the united states during his 2016 campaign and who famously tweeted that trade wars are easy to win the united states and china are pulling back from the brink of a trade war after the world s two biggest economies reported progress in talks aimed at bringing down america s massive trade deficit with beijing the associated press reports we are putting the trade war on hold treasury secretary steven mnuchin said sunday china calls for us trade talks to be conducted on an equal footing as beijing s top economic official is due in washington next week for more discussions on a dispute that could trigger tariffs on billions of dollars of goods this month the visit by vice premier liu he considered president xi jinping s right hand man on economic issues comes after he led talks in beijing last week with a high level us delegation that made little headway in resolving the standoff the meetings follow a series of tit for tat threats of tariffs on billions of dollars of goods sparked earlier this year by us president donald trump who accuses china of using unfair practices to gain an advantage over us exporters costing american jobs afp china s exports rebounded last month from a brief downturn while its politically sensitive trade surplus with the united states expanded according to official data released tuesday customs data show that exports jumped 21 5 percent from a year earlier in april bouncing back from a contraction the previous month thanks to resurgent global demand imports expanded 12 9 percent year on year in dollar terms leaving the country s politically sensitive monthly trade surplus with the rest of the world at 28 8 billion a turnaround from the previous month s 5 billion deficit china s trade surplus with the u s swelled to 22 2 billion up from 15 4 the previous month as its exports to the u s grew at double digit rates the latest figures come as

prospect of a trade war poses downside risks to the us economy which otherwise is poised to grow at a solid pace the federal reserve says while the fed says the steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that president donald trump imposed last month will not on their own have a significant effect the possibility of retaliatory trade actions by other countries can be harmful china president xi jinping promised tuesday to cut china s auto tariffs and improve intellectual property protection in possible concessions aimed at defusing a worsening dispute with washington over trade and technology that investors worry could set back the global economic recovery the associated press reports president donald trump instructed the u s trade representative to consider slapping an additional 100 billion in tariffs on chinese goods thursday in a dramatic escalation of the trade dispute between the two countries trump s surprise move came a day after beijing announced plans to tax 50 billion in american products including soybeans and small aircraft in response to a u s move earlier this week to slap tariffs on 50 billion in chinese imports and it intensified what was already shaping up to be the biggest trade battle since world war ii global financial markets had fallen sharply as the world s two biggest economies squared off over beijing s aggressive trade tactics but they had calmed down wednesday and thursday on hopes the u s and china would find a diplomatic solution forecasters say the impact of monday s move should be limited but investors worry the global recovery might be set back if other governments respond by raising import barriers the associated press reports the tariffs signal a most unwelcome development which is that countries are becoming protectionist says economist taimur baig of dbs group but in commercial terms they are not very substantial compared with china s 150 billion in annual imports of u s goods he says in an ap

what hoenig adamantly objected to was the fed s decision to keep interest rates at zero and begin a new round of buying long term government debt a policy known as quantitative easing which effectively injected trillions of new dollars into the banking system the easy money of the book s title an inflation hawk so troubled by the prospect of rising prices that he was keen to limit the fed s reach hoenig had been fine with such measures during the 2008 financial crisis when markets were cratering but he didn t think that an unemployment rate of 9 6 per cent amounted to the kind of emergency that called for turning extraordinary methods for expanding the money supply into a matter of course a large part of the lords of easy money is given over to trying to rehabilitate hoenig s reputation which took a hit when year after year the inflation he warned about failed to happen but inflation did happen leonard repeatedly emphasises just not in the form that people thought it would take what escalated weren t consumer prices but asset prices in the past decade the stock market boomed while the real economy sputtered along hedge funds banks and private equity firms were all incentivised to create newer riskier and ever more exotic forms of debt all that new money was helping to fund another speculative bubble while simultaneously leaving little room for the fed to manoeuvre in the event of another crash leonard says that this asset speculation further enriched the wealthy few while work became ever more precarious for the many the last third of the book introduces us to one of the many john feltner who in 2013 landed an unionised job at rexnord a manufacturer of heavy industry equipment just a few years before the company decided to move his indianapolis plant to mexico leonard has chosen rexnord as an example advisedly advertisement first starting in the 1980s a string of private equity firms saddled rexnord with so much debt that the company s reason for being became the servicing of that debt second one of the private equity firms that acquired rexnord in the early 2000s was the carlyle group and one of the partners of the carlyle group at the time was jerome powell currently chair of the federal reserve powell a politically astute operator powell who last week signalled a willingness to raise interest rates if inflation persists is depicted as someone so protean that it s almost as if he s the personification of the financial system writ large ap powell was appointed as chair in 2018 by then president donald trump the same donald trump whose populist rhetoric had gotten the vote of a frustrated feltner two years before all of this usefully highlights how extreme financialisation has transformed or deformed the economy and politics even if powell s connection to rexnord ended long before feltner worked there and his job was moved to mexico advertisement powell who last week signalled a willingness to raise interest rates if inflation persists is depicted as someone so protean that it s almost as if he s the personification of the financial system writ large an improvisational politically astute operator to hoenig s principled but doomed cassandra powell s good standing among the washington establishment comes across as suspect although leonard has no patience for anti establishment conspiracy theories either and he laments that criticisms of the fed s easy money policies in the past decade have mainly been the purview of right wing cranks he takes a great deal of care making hoenig s hawkishness sound like good old common sense as if it s simply the inevitable conclusion drawn by a stalwart steward of prudence and integrity which it very well may be although hoenig s hard line position glides through this book mostly uncontested with only a scant sense of why it didn t win over the other economists at the fed you wouldn t know that there have been any serious developments in economic ideas since hoenig was deeply influenced by the inflationary spiral of the 1970s there is no mention at all of modern monetary theory advocated most prominently by the economist stephanie kelton which takes to heart a line from john maynard keynes anything we can actually do we can afford even if hoenig thinks it s utter garbage it would have been good to see exactly how when pressed he makes his case advertisement nor does leonard address what could have happened if hoenig had gotten his way back in 2010 what the economic historian adam tooze calls the deflationary misery of the 1930s loomed understandably large in the fed s institutional memory a terrible reminder of what could happen when the institution failed to counteract a collapsing banking system by buoying the money supply not to mention that in 2010 the fed s actions indicated that it had become a guarantor not just for the american economy but for the global financial system tooze s recent books crashed and shutdown suggest that the relationships among the fed the us economy and the global system have all been torqued to the point where an urge to stand athwart it all yelling stop is futile leonard or hoenig is right to recognise how precarious and how dangerous the current situation is leonard or hoenig is right to call for some long term thinking too still the lords of easy money presents the complexity of the current system as if it were merely disguising some unshakable fundamentals there s a satisfying clarity to reading a book that puts the jumble of political and economic turmoil into such stark narrative terms but there s more to the story than that the lords of easy money how the federal reserve broke the american economy by christopher leonard 373 pages

2021 from 553 1 million at june 30 2021 the increase in deposits was primarily due to a 35 5 million increase in core deposits partially offset by a 17 8 million decrease in time deposits the decrease

at december 31 2021 from 41 0 million at june 30 2021 the decrease in borrowings was due to the strategic prepayment of 7 0 million of higher cost advances from the fhlb during the three months ended september 30 2021 stockholders equity decreased 3 0 million or 1 4 to 213 9 million at december 31 2021 from 216 9 million at june 30 2021 the decrease in stockholders equity was primarily due to the

on available for sale securities partially offset by 2 3 million of net income recorded during the six months ended december 31 2021 book value per share measured 14 10 as of december 31 2021 compared to 14 30 as of june 30 2021 and tangible book value per share 3 measured 13 72 as of december 31 2021 compared to 13 92 as of june 30 2021 net interest income for the three months ended december 31 2021 net interest income was 5 5 million a decrease of 69 thousand or 1 2 from the quarter ended december 31 2020 the decrease in net interest income was primarily due to a decrease in interest income on loans partially offset by an increase in the interest income on investments and a decrease in interest expense on deposits and borrowings we improved our asset mix by utilizing some of the excess cash on our statement of financial condition to purchase high quality investments resulting in an increase in the average balance and yield on investments we also originated 27 3 million of new loans including 24 8 million of commercial loans that were offset by significant payoffs primarily in the residential portfolio in addition we experienced a 533 thousand decrease in interest expense primarily due to the re pricing of deposits in the current low interest rate environment and the prepayment of advances from the fhlb of pittsburgh the net interest margin measured 3 00 for the three months ended december 31 2021 compared to 2 80 for the three months ended september 30 2021 and 3 29 for the three months ended december 31 2020 the increase in the net interest margin during the three months ended december 31 2021 compared to the three months ended september 30 2021 was primarily due to the previously mentioned improved asset mix the year over year decrease in the net interest margin is consistent with the low interest rates and current margin compression that is primarily due to the ongoing covid 19 pandemic and its continued impact on the economy and interest rate environment for the six months ended december 31 2021 net interest income was 10 8 million a decrease of 24 thousand or 0 2 from the six months ended december 31 2020 the decrease in net interest income was primarily due to a decrease in interest income on loans partially offset by an increase in the interest income on investments and a decrease in interest expense on deposits and borrowings as previously discussed we improved our asset mix by utilizing some of the excess cash we hold on our statement of financial condition to purchase high quality investments resulting in an increase in interest income on investments we also originated 51 0 million of new loans including 42 8 million of commercial loans that were offset by significant payoffs primarily in the residential portfolio in addition we experienced a 1 3 million decrease in interest expense primarily due to the re pricing of deposits in the current low interest rate environment and the prepayment of advances from the fhlb of pittsburgh the net interest margin measured 2 90 for the six months ended december 31 2021 compared to 3 19 for the same period in 2020 the decrease in the net interest margin is consistent with the recent decrease in interest rates and current margin compression that is primarily due to the ongoing covid 19 pandemic and its continued impact on the economy and interest rate environment non interest income for the three months ended december 31 2021 non interest income totaled 664 thousand a decrease of 176 thousand or 21 0 from the three months ended december 31 2020 the decrease was primarily due to a 454 thousand net gain on the disposition of premises recorded during the three months ended december 31 2020 in connection with the sale of several properties acquired as part of the acquisitions of fidelity savings association of bucks county and washington savings bank in may 2020 this decrease to non interest income was partially offset by a 180 thousand increase in earnings on bank owned life insurance due to the purchase of additional boli during the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 and a 57 thousand increase in service fees consistent with our increase in core deposits for the six months ended december 31 2021 non interest income totaled 1 4 million an increase of 129 thousand or 10 4 from the six months ended december 31 2020 the increase in non interest income was primarily due to a 306 thousand increase in earnings on bank owned life insurance a 140 thousand unrealized net gain on equity securities recorded during the six months ended december 31 2021 a 92 thousand increase in the net gain on the sale of securities and an 87 thousand increase in service fees consistent with our increase in core deposits these increases to non interest income were partially offset by a 469 thousand net gain on the disposition of premises recorded during the six months ended december 31 2020 in connection with the sale of the previously discussed properties non interest expense for the three months ended december 31 2021 non interest expense totaled 4 8 million an increase of 178 thousand or 3 8 from the three months ended december 31 2020 the increase in non interest expense was primarily due to a 270 thousand increase in salaries and employee benefits due to the addition of new employees in connection with the build out of the company s commercial lending and credit functions and branch expansion partially offset by a 90 thousand decrease in data processing expense for the six months ended december 31 2021 non interest expense totaled 9 7 million an increase of 310 thousand or 3 3 from the six months ended december 31 2020 the increase in non interest expense was primarily due to a 428 thousand increase in salaries and employee benefits due to the addition of new employees in connection with the build out of the company s commercial lending and credit functions and branch expansion and an 84 thousand increase in professional fees these increases to non interest expense were partially offset by a 97 thousand decrease in prepayment penalties associated with the prepayment of 7 0 million and 23 2 million of advances from the fhlb of pittsburgh during the quarters ended september 30 2021 and 2020 respectively and a 91 thousand decrease in data processing expense income taxes for the three

compared to a 516 thousand provision for income taxes reflecting an effective tax rate of 20 1 for the same period in 2020 the decrease in the provision for income taxes for the three and six months ended december 31 2021 compared to the same periods a year ago is primarily due to a 53 thousand and a 288 thousand income tax benefit recorded during the three and six months ended december 31 2021 respectively related to refunds received associated with the carryback of net operating losses under the cares act and a decrease in income before income taxes the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended december 31 2021 compared to the same periods a year ago was also impacted by the previously discussed income tax benefit from refunds received associated with the carryback of net operating losses under the cares act asset quality the provision for loan losses was a 30 thousand net recovery during the six months ended december 31 2021 compared to an expense of 98 thousand during the six months ended december 31 2020 the provision credit for the six months ended december 31 2021 was primarily due to an improving economic outlook combined with continued stable asset

2021 net interest income was 5 5 million a decrease of 69 thousand or 1 2 from the quarter ended december 31 2020 the decrease in net interest income was primarily due to a decrease in interest income on loans partially offset by an increase in the interest income on investments and a decrease in interest expense on deposits and borrowings we improved our asset mix by utilizing some of the excess cash on our statement of financial condition to purchase high quality investments resulting in an increase in the average balance and yield on investments we also originated 27 3 million of new loans including 24 8 million of commercial loans that were offset by significant payoffs primarily in the residential portfolio in addition we experienced a 533 thousand decrease in interest expense primarily due to the re pricing of deposits in the current low interest rate environment and the prepayment of advances from the fhlb of pittsburgh the net interest margin measured 3 00 for the three months ended december 31 2021 compared to 2 80 for the three months ended september 30 2021 and 3 29 for the three months ended december 31 2020 the increase in the net interest margin during the three months ended december 31 2021 compared to the three months ended september 30 2021 was primarily due to the previously mentioned improved asset mix the year over year decrease in the net interest margin is consistent with the low interest rates and current margin compression that is primarily due to the ongoing covid 19 pandemic and its continued impact on the economy and interest rate environment for the six months ended december 31 2021 net interest income was 10 8 million a decrease of 24 thousand or 0 2 from the six months ended december 31 2020 the decrease in net interest

interest income for the three months ended december 31 2021 non interest income totaled 664 thousand a decrease of 176 thousand or 21 0 from the three months ended december 31 2020 the decrease was primarily due to a 454 thousand net gain on the disposition of premises recorded during the three months ended december 31 2020 in connection with the sale of several properties acquired as part of the acquisitions of fidelity savings association of bucks county and washington savings bank in may 2020 this decrease to non interest income was partially offset by a 180 thousand increase in earnings on bank owned life insurance due to the purchase of additional boli during the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 and a 57 thousand increase in service fees consistent with our increase in core deposits for the six months ended december 31 2021 non interest income totaled 1 4 million an increase of 129 thousand or 10 4 from the six months ended december 31 2020 the

months ended december 31 2021 a 92 thousand increase in the net gain on the sale of securities and an 87 thousand increase in service fees consistent with our increase in core deposits these increases

december 31 2020 the increase in non interest expense was primarily due to a 270 thousand increase in salaries and employee benefits due to the addition of new employees in connection with the build out of the company s commercial lending and credit functions and branch expansion partially offset by a 90 thousand decrease in data processing expense for the six months ended december 31 2021 non interest expense totaled 9 7 million an increase of 310 thousand or 3 3 from the six months ended december 31 2020 the increase in non interest expense was primarily due to a 428 thousand increase in salaries and employee benefits due to the addition of new employees in connection with the build out of the company s commercial lending and credit functions and branch expansion and an 84 thousand increase in professional fees these increases to non interest expense were partially offset by a 97 thousand decrease in prepayment penalties associated with the prepayment of 7 0 million and 23 2

respectively related to refunds received associated with the carryback of net operating losses under the cares act and a decrease in income before income taxes the effective tax rate for the three and

during the six months ended december 31 2020 the provision credit for the six months ended december 31 2021 was primarily due to an improving economic outlook combined with continued stable asset

cash on our statement of financial condition to purchase high quality investments resulting in an increase in the average balance and yield on investments we also originated 27 3 million of new loans including 24 8 million of commercial loans that were offset by significant payoffs primarily in the residential portfolio in addition we experienced a 533 thousand decrease in interest expense

months ended december 31 2021 compared to 2 80 for the three months ended september 30 2021 and 3 29 for the three months ended december 31 2020 the increase in the net interest margin during the three months ended december 31 2021 compared to the three months ended september 30 2021 was primarily due to the previously mentioned improved asset mix the year over year decrease in the net interest margin is consistent with the low interest rates and current margin compression that is primarily due to the ongoing covid 19 pandemic and its continued impact on the economy and interest rate environment for the six months ended december 31 2021 net interest income was 10 8 million a decrease of 24 thousand or 0 2 from the six months ended december 31 2020 the decrease in net interest income was primarily due to a decrease in interest income on loans partially offset by an increase in the interest income on investments and a decrease in interest expense on deposits and borrowings

interest income on investments we also originated 51 0 million of new loans including 42 8 million of commercial loans that were offset by significant payoffs primarily in the residential portfolio in

of pittsburgh the net interest margin measured 2 90 for the six months ended december 31 2021 compared to 3 19 for the same period in 2020 the decrease in the net interest margin is consistent with the recent decrease in interest rates and current margin compression that is primarily due to the ongoing covid 19 pandemic and its continued impact on the economy and interest rate environment non interest income for the three months ended december 31 2021 non interest income totaled 664 thousand a decrease of 176 thousand or 21 0 from the three months ended december 31 2020 the decrease was primarily due to a 454 thousand net gain on the disposition of premises recorded during the three months ended december 31 2020 in connection with the sale of several properties acquired as part of the acquisitions of fidelity savings association of bucks county and washington savings bank in may 2020 this decrease to non interest income was partially offset by a 180 thousand increase in earnings on bank owned life insurance due to the purchase of additional boli during the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 and a 57 thousand increase in service fees consistent with our increase in core deposits for the six months ended december 31 2021 non interest income totaled 1 4 million an increase of 129 thousand or 10 4 from the six months ended december 31 2020 the

months ended december 31 2021 a 92 thousand increase in the net gain on the sale of securities and an 87 thousand increase in service fees consistent with our increase in core deposits these increases to non interest income were partially offset by a 469 thousand net gain on the disposition of premises recorded during the six months ended december 31 2020 in connection with the sale of the previously discussed properties non interest expense for the three months ended december 31 2021 non interest expense totaled 4 8 million an increase of 178 thousand or 3 8 from the three months ended december 31 2020 the increase in non interest expense was primarily due to a 270 thousand increase in salaries and employee benefits due to the addition of new employees in connection with the build out of the company s commercial lending and credit functions and branch expansion partially offset by a 90 thousand decrease in data processing expense for the six months ended december 31 2021 non interest expense totaled 9 7 million an increase of 310 thousand or 3 3 from the six months ended december 31 2020 the increase in non interest expense was primarily due to a 428 thousand increase in salaries and employee benefits due to the addition of new employees in connection with the build out of the company s commercial lending and credit functions and branch expansion and an 84 thousand increase in professional fees these increases to non interest expense were partially offset by a 97 thousand decrease in prepayment penalties associated with the prepayment of 7 0 million and 23 2 million of advances from the fhlb of pittsburgh during the quarters ended september 30 2021 and 2020 respectively and a 91 thousand decrease in data processing expense income taxes for the three

ended december 31 2021 compared to the same periods a year ago is primarily due to a 53 thousand and a 288 thousand income tax benefit recorded during the three and six months ended december 31 2021 respectively related to refunds received associated with the carryback of net operating losses under the cares act and a decrease in income before income taxes the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended december 31 2021 compared to the same periods a year ago was also impacted by the previously discussed income tax benefit from refunds received associated with the carryback of net operating losses under the cares act asset quality the provision for loan losses was a 30 thousand net recovery during the six months ended december 31 2021 compared to an expense of 98 thousand during the six months ended december 31 2020 the provision credit for the six months ended december 31 2021 was primarily due to an improving economic outlook combined with continued stable asset

private investment trends in water and wastewater utilities by christopher mackin initial advice for utilities considering privatization public private partnerships and consolidation as the population increases and more people live in water scarce regions more demands are placed on already stressed water resources and systems in the u s many systems struggle with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events including droughts floods and freezes the water sector municipal officials and local governments face many barriers to properly addressing these issues from fragmentation within the industry to increasingly stringent standards and regulations as well as limited funding moving from publicly operated water services to privatization and or consolidation may be an attractive option for communities that want to improve their water systems receiving investments from private equity partners and or combining resources with nearby utilities offers municipal water systems the potential to improve their efficiency sustainability and fiscal stability this consequently offers value to communities if it streamlines processes and reduces their costs there is significant demand for new water supplies novel wastewater treatment and potable and non potable water reuse but local decision makers should understand all of the variables to ensure their communities are protected this article explores many facets of privatization including what s driving the current demand for improved water systems in the u s why are investors interested in water and wastewater utilities what utilities should understand when considering privatization public private partnerships p3s or consolidation how to plan a successful merger or acquisition what s driving demand in the u s demand for private acquisition of water systems in the u s has been increasing for a while between growing communities in water scarce regions aging infrastructure and years of underinvestment plus financial stresses exacerbated by the pandemic the private sector is positioned to help especially when considering historically low interest rates and increased support from governments around the world to transform outdated systems growing population most of the growth within the water and wastewater treatment market is driven by rapidly growing population and urbanization new residents can strain current systems as they move to areas with limited water supplies and research has projected that many regions of the u s experiencing population growth including parts of the great plains the southwest central rocky mountain states california the south and the midwest could see their fresh water supply decrease by as much as one third1 within the next 50 years aging infrastructure increased demand for new water resources also spotlights issues related to aging infrastructure and years of underinvestment exacerbated by years of underinvestment and new challenges from climate change many systems need investments to make them more sustainable both short and long term aging water infrastructure also loses water at an alarming rate and it s estimated that drinking water systems in the u s currently lose at least 2 1 trillion gallons of treated water per year2 approximately 7 6 billion to water main breaks and leaky pipes financial impacts of covid 19 on the water sector water and wastewater systems experienced financial shocks during the pandemic and the cost of covid 19 on water and wastewater utilities combined is predicted to exceed 27 billion3 due to utilities eliminating shutoffs for non payment anticipated increased delinquencies and reductions in non residential water demands taking all of this together with increasingly stringent standards industry stakeholders may consider privatization or consolidation to help their communities better deliver on their promise of safe water and a clean environment financial support in the u s president biden proposed a comprehensive approach to improving infrastructure through his american jobs plan while the plan was still up for debate at the time this was written details included 111 billion in clean water and drinking water investments the plan proposed prioritizing federal spending on several aspects of water quality proposing including 56 billion toward upgrading and modernizing america s wastewater stormwater and drinking water systems through grants and low cost loans 45 billion toward removing all of the lead service lines across the country 10 billion toward monitoring and remediating pfas in drinking water the current administration also supports the bipartisan infrastructure framework a 1 2 trillion transformational investment in clean water infrastructure clean power infrastructure remediation of legacy pollution climate change resiliency and more this plan is the largest investment in clean drinking water and wastewater infrastructure in american history the framework calls for the elimination of all lead pipes and service lines in the country s drinking water systems 55 billion toward building out and repairing water infrastructure 5 billion toward the western water shortage outside of federal support private markets are also well positioned to provide much needed capital along with innovative approaches that can help struggling communities interest rates have recently been at historic lows and in march of 2020 the federal reserve slashed interest rates to 0 percent to shield the economy from negative consequences of the coronavirus in turn private equity firms have been able to leverage debt with lower interest rates to acquire and improve assets like water systems investor interests financial markets around the globe periodically experience volatility as shown by the 2008 economic recession and recently with the covid 19 pandemic now investors are looking for financially stable recession proof businesses to act as a hedge against macroeconomic downturns water utilities have always been a safe harbor for capital during choppy times in the equity markets investors trade off beta or volatility for more predictable yet modest returns says jud hill cofounder and managing partner at ecological service partners an investment fund dedicated to environmental services and water assets in fact water utility equities have often been referred to as widow and orphan stocks because of their low risk profile to hill s point investors have historically purchased water and power utilities as long term holdings for their dividend income and stability while this still holds true the trend toward clean energy along with friendly legislation and heightened investments in renewable energy

more potential to expand customer count than other utilities while producing steady returns when looking at the whole picture it is not surprising that many water utilities actually jumped 10 to 15 percentage points in value during the first quarter of 2020 coinciding with the onset of the pandemic this was a classic flight to quality or safety as water has always had reasonably stable demand added hill now water utilities are trading at their pre pandemic values and have seen little volatility over the last 18 months as described in the following sections utility privatization p3s and consolidation offer water and wastewater systems different benefits but there are key differences between these strategies that stakeholders should understand before moving forward privatization privatization is when a government owned property or business becomes privately owned the current low interest rate environment will likely encourage increased privatization of assets as investors acquire them at low cost when a public utility considers changing to become privately owned and managed there are three key groups that will have to be convinced in order to ensure a deal goes through policymakers community members and the press these groups have the power to make or break a deal so it s critical to address their questions and concerns utilities their investors and their partners should arrange public meetings with community members prepare clear messaging about their proposal and be prepared to make necessary changes most importantly they need to listen to the customers if utility customers are saying they value public utilities and have no desire for privatization that carries a lot of weight elected officials will want to keep their constituents happy public private partnerships governments can also work in tandem with the private sector via p3s for potential cost savings p3s involve cooperation between the public and private sectors in one or more areas of the design development construction operation ownership or financing of infrastructure assets or in the provision of services according to a report from the reason foundation5 the city of tampa was able to save 85 million on a 15 year water public private partnership and also saved 50 percent on a 30 year deal for its desalination plant by tapping the private sector instead of using in house service the report also cites seattle as another example of privatization cost reductions where the city was able to save a combined 120 million on separate projects by not using in house services consolidation consolidation of utilities involves combining assets liabilities and other financial items of two or more entities into one the different types of consolidation include direct acquisition higher capacity utility acquires the assets operations and customers of another system and absorbs them into its existing governance operational and financial frameworks joint merger two or more relatively equal partners both adjust governance operations and financial frameworks to create a new entity that is owned and controlled by the previously separate parties balanced merger two or more entities consolidate with the goal of establishing a governance structure that provides a basis for at least some direct participation by the preexisting utility in future decision making regional agreements do not combine legal entities but rather pool utility resources buying power and technical expertise to do more across a wider area than a single utility could do alone as an example the city of raleigh merged seven local utilities6 into a full service regional water and wastewater provider serving 570 000 people over a 299 square mile service area the consolidation resulted in the creation of lower regional uniform rates reduced operational and maintenance costs and improved efficiencies in water and wastewater asset investment as well as access to lower cost capital overall the consolidation of these systems is estimated to have saved the region an aggregate of approximately 350 million successful mergers and acquisitions if a water or wastewater system undergoes a merger or is purchased there are certain things they should know to ensure they receive the best deal while protecting customers build a strong team going through an m a process alone is not advisable at minimum utilities should have a business attorney a certified public accountant cpa a certified financial planner cfp and an industry consultant to protect their interests during the transaction clearly define goals with their team of advisors utilities should determine what they want to achieve with private equity partners or consolidation whether the current owner operator is moving on completely or merging with nearby facilities the level of involvement post transaction will help determine the right private equity firm and avoid regrets down the line know what the utility is actually worth understanding a utility s true value helps in framing negotiations and setting realistic expectations a reputable advisor should be present to help with this process understand earnouts buyers will sometimes offer the seller an earnout or contingent payments which is money set aside until certain performance targets are achieved by the seller careful consideration should be given to earnouts because some contingencies can quickly turn into golden handcuffs between the nation s growing population and rapid urbanization the need to identify and create new water sources continues to grow this will continue to drive the private sector s interest in the water and wastewater treatment market particularly because water utilities are viewed as low risk investments with consistent demand ultimately privatization and consolidation of water assets can offer communities and investors improved efficiency financial stability and greater sustainability references about the

washington the decision of pot banking reform s biggest champion to leave congress at year end won t doom the legislation but securing its passage this year could become trickier analysts say rep ed perlmutter d colo announced last week that he would not seek reelection in november a member of the house since 2007 perlmutter is known in financial policy circles for nearly a decade of advocacy for legislation that would allow regulated financial institutions to work with cannabis firms in states that have legalized the substance and while perlmutter s departure is a significant loss for house democrats analysts say the years of political groundwork already laid by his office won t be lost it takes more than one member to get a bill over the finish line and there are always potholes on the road said isaac boltansky managing director at btig but my bet is that perlmutter leaves congress later this year on a high with the banking act being signed into law senate majority leader chuck schumer left has prioritized full scale cannabis legalization over pot banking legislation however if that effort fails some provisions of the legalization bill could be added to the safe banking act championed by rep ed perlmutter d colorado bloomberg news the path of perlmutter s safe banking act has been bumpy even though it has secured decent bipartisan support on capitol hill in recent years it was first passed by the house in 2019 with almost half of the house republican caucus support in the two years since the bill has been adopted a total of five times by the house as a stand alone measure or as part of an annual defense spending package but the senate under both republican and democratic leadership has proven to be an enduring obstacle the chamber has never voted on the bill after democrats took control of the senate in 2021 senate majority leader chuck schumer vowed to pursue full scale cannabis legalization instead of the narrower pot banking reform i think the status of the bill is similar to what it has been for the past few years which is that it has solid support but needs a window of opportunity or a legislative vehicle to get through the senate said ian katz a managing director at capital alpha partners i don t think that has changed if democrats fail in the coming months to find the votes for comprehensive cannabis legalization analysts say pot banking reform will likely emerge as a promising legislative fallback by summer we expect democratic leaders will realize legalization lacks the required gop support said jaret seiberg an analyst with the cowen washington research group that should provide an opening to bring the safe act to the floor of the house and senate the safe banking act is a fairly targeted piece of legislation that would prohibit federal bank regulators from penalizing banks working with licensed cannabis businesses the bill would also tweak anti money laundering law to clarify that proceeds from legitimate cannabis businesses would not be considered unlawful activity if full scale cannabis legalization lacks the votes to become a reality analysts say some of its provisions could be added to the safe banking act an expanded bill could allow republicans and democrats to secure key policy objectives such as justice related measures making it easier for nonviolent cannabis offenders to expunge their criminal histories lawmakers could also widen the act s scope by allowing capital markets access for the cannabis industry a change that would make it simpler for cannabis firms to be publicly traded and financed on u s stock exchanges but some analysts say that political timing will be crucial if perlmutter moves too quickly to try and pass his signature bill before the senate attempts its broader push for cannabis legalization lawmakers may lose their chance to secure those other reforms via compromise our concern is that congress might never get to a compromise if rep perlmutter pushes too soon in 2022 to add the safe act to any bill that congress is likely to enact seiberg said if he were to succeed then that likely would close the door in this congress to other cannabis provisions like capital markets access at the same time however other analysts say there is also risk for lawmakers in waiting too long 2022 is an election year which can often discourage bipartisan compromise the bill always has a decent chance but it would be hard to say there s a greater than 50 chance it passes this year because you have a congress where not much gets through and now we re in an election year said katz in a statement provided to american banker perlmutter said his work on the bill is far from over and my not running for reelection doesn t change that getting the safe banking act across the finish line is one of my top priorities and i am pursuing every possible avenue to get the bill signed into law before the end of the year the colorado representative added

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video the permanent designation means the rule would have no built in expiration date but state health officials could still lift it when it s safe to do so portland ore oregon state health officials held a public hearing thursday morning to consider adopting a permanent indoor face mask rule but what does permanent mean a large number of recent social media posts right wing outlet headlines and even some mainstream news sites have presented the word permanent without context in the headline implying at first glance that the rule will continue forever the question does oregon s proposed mask rule being permanent mean it would remain in place forever the sources the answer no permanent does not mean the rule would be in place forever it s legal jargon not a literal description it means a rule can remain in place indefinitely without a prescribed expiration date but it can still be repealed what we found the oregon health authority put oregon s current indoor mask requirement in place in august when the state was being pummeled by the more contagious delta variant of the coronavirus that causes covid 19 the state s original mask mandate which was imposed through an executive order by gov kate brown not the oha was lifted two months earlier as vaccination drove case numbers downward the delta variant reversed that trend and oha enacted the new indoor mask rule to slow the spread oregon s numbers fell in the following three months but they were still far above pre delta levels in early december when oha s rules advisory committee began drafting the permanent rule and the subsequent arrival of the omicron variant pushed case rates to new record levels eclipsing the delta wave the mandate put in place in august was a temporary rule and is set to expire in early february just after the projected peak of the omicron wave oregon law gives oha the power to implement public health rules such as the mask mandate but the agency is only allowed to leave temporary rules in place for 180 days according to lead communications officer jonathan modie in order to keep a rule in place longer than 180 days the agency must go through a formal administrative process including soliciting public input and filing the rule with the secretary of state s office to adopt it as a permanent rule despite the name permanent rules can still be rescinded or cancelled if the oha determines that they are no longer necessary according to modie and the agency has indicated that it intends to do so in this case in a notice of proposed rulemaking published in mid december the oha said it was proposing that the oregon state public health director or oregon state health officer would have the authority to rescind the mask rule based on covid transmission hospitalization and death rates so permanent in this case just means the agency can leave the rule in place until case numbers fall back to a safe level rather than being forced to end the rule in the middle of a surge

a vital demographic of the american electorate swing state voters in the heartland who side with economic populists against corporate special interests are being sought after by a number of democrats running for the united states senate in october 2021 as breitbart news reported a pair of democrat strategists detailed an analysis of the 2020 presidential election which found that american communities devastated the most by globalization and u s free trade policy have drifted from the democrat party and moved toward republicans since 2012 the share of the democratic presidential vote in the midwest declined most precipitously between 2012 and 2020 in counties that experienced the steepest losses in manufacturing and union jobs and saw declines in health care the new york times reported at the time the ten states analyzed including ohio pennsylvania and wisconsin have lost nearly two million manufacturing jobs since the year 2000 from 2012 to 2020 democrats lost 2 63 million votes in the all important factory towns of the various states now across ohio pennsylvania and wisconsin democrats running for senate are trying to pull these swing voters back into the democrat party backing fiercely populist causes like banning congress from trading stocks and striking with union workers against corporations vowing to close u s plants while sen josh hawley r mo has filed legislation to ban congress from trading stocks though no senate republicans have signed onto the plan and house minority leader kevin mccarthy r ca considers backing similar legislation in the house house and senate republicans have ceded much of labor policy outside of immigration to the likes of sen bernie sanders i vt and others most notable is pennsylvania lt gov john fetterman d who is running for senate a spokesman for his campaign told axios that they are running an unabashedly working class campaign fetterman last year raised money to support union workers in lancaster pennsylvania whose jobs were being threatened with offshoring to mexico by the left wing kellogg s corporation only one republican gov pete ricketts of nebraska spoke out in support of the workers likewise fetterman has rebuked anti worker environmentalists in the democrat party specifically after they helped get a 1 5 billion project by u s steel canceled in the state in may of last year the investment would have brought thousands of middle class union jobs to eastern pennsylvania will never understand why i was one of the only elected officials who pushed for this major project proactively and enthusiastically while so many others turned their back on the working men and women of the steelworkers and building trades in allegheny county fetterman said tom nelson d running for senate in wisconsin is touting his work with union workers in the past that helped save a paper mill in outagamie county from shuttering in ohio last month rep tim ryan d won the endorsement of the united auto workers uaw and the state s carpenters union in his bid for senate even in cases where historically gop constituencies of union workers have protested left wing corporations house and senate republicans have remained silent democrats on the other hand have reached out to the workers for months coal miners with the united mine workers of america umwa from west virginia pennsylvania and alabama have been striking against warrior met coal whose biggest shareholder is wall street s 22 billion firm blackrock house and senate republicans have been largely silent as sens elizabeth warren d ma sherrod brown d oh bernie sanders i vt and tammy baldwin d wi have publicly backed the coal miners in their fight to win a better labor contract last week for instance warren baldwin and sanders called on blackrock ceo larry fink a donor to failed presidential candidate hillary clinton and senate majority leader chuck schumer d ny who celebrated president joe biden s victory to

washington world bank president david malpass on wednesday criticized microsoft s us 69 billion takeover of gaming developer activision blizzard as a questionable allocation of capital at a time when poor countries are struggling to restructure debts and fight covid 19 and poverty malpass said during a peterson institute for international economics virtual event that more capital needed to flow into poor countries but these flows have been disrupted by unusually easy monetary policies in developed countries he said he was struck by the scale of microsoft s acquisition deal for call of duty maker activision blizzard this dwarfed the 23 5 billion in cash contributions agreed in december by wealthier donor countries to the international development association the world bank s fund for the poorest countries about 8 billion annually over three years he said you have to wonder wait a minute is this the best allocation of capital malpass said of the microsoft deal this goes to the bond market you know a huge amount of capital flows are going to the bond market a very small portion of the developing world has access to such bond financing while too much capital remains bottled up in advanced countries especially in central bank reserve assets used to back long term bond purchases he added a spokesperson for microsoft did not immediately respond to a reuters request for comment on malpass remarks his comments echoed a similar call last week for central banks to cut long term bond holdings to free up lending capital that gets you into a situation where a huge amount of the capital is being allocated to already capital intensive parts of the world the advanced economies building more and more on top of already heavily built infrastructure and real estate for example malpass said meanwhile a return to more normal global investment returns is needed to bring more financing capacity to small businesses in the developing world he said in order to address the refugee flow that malnutrition that s going on and so on there has to be more money and growth flowing into the developing countries malpass added reporting by david lawder editing by david gregorio and sandra maler

interest income net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 145 5 million an increase of 13 0 million from the linked quarter and an increase of 14 4 million from the prior year period the increase from the linked quarter was primarily due to higher interest income as a result of acquired earning assets from the bank of commerce in addition to securities purchased during the quarter and higher prepayment interest the increase in net interest income from the prior year period was mainly due to the same items noted above for the comparison to the linked quarter for additional information regarding net interest income see the net interest margin section and the average balances and rates tables provision for credit losses columbia recorded an 11 1 million provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to no provision for the linked quarter and a net provision recovery of 4 7 million for the comparable quarter in 2020 the provision for credit

of the combined portfolio andy mcdonald columbia s executive vice president and chief credit officer stated our credit metrics continue to improve provision expense during the quarter was a reflection of the acquisition of bank of commerce and was partially offset by a recapture related to the strength of the legacy columbia portfolio noninterest income noninterest income was 24 2 million for the fourth quarter of 2021 an increase of 282 thousand from the linked quarter and an increase of 678 thousand from the fourth quarter of 2020 the increase compared to the linked quarter was due to increased deposit account fees and card revenue as a result of the bank of commerce acquisition the increase in noninterest income during the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter in 2020 was mainly due to the same items as noted above for comparison to the linked quarter in addition increased financial services and trust revenue was partially offset by a decrease in mortgage banking due to a decrease in the mortgage pipeline and total volume of funded home loans noninterest expense total noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 102 6 million an increase of 12 6 million compared to the third quarter of 2021 the increase was mainly due to increases in compensation and employee benefits expense mostly attributable to our acquisition of bank of commerce as well as legal and professional fees that were primarily due to our acquisition of bank of commerce and proposed merger with umpqua total acquisition related expenses for the quarter were 11 8 million these increases were partially offset by a decrease in other noninterest expense driven by a 2 0 million recapture of allowance for unfunded loan commitments as noted in the following table compared

a decrease of 12 basis points from the linked quarter and a decrease of 47 basis points from the prior year period the decrease in the net interest margin tax equivalent compared to the linked quarter was primarily due to a decrease in loan yields partially offset by higher yields on securities due to prepayment interest the average cost of total deposits for both the fourth and linked quarter of 2021 was 4 basis points the decrease in the net interest margin tax equivalent compared to the prior year period was driven by lower average rates on loans and securities as well as a higher ratio of taxable securities which had an average rate of 1 93 for the current quarter for additional information regarding net interest margin see the average balances and rates tables columbia s operating net interest margin tax equivalent 2 was 3 08 for the fourth quarter of 2021 a decrease of 8 basis points from the linked quarter and a decrease of 43 basis points compared to the prior year period the
