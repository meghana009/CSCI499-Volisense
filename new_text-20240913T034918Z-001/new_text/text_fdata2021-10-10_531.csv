the country could close within weeks as gas prices continue to soar one industry leader has warned the government that factories across the country could stop production due to rising prices andrew large director general at the confederation of paper industries attended a meeting on friday with the business secretary and other representatives of energy intensive industries to discuss the wholesale gas crisis speaking to the bbc radio 4 s pm programme afterwards mr large claimed it was very clear across all of the sectors that there are serious risks factories could stop all activities as a result of the gas prices being too high at his conservative party conference speech earlier this week mr johnson promised that the uk would become a higher wage higher productivity economy mr large said when we talked with the secretary of state this afternoon it was very very clear across all of the sectors that there are serious risks of effectively factory stoppages as a result of the costs of gas being too high to bear and in those circumstances there will be a gradual knock on effect through supply chains right the way across manufacturing consumer retail and other products and so the risks are very very real when asked what this would mean for the paper industry mr large said it would be incredibly damaging for profitability but mr large did say the meeting was a positive first step to look at the solutions they had proposed and that kwasi kwarteng clearly furthers our desire to avoid any potential supply chain disruption the energy intensive users group eiug echoed mr

regions where steel is they re highly skilled as well if you re paying as much for gas and electricity as we are as a steel sector then these unprecedented price rises are hurting us now today if the prime minister and government does nothing to help us they could start to strangle steel production here in the uk and rather than working towards a high wage economy we ll actually be walking blindly towards a low wage economy advertisement as the gas crisis escalated ofgem warned there will also be a significant rise to the cap on energy bills hitting millions of britain s poorest people with soaring energy prices set to push average annual bills through the 2 000 barrier for the first time ofgem chief executive jonathan brearley didn t put a figure on it but said there will be a significant rise in the price cap set by the industry regulator which helps to control the cost of gas and electricity in the uk he didn t knock back claims that fixed and other deals could reach 2 000 in 2022 we can t predict everything and the wholesale market as we ve seen has gone up and down extremely quickly so we can t predict fully what that will be he told bbc radio 4 s today programme but looking at the costs that are in the system we are expecting a significant rise in april but mr brearley added that the current price cap will remain until april we have no plans to raise the price cap before april he said in the face of the ongoing energy crisis london based money saving expert martin lewis has urged customers to do nothing he said those who want cheaper energy deals shouldn t shop around like normal instead he insisted inaction is now the best action speaking on his eponymous itv show on thursday martin said customers should pick deals that match their energy providers price cap or wait until they are given one when their current deal ends the finance expert explained do nothing do nothing energy prices are rising energy firms are falling the cheapest

the wholesale gas price is the price firms pay and in the uk a lot of our electricity is heated by gas so it hits the electricity price too it was normally about 50p therm you ll see it has exploded in the last few months it s now well over five times the normal amount and that s hideous the energy crisis has been blamed in part on a shortage of natural gas caused by vladimir putin allegedly choking supplies to europe to pressurise regulators into approving the controversial nord stream 2 pipeline yesterday boris johnson waded into the row branding the link a threat to energy security and suggesting the decision to bypass ukraine to bring supplies direct to germany would damage the ukrainian economy a no 10 spokesman said although nord stream 2 will not directly impact the uk s energy security it could have serious implications for central and eastern european countries some european countries are nearly wholly dependent on russian gas which raises serious concerns about energy security in comments reported by the times the spokesman also warned about the damage to ukraine which currently hosts the largest pipeline network for russian gas and benefits from large transit fees he added nord stream 2 would divert supplies away from ukraine with significant consequences for its economy the natural gas price is currently hovering at around 2 40 a therm down from more than 4 yesterday after traders were reassured by putin hinting that russia would consider increasing exports he said so our paper mill will be wanting to operate 24 7 365 days a year with the exception of planned stoppages for maintenance and so on so the financial sustainability of that paper mill is dependent upon being able to maximise its uptime every minute that the machinery isn t working every minute that paper isn t being produced is a damage to the profitability of the sector and a damage to the future investment potential and opportunities going forward the south east is still in the

source told the publication that it could be extended if problems persist past the beginning of november when the order will run out andrew large director general at the confederation of paper industries said its members are being affected very very severely by cost increases with toilet roll and packaging among the items that could be hit hardest he said they re seeing their costs go up through the roof it s damaging their profitability and in some cases it s causing them to manage their production rates so as not to expose themselves to the very very highest costs meanwhile baked beans have become the latest victims of soaring inflation with the head of manufacturer kraft heinz yesterday revealing the cost of the breakfast staple will have to go up miguel patricio ceo of kraft heinz which makes a range of other products including philadelphia spread and capri sun said that inflation was widespread globally and costs were rising in previous years there was inflation in coffee because of a bad crop or a bad crop in beans what is different now is that this inflation is across the board he told bbc radio 4 s today programme so it s impossible to navigate through this moment of inflation without increasing prices it s up to us and to the industry and to other companies to try to minimise these price increases one in ten british businesses put up their prices in the past month due to the rising costs the office for national statistics ons latest business survey for september shows meanwhile nearly a third of companies have seen a higher than normal increase in running costs and many have been forced to pass this on to customers companies in construction services and manufacturing were the worst hit as 10 per cent said they needed to raise prices last month up from 8 per cent in mid august and 4 per cent early in 2021 the data showed that of these nearly a quarter 23 per cent were retailers in consumer facing sectors and 25 per cent were in the manufacturing industry the stark data came as the soaring cost of electricity and gas hit industries such as steel glass and chemicals meaning consumers will soon be paying more for a huge number of products including cars building materials food packaging and even toilet roll factories have moved to reduce their output to save on costs as the price of energy went through the roof with some demanding government support to keep running it came as the bank of england s new chief economist huw pill used his first interview in the in the job to warn that britain faces a greater than expected rise in inflation over the coming months which with further hammer households and businesses mr pill said he expects increasing costs of living should subside as the pandemic recedes but with inflation already at a nine year high of 3 2 per cent he gave the chilling warning the magnitude and duration of the transient inflation spike is proving greater than expected britons and their businesses are being battered by a perfect storm of inflation and supply chain problems with experts predicted inflation could still reach 5 by christmas an earlier version of this story suggested that senior tories had been seen panic buying this has been amended and we are happy to clarify that the column in the financial times on which it was based had in fact stated that several top party

rebuffing the widespread agitation to reset nigeria s lopsided political system the president major general muhammadu buhari retd initiated another round of controversy within the education sector by unilaterally increasing the salary of teachers to mark world teachers day 2021 buhari promised that the government would enhance teachers salaries at the primary and secondary school levels he nailed down january 2022 for implementation in a federal political system this is insensitive of the president no matter his intentions buhari is in the wrong to impose the centre s decision to raise teachers pay on the federating units the states because education is on the concurrent list the president has no constitutional right to do that in many critical areas of national life the disdain of the centre for true federalism is deeply hurting efforts to make the system work for most nigerians besides the federal government owns just 104 unity schools and those run by the federal capital territory administration out of nigeria s estimated 13 029 public secondary schools as of 2018 it is completely unwise not to collaborate with the states before taking decisions on behalf of the majority outrageously organised labour has fallen for buhari s populism again during the 2020 wtd buhari promised similar reform in the teaching profession a year later he has not fulfilled it the president had increased the service period for teachers from 35 years to 40 years of service and from 60 to 65 years as retirement age whichever comes first in a country where youth unemployment underemployment is 42 5 21 0 percent respectively it is an illogical prescription moreover the plan is woolly not tied to any concrete economic projections currently nigeria is borrowing heavily as of march 2021 the debt management office put the total public debt stock at 87 23 billion uneconomically it uses 98 7 percent of its revenue for debt servicing it plans to borrow more the pertinent question is where buhari plans to source the extra revenue to service the proposed salary increment the president is tilting more towards sentiments than rational economic decision making it is precisely why what he intends to do is receiving strident opposition from the states while many states are indebted statistics from the national bureau of statistics consistently show that most of them are not fiscally viable up to this point many of the sub national governments have not implemented the 2018 minimum wage law of n30 000 per month not surprisingly the punch anticipated the crisis when buhari initially broached the reforms during the wtd last year in an editorial entitled new special salary scale for teachers in october 2020 this newspaper said no doubt any measure undertaken by the government to motivate teachers in the country towards better service delivery in their respective areas of assignment is laudable but it is obvious that the ground is being prepared for an intractable crisis in the sector going by the way the federal government went about this all important task all on its own without collaborating with state governments and other stakeholders it does not bode well that the federal government ignored the fact that education is on the concurrent legislative list of the 1999 constitution which requires multi stakeholder buy in and wide consultation among the three tiers of government in cross cutting policy initiatives arguing presciently the punch added in fact the governors should be resolute in their opposition to the unilateral imposition of the new special salary scale the country can ill afford a replication of the chaos that has followed a similar agreement between the federal government and the academic staff union of universities that contract has hobbled seamless academic activities since 2009 having failed to take into consideration the huge financial implications on the state governments which bear the brunt of funding a large proportion of the universities in the country another agreement it signed with resident doctors to stave off strikes has remained un implementable to many states it is a demonstration of the bizarre federalism practised in nigeria where the central government suffocates the other tiers of government by entering into agreements with labour unions with an overarching impact on the states this is wrong this newspaper had advised both the teachers and the federal government the teachers need to see the increase of their service years from 35 to 40 years as a poisoned chalice and a greek gift the best response is to reject it for what it is for a country confronted with huge unemployment estimated by the pwc an international audit and consulting firm to reach 30 percent by the fourth quarter of 2020 raising the retirement age is ludicrous and illogical what is the rationale in keeping tired and spent teachers longer on the job when so many qualified unemployed young graduates are looking for what to do in other countries governments encourage early retirement to create room for the employment of young blood to rejuvenate the system and provide jobs for the youth population instead of implementing this wrong headed policy we encourage the government to consider giving incentives to teachers who have put in a minimum of 30 years or thereabout in service to enable them to retire early to create room for young teachers who are innovative imaginative technology adept and attuned to the realities and demands of the times buhari is just toying with education he should re examine his reform to deescalate tensions in the polity the president should allow states to determine their fate for now the only bright spot could be the proposal to pay n75 000 per semester to undergraduates of education in federal tertiary institutions the intention is noble since it does not impose any burden on state governments to do the same it could inspire real interest in the teaching profession but it could also generate dissonance because funding this is a tough call for a government reeling in debt as is done in the united states the federal government could create a special fund that will give states grants to defray their burden copyright punch all rights reserved this material and other digital content on this website may not be reproduced published broadcast

the thousands from accidents and tropical diseases malaria and dengue fever the dead included minor keith s uncle meiggs and keith s brothers leaving keith in chrage of the project the railroad s reputation for killing its workers made it impossible to hire enough local labor so keith recruited convicts from new orleans only 25 of the seven hundred convicts hired survived the construction and returned to new orleans around 1873 keith planted banana trees in the railroad s right of way in the province of limón in order to cut food costs for his workers midway through the project keith

in central america the nation of guatemala contracted its postal system to the united fruit company in 1901 in 1903 united fruit commenced the first refrigerated steamship service and the united state

country s main rail line from guatemala city to puerto barrios by 1908 keith s railway connected puerto barrios to guatemala city allowing united fruit to develop banana plantations in the guatemalan lowlands and eventually built roads connecting to the pacific and to mexico s railway system in 1911 at that time keith conceived a new company called the international railways of central america

making him the largest shareholder united fruit s share prices had been devasted by the 1929 crash and kept dropping after zemurray bought in from 158 a share to 10 a share in 1932 with his original 30 million fortune reduced to 2 million zemurray had to come out of retirement and kick some butt at this point zemurray stormed into to the board of directors meeting the company had long been a preserve of the boston elite and daniel g wing chairman of the first national bank of boston displayed his disdain by replying to zemurray that he could not understand his russian accent unfortunately mr zemurray i can t understand a word of what you say wing said while smiling thinly zemurray was infuriated and quickly he went out and gathered up proxies allowing him to take control of the company

commentary how revealing a little punctuation mark may be a recent headline in the left leaning once liberal newspaper the guardian ran a story with a headline as follows university defends academic freedoms after calls to sack professor the university was sussex and the professor was kathleen stock a feminist philosopher she was accused of the thoughtcrime of transphobia by an anonymous group which demanded that she be sacked from the university the vice chancellor professor alan tickell was forthright in his response alas untypically so for persons in his position we cannot and will not tolerate threats to cherished academic freedoms and will take any action necessary to protect the rights of our community professor stock s thoughtcrime was to have thought and said openly that you cannot change your biological identity simply by wishing to do so and by taking a few drugs or having a few operations your identity is not determined wholly by what you feel that you are or what you would like to be some things are given among them sex reality places limits upon us a person who undergoes sex change procedures as they are currently practiced is only metaphorically a person of the sex opposite to his or her original biological sex one day it may be possible for science to go further than the current crude methods permit but that day is probably a long way off for the moment as robert burns put it in another context a man s a man for a that until this call for professor stock to be sacked from her chair of philosophy i confess that i did not know anything about her but these days it is easy to familiarize yourself with someone s work at least in outline and it is clear that she is not an extremist of the kind who would say call for the removal of trans gender persons to prison camps or anything remotely similar she is concerned mainly with the untruth of the claims made by some activists who use untrue claims to influence public policy whether or not you agree with her is hardly the question though in fact she couches her arguments in the language of rationality and without stridency she is accused of transphobia these days activists of many kinds reduce those who disagree with them to the mental level of those who are irrationally afraid of spiders though with the connotation not only of irrationality but of moral defect and of course moral defect is a good pretext for shutting people up after all why should bad people be allowed to speak those who called for her dismissal were in effect saying that no one who holds her views should be allowed to teach in a university only those with certifiably correct views should be permitted to do so as fidel castro put it fifty years ago within the revolution everything against the revolution nothing the guardian s headline was interesting because of the quotation marks around the words academic freedoms these quotation marks were meant to imply that the very notion of academic freedom is fictitious or worse a kind of smokescreen for permission to express reactionary ideas and put them into practice the theory of knowledge that this implies is that of marx that a person s beliefs are but a reflection of his economic and social interests apart of course from his own and that no one considers a question from a purely intellectual or disinterested point of view thus those who defend academic freedom are really defending their right to intellectual and economic hegemony there is really no such thing as academic freedom there is only the expression of power what is necessary therefore is merely to replace one hegemony with another that of virtue and justice as interpreted by the guardian for that of bourgeois privilege the newspaper s utopia is a world in which everyone agrees with its editorials and acts upon them as if they were holy writ this intolerance of any opinion but one s own had been growing and is now stronger than at any period that i can remember in my lifetime i should have seen it coming about thirty years ago before the advent of the so called social media today while walking in the street i saw a young man not the kind of whom i would willingly ask directions who wore a t short with the legend my local anti social social club i published an article admittedly not in altogether emollient terms against the point of view of a certain pressure group representatives of that pressure group contacted the hospital in which i worked and asked that i should be dismissed the chief executive of the hospital at the time wrote back to the representatives and said that he was sorry that they were upset by what i had written but that it was a free country and i could write whatever i liked peace be upon him and honor to his memory at the time i little thought that his forthright response would soon come to appear extraordinary and brave on the contrary i thought at the time that it was perfectly banal and almost self evident but nowadays practically no person in his position with honorable exceptions such as the vice chancellor of sussex university would dare to write in such a fashion for fear himself of falling under suspicion of having incorrect and impermissible thoughts the national union of monomaniacs has understood the principles of intimidation as well as of informing and denunciation things of which the guardian which in its better days was a defender of freedom is now a handmaiden not that it would ever understand so patriarchal a term as handmaiden the great former editor of the guardian c p scott once wrote that comment is free but facts are sacred now he would write that the facts are free but current orthodoxy is sacred the quotation marks in the guardian s headline reveal a totalitarian mindset that is however far from unique to the newspaper it is being actively inculcated in our children on the old jesuit principle that if you have a child by the age of seven he is yours in this case the latest orthodoxy s for ever views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the epoch times
mpaa rating pg 13 usccb rating a iii reel rating 4 reels out of 5 note spoilers alert in the 1938 classic boys town fr flanagan famously said there is no such thing as a bad boy he didn t mean males never sin rather the worst social situations and bad habits of the homeless rebel teenager do not remove his god given dignity or opportunity for redemption the same is true for apple a poor expectant teenager who escapes her abusive mother in search of a home gimme shelter is the best pro life movie yet made mostly because it is an actual movie rather than a two hour sermon it is beautifully written with amazing performances by a list actors most importantly it has the real capacity to change lives the film opens with apple bailey vanessa hudgens brutally cutting her hair and calling a cab to pick her up it is unknown who this girl is why she is changing her looks or where she is going in such a hurry gradually it becomes clear she is fleeing her monster of a mother june rosario dawson and seeking her biological father tom brendan frasier with only a decade old letter to guide her tom now a successful stock broker is open to helping her but his wife joanna is less keen especially when it is revealed that apple is pregnant from a brief affair not unlike tom and june they arrange an abortion for apple waiting at the clinic apple takes one last peek at the ultrasound picture and runs away weeping when apple emerges from the clinic she will not return to her father and becomes homeless while fleeing a prospective pimp she steals a car and promptly crashes in the hospital she meets fr mccarthy james earl jones in an amazing performance he gently tries to lead her soul to peace while guiding her to catholic shelter for pregnant mothers in need run by a saintly woman named kathy ann dowd the shelter provides apple with her first genuine security in life including protection from june spiritual guidance financial assistance and most importantly love while initially hesitant she eventually connects with the other woman at the shelter over their common struggles and finds a true home this film is a tremendously effective treatise on abortion because it connects the situation of apple with that of her child it handles abortion in a direct realistic fashion without dramatic music screaming or political overtones apple understands what it means to be unwanted and realizes she could never treat another human that way the film title gimme shelter could just as easily apply to apple s child as herself every baby seeks shelter in the wombs of their mothers and the loving work of their fathers all people are called to be hospitable hosts to these tiny guests two people who are not hospitable are tom and june tom had left june shortly after he got her pregnant going on to lead a life of luxury in white suburban new jersey while the mixed raced june gave birth to apple in poverty stricken new york city june is terrible to apple beating her yelling at her and even suggesting it was good she got pregnant because it will bring them more welfare money all while obviously addicted to a variety of drugs june s crimes are her own but it s impossible to ignore the consequences of the racial social and educational divides when apple does finally find shelter it is with people just like her there is a pivotal scene where the teens break into kathy s office and share their personal files one by one they read the summery of their broken lives to each other abuse rape prostitution mental illness and homelessness what started as a funny prank evolves into a gentle therapy session and apple slowly opens herself up to the group everyone here is broken like her but wants the best life for their babies she also finds in kathy her first real mother a woman who experienced the same challenges apple did growing up gimme shelter has only one misstep but it comes at a crucial moment after apple gives birth to a beautiful baby girl cheesily but aptly named hope tom invites her and his granddaughter to live with him he has even built an entire house for her right next to his with a nursery adorned including all the pink trappings a european princess would be jealous to have he has created the perfect ending however apple cannot accept something is not right it is rich and fancy but also cold and empty she gives him the long dreaded soliloquy that plagues message films it s disjointed confusing and unnecessary in a small way however this makes sense because apple has spent the entire film looking down at her feet and not saying five words at a time yet the wisdom of samuel goldwyn still rings true pictures were made to entertain if you want to send a message call western union apple s choice however is very

as the u s dollar is entering the crypto age the u s government is considering the tremendous change the digital dollar would bring according to a bloomberg report the guidance will come through three pending reports related to public and private efforts to digitize the world s global reserve currency first this month the federal reserve board will release a paper on the u s payments system that is expected to provide direction on whether the country should issue a so called central bank digital currency soon after the fed bank of boston will publish research and open source computer code on technology that could underpin a digital dollar then the president s working group on financial markets is set to issue policy recommendations on how to regulate stablecoins which are actually digital dollars created by private companies put together the three reports will provide guidance map for the broader financial community on how the fed and biden administration see the dollar s crypto future playing out the extent to which they embrace adoption of a digital currency and the guardrails they may see as necessary to protect individuals and investors in a largely unregulated corner of the market digital assets have exploded to 2 trillion usd according to the bloomberg report the u s government has to move swiftly as the value of digital assets has exploded to about 2 trillion and china and other countries as well move rapidly with plans for their own sovereign digital currencies this has gone from it s an interesting idea a few years ago to we need to have a pilot project said josh lipsky director of the atlantic council s geoeconomics center of a fed issued digital dollar the fed board s paper is expected to focus on the u s payments system as well as the potential prospects of a fed issued digital dollar however u s central bankers have been divided over whether creating a digital dollar is wise with fed vice chair for supervision randal quarles describing its benefits as unclear and its risks significant and concrete on the other side proponents of creating central bank digital currencies or cbdcs say they can speed up payments reduce their cost and increase access to the financial system for the underbanked however there are risks a group of world central banks including the fed the bank of england and the european central bank last week issued a report warning that cbdcs could exacerbate bank runs by making it easier for depositors to clear out their cash during a crisis the ultimate issuance of a cbdc would take years and the fed would prefer congress to pass legislation authorizing the issue of the digital dollar fed chair jerome powell has said technological standards of digital us dollar the second paper from the boston fed could begin to set technological standards that would be important not just for the rollout of a digital dollar but for others already being developed around the world said the atlantic council s lipsky most countries economies will have to be integrated with the u s payments system which means any guidance the fed gives on what to do about privacy tradeoffs and other attributes could end up molding foreign efforts lipsky said while an official u s digital currency if it happens will take years to come about private companies including tether international ltd and circle internet financial inc have launched their own versions with tokens in circulation now worth more than 120 billion stablecoins regulation the third paper which will be released by the president s working group on financial markets a collection of the leaders of u s agencies including the fed and the u s treasury department will address this trend federal officials are concerned because since stablecoins are invested in assets such as corporate bonds and related securities they could experience severe stress if investors were to lose confidence and attempt to cash in their stablecoins all at once powell and securities and exchange commission chair gary gensler have likened stablecoins to money market funds which also seek to maintain a value of one dollar but during times of stress have sometimes failed the report is expected to recommend banklike regulation for stablecoin providers and for congress to pass a bill establishing a new limited type of charter to allow crypto banks to manage stablecoins as deposits a senior official involved with the report told bloomberg such regulation could limit what stablecoin providers can do with their reserves possibly constraining their profits in the name of greater investor protection the fed would have an enormous competitive advantage over private tokens if it launches its own digital dollar barclays plc said in a september research report analyzing the case for a u s digital currency together with regulations a fed cbdc could crowd out private issue crypto the barclays report said

i follow the science and trust the experts but let s be honest they don t always get it right for instance we recently learned that although public health experts had told us repeatedly that the moderna and pfizer biontech vaccines were equally effective that s not actually true half a dozen studies the new york times reported now show that moderna offers more protection and that s just the most recent screw up don t wear masks they told us in the beginning until they changed their minds covid 19 is unlikely to be spread by asymptomatic people oh oops yes it is wipe down your packages um no actually that s not necessary a few days ago irked by the most recent turnaround i suddenly recalled a book i ve had on my shelf for the last 37 years titled the experts speak it is a nearly 400 page doorstopper written in 1984 by christopher cerf and victor navasky that claims to be the definitive compendium of authoritative misinformation navasky and cerf set out to lampoon the world s experts by showing how wrong they ve been over the last 2 000 years about everything including they noted facts theories dates geography predictions about the future conclusions about the past and yes even assertions about the present advertisement we are ready to concede that the experts are occasionally right they wrote as a matter of fact some of our colleagues have argued persuasively that the experts are right as much as half the time ok they were being snarky but their compendium is no joke here are a handful of the thousands of entries stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau yale economics professor irving fisher said on oct 17 1929 just a week before the market crash that devastated the u s economy roosevelt will be a one term president wrote political columnist mark sullivan in the new york herald in 1935 roosevelt was elected to four terms and died in office in 1945 is dangerous immediately after a meal wrote dr bernard s talmey in his treatise on the science of sex attraction in 1919 a man made moon voyage will never occur regardless of all future scientific advances said lee deforest an american inventor who has often been called the father of the radio in 1957 clearing and colder preceded by light snow was the official new york city weather forecast for march 12 1888 the day of the blizzard of 88 which killed more than 400 people for the majority of people smoking has a beneficial effect los angeles surgeon ian g macdonald told newsweek in 1963 advertisement i think i needn t go further their message is clear don t believe everything you hear even from someone with an advanced degree especially when it predicts the future furthermore even when the experts all agree they might still be wrong but having said all that what s the alternative with all due respect to navasky and cerf no number of wrong assertions by a scientist or expert truly undermines the value of study knowledge experience experimentation data gathering and the scientific method nor do i think the authors meant to suggest it did and just because the experts make mistakes that doesn t mean that they aren t right vastly more often than they re wrong or that they don t know a lot more about viruses than you and i do what we sometimes forget is that science and expertise don t exist in a world of perfectly discernible truth and objectivity but in one of uncertainty especially when it comes to advising on policy scientists conclusions and experts recommendations are based as often as not on estimates and hypotheses on projections and modeling it is necessary to weigh evidence reconcile contradictory findings and make judgments sometimes with incomplete information during the covid 19 pandemic scientists and policymakers have obviously been under pressure to move quickly at the beginning little was known about the virus but policy recommendations were urgently necessary studies were sped up and assumptions were made some of which didn t bear out there are currently more than 360 000 entries in the world health organization s database of global literature on the coronavirus unfortunately mistakes when they occur give ammunition to skeptics mistakes encourage laypeople to trust their own anecdotal observations or the baseless assertions of irresponsible people around them rather than authoritative sources what s more americans or at least a subset of them have a long tradition of distrusting authority and people they see as pointy headed know it alls historian richard hofstadter wrote a whole book in 1963 about anti intellectualism in the united states arguing that many americans believe their own common sense is an altogether adequate substitute for if not actually much superior to formal knowledge and expertise the donald trumps of the world take advantage of that the experts are terrible said the demagogue in chief in 2016 later he made empty promises like this one about covid in march 2020 it s going to go away hopefully at the end of the month advertisement sure i now wish i d gotten the moderna vaccine rather than the pfizer but data evolve and pfizer is effective it s easy to be irked by botched predictions and inaccurate assertions but to discount rigorous methods objective standards and open minded inquiry to discount science and expertise is dark ages thinking it s a much bigger mistake than doing a 360 on mask wearing or which vaccine works best nicholas goldberg is an associate editor and op ed columnist for the los angeles times 2021 los angeles times distributed by

sept 23 annual report to the federal securities and exchange commission in that filing the company also disclosed that it complied with colorado attorney general phil weiser s civil investigative demand for documents regarding medicaid billing patient services and referrals we have been fully cooperating with the attorney general and are producing the requested information and documentation the company said it its sec filing we are currently unable to predict the outcome of this investigation last month the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services barred innovage s sacramento calif operations from enrolling new medicare funded patients the agency said an audit found problems including that the firm failed to provide medically necessary items and services to participants needs and that those failures adversely affected or had the substantial likelihood of adversely affecting its participants maureen hewitt who was paid 1 6 million in 2020 as innovage s chief executive officer declined requests for interviews and referred questions to company spokesman mark corbae in a statement corbae said the company s repayment to colorado s medicaid program was part of an annual reconciliation which resulted in a reduction in accounts receivable of 17 million including 13 6 million related to medicaid he said the company does not expect adjustments related to the reconciliation to be significant in future periods as a healthcare provider in a highly regulated industry innovage has established protocols to cooperate with and fully support regulatory and oversight measures corbae said our primary concern is always the health and safety of our participants the company provides home based services to more than 6 800 patients in the states of colorado california new mexico pennsylvania and virginia and plans to expand into florida and kentucky according to corporate filings final findings from audits conducted in may by the colorado department of health care policy and financing in coordination with the colorado department of public health and environment are pending corbae said he said the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services initiated its own audit in june final findings from federal and state audits are expected in 2022 the company said in its annual report colorado generated half of innovage s 635 million in revenue for the fiscal year that ended this june records show the firm operates two affordable senior housing complexes in denver the company generated nearly 44 million in losses for the recent fiscal year but a 26 million profit in the previous fiscal year according to the annual report filed with the securities and exchange commission in september more than 99 of the company s revenues come from government

measured and pragmatic approach to our growth strategy he said our primary concern is the health and safety of our participants and staff in every market we serve all of our participants have access to experts across at least 11 disciplines as required by regulations the accusations from the former innovage executive mirror earlier allegations brought in a now dropped 2019 federal lawsuit filed by the company s former western region chief operating officer who claimed her advice was consistently ignored while company officials actively hid the depth of its noncompliance from the government that whistleblower lawsuit from karen lapcewich accused the company of preying on medicare and medicaid programs at the expense of quality care for elderly patients the litigation s allegations referenced emails and internal company auditing showing instances of thousands of elderly patients waiting sometimes over a year for promised services and medications delivery of medications stalled due to a lack of transportation couriers and because prescriptions weren t sent to pharmacies the lawsuit stated in one instance a patient needing an orthopedic consult never got one and resorted to medication to alleviate the pain according to that lawsuit which lapcewich dropped in 2020 in another instance according to company emails referenced in the lawsuit a patient waited more than a year for evaluation and treatment of poor vision due to cataracts the original order to help this participant s vision was not done timely stated an email from a corporate director of clinical care that was used in the lawsuit it was not realized the ophthalmology appointment is essential to the participant s vision and mobility lapcewich who resigned from the company in october 2017 claimed in her lawsuit that example of a lack of care was one example of many that left patients suffering from additional injury pain or exacerbation of chronic conditions they needed care and were entitled to it but innovage did not provide it her whistleblower lawsuit stated hewitt innovage s chief executive officer in 2016 converted the company from a non profit provider to a for profit company corporate filings state that company revenues have more than doubled since then along the way the company awarded hewitt more than 4 million in stock options the lawsuit from lapcewich stated that of the 74 program of all inclusive care for the elderly organizations audited by federal regulators in 2017 only seven were for profit operations innovage s california and colorado pace operations both had federal audit scores that year that were among the 10 worst in the nation the lawsuit stated each year we develop an annual quality plan that outlines how we will meet the requirements of state and federal regulators innovage s corbae said the plan evaluates performance against a robust set of measures including the safety and effectiveness of all services delivered to participants he said innovage is pursuing certification of its centers as patient centered medical homes which are defined by the federal agency for healthcare research and quality as accountable for meeting the large majority of each patient s physical and mental health care needs including prevention and wellness acute care and chronic care innovage s centers were recertified by the national committee for quality assurance in 2020 for the third time corbae said innovage went public in march of this year raising 350 million in an initial public stock offering its board members include jeb bush the former governor of florida and ted kennedy jr a former connecticut state senator and son of former u s senator edward kennedy the company also tapped actor susan sarandon to work on its behalf as a spokeswoman tracy miller who worked for three months as clinical director of an innovage s program in san bernardino calif said that despite all the corporate glitz the company failed to provide adequate care to its elderly patients when she worked for the company miller said she resigned after company officials failed to correct problems she identified miller said she personally observed some orders for doctor care and follow up were not carried through with patients left to languish while they waited for care they didn t seem to like to hear from people actually telling them about stuff like lack of staff miller said she added that she absolutely believed the company had failed to provide adequate care to many patients from my experience it came from the top miller said it was more about making money in my opinion than about patient safety

freightcar america called hundreds of workers into the break area at the company s factory near muscle shoals alabama to tell them that the plant was closing for good for some employees the news wasn t a shock they d been hearing rumors that management would move the work elsewhere for years the timing however seemed odd only a few months earlier the publicly traded company had received a 10

approved to be clear the companies may have complied with program rules which put a premium on getting money out fast the regulations changed frequently in the months after the congress established the ppp as part of the cares act in march 2020 and the law was later amended to allow more of the money to be used for non payroll expenses the law also contained many exemptions that stretched the

declined to comment canadian owned supreme steel took 1 69 million in may 2020 for its plant in portland oregon which it closed five months later terminating 112 employees spokesperson rhandi berndt said that the closure was the result of market forces and declined to answer further questions in order for ppp loans to be forgiven the federal small business administration initially required borrowers to spend 75 of the funds on payroll over eight weeks since the maximum ppp loan amount was for 2 5 times companies average monthly payroll in 2019 that should have guaranteed that wages and hours could be maintained as required by the cares act in the case of freightcar and some other borrowers the original eight week covered period of the ppp loan passed before layoffs occurred allowing the companies to have their loans fully forgiven but the other cases may have easily qualified as well because congress changed the rules last june after businesses protested that they couldn t spend their ppp money fast enough in a stalled economy the legislation was amended to require only that 60 of a loan go toward workers pay and the covered period was extended to 24 weeks since borrowers had to spend less of the loan on payroll over a longer period to keep the money they had wide leeway to let people go as they saw fit it wouldn t be difficult to lay off 50 of your workforce and still get full forgiveness said eric kodesch an attorney at lane powell who has helped many clients with their ppp applications the sba has not publicly released data on forgiveness of specific loans but aggregate statistics show that so far out of all applications processed more than 99 of the total dollar value has been forgiven the sba declined to comment on individual borrowers or identify loans that have been forgiven there s another reason why a casual reader of the cares act might think companies would not qualify for ppp money many are actually very large businesses in general the cares act set an upper size limit of 500 employees with a few exceptions the law required sba to count all affiliate companies toward that total that would include companies owned by private equity firms as well as subsidiaries contained within holding companies it exempted hotels restaurants and franchises but no other industries that s why shake shack and ruth s chris steak house qualified for loans though each returned the money after a barrage of negative press coverage however a number of program nuances allowed large companies to obtain ppp loans freightcar laid off 550 people with the shoals plant shutdown according to a notice filed with the state of alabama along with its headquarters employees that alone would exceed the ppp s ostensible 500 employee cap but freightcar availed itself of a loophole baked into the ppp the sba s alternative size standards a complex set of industry by industry thresholds that have been debated for decades allowed it to qualify with up to 1 500 workers originally the sba allowed foreign owned applicants to count only their u s based employees under the 500 person cap that guidance changed last may requiring foreign owned applicants to count their entire global workforce but plenty of companies had already gotten ppp loans and were allowed to keep them for example ledvance llc a chinese owned global lightbulb manufacturer operating in the u s under the brand name sylvania was approved for a 9 36 million ppp loan in april 2020 then between may and july it laid off 50 people while closing down a distribution center near bethlehem pennsylvania ledvance spokesperson glen gracia said in an email that the layoffs were unrelated to the pandemic and in full compliance with ledvance s participation in the paycheck protection program then there s chick master incubator company which took 1 34 million in april 2020 in june its corporate parent a zurich based private office that invests the fortune of a long established industrialist family announced it would combine chick master with its other hatchery holdings and close the plant laying off 68 people in medina ohio by year s end chick master didn t reply to a request for comment one type of applicant however still likely should not have qualified companies controlled by private equity firms whose total holdings exceed the sba s size standard for the borrowers specific industries cadence aerospace a supplier of aerospace and defense parts that itself has bought three companies in the last three years is majority owned by arlington capital a private equity firm managing billions of dollars cadence was approved for a 10 million ppp loan in april 2020 and later that month laid off 72 people at its giddens industries subsidiary in washington state according to a notice filed with the state arlington capital did not respond to a request for comment the shoals plant was the last remaining u s manufacturing facility for freightcar a 120 year old company headquartered in chicago that had been shrinking its u s footprint for years in 2008 it shuttered its plant in johnstown pennsylvania in 2017 it shut down its factory in danville illinois in 2019 it closed its plant in roanoke virginia and announced it would open a new facility under a joint venture in castaños mexico when executives informed investors in september that the shoals facility would also close and manufacturing would shift to mexico they projected 25 million in overall savings including a 60 reduction in labor costs our manufacturing transformation is now largely complete and we have taken control of our own destiny meyer said on an earnings call in march we have dramatically repositioned our competitive profile and in so doing created a new company one that is able to win in 2013 the future looked different when the shoals plant opened it offered about 12 an hour to start and a chance at advancement one worker who asked not to be named in order to protect her future employment prospects left a tile making job to become a welder constructing a variety of rail cars from hoppers to gondolas soon she moved up to air brake tester sliding underneath the massive steel vehicles to fix pipes i went to freightcar to retire said the worker i wasn t planning on leaving when i got there in the following years safety pay and management concerns led to a union drive during the campaign anti union employees circulated flyers warning that the plant would shut down if workers voted to organize and in 2018 they voted decisively against it as it turned out the shoals facility wouldn t last long anyway leading up to 2020 freightcar touted the shoals plant s competitiveness a marketing video showed production lines run by industrial robots and skilled workers this is the largest newest most purpose built factory in north america boasted meyer a modern state of the art factory in every sense of the word but the company was still losing money to the tune of 75 2 million in 2019 when the pandemic further slowed down orders executives started talking up the new facility in mexico instead the mexico labor rate is approximately 20 of that in the u s meyer said on an earnings call in august 2020 and the new plant provides other sources of savings beyond just labor also on the august earnings call executives explained that loan proceeds had made up for some of the cost of the company s move to mexico chris eppel then the company s chief financial officer said that the money also partially offset operating losses and inventory purchases meyer still got his 500 000 base salary in 2020 plus stock options worth nearly that and a 1 million bonus for securing a 40 million loan from a private investment company freightcar did not take out a second draw ppp loan updated rules excluded publicly traded companies after the plant closure announcement the air brake tester found a job making dashboards and bumpers for toyota it takes three times as long for her to get to her new job as the 20 minute drive she had to freightcar and she s paid six dollars less per hour although freightcar gave employees a few thousand dollars in severance payments she said all of hers went towards bills it s like starting all over again she said if they did right by us like they did their supervisors maybe we d be in more decent shape than what we re in now

its asset purchase program while peers in norway brazil mexico south korea and new zealand are among those to have already raised interest rates behind the shift are signs that the recent inflation scare won t fade soon amid supply chain strains surging commodity prices post lockdown demand ongoing stimulus and labor shortages complicating the task for policy makers is that growth may be slowing prompting some to warn of a stagflationary lite environment that puts central bankers in a a bind as they debate which risk they should prioritize targeting inflation with tighter monetary policy adds to the pressure on economies but trying to boost demand may ignite prices further for now the feeling of many is that inflation has lingered longer than most predicted as huw pill the bank of england s new chief economist said last week the balance of risks is currently shifting towards great concerns about the inflation outlook as the current strength of inflation looks set to prove more long lasting than originally anticipated not all are as concerned or looking to change tack officials at the european central bank and bank of japan are among those intending to keep stimulating their economies aggressively and the international monetary fund predicts that in advanced economies at least inflation will soon ease to about 2 stagflation is too strong a word still supply shocks that lift prices and lower output leave monetary policy makers with no easy options with little urgency to act the fed and other major central banks are preserving optionality if stubborn inflation forces their hand the global recovery will face an additional drag tom orlik chief economistjerome powell who s waiting to hear if he ll be renominated for another four years at the helm of the fed has recently taken a step toward scaling back massive pandemic support the fed chair last month said the u s central bank could start to taper monthly bond purchases as soon as november getting that started is top of his to do list alongside persuading americans that the fed is also keeping an eye on higher than expected inflation he ll try to communicate that message without giving the impression that the fed is getting closer to raising near zero interest rates even though policy makers were evenly split on rate liftoff next year according to quarterly projections they released sept 22 but the forecasts displayed as anonymous dots on a chart can be affected by shifts in personnel in addition to powell s chairmanship president joe biden has the chance to pick three other governors on the seven seat board in washington a decision on the chair is expected this fall there are also changes coming among the 12 regional fed presidents two of the most hawkish dallas fed president robert kaplan and boston s eric rosengren are stepping down following revelations about their trading activity in 2020 rosengren cited a serious health condition in announcing his early retirement stubbornly high inflation means risks appear to tilt toward an earlier hike than our current baseline of a 2023 move however our analysis of the views of voting fomc members in 2022 suggests that the majority prefers a somewhat more accommodative timeline than implied by the committee median after rosengren s early resignation we think four 2022 voters currently favor a hike against six for a hold next year anna wongthe ecb is preparing for a major policy update in december when projections through 2024 will show how much progress inflation is set to make toward sustainably reaching a newly set 2 goal global supply bottlenecks and a series of one time factors have pushed price growth far above that rate though pressures are expected to ease over the course of next year policy makers led by president christine lagarde have already decided to slow purchases under their 1 85 trillion euro 2 2 trillion pandemic program in the fourth quarter and are likely to allow the plan to expire in march a debate in coming months about how to redesign the ecb s older bond buying scheme may prove more contentious with some advocating more flexibility and an increase in pace that others say may not be needed wage growth is unlikely to accelerate sustainably until the significant spare capacity in the labor market is absorbed that will leave many on the governing council doubtful about the persistence of inflation and pushing for an increase in bond buying through the asset purchase programme they will also be concerned about the credibility of the ecb s commitment in its strategy review to more forceful or persistent action at the effective lower bound david powellboj governor haruhiko kuroda must now work with a new prime minister fumio kishida to guide the economy out of the pandemic the boj could decide this quarter to extend its covid funding measures or wrap them up by the end of march as planned the policy board will be watching to see if the recovery benefits from a release of pent up demand after restrictions on activity were finally lifted last month and as vaccination rates rise still inflation that s forecast to stay below target for years means the bank is unlikely to let up on its main stimulus any time soon even as peers move toward normalization that divergence should keep the yen weak providing a tailwind for japan s export led recovery some central banks are looking to exit not the boj it s far behind we expect it to stay on cruise control through 2022 goushi kataoka a prominent reflationist on the policy board will see his term expire next summer japan s new administration could fill his seat with a person who has a more balanced view on monetary policy supporting a move toward normalization yuki masujimawith u k inflation on course to hit more than double the boe s 2 target by the end of the year speculation is mounting the institution will be the among the first of its g 7 peers to start unwinding pandemic era rate cuts while officials said in september that they didn t necessarily have to wait until their bond buying plan finishes at the end of this year to act most economists are penciling in the first move in for 2022 markets are even more aggressive and at one stage were predicting three increases next year still concerns that a premature tightening would choke off the recovery may yet stay the boe s hand especially as u k consumers prepare for a difficult winter of mounting bills inflation is becoming increasingly hard to ignore for the boe but we expect a rise in unemployment following the end of the government s furlough scheme and a slower recovery to cool concerns among policy makers that should mean interest rates are left alone until may still we can t rule out an increase this year if inflation continues to surprise and expectations drift higher dan hansonthe bank of canada s next meeting is on oct 27 where it will release an updated set of quarterly forecasts economists largely expect the central bank to revise down its forecast for the third quarter after july and august monthly gdp showed the quarter tracking well below its previous 7 3 forecast while the institution is not expected to change its policy rate economists will be watching for changes to the pace of asset purchases or forward guidance governor tiff macklem has already reduced the pace of government bond buying three times in the past year and is expected to taper asset purchases once more this month to c 1 billion in government of canada bonds per week it s also possible the bank of canada will provide some update around its forward guidance which currently states it will keep interest rates low until the output gap is closed and inflation returns sustainably to 2 something it doesn t see occurring until the second half of next year as economic reopening bumps up against fractured supply chains consumer price inflation may prove stickier for longer our updated projections have inflation holding above 4 through 2021 slowing to an average of 2 5 in 2h 2022 as the output gap closes in 4q 2022 an initial rate hike happens a quarter sooner than we previously expected andrew husbychina s central bank began gradually curbing credit expansion to control financial risks this year once the economy s recovery from the pandemic was well underway however the economy started showing signs of weakening in the second half prompting authorities to make a surprise shift in july by reducing the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve in part to help banks with liquidity needs but also to boost lending to small businesses hurt by rising commodity prices since then growth risks have only gotten worse stringent virus control measures to contain sporadic outbreaks have made still cautious consumers even more wary of spending a debt crisis at a major property developer has roiled financial markets while beijing s tighter restrictions on the real estate market have caused a slump in construction investment more recently an electricity shortage has forced factories to shut with ripple effects across global supply chains that weaker outlook means the central bank will likely reduce the reserve requirement ratio for banks again economists predict and possibly even lower its policy rates china s economy is facing a range of downside risks from power shortages to virus outbreaks and weak consumption market strains from the crisis at evergrande are another worry we expect the pboc to keep a loose stance to cushion the slowdown pumping more liquidity into the banking system and cutting the reserve requirement ratio by another 50 basis points probably in october or november a rate cut is unlikely in the near term that would only fuel financial imbalances that the authorities are keen to curb david quindia s central bank suspended its version of quantitative easing this month signaling the start of tapering pandemic era stimulus measures as an economic recovery takes hold while it kept the benchmark repurchase rate unchanged at a historic low of 4 and the monetary stance dovish it made a gradual move to withdraw the billions of dollars it has pumped in since the start of the pandemic last year that liquidity injection risks adding to inflationary pressures and fueling an asset bubble with policy makers growing increasingly confident that the nascent recovery will gather pace as vaccination picks up and chances of a third wave ebb the reserve bank of india expects pent up demand and the festival season to give a fillip to urban demand in the second half of the financial year to march 2022 while rural demand is expected to be underpinned by a near normal monsoon and record food grain production what bloomberg economics says the rbi s decision to suspend quantitative easing at its october policy marked a retreat from its previous stance of keeping long term sovereign bond yields in check this is likely to steepen the yield curve but we don t see it is as a pre cursor to an imminent policy rate hike we are sticking to our view that the rbi will keep policy rates low for longer to revive growth on a more durable basis we expect it to begin a gradual rate hike cycle in april 2022 by first raising the reverse repo rate and see the first repo rate hike only in february 2023 abhishek guptacurrent selic target rate 6 25 bloomberg economics forecast for end of 2021 8 bloomberg economics forecast for end of 2022 8 5 brazil s central bank has unleashed the world s most aggressive monetary tightening campaign this year raising its benchmark interest rate by 425 points since march and promising to take it to a significantly restrictive level until inflation expectations ease back to target yet prices are rising by more than 10 a year the fastest pace since 2016 and expectations for 2022 are running above the 3 5 goal complicating matters for policy makers led by roberto campos neto is a severe drought that s making hydro electricity costlier just as commodities and food prices jump across the globe and local demand for services grow with the economic reopening all things considered traders in the local futures market are already betting that the selic will end 2022 above 10 inflation continues to run hot and appears headed to a slow descent in the coming quarters in an effort to bring inflation expectations for 2022 back to the center of the target the central bank indicated that it intends to bring the monetary policy to tight territory for the first time since 2017 but has not hinted on how tight the policy will be we expect the bcb will continue to raise the policy rate through february after when the shifting focus to 2023 inflation will give the monetary authorities some reason to pause and monitor the effects of the tightening introduced that far adriana dupitathe bank of russia raised its benchmark rate to 6 75 on sept 10 meaning governor elvira nabiullina has delivered a total of 250 basis points of tightening this year and there s no sign she s done nabiullina said it may take more than one rate increase to tame runaway inflation and curb inflation expectations which remain elevated consumer price growth accelerated to 7 4 in september from a year earlier that was above economists expectations and boosts the chances for a 50 basis point rate increase on oct 22 delays in the domestic harvest as well as climbing food prices globally are keeping russia s inflation rate at the fastest pace in half a decade most of the spike in russia s inflation looks fleeting but the central bank isn t taking any chances resilient demand and rising inflation expectations pose a more persistent threat once supply shocks fade policy makers are likely to favor another 50 bps of tightening this month to regain control if price pressure remains elevated further hikes may follow scott johnsonsouth africa s central bank has made it clear that its next move will be to raise borrowing costs while no member of its monetary policy committee has voted for tightening this year that could change at its next meeting as the panel now sees material upside risks to its inflation outlook it prefers to anchor price growth expectations close to the 4 5 midpoint of its target range and sees inflation at or below the level through 2023 the implied policy rate path of the quarterly projection model which the mpc uses as broad policy guide indicates a 25 basis point increase in the final quarter of this year and in every quarter of 2022 and 2023 delaying the lift off could see the monetary policy authorities playing catch up with inflation potentially destabilizing the relatively well anchored inflation expectations the reserve bank said tuesday in its six monthly monetary policy review what bloomberg economics says the sarb continues to signal the need for a gradual normalization of rates from the record low of 3 5 it s model points to 4q as the possible start but we expect ongoing virus uncertainty and still muted core inflation to push this out to 1q2022 the bank envisions only a gradual rise in rates however rising inflation risks and the anticipation of higher u s rates could speed up the monetary tightening cycle once it begins boingotlo gasealahwemexico s central bank has been slowly removing the monetary stimulus granted during the pandemic raising the overnight interest rate by a quarter percentage point in each of its last three board meetings through september defying banxico s initial projections that inflation would slow by the end of the year consumer prices have been rising at an annual pace of around 6 since april double the central bank s target the deterioration in inflation expectations takes place as banxico is going through a leadership change governor alejandro diaz de leon will finish his term at the end of the year and he is set to be replaced by former finance minister arturo herrera a change that led to speculation about the board being more dovish in the future we expect banxico to increase its policy rate by 25 basis points in november and again in december closing the year at 5 25 to anchor inflation expectations decelerating inflation weak growth and near neutral rates next year should allow for a pause until the federal reserve begins hiking felipe hernandezit s smoother sailing for bank indonesia this quarter with the nation s worst covid 19 wave contained and the economy reopening the rupiah has shaken off fears around the fed s impending taper it s the best performer among emerging markets so far in the second half with inflation under control governor perry warjiyo has room to keep policy rates at record lows for the rest of this year and through much of next should the market turn volatile once the fed begins tightening indonesia is banking on a robust trade balance thanks to surging demand for palm oil and coal and record forex reserves to defend its currency extending its 31 billion bond buying program should also help southeast asia s largest economy control borrowing costs bank indonesia could justify another rate cut with the inflation outlook benign and recovery prospects dented by slow shots and the threat of more delta outbreaks but the rupiah remains vulnerable to selling pressure precluding a cut that suggests the central bank will instead lean on bond purchases to support growth making the next move in rates a hike in 4q 2022 or later tamara hendersonturkey s central bank unleashed a new bout of market turbulence by unexpectedly lowering interest rates last month reflecting the long shadow cast by president recep tayyip erdogan over monetary policy the surprise cut came despite rising prices and after erdogan called for lower borrowing costs making the lira the worst performing emerging market currency of this year again not delivering on the president s unorthodox doctrine could have cost the central bank governor sahap kavcioglu his job kavcioglu who held rates steady for five meetings until last month is the fourth governor since 2019 with the president having fired his three immediate predecessors both headline inflation and a core gauge closely watched by the central bank accelerated in september but some economists say officials may continue cutting rates as early as this month as it no longer offers a clear guidance on the monetary policy implications of price growth turkey has embarked on an easing cycle while its peers are raising interest rates lower rates now risk higher rates in the future in the meantime the lira will continue to test fresh lows ziad daoudnigeria s central bank will probably leave its key interest rate unchanged for the rest of the year as it looks to build growth momentum in africa s biggest economy output undershot forecasts in the second quarter suggesting the economy is struggling to recover from its biggest contraction in almost three decades in 2020 that forced the central bank to cut its economic growth forecast for this year to 2 86 from 3 15 governor godwin emefiele has previously said the mpc can only shift to fighting inflation which has exceeded the 9 top of the central bank s target band for more than six years once the economy s recovery from last year s coronavirus induced contraction gathers pace nigeria s inflation remains above target but the central has made it clear it wants to see a solid recovery before switches to fighting inflation we have pencilled in 4q21 as the start of the hiking cycle but a faster disinflation path and weaker than expected growth could stay the cbn s hand boingotlo gasealahwethe bank of korea is well ahead of the federal reserve and some other peers in developed nations in reining in pandemic era stimulus after lifting its benchmark interest rate from a record low of 0 5 in august the central bank has two rate decisions left this year and most economists believe it will go ahead with another 25 basis point hike in november rather than this week as the bok embarks on the path to policy normalization it is shifting its focus from fueling the economic rebound to curbing household debt at the center of financial imbalances governor lee ju yeol who steps down in march has recently held met with financial regulators and agreed to coordinate policy responses with them the bank of korea has entered a rate hike cycle with its august liftoff and we see conditions ripe for another increase this year most likely in november resilience in exports and a rebound in activity amid a rapidly rising vaccination rate suggest growth momentum remains solid financial imbalances meanwhile have also been growing as have inflationary pressures justin jimenezreserve bank governor philip lowe is betting the economy will see a swift rebound once virus restrictions across the population heavy east coast ease as vaccination levels climb even

current record low level of 0 1 until 2024 at the earliest that s fueling a surge in the nation s already lofty home prices spurring recent moves by the banking regulator to raise the minimum interest rate buffer that lenders need to account for when assessing home loan applications with the rba s conditions for rate hikes sustainable inflation within the target band unlikely to be met until late 2024 the pace of monetary policy tightening in australia is likely to remain gradual while we expect a prolonged tapering of bond purchases over 2022 policymakers focus is likely to switch towards regulatory restrictions to contain financial stability risks an initial tightening of macro prudential policy is likely to be followed by further measures potentially as early as 4q 2021 james mcintyreargentina s central bank is a clear outlier in latin america s trend for rising interest rates with president alberto fernandez s government facing midterm elections in november the central bank is printing money to finance public spending at the fastest pace so far this year even with annual inflation accelerating past 50 central bank chief miguel pesce shows no signs of raising interest rates any time soon one reason is that higher rates would lead to greater interest payments on a ballooning debt load further complicating government finances central bank debt has catapulted to 4 2 trillion pesos 42 5 billion from 2 4 trillion a year ago according to oct 1 data the bcra has focused its efforts so far on strengthening the peso in real terms in hopes this will help curb inflation at the same time it has left the policy rate virtually unchanged at 38 since march 2020 meaning deeply negative real rates for investors that policy mix is unlikely to change before year end

fernandez de kirchner adriana dupitathe snb s monetary policy consists of negative rates and currency market interventions which central bank president thomas jordan says are the best policy tools in light of his country s small bond market economists don t expect that stance to change in the next year the global economic recovery from the pandemic has taken pressure off the franc which investors typically flock to as a haven that s allowed the snb to ease its foot off the gas on foreign exchange interventions the spike in inflation seen in the euro area and the u s hasn t been evident in switzerland yet with consumer price pressures forecast to remain well within the snb s definition of price stability the riksbank still expects to hold its benchmark rate at zero all the way through the third quarter of 2024 which would mean a full decade of keeping its benchmark rate at or below zero that is despite a robust economic recovery and projections of inflation peaking above 3 in the coming months while rate setters may pencil in a hike toward the end of 2024 at their november meeting the majority view remains that the risks associated with tightening too soon are greater than holding on to an expansionary policy for too long after scaling back large scale asset purchases implemented during the crisis the riksbank expects to keep its balance sheet largely unchanged through 2022 by compensating for bond redemptions norway s central bank is set for another 25 basis point interest rate hike before year end after it last month delivered the first post pandemic increase in borrowing costs among economies with the world s 10 most traded currencies norges bank also forecast a slightly elevated trajectory for the benchmark than signaled in june cementing its outlier status among the rich peers in unwinding the crisis policies the oil rich nordic economy has recovered faster than most while governor oystein olsen hasn t needed to deploy any unconventional tools as the government is relying more than ever on the world s largest sovereign wealth fund for stimulus policy makers see the risk of too high price growth as limited with core inflation at the slowest level since 2017 after a false start in august when a nationwide lockdown stayed its hand the rbnz raised the cash rate on oct 6 and signaled more hikes to come inflation is already in breach of the bank s 1 3 target band and forecast to accelerate further the labor market is tight with unemployment at 4 matching its pre pandemic low but much will depend on how the economy responds to new zealand s current coronavirus outbreak largest city auckland remains in lockdown and the delta variant has spread to the neighboring waikato region the government plans to ease restrictions once enough people are vaccinated but with the virus circulating the economy may not bounce back from a third quarter contraction as rapidly as the rbnz expects the rbnz has started tightening policy responding to emerging signs of wage gains and inflation pressures following a rapid closed border recovery further tightening is likely in our view with a rate rise and harsher curbs on lending over coming months but the entry of the delta variant in covid free new zealand looks set to derail the economy along with the rbnz s projections for an aggressive lift in rates through 2022 james mcintyrepoland has shifted into wait and see mode for monetary policy after shocking economists and investors alike with its first interest rate hike since 2012 in early october central bank governor adam glapinski says he can t say what the next move will be as he assesses the effect of the step on the economy s recovery but with inflation set to remain way above target and prime minister mateusz morawiecki taking an increasing interest in elevated consumer prices another increase can t be ruled out in the coming months the pandemic which is raging in other parts of eastern europe is likely to dictate the path ahead the czech central bank has accelerated its campaign against inflation with a surprising 75 basis point rate increase on sept 30 marking its biggest move in 24 years that triggered a rare rebuke from the government which fears that higher borrowing costs will undermine the economic recovery the bank worries that the fastest inflation in 13 years combined with the eu s lowest jobless rate will boost wage demands it pledged more rate hikes this year and eventually wants to bring the benchmark to normal levels of 2 5 to 3 we simply need to send a strong signal to people and the economy that we won t allow inflation expectations to become detached from our target governor jiri rusnok said after the september decision
the colorado attorney general is investigating a denver based company that is the nation s largest provider in a federal community based home health program for frail elderly patients initiating the probe after the company paid back 13 6 million this year to colorado s medicaid program amid audits by state and federal regulators innovage disclosed the audits and the colorado repayments in its sept 23 annual report to the federal securities and exchange commission in that filing the company also disclosed that it complied with colorado attorney general phil weiser s civil investigative demand for documents regarding medicaid billing patient services and referrals we have been fully cooperating with the attorney general and are producing the requested information and documentation the company said it its sec filing we are currently unable to predict the outcome of this investigation last month the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services barred innovage s sacramento calif operations from enrolling new medicare funded patients the agency said an audit found problems including that the firm failed to provide medically necessary items and services to participants needs and that those failures adversely affected or had the substantial likelihood of adversely affecting its participants maureen hewitt who was paid 1 6 million in 2020 as innovage s chief executive officer declined requests for interviews and referred questions to company spokesman mark corbae backlog of people waiting for treatment at colorado s mental hospital could lead to more death report in a statement corbae said the company s repayment to colorado s medicaid program was part of an annual reconciliation which resulted in a reduction in accounts receivable of 17 million including 13 6 million related to medicaid he said the company does not expect adjustments related to the reconciliation to be significant in future periods as a healthcare provider in a highly regulated industry innovage has established protocols to cooperate with and fully support regulatory and oversight measures corbae said our primary concern is always the health and safety of our participants the company provides home based services to more than 6 800 patients in the states of colorado california new mexico pennsylvania and virginia and plans to expand into florida and kentucky according to corporate filings final findings from audits conducted in may by the colorado department of health care policy and financing in coordination with the colorado department of public health and environment are pending corbae said he said the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services initiated its own audit in june final findings from federal and state audits are expected in 2022 the company said in its annual report colorado generated half of innovage s 635 million in revenue for the fiscal year that ended this june records show the firm operates two affordable senior housing complexes in denver the company generated nearly 44 million in losses for the recent fiscal year but a 26 million profit in the previous fiscal year according to the annual report filed with the securities and exchange commission in september more than 99 of the company s revenues come from government health programs under medicaid and medicare innovage is a participant in the program of all inclusive care for the elderly offering in home care services and in center services aimed at keeping elderly patients out of nursing homes the program pays providers set fees per patient from medicare and medicaid validity of colorado amusement ride inspections faced state scrutiny in corporate filings innovage stated that it is the largest provider for the program of all inclusive care for the elderly in the united states and operates 18 centers under the program one former company executive said in an interview that innovage grew dramatically in recent years through plans including recruitment of homeless residents for enrollment as patients but promised services were not provided and people got hurt said the former executive who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matters involved it s a

across at least 11 disciplines as required by regulations the accusations from the former innovage executive mirror earlier allegations brought in a now dropped 2019 federal lawsuit filed by the company s former western region chief operating officer who claimed her advice was consistently ignored while company officials actively hid the depth of its noncompliance from the government that whistleblower lawsuit from karen lapcewich accused the company of preying on medicare and medicaid programs at the expense of quality care for elderly patients the litigation s allegations referenced emails and internal company auditing showing instances of thousands of elderly patients waiting sometimes over a year for promised services and medications delivery of medications stalled due to a lack of transportation couriers and because prescriptions weren t sent to pharmacies the lawsuit stated in one instance a patient needing an orthopedic consult never got one and resorted to medication to alleviate the pain according to that lawsuit which lapcewich dropped in 2020 in another instance according to company emails referenced in the lawsuit a patient waited more than a year for evaluation and treatment of poor vision due to cataracts the original order to help this participant s vision was not done timely stated an email from a corporate director of clinical care that was used in the lawsuit it was not realized the ophthalmology appointment is essential to the participant s vision and mobility lapcewich who resigned from the company in october 2017 claimed in her lawsuit that example of a lack of care was one example of many that left patients suffering from additional injury pain or exacerbation of chronic conditions they needed care and were entitled to it but innovage did not provide it her whistleblower lawsuit stated hewitt innovage s chief executive officer in 2016 converted the company from a non profit provider to a for profit company corporate filings state that company revenues have more than doubled since then along the way the company awarded hewitt more than 4 million in stock options the lawsuit from lapcewich stated that of the 74 program of all inclusive care for the elderly organizations audited by federal regulators in 2017 only seven were for profit operations innovage s california and colorado pace operations both had federal audit scores that year that were among the 10 worst in the nation the lawsuit stated each year we develop an annual quality plan that outlines how we will meet the requirements of state and federal regulators innovage s corbae said the plan evaluates performance against a robust set of measures including the safety and effectiveness of all services delivered to participants he said innovage is pursuing certification of its centers as patient centered medical homes which are defined by the federal agency for healthcare research and quality as accountable for meeting the large majority of each patient s physical and mental health care needs including prevention and wellness acute care and chronic care innovage s centers were recertified by the national committee for quality assurance in 2020 for the third time corbae said innovage went public in march of this year raising 350 million in an initial public stock offering its board members include jeb bush the former governor of florida and ted kennedy jr a former connecticut state senator and son of former u s senator edward kennedy the company also tapped actor susan sarandon to work on its behalf as a spokeswoman tracy miller who worked for three months as clinical director of an innovage s program in san bernardino calif said that despite all the corporate glitz the company failed to provide adequate care to its elderly patients when she worked for the company miller said she resigned after company officials failed to correct problems she identified miller said she personally observed some orders for doctor care and follow up were not carried through with patients left to languish while they waited for care they didn t seem to like to hear from people actually telling them about stuff like lack of staff miller said she added that she absolutely believed the company had failed to provide adequate care to many patients from my experience it came from the top miller said it was more about making money in my opinion than about patient safety
menafn jordan times berkeley in 2011 when still vice chair of the us federal reserve janet yellen reassured her colleagues that drama around the federal government s debt ceiling usually turns out to be just theatre theatre of the absurd one might add a decade later the debt ceiling debate is shaping up as a tragedy for the ages to understand the absurdity of the debt ceiling recall its origins the statute creating it was adopted in september 1917 in conjunction with an act authorising the issuance of bonds to help finance us entry into world war i it was designed to assure opponents of us involvement in the war that there were limits on how far the country would go the constitution had given congress the power to micromanage borrowing by the treasury something that was impractical in wartime so legislators now delegated this power to the president but to placate those who opposed any enlargement of executive powers as well as german americans who opposed going to war with germany and irish americans opposed to allying with britain after that country s violent suppression of the 1916 easter rising for an independent ireland congress placed a ceiling on that borrowing those all but forgotten grievances from more than a century ago created the dilemma the united states faces today absurd is right until now congress has always succeeded in averting the worst even in 2013 a year of partisan rancor democrats and republicans agreed to suspend the debt ceiling just a week before the treasury already unable to borrow ran out of cash reserves but this year might be different most obviously political polarisation is even greater than it was in 2013 norms of political behaviour including the idea that the two parties should collaborate to avoid a predictable disaster have gone out the window since the january 6 attack on the us capitol by supporters of then president donald trump in a post fact world republican members of congress even if they are the actual agents of the calamity can successfully blame at least in the eyes of the republican base democratic legislators and their free spending ways the immediate consequence of a failure to raise or suspend the debt ceiling would be a government credit rating downgrade if us treasury debt lost its investment grade rating institutional investors would be prohibited by their mandates from holding it while foreign investors including central banks would think twice us borrowing costs would go up some studies find that the dollar s safe haven status saves the treasury upward of 700 billion in interest payments over a decade enough ironically to fund nearly three quarters of the bipartisan infrastructure package there is some already evidence of this bonus being lost uncertainty as the covid 19 crisis has reminded us is what investors dread the most and uncertainty would spike with an interest payment suspension of unknown duration stock markets would react negatively moreover because treasury securities are used as collateral in a wide range of private financial transactions short term funding markets would be impaired if the treasury was forced to suspend interest payments withdrawals would force money market mutual funds to engage in fire sales of treasury bills and conceivably to suspend redemptions estimates of the economic fallout range from deeply damaging to catastrophic one representative forecast suggests that gdp would decline by 4 per cent while unemployment would rise to 9 per cent the fed would step in of course as it does in every crisis it would activate emergency measures discussed in the run up to prior debt ceiling crises it would purchase defaulted treasury securities and accept them as collateral in its own lending operations albeit at their now lower market prices but this would put the fed on thin ice it would find itself in the middle of a political conflict democrats would criticise it for shielding republicans from the consequences of their inaction republicans would accuse the fed of complicity with the democrats socialist agenda clever analysts suggest that all this could be avoided if the treasury simply put interest payments first it could continue paying them in full as tax revenues arrive while cutting other outlays by 40 per cent but this assumes away formidable technical problems think reprogramming the government s computers and if you believe that congress would be prepared to cut social security benefits and military pay to bail out bondholders then you live in a political fantasyland some hope remains the senate parliamentarian could allow the debt ceiling increase to be attached to a reconciliation bill passed along party lines the democrats could swallow hard and vote for it on that basis doing what s right for the country regardless of the electoral consequences or republican holdouts could reconsider given the gravity of their actions recall how in the throes of the global financial crisis in 2008 then us treasury secretary henry paulson went down on one knee to beg for leadership s support after congress rejected his 700 billion financial bailout he succeeded and the house passed the measure on a second try with votes from democrats and republicans but don t hold your breath the recalcitrant congressional leader then was the democratic house speaker nancy pelosi today it s the republican senate minority leader mitch mcconnell barry eichengreen is professor of economics at the university of california berkeley he is the author of many books including the forthcoming in defence of public debt copyright project syndicate 2021
lebanon has been sent into a blackout after two main power stations went offline due to a lack of fuel the mediterranean country is battling one of the planet s worst economic crises since the 1850s and has in recent months struggled to import enough fuel oil for its power plants after the deir ammar power station was forced to stop producing power yesterday morning friday due its gas and oil reserves running out the zahrani plant also stopped this afternoon for the same reason electricite du liban edl said in a statement local officials said lebanon s energy production network dropped below 200 megawatts on friday which is barely enough power to provide for 5 000 homes it was the second such complete outage reported by edl since the start of the month after a similar incident last saturday a view of the city during power cuts due to the fuel shortage and problems in the supply of fuel in beirut lebanon restoring electricity is one of the many tough tasks facing lebanon s new government formed last month after 13 months of political wrangling edl said that a fuel oil shipment was expected to arrive on saturday evening and was expected to unload at the beginning of next week several measures have been launched in a desperate bid to keep the lights on with the state bringing in some fuel oil for power stations in exchange for medical services under a swap deal with iraq lebanon has also reached an agreement towards bringing jordanian electricity and egyptian gas into the country via war torn syria while shiite movement hezbollah has separately started hydrocarbon deliveries from iran governments are scrambling to get subsidies in place to avoid a tremendous political backlash daniel yergin author of the new map energy climate and the clash of nations told the washington post there s a pervasive anxiety about what may or may not happen this winter because of something we have no control over which is the weather adding to the mess lebanon has been paralysed by an economic crisis which has deepened as supplies of imported fuel have dried up many lebanese normally rely on private generators that run on diesel although that is also running low the economy was already creaking before the horrific explosion in august 2020 which killed hundreds of people and injuring thousands up to 300 000 people were also left homeless by the explosion which caused approximately 7 billion in damages corruption and negligence are believed to have played its role in the blast as top security officials and politicians knew a large stock of explosives was being stored at the port in beirut it emerged that 2 750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate used as a fertiliser and in explosives was left in a warehouse for six years before it went up in flames the intensity of the blast threw victims into the sea and knocked out a crater around 200 metres across while buildings were damaged up to six miles outside the blast site the explosion one fifth the size of the hiroshima nuclear bomb was heard 110 miles away in cyprus and ended in the collapse of lebanon s government as numerous politicians were charged with negligence originally published as lebanon plunges into countrywide blackout
back when we all thought we d live forever which is to say when we didn t know how good we had it i got an acting job through a friend of a friend of a friend of mine in a little summer stock theater in mount carroll illinois way up north there right on the illinois wisconsin border it was my second extended period away from home in a year and i was drunk on power specifically the power of sex mount carroll was a college town and a farming town and a good safe place to grow up surrounded by corn fields easily arrived at by traversing roads and rails that run from chicago and davenport and clinton and savannah straight as arteries to the heart i fell in love with a girl named annette deboudard the final d was silent and for that giddy golden summer she made all the difference she was just a little audrey hepburn slip of a thing with boyish hips great legs big green eyes and a saucy air she had boundless style like all ballet dancers who learn to reinvent themselves with a ribbon a hat a scarf an attitude she drove me mad little by little because making love to her 92 pounds of juilliard trained energy was like being repeatedly thrown into a cement mixer half full of honey and malted milk balls annette liked to rock she was the first woman i ever knew who was as obsessed with sex as i was and it showed she drew men better than michelangelo and my life i came to realize was miserable because of her i m talking jealousy big time i was the new sheriff in annetteville and everybody wanted me dead a summer stock theater is an interesting social experiment basically twenty or thirty young actors and technicians are thrown together for two months of intimate interaction and people pay money to watch them live through their mental and physical breakdowns on stage a new play every week all summer long rehearsal and tech work during the day the show six nights and two matinees drunken unwindings in town and sex sex sex at every other opportunity it s a lot like military boot camp everything happens fast you don t get enough sleep and when it s all over you can t believe you made it through this was the summer annette deboudard almost died because of me she was the girl woman who taught me the french term la petite mort say it french like murmur other sexy sounding whispering parisian phrases that you half understand lying alone there in the dark but always end with la petite mort at least in your mind s ear the little death orgasm annette and i were committed habitués slaves to our libidos we couldn t get enough of each other and the little death just like in the story books it was bound to end bad like a lot of affairs that go south it started with a rambling conversation without a point we were lying in each other s arms beside the lake that the actors self referentially called veronica veronica lake famous in those parts really for solitude something nearby that smelled good and the best insect nightbird orchestra in the whole midwest we made the mistake a lot of young lovers do assuming that just because we knew each other s bodies inside out we d be able to wrap our minds around our deepest fears it developed that annette had recently been engaged her boyfriend was a plebe a first year student at west point his dad was a powerful businessman who d engineered his admittance a baby had been out of the question annette s decision had torn her apart what i had misinterpreted as charmingly mercurial behavior was really a desperate series of attempts on her part to be forgiven to be told yes there there it s ok and dammit it was ok it s just that we were both so young and neither of us was any good at empathy and i probably said the wrong thing and thought the wrong thing because mostly all i could think about was gee suppose it was me what if we well my undisciplined young actor s mind ran away with the idea of not being able to live out this perfect artist s life i had envisioned how i d have to get a job to pay for a baby how this girl was irresponsible and on and on and stupidly on and all of a sudden i didn t love her anymore all of a sudden she wasn t a ballerina princess who liked to ball rather she d become a too skinny kid who forgot to take her contacts out at night and drank too much and never used birth control and she wore scarves because she never washed her hair what a difference a conversation from the heart can make she was crying hysterically great wracking sobs of remorse and misunderstanding when some friends blankets and wine bottles in hand came upon us they pretty much understood what was going on seems everybody knew the story but me like i said i was the new sheriff in town they talked us into taking our bad vibe away from the lake we called veronica but as we walked to the car annette decided she wasn t feeling well and went to her room which left the two couples and me standing there surrounded by the crickets the birds and a suddenly stagnant veronica lake we decided to drive to savannah a mississippi river town not far away where there was a bar that served great pizza with bacon and didn t mind pouring us draft beer we were underage and times were simpler the plebe was coming to visit it turned out the plebe was sorry about the baby it turned out it turned out the plebe wanted to get married anyway bag west point and live happily ever after with my eighteen year old paramour and what annette really wanted to do that night was break up with me i drank a lot of beer i was dog sick at dawn i had a crap rehearsal for the lady s not for burning a tough play in verse and that night we had to hold the curtain for oklahoma for forty five unbelievably tense minutes the plebe flew into town in a little piper cherokee his dad had bought for him as a reward for getting through his first year at the point i watched from a polite distance as annette wrapped herself around her good looking army officer candidate in that special way lovers have already in her dancer way she seemed like a different person there were grass stains on her shorts and for some reason she didn t look good in green annette the plebe a girl in the chorus and the guy who played ado annie s boyfriend had decided to take a joyride in the cherokee before the show a hot day a high density altitude a short runway a new pilot a lot of weight in the little plane and a cornfield everybody walked away after the plane s gear clipped the tops of the cornstalks and the piper flipped tail over nose settling gently safely onto its back propeller slashing furiously through the crop not quite ready for harvest annette left before the season was over and i ve always worried about that but the plebe and i became friends and we talked about her a lot not that many years down the road in vietnam where our fates once again entwined

alondon households across europe face much higher winter energy bills due to a global surge in wholesale power and gas prices and consumer groups have warned the most vulnerable in the region could be hit by fuel poverty as a result why the high prices energy companies pay a wholesale price to buy gas and electricity which they then sell to consumers as in any market this can go up or down driven by supply and demand prices typically rise in response to more demand for heating and people turning lights on earlier in winter while those in the summer period are usually lower but prices have sky rocketed due to low gas storage stocks high european union carbon prices low liquefied natural gas tanker deliveries due to higher demand from asia less gas supplies from russia than usual low renewable output and infrastructure outages benchmark european gas prices at the dutch ttf hub have risen by more than 400 percent since january while benchmark german and french power contracts have more than doubled how long could this last europe s winter heating season typically begins in october and wholesale prices are not forecast to fall significantly during the remainder of this year despite promises from some suppliers of more gas many analysts expect prices to remain elevated next year russia europe s largest gas supplier said this week that the certification of the nord stream 2 undersea gas pipeline from russia to germany which expects clearance from a german regulator could cool soaring european gas prices the regulator which said in september it had four months to complete certification said it could not rule out that nord stream 2 operations could start soon adding that all technical requirements had been met but gazprom s ability to supply more volumes to europe could be limited this winter as it is still filling its own domestic gas storages and already producing close to a 10 year high said analysts at bank of america last month norway s equninor eqnr ol europe s second largest supplier said it would increase natural gas exports to europe norway supplies just under a third of britain s gas why retail price rises many energy suppliers announced hikes to retail tariffs in recent months passing a higher wholesale cost on to consumers wholesale costs can make up a large chunk of a bill in britain for example on a dual fuel bill electricity and gas the wholesale cost can account for 40 percent of the total so when wholesale market prices rise significantly suppliers can hike consumer retail tariffs what makes up a uk household dual fuel bill suppliers can buy energy in the wholesale market on the day of delivery a day ahead and up to months or seasons in advance they have to try and predict when the price will be cheaper and buy the right amount to cover their customer needs if suppliers do not buy enough energy they might have to buy more at a price which could be higher depending on market movements this year prices have kept on climbing all summer can anyone intervene european energy commissioner kadri simson has said she would soon present a plan to overhaul the eu gas market one of the ideas proposed by spain is for the eu to buy gas jointly to take advantage of the power of its single market of 450 million consumers and create a strategic eu gas reserve but details are scant on how that would work some national governments have announced measures to try and ease the winter burden on households such as subsidies price caps or redirecting energy company profits to consumers britain which relies heavily on gas for heating introduced a price cap on the most widely used energy tariffs in 2019 aimed at ending what former prime minister theresa may called rip off pricing however britain s energy regulator ofgem has raised the cap on the most widely used tariffs called standard variable tariffs by 12 13 percent from october it said on friday it expects a significant rise of the cap again next april proposals for uk government intervention have included state loans and the creation of a bad bank to support energy suppliers as well as a windfall tax to help ease the burden on household bills it is however unclear how any of such proposals could be implemented and what their impact on the industry would be said moody s investor service what can consumers do due to a deregulated market britain has had some of the biggest choice in energy suppliers for consumers in a market of now around 40 suppliers smaller firms have less capital to hedge their wholesale power purchases against soaring prices and nine firms serving over 1 7 million customers or 6 percent of the market have ceased trading since the beginning of september consumers are usually encouraged to switch providers or to a cheaper tariff however consumer groups in britain now say standard variable tariffs subject to the price cap are among the cheapest as smaller suppliers fail and there are no longer cheaper deals available but the cap level isn t the maximum anyone will pay the price cap sets a limit on the rates you pay for each unit of gas and electricity so if you use more you ll pay more said andrew capstick energy analyst at price comarison website moneysupermarket com regulators such as britain s ofgem urge consumers to contact their energy provider if they are struggling to pay their bills to explain when and how much can be paid energy efficiency measures such as improved insulation energy efficient lighting and smart meters are also advised but could require upfront costs reducing energy usage is much easier in the summer months
as the rain came down the fingers went up three to four inches of rain fell the night before the bond brook tread fest organizers of the annual mountain bike race in augusta thought about postponing but they couldn t sept 26 was already a makeup date the event had been scheduled for june but was pushed to the fall because of a browntail moth infestation this one was probably the hardest tread

riders showed up on sept 12 for the maxxis eastern states cup box showdown some of the best riders on the continent are here said justin lagassey before the start of the pro division race the competition is fierce but friendly lagassey of plymouth new hampshire himself built a few of trails on teague hill in turner a few summers ago a logging operation had other plans for the land lagassey built on so he moved over to highland mountain bike park in new hampshire where he continues to build advertisement the momentum is huge said dave richard of vassalboro i think the momentum is not even close to peeking yet because people are excited about all the opportunities here in maine he said while in lewiston auburn for the dempsey challenge two weeks ago he works for specialized bicycles and travels around the country to bike events and races the pandemic has been very tough on people but the pandemic has also got more people out to hike to bike to do different things outdoors richard said pandemic aside covid is not the only reason people have found a new passion riding bikes through the woods another is technology and a third is flow it s an exciting time to be in the bike business ben king said from behind the counter at mathieu s cycle in oakland there is a lot of really cool innovation coming out larger wheel sizes modern geometry suspension dropper posts and electronic shifting are not necessarily new to mountain bikes but tweaks in the past few years have made modern bikes a dream to peddle versus the rigid bikes that seasoned riders grew up on and yes even electric motors are becoming more popular the second generation of e bikes are much better than the first said king advertisement as for flow think of trails built by machine rather than by hand flow trails tend to be smoother and less technical than the traditional new england single track that maine has been known for there is more demand for smoother machine built flow trails said riley but we are trying to really balance where we came from as far as that traditional new england single track that has roots rocks and technical challenges flow trails are enticing to newer riders but are liked by those with more experience as well if your thoughtful about your builds a beginner will enjoy them as much as more experienced riders said trail steward wil libby of livermore who doesn t love flow trails riley acknowledged advertisement some do some don t but holding onto that new england identity is important said richard riding is so different throughout the country riding in the west is way different than it is in the east the south southeast southwest he said everybody offers a different type of riding when richard is on the road at mountain bike events throughout the country it s the old school single track that sets maine apart we always talk about new england single track rocky rooty very natural single track he said adding that and the hospitality of new england people is what i would tell people as to why they should come to maine and ride king would like to ride in maine but he can t find a bike and he works at mathieu s cycle this year has been weird because there are just no bikes king said bike shops quickly sold out of mountain bikes at the start of the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 overseas factories responsible for the bike parts shut down operations to contain the spread of the coronavirus add shipping backlogs and the high cost of shipping containers to the mess and there are simply not many bikes on showroom floors advertisement you want to help people when they come in said king you want to help them out but you can t there is nothing you can do it s frustrating for both the customers and on the retailer s end frank jalbert of busytown bikes in lewiston said the shop has been super busy with bike repairs more people are having their old bikes fixed because there are no new bikes available said jalbert that is the only option at the moment we are mostly a repair business right now king agreed we are noticing a lot of people resuscitating old barn bikes people are dragging their old rust buckets out of the garage we try to re grease the wheels and get them going again nobody seems to know king said when bikes or parts will be available i m hoping things are starting to turn the corner we are starting to see some things in stock more but there are no assurances now that next summer is going to be any different but 2022 will be different advertisement for one more trails are coming riley s youth trail builders will be in auburn adding to the network of trails at mt apatite a one mile trail that will connect the signature flow trail with the tight rocky rooty carrie on trail will be built the project is phase three of a combined effort between central maine nemba and the city of auburn it will be nice to be back in auburn said libby who s tasked with keeping the young builders in line sick jumps are fun but the teenage crew needs to keep all abilities in mind he noted and a second reason why 2022 will be different the world s best will be in maine the draw the enduro world series will be at sugarloaf from aug 20 21 and riders from all over the world will be there so will lagassey to see the ews come to my home state is an opportunity i am not going to miss he said i think the world is really going to enjoy this advertisement richard added it s huge it s huge for the economy its huge for cycling ews is world class to have that come to sugarloaf is huge as with all outdoor activities weather is an important factor yes it rained a lot this past summer and wet trails played a role in most every major event it rained during the central maine cycling challenge in farmington it rained during the late stages of the 12 hour race at bradbury state park and as the show of fingers attested it was a rainy mess for the tread fest but we pulled it off riley said about the festival one hundred and seventy riders signed up a little over half showed up which is pretty good considering we had three to four inches of rain overnight riding on wet trails is frowned upon because of the damage done while riding muddy trails but canceling large fundraising events rarely happens because of rain i think every penny we raised for the trails is going back into these trails to fix them riley said after the last mud covered racer crossed the finish line but that is all right that s what we do we had a good event we had fun so thanks in part to covid 19 and despite rain a shortage of parts and no new bikes in 2021 we definitely have seen a lot of new trail growth said marshall riley added we have seen a huge growth in the number of people on the trails so maybe the pandemic has done nothing great for us richard said but it has gotten people outside that s not a bad thing send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

some people prolong their stay at work beyond the set age while others go into business warren buffett one of the world s most famous business magnates is 91 he is the chairman and ceo of the company he founded berkshire hathaway and is so suave in his craft that fellow billionaires call him the oracle of omaha should he not have retired at that age bidco chairman vimal shah in a past interview dismissed the idea of retirement the shah family does not retire they step up there are four levels in the business he said and we can only step up to the higher one when we are ripe enough for it do people even retire with covid 19 disrupting workplace practices will workers still aim for a certain age to hang their boots will we work forever according to tv channel cnbc research from the centre for retirement research at boston college shows that americans mostly tend to claim retirement benefits either around the age of 62 or their full retirement age as defined by social security this does not sound like a huge departure from what happens in kenya while private companies have internal human resource policies that state their employees retirement age government workers should leave at 60 according to the public service act it would be bold to assume that after attaining this age the retirees tour the world for the remainder of their lives tasting the finest cuisines in the malibus and maldives of this world most of them go into business while a number of them seek extension of their contracts nobody really wants to retire some follow the doctrine of the financial independence retire early fire movement hoping to have the freedom and means to enjoy their retirement fire is an early retirement movement where people aggressively save with the intention of retiring in their 30s or 40s cnbc says it is not for the faint of heart you ll have to invest more than half of your annual income and cut down on all of your expenses in order to retire early fire adherents abide by the four per cent rule first developed by financial advisor william bengen in 1994 the four per cent rule suggests that people save 25 times their annual living expenses and withdraw only four per cent of their nest egg in retirement only increasing the amount to adjust for inflation cnbc says but few have this kind of discipline fewer earn enough to accommodate such a plan the covid 19 pandemic s impact on jobs and earnings has shaken many work and retirement models according to the society for human resource management shrm an american professional membership association the worsening economic situation means that many employees may be forced to tap into their retirement savings to stay afloat and while that may provide access to funds now it could come back to hurt them in their golden years shrm says more than half 52 per cent of respondents said they will need to dip into their long term savings in a year or less according to an april survey of 5 000 people by betterment a new york city based financial services company in addition to that many employees also plan to work longer a moneyrates survey conducted in march found that 36 4 per cent of americans within 20 years of retirement expect the covid 19 crisis will delay their retirement shrm says will these people retire luke kinoti a corporate executive author and entrepreneur says some people still need to work after retirement while others have their money working for them in either case it is not holiday time research shows that 80 per cent of workers want to start a business after retirement because they need to meet their daily needs as high expenses and low income levels make it hard for them to save earlier for their sunset years he says others feel they cannot afford to retire while others view their children as an old age safety net writes mr kinoti in his book the agile investor in a past interview at fortune s most powerful women summit mr buffett said it would be crazy for him to leave his job according to business insyder if i quit today i see these people they spend a whole week planning their haircut that is not my idea of living he said but buffett also enjoys his job which is also one of the reasons he would rather continue working i would rather do this than anything in the world he said my social security check is coming every day i don t need this i m tap dancing to work every day there s nothing more exciting than to get there it doesn t get better than that those who subscribe to his school of thought will certainly not be planning to retire according to the economist until the covid 19 pandemic the average age of retirement among americans had been steadily moving upwards since the mid 1980s that has stalled the proportion of people aged 55 and over who are retired has risen by two percentage points compared with before the pandemic to 50 per cent the magazine said nearly half of americans 49 9 per cent expect to retire before they turn 62 a two percentage point increase from two years ago according to the federal reserve bank of new york one reason given for the change in retirement patterns is that some americans particularly the well off are choosing to take it easy a booming stock market and soaring house prices have made early retirement more viable for others working through a public health crisis has changed their priorities falling life expectancy it decreased by 1 9 years between 2018 and 2020 may have inspired some americans to make the most of their golden years said the economist older workers may also be especially nervous about returning to offices given that they face a higher risk of dying from covid 19 than their younger colleagues while others are extending their working deadlines these ones are reducing it and running to the mantra you only live once kinoti says people should invest for retirement at whatever age the first step in this process is to calculate the amount of investment accumulated in various savings plans over one s working life he says then it is necessary to calculate the amount of retirement income that can be provided by that wealth the rule of the thumb is for employees to save at least 10 per cent of their income for retirement as soon as they start work if you don t do this and leave it until you are older this percentage will rise rapidly kinoti says he advocates for saving in pension plans occupational pension schemes umbrella schemes and provident and gratuity schemes to plan to retire one has to make sure that their money is making them more money one of the reasons why the working class retire poor is that they work for money as opposed to having money work for them says kinoti income is manifested in three ways earned income including salaries portfolio income such as stocks and pensions and passive income such as rentals and royalties if you want to retire poor keep working for money without an alternative source of income additionally many people retire poor simply because they have no golden goose and those that do frequently kill it for immediate gratification kinoti says saving a lot of money means that the retirement years are spent in relative peace and less hassle but do we truly retire

bridgeport anglers at the bridgeport state recreation area might get a few more bites after rock creek fish hatchery released a total of 3 400 rainbow trout into two of the lakes on friday julie fraley made the nearly three hour drive from park nebraska to release 2 000 rainbow trout into the middle lake at bridgeport sra an additional 1 400 were released into the northwest lake on wednesday fraley said she makes several stops to the bridgeport area as rock creek stocks the middle lake once a year and the northwest lake gets fresh rainbow trout several times several factors go into how many of the fish are put into the lakes basically biologists take the acreage of the lake and they figure it out they have some sort of calculations and then they just bring it to me and go this is what your stocking rate is she said the exact number of fish put into the lake is not known fraley said it s all by weight we do sample count on them so we know about how many fish per pound there are then we load according to that roughly there s 2 000 fish it could be more she said fraley said they have a process to get the fish ready to be released into area waters we take them off of feed a couple of days before we let them sit in the raceway when we transport them out of the ponds and into the raceway they get a 1 salt bath then when i transport them to be released they get a quarter percent salt bath she said the salt bath helps clean organisms and bacteria off of the fish before they re released into waterways once they are packed for transporting the water is oxygenated with condensed oxygen and aerators the fish can be seen breaking the surface and even jumping out of the water soon after being released from what i know it helps the fish get the condensed oxygen off and out of their air bladder diving up and down helps them remove that fraley said the stop in bridgeport is just one of many stops the hatchery makes in the panhandle from march through may i think we usually hit the zoo ponds terry s lake and the morrill sandpits at least twice then we hit morrill and the zoo ponds and bridgeport in the fall fraley said rock creek stocks mostly rainbow trout in the panhandle we mainly raise rainbow trout we do have tiger trout on the property right now we do those every other year we do raise several warm water species but usually those go east she said there is no need to wait to fish the rainbow trout fraley said she said anglers can start casting their lines now we do put and take so we raise 10 inch trout so the fisherman will come in and fish those out and not have them stay in there fraley said if we were doing like other states we d raise 5 inch fish and put twice as many in there that way if any of them get eaten you still probably have about 50 that survived but with put and take we want you to come fishing they re ready to go there are limits on trout i believe you can only have one over 19 inches fraley said the hope is that stocking the lakes will inspire people to go out and fish they re probably gone within two to three weeks once people find out they re there they re gone she said and that s what we want we want to take your kids or grandkids out fishing trout are easy to raise they re easy to catch we hope it gets them interested in fishing she said

by jim ritch more than three years of legal wrangling over the fate of the former bay coast railroad may enter its final phase on oct 18 when contractors begin north of onancock tearing up track but a former railroad manager and retired public defender say that the fight to save the line continues and that they have an operator willing to take it over the canonie atlantic board owner of the railroad gave the go ahead on monday night for up to 10 months of work to remove the tracks south to cape charles said spencer murray vice chairman the tracks can never be used as is they happen to be of very good steel that can be repurposed the price right now is good murray said removal of the rails is necessary for the right of way to be protected under the national trails act he said the national trails act requires that we not erect any permanent structures on the right of way he said we are seeking protection to preserve our broadband line that runs along the railroad right of way anec connections that cross it and the hampton roads sanitary district s proposed forced main he said without legal protection between 500 and 600 separate parcels that make up the 49 mile railroad would have to be renegotiated proceeds from the sale are expected to more than cover the cost of removing the tracks he said the use of the profits has not been stipulated and the amount isn t exactly known because the contract allows for some flexibility in the resale price of steel he said murray declined to name the company that was awarded the bid saying that a press release is forthcoming the firm was chosen after a competitive bid process in part because the firm has completed over 3 000 miles of repurposing railroad tracks former railroad manager john paffrath of cape charles and attorney roger malick of baltimore hope to see traffic return to the tracks much sooner perhaps by christmas officers in a nonprofit corporation the pair recently garnered approvals from town councils in parksley and exmore supporting the start of rail biking and an eventual return to active railroading paffrath said that the operator of three new jersey short line railroads is willing to invest 100 000 for track improvements and 600 000 in rolling stock to begin a venture no formal submission or request has been made to canonie atlantic or the accomack northampton transportation district commission said murray the two sides strongly disagree on the condition of the tracks and the funding needed to bring them back to working order paffrath believes that 70 of the line is already in grade one condition as defined by the federal railroad administration this would permit speeds of 8 to 10 miles per hour said murray murray said two railroads the buckingham branch railroad of dillwyn va and the delmarva central railroad in delaware believed that the necessary repairs would be in the millions of dollars and that the line could not be operated profitably the two sides also disagree on the potential amount of traffic on the line paffrath said that in 2018 he collected letters of interest to ship as many as 1 700 cars of freight annually and he envisions light rail and tourist trains bringing the total to nearly 5 000 cars when bay coast railroad filed for bankruptcy in 2018 it was hauling on only about 500 cars per year said murray don hart chair of canonie atlantic and accomack district 9 supervisor said that the company has worked with several parties interested in operating the railroad however we can t have pie in the sky proposals they ve got to put some meat on those bones he said

former coronation street star sally lindsay has penned new murder mystery the madame blanc mysteries and opened up to the sunday people s love sunday magazine about the strange inspiration behind it since bursting onto the scene in 2001 as coronation street barmaid shelley unwin actress sally lindsay has ticked a lot of boxes when it comes to stage and screen she s starred in prime time dramas hosted a quiz show appeared in sitcoms been a panellist on loose women and runs her own production company saffron cherry productions now at the age of 48 she has added another string to her bow by creating and co writing a new murder mystery series for channel 5 called the madame blanc mysteries in which she plays the leading role the series is due to air this week but sally is still in a state of disbelief and declares that if it s rubbish she s opening a buttie van in torremolinos image viacomcbs viacomcbs if that ever happened she d no doubt smash it as sally is a person who gets things done and does them well when we admire her zoom background which is worthy of the pages of an interiors magazine she swivels the camera round and reveals that it s a garden shed painted in fashionable teal i couldn t find a painter so i did it myself i ve turned my garden shed into a soho ladies club sally who lives in south london with her musician husband steve and their 11 year old twin boys gives us the lowdown on the new show and what it s like to finally feel confident in her talents tell us a bit about the series i play a woman called jean white who runs an antiques business in cheshire her husband gets their stock from the south of france one day she gets a call to say that he has died in a crash out there and then she finds out that there is no money left in their account their shop has been remortgaged to the hilt and their assets pawned off image dave benett getty images dave benett getty images image viacomcbs viacomcbs all she has left is a cottage in a place called saint victoire she suspects foul play and finds out there is another mrs white out there i ve always loved murder mysteries like murder she wrote and columbo and with this one there is this moriarty character in the background is jean named after you i am mrs white but i didn t change my name when i got married i did it as a little homage to my husband steve who wrote the score for the show his band played the music too jean blanc is a really cool name what made you try writing for the first time i ve created tv shows before but never co written anything i did it with my friend actress sue vincent who was in mount pleasant with me we ve been writing together for about five years and although we have got very close nothing of ours has ever been made i came up with the idea after going on holiday to majorca about five years ago i met a woman there who is a brilliantly knowledgeable antiques dealer and she told me that she and her husband drive over to the south of france twice a month as there are these little villages that are antiques hubs for the rest of europe what s fashionable in one country is tat in another image granada television granada television image rex rex do you know anything about antiques no but what i have done in jean is fulfil my fantasies i would love to be massively observant like her with sherlockian powers of observation i ll tell you how unobservant i am in real life i went into london for a posh meeting with my favourite boots in a rubbish shopping bag i was going to take them to the cobblers on the corner at charing cross but when i went the cobblers was actually a pret and had been for five years i hadn t noticed we loved madam blanc s clothes so did i and i never like the clothes i wear for tv dramas our wardrobe master made 60 of jean s outfits the rest came from this wonderful girl who has a stall in pimlico market called woo woo boutique she uses recycled materials and makes lovely classic designs i m obsessed with her clothes now if someone asks me where did you get that dress i ll know what to say because in 25 years i ve never been able to answer that question did you film the show in france no we filmed it in a place called gozo in malta if you watch an american drama set in france it s always filmed there it looks like the south of france it s cheaper and there are already tv crews out there how long were you away from your family i didn t see my sons for 10 weeks it was horrible steve was due to bring them over and i was really excited i d hired a villa and the production team helped me plan lots for them to do but for some reason malta wasn t on the green list so they couldn t come image itv itv how do you juggle motherhood with work commitments steve and i sleep a lot we re always in bed by 10pm he works locally so is around for the boys every friday we plan the next week to decide who is going to pick whom up etc it s a matter of being organised really you created co wrote and produced the madame blanc mysteries did you feel under pressure after i had the twins i realised that everything else was a bonus i decided then that it didn t really matter if nobody liked me or my ideas in a meeting i have been on so many tv sets why would somebody straight from cambridge know any more than me were you this confident at 24 when you landed your corrie role i was a bolshy 24 year old and i talked my way into coronation street to be fair but i was an actor and i didn t know that there were all these other aspects to the profession i d come straight from university i wasn t one of those kids who d been tap dancing since the age of five i never imagined i would have the skills to do what i do now but i m still growing i learn something new every day is it a good time to be an actress in her 40s it s better than it used to be but you know to be fair i have written this show myself i still think there is a predominance of men on screen with madame blanc i ve tried to bring in different sexualities skin tone etc if you make it very normal it becomes normal however when it comes to women and tv we re still not quite there yet

necessarily mean they d become involved romantically at the same time it could also head down the route of like it being platonic because two people are allowed to travel together and not have that relationship she said people have asked about it people have wanted it me and jodes have a lovely relationship as people as actors and our characters have a really really nice relationship and i think it s been written very naturally 3 jms faq j michael straczynski told facebook readers today i m getting a lot of nearly identical questions on various forums here twitter elsewhere so to avoid

of that is classified i can t publicly discuss any of it so there s no point in asking anything about the story for the new pilot because i can t tell you but patrons here will be the first to get the

dirda anoints ambrose bierce as one of america s best in the new york review of books ambrose bierce 1842 1913 is arguably the finest not quite first rate writer in nineteenth century american literature civil war veteran contrarian journalist master of the short story muckraker epigrammatist and versifier he is today most widely known for that word hoard of cynical definitions the devil s dictionary and for a handful of shockingly cruel stories about the civil war in those dozen or so tales of soldiers gathered in the collection eventually titled in the midst of life 1892 augmented in 1898 and 1909 a brother shoots his brother a sniper is compelled to kill his father and a cannoneer obeys the order to destroy his own house where his wife and child await his return from battle the

time reader ever forgets the shock of its final sentences 5 sandcastles in the air john scalzi registers his take on the epic film dune a review at whatever to bring villeneuve himself back into it it s fair to say that he is a very fine match for the material to begin villeneuve s visual aesthetic and its tendency to frame people as tiny elements in a much larger composition is right at home with the dune source material in which legions of fremen and sardaukar and harkonnens stab at each other and 400 meter sandworms tunnel through the dunes of arrakis to continue anyone who has seen villeneuve s filmography is well aware he is a very very very serious dude there s not a rom com anywhere in his history dune s single attempt at a joke is done and over in the first 20 minutes the film almost before it even registers one can argue whether or not frank herbert s prose and story styling in dune is exhaustingly and pretentiously serious or not but it is what it is given what it is it needs a director whose own style matches that s villeneuve i don t care to see villeneuve s take on say galaxy quest but dune yup that s a match 6 100 accurate prediction here s ursula vernon s reaction thread starts here a few highlights basically it s very pretty and very long and everyone dies that s not a spoiler it s dune what did you expect kingfisher wombat ursulav october 28 2021 ah

including alma katsu stephen graham jones and grady hendrix horror fiction in the age of covid a roundtable discussion i came to horror the same way i came to rihanna later than most but with the commensurate fiery passion of a true convert crime and horror have after all been slowly converging for many years as domestic suspense transformed into the new gothic and psychological thrillers took over from procedurals as the dominant trend in the genre and yet despite my newfound fandom i m about as poorly informed a horror reader as one could be i ve only read one stephen king novel and it was mr mercedes so i invited a whole bunch of authors with horror novels out in 2021 to join me for a roundtable discussion on the genre and its appeal to crime fans and in which i could stealthily attempt to figure what exactly horror is and why we re all enjoying it so much during the pandemic 9 come and get my copper atlas obscura tells how the genre got its name and contends they had a beneficial side effect how gruesome penny dreadfuls got victorian children reading as one might expect no audience was drawn into the world of penny dreadfuls more than children and teenagers in fact they specifically targeted young readers many of the stories feature young characters such as the schoolboy jack harkaway who would become as beloved to victorian readers as harry potter is today according to the british library boys of england a periodical marketed to young boys first introduced the character in the 1871 penny dreadful jack harkaway s schooldays which details the protagonist running away from school boarding a ship and embarking on a life of adventure and travel jack even had to battle a 15 foot python when one of his many pranks went awry the popularity of penny dreadfuls had another side they helped to promote literacy especially among younger readers at a time when for many children formal education was nonexistent or well dickensian the proliferation of such cheap reading material created an incentive to require literacy says professor jonathan rose author of the intellectual life of the british working classes people were invested in the stories of jack harkaway and sweeney todd and there was only one good way to keep up learn to read while some historians credit compulsory education for the increased literacy of the age the fact is that most of the increase in literacy happened before you got universal free education says rose in england education wasn t required for all children until 1880 decades into the heyday of penny dreadfuls 10 de

simple bw that i later learned belonged bernie wrightson the artist who d soon become my comic book hero as well as a later inspiration for my writing wrightson s cover became my gateway into the world of 1970s horror comics five years later i had the pleasure of seeing the original pen and ink drawing in its entire poetic grotesque splendor hanging on the wall of the new york comic art

halloween 1981 the roleplaying world met and grew to love the lovecraft inspired game in which characters boldly confront the unknown before being consumed by it if there s one thing humans seem to

many collectors contributed to this book by lending paperbacks to ed also he visited several art collectors his visit to my house can serve as an example of his methods in borrowing so many books one afternoon several months ago he visited me and we went through the rooms discussing and looking at my paperback collection we started on the second floor in the room that my wife and kids call the paperback room the entire room is devoted to detective and mystery paperbacks including what may be a complete set of the hundreds of dell mapbacks also in the room is some original cover art and several paperback racks which took me decades to find these wooden racks were made to hold paperbacks for sale and were usually destroyed or lost over the years we then went to my basement where we looked and talked about my science fiction western and mainstream paperbacks ed ended up borrowing two boxes full of paperbacks perhaps 75 to 100 of which close to 50 may have been used in the book by the way i noticed one paperback lacked the 50 words of comment if there is a reprint or revised edition in the future page 116 needs comments for poul anderson s brain wave 18 never say never ghostbusters afterlife director jason reitman used his complicated relationship with his father to take on the franchise he s avoided his whole life msn s jason guerrasio profiles the younger reitman reitman s change of heart began with the idea of a girl in a cornfield wearing a proton pack a decade ago i had this vision of a girl shooting a proton pack in a cornfield and suddenly popcorn flying up and her catching and eating it reitman said with a far off look in his eye as he sipped on his morning coffee inside his home office the sun shined in from his backyard window beside his desk it was just one of those images where i was like well i don t know what to do with that he continued reitman is the first to admit that he usually doesn t embrace these types of ideas his movies up to this point have been grounded in reality he s preferred the independently financed dramas that explore the human condition and usually feature women going through challenging times in their lives like a teenaged pregnancy juno or a mid life crisis tully he s always had the same answer when asked if he ll ever make a ghostbusters movie no 19 and if you want to play along at home gizmodo reports hasbro s fan funded haslab is offering the chance to purchase a full scale model of the iconic prop ghostbusters proton pack furthermore the prop even has a metal v hook bracket that connects to the metal v hook bracket on the bottom of the neutrona wand the neutrona wand being another hasbro pulse item you can preorder here for 125 if you re not up on your ghostbusters equipment lingo the neutrona wand well it s the gun that connects to the proton pack so if you really want to get your cosplay on you re looking at dropping 525 for the pair that is assuming the proton pack project gets fully funded but i wouldn t be too worried about that more than half of the 7 000 backers needed have signed up since the project launched yesterday and there are still 45 days to go 20 octothorpe

think you ve found e t call for a framework for reporting evidence for life beyond earth nature has the details our generation could realistically be the one to discover evidence of life beyond earth with this privileged potential comes responsibility the magnitude of the question of whether we are alone in the universe and the public interest therein opens the possibility that results may be taken to imply more than the observations support or than the observers intend as life detection objectives become increasingly prominent in space sciences it is essential to open a community dialogue about how to convey information in a subject matter that is diverse complicated and has a high potential to be sensationalized establishing best practices for communicating about life detection can serve to set reasonable expectations on the early stages of a hugely challenging endeavour attach value to incremental steps along the path and build public trust by making clear that false starts and dead ends are an expected and potentially productive part of the scientific process
don t miss out on the headlines from world followed categories will be added to my news lebanon has been sent into a blackout after two main power stations went offline due to a lack of fuel the mediterranean country is battling one of the planet s worst economic crises since the 1850s and has in recent months struggled to import enough fuel oil for its power plants after the deir ammar power station was forced to stop producing power yesterday morning friday due its gas and oil reserves running out the zahrani plant also stopped this afternoon for the same reason electricite du liban edl said in a statement local officials said lebanon s energy production network dropped below 200 megawatts on friday which is barely enough power to provide for 5 000 homes it was the second such complete outage reported by edl since the start of the month after a similar incident last saturday a view of the city during power cuts due to the fuel shortage and problems in the supply of fuel in beirut lebanon restoring electricity is one of the many tough tasks facing lebanon s new government formed last month after 13 months of political wrangling edl said that a fuel oil shipment was expected to arrive on saturday evening and was expected to unload at the beginning of next week several measures have been launched in a desperate bid to keep the lights on with the state bringing in some fuel oil for power stations in exchange for medical services under a swap deal with iraq lebanon has also reached an agreement towards bringing jordanian electricity and egyptian gas into the country via war torn syria while shiite movement hezbollah has separately started hydrocarbon deliveries from iran governments are scrambling to get subsidies in place to avoid a tremendous political backlash daniel yergin author of the new map energy climate and the clash of nations told the washington post there s a pervasive anxiety about what may or may not happen this winter because of something we have no control over which is the weather adding to the mess lebanon has been paralysed by an economic crisis which has deepened as supplies of imported fuel have dried up many lebanese normally rely on private generators that run on diesel although that is also running low the economy was already creaking before the horrific explosion in august 2020 which killed hundreds of people and injuring thousands up to 300 000 people were also left homeless by the explosion which caused approximately 7 billion in damages corruption and negligence are believed to have played its role in the blast as top security officials and politicians knew a large stock of explosives was being stored at the port in beirut it emerged that 2 750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate used as a fertiliser and in explosives was left in a warehouse for six years before it went up in flames the intensity of the blast threw victims into the sea and knocked out a crater around 200 metres across while buildings were damaged up to six miles outside the blast site the explosion one fifth the size of the hiroshima nuclear bomb was heard 110 miles away in cyprus and ended in the collapse of lebanon s government as numerous politicians were charged with negligence originally published as lebanon plunges into countrywide blackout

why the debt ceiling is the basement of u s politics the sunday political brunch the big national political headline of the week was that senate republicans paved a path forward with democrats to raise the u s debt ceiling there was a temporary short term compromise the old line that the u s currency backs the full faith and credit of the united states still holds true the bigger question is does anyone care or does this matter let s brunch on that this week deferring debt default look this has happened what seems like a million times before the nation comes to the brink of the abyss ready to default on its debt no matter if republicans or democrats are in charge and then suddenly there is a bipartisan band aid applied to stop the bleeding when sometimes a tourniquet is needed thursday night the senate upped the borrowing limit by 480 billion dollars until december 3 when we will revisit this again sorry are your eyes glazing over yet why this is a non issue folks i realize this will have some potentially stabilizing effects on jittery financial markets but that s about it if they fail to pass something then that s a real headline but the bottom line churns on albeit deeper in debt but as the old saying goes wall street likes certainty investors and funds will go forth and will address accordingly why this falls flat politically images are critical in politics they convey the human joy of fixing our problems or the pain of suffering from not fixing problems oh i can already see the republican campaign ads next year showing the troubled evacuation of afghanistan and the chaotic immigration policies at the u s southern border democrats in turn will likely show crowds of people in face masks and death counts they believe date back to the trump administration they ll show the january 6 capitol riots too images can be very powerful to both sides assuming you have the imagery can someone paint me a photo or record a video of a debt ceiling i know it s an important issue but it s vacant of pictures it dies with a thud the short term problem and maybe the long term too president biden s approval ratings are taking a sudden turn south something you don t want 13 months before the midterm elections the latest real clear politics composite poll has 47 percent approving of biden s job performance while 48 percent disapprove today that doesn t seem like much but everything has turned on the white house around october 1st on september 27 a the hill harrisx poll had biden s approval rating at 48 positive 43 percent negative it is now trending in the wrong direction is there time to right the ship of course there is but the afghanistan and southern border images have left him deeply wounded and politically vulnerable are candidates really desperate i ve written for weeks about the sad and pathetic begging for cash by political candidates on both sides of the aisle are they really this needy here s the opening salvo from sen marco rubio r florida who is running for a third term i don t know how else i can put this my team is desperate we have a massive financial deadline coming up and we are not on pace to hit our goal really this is the marquee senate race in 2022 with rubio likely facing rep val demings d florida in the general election both sides are raising buckets of cash but for rubio to declare he is desperate wow hyperbole i know on the other hand look as bizarre as that republican appeal is democrats are hardly standing on the moral higher ground here is a regular bot email i get from them first the headline states update cnn s senate race rankings that s deceitful as you have the immediate impression the email is coming from cnn when in fact it is not then there is the shameless but fair pitch for money chip in 5 or more right now so senate democrats can expand our majority and keep power out of mitch mcconnell s hands we re still 14 146 short of today s fundraising goal both sides are openly begging and it s kind of pathetic take an image inventory when i was not working as a journalist i helped run two successful political campaigns one for a democrat and one for a republican here s my advice to both sides images matter one of my candidates was a retired fire chief who was wearing a suit for his tv pitch i said did they give you the white fire chief s helmet when you retired when he said yes i told him to go get it and tuck it under his arm in the commercial he never mentioned it but the symbolism was gold in my other race a town planning commissioner wanted to win a town council seat i said roll out a sheet of construction blueprints and we ll videotape as you review them again the images without any dialogue gave the impression of expertise and authority both my clients won now that we have the debt ceiling solved temporarily which infrastructure bill do you favor the traditional infrastructure bill that focuses on roads bridges highways broadband and

after years of debate in germany and beyond the russian state backed energy giant gazprom confirmed last month that it had finished building nord stream 2 a 760 mile pipeline with the potential to send 55bn cubic metres of gas under the baltic sea to germany every year russia is already europe s biggest gas supplier but once running nord stream 2 would offer a significant boost to the annual 170bn cubic metres that keep lights on across the continent never shy of seizing an opportunity in a crisis russia s deputy prime minister alexander novak suggested last week that swift approval from germany s regulators for nord stream 2 currently set to take months could be the answer to the soaring gas prices troubling european governments it was a move that cooled markets and followed intense pressure from europe and the international energy agency the world s energy watchdog to boost supplies in reality nord stream 2 cannot be the answer to the short term crisis at best gazprom has conceded that it would probably only be running at 10 of capacity in the remaining months of this year if gazprom really wished to cool markets it could book further capacity for gas supply via pipes through poland and ukraine indeed there are signs that russia has been increasing supply in the past two days and once gazprom has hit a november deadline of being fully stocked for this winter s domestic demand even more gas should be available for europeans the nord stream 2 argument underlines the dilemma facing europe as it wrestles with how to clean up its energy supplies europe is setting itself some challenging targets in the name of the climate emergency including raising the share of renewable energy in the eu to 40 that is where money is being invested but as europe closes its coal mines and gears up its wind turbines there will be a difficult transition period germany made that situation even tougher with its decision to phase out nuclear power after the 2011 fukushima disaster leaving it relying on fossil fuels to help bridge the gap to a renewables powered future those opposed to nord stream 2 including the white house argue that it is part of the kremlin s geopolitical strategy while ostensibly a private sector project it is clearly under vladimir putin s control the us argues that regulatory approval will only reinforce europe s dependence on russia and undermine ukraine a key western ally by making its pipelines redundant perhaps putin will seek to play politics with gas but the kremlin has been loth to do so in the past seeking instead to be a reliable partner and russia has one key interest above all and that is to sell as much gas as it can as swiftly as possible putin s change of heart last week had this economic reality in mind while it revels in being a nuisance for its neighbours it is not in its interests to accelerate the shift to renewables in europe the clock is ticking on fossil fuels and russia would be undermining its finances by speeding up europe s decarbonisation as for ukraine there is ample evidence that the transit fees paid by europeans for gas sourced from its old pipelines have ended up in the pockets of some less than reputable characters and they are old pipelines prone to leaks and explosions nord stream 2 would be a cheaper and more efficient source of supply europe has every interest in helping ukraine rebuild its economy but the broken model of today isn t necessarily what needs preserving some additionally argue that the growth of the liquefied natural gas market lng makes pipelines and nord stream 2 less relevant lng can be shipped around the world the developments over the past few days offer some pause for reflection most lng is locked into long term contracts the majority of which are destined for asia as china emerged from the global pandemic it was insatiable in buying up the unreserved stock brazil added to the shortfall as it turned to lng to produce electricity normally generated by hydropower dams putin is not a man europe wants to do business with but the global energy crunch has given him and his pet project a powerful negotiating position one that may force europe s hand ba may rue its lack of generosity two of the uk s biggest airlines british airways and ryanair were adjudged by the competition and markets authority not to have broken the law when they refused to refund customers who were prevented by covid rules from taking flights they had booked but the airlines were far from vindicated only a lack of legal clarity and an uncertain court battle prompted the cma to drop its investigation and it stated unequivocally that passengers had unfairly lost out some may see this as a demonstration of the toothlessness of a cma but neither government nor the airlines come out of the chapter looking good ba had called the cma investigation at a time when it was pole axed by travel bans and making redundancies incredible ryanair maintained more bullishly that it was providing the flights and obeying the law the carriers had offered their most generous terms and conditions ever refunding millions of cancelled flights and allowing free rebooking their own schedules were thrown into disarray at short notice by suddenly changing government travel rules any fine would have paled beside the billions airlines lost during the pandemic wider consumer behaviour also complicates the picture essential international travel was permitted and those who needed to fly accepted the hardship of quarantine as uk city hotels could testify after a summer of late cancellations plenty of holidaymakers saw flexible covid policies as a risk free back up plan many though will have been unjustly stung in situations that slipped through insurance policies for low fare ryanair low expectations are priced in ba however aggrieved it feels should be concerned that customers will perceive it has not met a fairer standard in the long run more generous competitors may reap the rewards dave there s a wee problem saving christmas he managed to dig the uk s biggest supermarket out of a hole and now the government is hoping dave lewis can rescue christmas as a supply chain tsar the former tesco boss has been tasked with fixing a crisis caused largely by staff shortages it started with lorry drivers but retailers are now struggling to recruit warehouse workers especially those with special skills such as forklift truckers after brexit many people who used to come from europe for seasonal work can find better and more lucrative jobs elsewhere meanwhile the government s slow and ill conceived action on resolving the issue is pushing industry into finding creative solutions tesco last week credited its investment in rail freight for helping it ride out the worst of the supply chain crisis it has plans to increase the number of containers it transports by train from 65 000 a year to 90 000 at christmas the supermarket is not the only one trying new ideas last week john lewis was the latest business to open a driver academy aiming to get 90 more people behind the wheel of a lorry every year on a completely different tack ikea announced plans to shift production of some furniture from the far east to turkey cutting the distance goods will have to be shipped and ocado last week invested 10m in self driving vehicle startup wayve and will trial four vans in london over the coming months supported by human operators such ideas are for now a small fry alternative to a battle for workers that has led to pay rises and big bonuses for some formerly underpaid and under appreciated groups of employees in the longer term though driving lorries in the uk must be made much more attractive when even simple benefits such as washing facilities and toilets are well below standard it s hardly a surprise that sought after drivers are choosing to truck on elsewhere lewis could do worse than to look to the loos
the information age turned out to be the age of disinformation and then it became the age of climate disinformation which is a bit more dangerous if you stop and have a look at the water levels in the maldives or the heatwaves in uzbekistan that is not a novelty either propaganda executed for negative clientelistic or self serving purposes has been around forever ever since edward bernays sigmund freud s nephew coined the term in the 1920s and even before it s just that it has gotten a bit out of hand once again bernays the aforementioned nephew is a legendary pioneer in the public relations field who wrote we are governed our minds are molded our tastes formed our ideas suggested largely by men we have never heard of how right he was one hundred years later the problem is that everything is mixed up companies that were historically champions of the fossil fuel industry now present themselves totally green environmentally friendly and very politically correct and while most of us experience cold in summer and heat in winter many mostly don t buy climate change which is simply stupid while we two do not know exactly the intricacies of what causes the ozone layer hole and we believe that governments should listen to scientists we know that investments when made with a sustainability perspective in mind yield better results after years involved in the environmental factors of the economy we have reached the conclusion that it is essential to ensure absolute transparency on the way that companies especially those that have the most effect on the physical appearance of the earth make the problem worse or better in recent years investor relations practitioners and fund managers such as us around the world have started a race to incorporate esg environmental social governance reporting into the communication we make about listed companies in the financial markets fundamental market institutions such as nasdaq or the london stock exchange or platforms such as clarity have been key to explain that sustainable investments that improve the planet are also straightforward ways of profitability sustainable investments are also straightforward ways of profitablity ramón pedrosa and pablo cano since both of us started working in promoting the first esg fund in spain we have been champions of developing new and better ways to convey to the market that sustainable investment strategies matter and work investment funds around the world require companies to respect esg criteria and to tell them about it that in their investor relations they are clear transparent about what they tell the markets because among other things they know that the markets will respond norges bank norway s central bank only invests in those companies that are clear in their esg reporting and follow a rule many of us call sustainable investment and support the recommendations of the task force on climate related financial disclosures set up by the g20 s financial stability board they have a 180 275 641 266 market value give or take and they exclude companies that generate coal based energy or have unacceptable greenhouse gas emissions just imagine their global influence that is why it is surprising that the house oversight committee of the us congress as the new york times puts it has widened its probe into the oil and gas industry s role in spreading disinformation about the role of fossil fuels in causing global warming that this committee at least suspects that large energy companies are investigating internal documents related to the companies and groups efforts to undermine climate policy as quoted in the american newspaper climate change affects us as fathers and mothers as those of us who have to leave a better world to the next generations and considering that in almaty it is 37⁰c when in sicily it may be 12 maybe it is worth starting to realise that we are close to a significant problem this scenario is affecting investors around the world capitalism and capital markets have been a positive force around the world they have driven innovation development efforts to improve technology medicine or transport and when they have done well they have generated returns for their shareholders companies need to incorporate esg information and environmental and social policies as a matter of course that can be communicated in an understandable way to investors to make their decisions to do this investor relations specialists financial communicators media colleagues and company boards of directors themselves need to be serious firm knowledgeable and listen to the scientists and the markets because possibly esg conscious investor relations will become a key ally in the betterment of our world ramón pedrosa is an investor relations consultant working from malta and london pablo cano is a cio specialised in esg investments based in madrid

it has been more than 18 months since the first case of covid 19 was reported in bartholomew county effective vaccines have been widely available for months and public health experts know what measures reduce the chances of spreading the virus yet local health officials are finding themselves once again taking stock of a grim and dispiriting reality 62 people in the columbus area died from the coronavirus in august and september including 19 people in bartholomew county that is roughly one life cut short per day over those two months and twice the number of deaths reported in the area which includes bartholomew brown decatur jackson jennings and shelby counties during the same time period last year when no vaccines were available about half of the people in bartholomew county who died from the virus over the past two months were younger than age 70 some were in the prime of their lives or getting close to it including a bartholomew county resident in their 30s and another age 19 or younger who were recently included among the county s growing virus death toll and the worst part of it all local health officials say is that nearly every single one of those deaths was preventable if people had gotten vaccinated which has been shown to overwhelmingly prevent deaths and serious illness it s very heartbreaking said dr deepankar deep sharma a physician who specializes in critical care medicine and interventional pulmonology at columbus regional health where he has been treating covid 19 patients in the hospital s intensive care unit looking at the data 90 of these deaths are preventable sharma added so if we had 19 people in bartholomew county die the last two months if our vaccine compliance would be higher then approximately 17 of them should still be alive an announced tragedy the tragic scenario unfolding in columbus and the surrounding area has been deeply troubling to doctors and other local health officials who had warned for months that lagging vaccination rates could leave much of the community vulnerable to a resurgence of the virus tens of thousands of people in the six county area have refused to get vaccinated providing fertile grounds for the highly contagious delta variant to take root and tear through the region erasing months of progress about 100 000 people in the united states including around 1 900 people in indiana have died from the virus over roughly the past three and a half months as hospitalizations climbed to levels not seen since this past winter at least 8 500 people in the columbus area including at least 2 550 people in bartholomew county were infected with covid 19 in august and september according to the regenstrief institute and the end result was staggering 2 413 people with covid 19 wound up in hospital emergency room over those two months roughly one emergency room visit every 36 minutes nearly 400 people were hospitalized including 131 bartholomew county residents younger and unvaccinated deaths which generally increase several weeks after cases and hospitalizations spike soon followed but the critically ill patients filling hospital beds this time around were different they tended to be younger and unvaccinated and many didn t have underlying medical conditions that would increase the odds of severe illness some were coming into the crh s icu on life support sharma said they are requiring life support for days if not weeks sharma said the trend that we re seeing is younger patients getting sick and a lot of fatalities also in the younger population who don t even have any kind of severe or serious chronic medical problems to begin with sharma said the vast majority of people who are turning up at crh struggling to ward off a covid 19 infection including those who end up dying from the virus are unvaccinated the hospital said over the past two weeks about 70 people with covid 19 have been admitted to crh sharma said around 50 of them were unvaccinated since july 19 of the 22 patients who have died from covid 19 at crh were unvaccinated the hospital said pleas from the icu nearly all of the patients who wind up in the icu at crh those who are still conscious and can speak have been making a heart wrenching request sharma said they are pleading with doctors for the vaccine they had opted not to get for months sharma said at some point most of them had requested if they can get the vaccination right now sharma said and unfortunately it doesn t work like that they re already infected most of them i would say had realized that their decision about not getting vaccinated was incorrect but it s too late doctors wage an all out battle to save their lives doing everything they can to sustain blood pressure and oxygen levels it s a battle that usually lasts for more than a week as staff give regular updates to family and loved ones sharma said but despite their best efforts the news often isn t good it s really heartbreaking because we see the patient struggle every day to survive sharma said but we also talk to the family we talk to their loved ones and feel and hear the pain in their voice you can tell that they worry about losing their loved one and that fear stays for days until they recover or they die imagine doing that with 10 families every day sharma said covid 19 can severely damage several organs in the body including the lungs heart kidneys and brain according to the mayo clinic some people end up needing dialysis others have strokes or seizures some who do survive end up struggling for months to fully recover others have to go to a long term care facility to live there on a ventilator for the rest of their life sharma said dying from covid 19 is a very painful process sharma said it s very traumatic for the patient and for the family to see their loved ones go through this however experts predict that the preventable deaths will continue particularly as colder weather drives people indoors where the virus can spread more easily currently about 75 000 eligible people in the six county area in and around columbus including about 24 000 people in bartholomew county remain unvaccinated we need to do better sharma said there s no reason for a young healthy 45 year old to just die from a respiratory infection which is 90 preventable he said

vermont s rino governor has been hailed as having saved the state from the scourge of covid by leading the nation in high vaccination rates but now the boondoggle of bunk covid science is home to roost in the green mountains the state has the highest rate of infection nationally the layers of covid fog are starting to clear as reality eclipses the fantastic lies of the government and medical establishment initially americans were told that natural immunity from covid 19 was unlikely for those already infected now it turns out it is the vaccines that wane 76 of vermont covid 19 fatalities from breakthrough infections are among the first vaccinated it appears the shots don t last ntibody levels generated by two shots of the pfizer biontech vaccine can undergo up to a 10 fold decrease seven months following the second vaccination research suggests but meanwhile he immune systems of the vast majority of people who have been infected with the ccp virus will continue to carry antibodies against the virus for at least 12 months according to a peer reviewed study accepted by the european journal of immunology on sept 24 dr joseph mercola and ronnie cummins published a remarkable book warning americans about various covid lies titled the truth about covid 19 many months before the current epidemic of the vaccinated this book explained that the touted effectiveness of these vaccines was a sham vaccine effectiveness vastly overstated in early november 2020 pfizer sent the stock market soaring when it announced that analysis of clinical trial data showed the efficacy of its vaccine was more than 90 percent soon after an efficacy rate of 95 was announced moderna boasted similar success with a 94 5 percent efficacy rating in its clinical trials however the definition of efficacy is not being discussed p 129 the authors then explain that while pfizer claims its vaccine has a 95 percent efficacy rate this is the relative risk reduction the absolute risk reduction is actually less than 1 percent urrent trials are not designed to tell us whether the vaccines will actually save lives and if they don t are they really worth the risks that might be involved nor do the trials tell us anything about the vaccine s ability to prevent asymptomatic infection and transmission pp 130 131 the breakout cases in vermont and around the world appear to prove this book s claims yet americans were told by dr fauci that 99 of those dying from covid 19 and 97 of hospitalizations were of the unvaccinated if that were ever true it is clearly not the case now the unvaccinated are being discriminated against for a disease spread easily by the vaccinated who walk around with less than 1 protection while falsely believing they are 95 protected writes one histrionic bunk science post covid 19 vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe disease hospitalization and death from covid 19 and also reduce the likelihood of mild or asymptomatic infection as a result of lagging vaccinations and the more infectious delta variant covid 19 cases hospitalizations and deaths are on the rise again instead of seeking corrective science those worshipping vaccines seek to silence those sharing the truth elizabeth warren and adam schiff have publicly pressured amazon to reduce sales of the truth about covid 19 in vermont a rabid attack by a supposed media outlet named seven days against the publisher of the book chelsea green publishing has been especially vicious as if discrediting publisher margo baldwin for personality issues alleged by a disgruntled former employee negate this important book s clear warnings seven days seeks to silence scientific discourse and perpetuate the vaccination of vermonters with ineffective vaccines the cdc continues to report to americans that the vaccines are hunky dory based on evidence from clinical trials in people 16 years and older the pfizer biontech comirnaty vaccine was 95 effective at preventing laboratory confirmed infection with the virus that causes covid 19 in people who received two doses and had no evidence of being previously infected all fda approved or authorized covid 19 vaccines provide substantial protection against covid 19 hospitalization vermont s current explosion in covid infections despite being the most vaccinated population in america reveals scientifically that bunk science has been used to lie to citizens the associated press reported nearly all covid deaths in the u s now are in people who weren t vaccinated a staggering demonstration of how effective the shots have been and an indication that deaths per day now down to under 300 could be practically zero if everyone eligible got the vaccine vermont s current experience proves this narrative is grotesquely false scientific truth is prevailing against lies and unscientific chicanery the great threat to america is not the covid 19 virus but those manipulating facts to control others image

the content of this article was relevant at the time of publishing circumstances change continuously and caution should therefore be exercised when relying upon any content contained within this article growth stocks have struggled in recent months mainly due to rising bond yields and inflation i think the dip offers an ideal time for me to buy these two the content of this article is provided for information purposes only and is not intended to be nor does it constitute any form of personal advice investments in a currency other than sterling are exposed to currency exchange risk currency exchange rates are constantly changing which may affect the value of the investment in sterling terms you could lose money in sterling even if the stock price rises in the currency of origin stocks listed on overseas exchanges may be subject to additional dealing and exchange rate charges and may have other tax implications and may not provide the same or any regulatory protection as in the uk when investing your capital is at risk the value of your investments can go down as well as up and you may get back less than you put in you re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from the motley fool s premium investing services become a motley fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations in depth research investing resources and more learn more growth stocks have faced a difficult time in recent months partly due to rising bond yields which may make it more expensive to borrow and rising inflation but many of these companies are still experiencing incredible growth and their recent dips offer an excellent time to buy these are the two that i m particularly interested in latin american e commerce giant mercadolibre nasdaq meli has experienced incredible growth over the past few years with its 2020 revenues reaching us 3 97bn the start to 2021 has been even better in fact in its second quarter trading update it recorded revenues of 1 7bn this is a year on year increase of 102 6 unique active customers also grew nearly 50 year on year to 75 9m this shows that the company is growing and there seems no signs that this growth is slowing down furthermore the company has also reached profitability indeed in the second quarter it reported net income of 68 2m although this puts the stock on a very high price to earnings ratio of around 280 it s also important to mention that the company is currently prioritising growth over high profits this makes me hope profits will be able to increase over the next few years and while still expensive i feel that mercadolibre stock has got room to rise this is especially true so to the rapidly growing e commerce market in latin america the current dip in the mercadolibre share price it has fallen 19 in the last month also makes the e commerce giant a more tempting buy this dip has mainly been due to rising bond yields alongside some shareholders taking profits rising bond yields are a very legitimate concern especially because the company has 2 4bn of debt and larger interest payments may be the final result but the company is still performing excellently and i feel that there is significant upside potential therefore i may add more shares to my portfolio soon an ev growth stock i ve remained wary of ev growth stocks due to their high valuations but after falling 33 year to date i feel that nio nyse nio stock now offers decent value this is after the stock has managed to rise nearly 70 over the past year the reason i like nio over other ev stocks is because of its current growth in fact in its second quarter trading update it reported revenues of 1 3bn an increase of 127 year on year as such it has even higher growth rates than mercadolibre at the moment which is a very good sign in september the company was also able to deliver over 10 000 vehicles an increase of 125 year on year this demonstrates that the semiconductor shortage has not impacted the company too severely and it s still managing to satisfy the high demand my one issue with nio is its current unprofitability and the lack of a clear route to making profits indeed in the second quarter it reported a net loss of around 90m the rising competition in the ev market may also hinder it and be an obstacle to the company reaching profitability even so the potential is very clear and while i prefer mercadolibre as a growth stock i m certainly keeping a keen eye on nio as well if it dips any further this could be a buy for me

treatments for extremely rare medical conditions are few and far between the number of cases of orphan diseases doesn t justify the amount of cash needed to get a pharmaceutical developed tested and approved this is exactly the niche that tel aviv based bioblast pharma was created to fill in 2012 now its three experimental platforms are moving closer to market cabaletta bioblast s lead product for treating two rare and currently untreatable conditions oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy opmd and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 sca3 received fast track approval in june from the us food and drug administration fda to expedite the drug s development review and potential approval specifically for treating opmd cabaletta is a protein stabilizer that binds to proteins to prevent harmful aggregation it is undergoing phase 2 trials in israel and canada for treating opmd and in israel for treating sca3 by year s end phase 3 trials are anticipated to start for opmd in north america and for sca3 in the us and europe we believe that the fast track designation represents an important recognition by the fda of cabaletta s potential to address a significant unmet need says bioblast president and ceo colin foster foster tells israel21c that one of the reasons bioblast s founders focused on opmd is that this inherited progressive disease tends to cluster within certain geographic and ethnic groups including bukharan and ashkenazi jews in israel french canadians in quebec and hispanic americans in the southwest people with opmd have difficulty swallowing and gradually lose muscle strength all over their bodies foster formerly president and ceo of bayer pharmaceuticals corporation usa joined bioblast last february shortly after it went public on nasdaq i thought bioblast had great science behind it and could offer patients who have nowhere else to go a therapy that could change the course of the disease he says if you have good data orphan drugs can punch above their weight hope for spinal muscular atrophy bioblast s second pipeline product is a read through platform for spinal muscular atrophy another debilitating and currently untreatable condition the platform repurposes an existing family of drugs called macrolides and delivers them in a new way that showed good results in mouse models of spinal muscular atrophy read through refers to the platform s use of macrolides to facilitate the production of a fully functioning version of a protein that fails to develop completely due to a genetic mutation ordering a stop code i thought bioblast had great science behind it and could offer patients who have nowhere else to go a therapy that could change the course of the disease in effect the platform allows the gene to bypass the stop code and read through the entire set of instructions for making this protein essential to the central nervous system the stop codon mutation is the cause of about 2 000 different diseases says foster adding that the injectable read through drug candidate is now in preclinical development going to phase 2 trials within about six months he noted that spinal muscular atrophy affects approximately 30 000 children in the united states and an equal number in europe unfortunately many of these kids end up on ventilators he relates bioblast presented proof of concept data on the read through platform at the 19th international sma researcher meeting in missouri this past june two more orphan diseases targeted also in june bioblast presented proof of concept for its third pipeline product at the united mitochondrial disease foundation s annual meeting in virginia the mitochondrial protein replacement platform mprt is something foster calls a novel frontier and is currently in the preclinical phase mitochondria are energy generating organelles present in every cell of the body except red blood cells something like 900 proteins function around the mitochondria and as many as 150 diseases result from mutations in these proteins says foster if we can make the protein outside the body and find a way to inject it into the mitochondria we re attacking the root cause of the diseases for now bioblast is focusing its efforts on treating two rare genetic mitochondrial diseases with mprt friedreich s ataxia which causes progressive nervous system damage and ornithine transcarbamylase otc deficiency which causes harmful ammonia to accumulate in the bloodstream the bioblast platforms are based on deep understanding of the disease causing biological processes and potentially offer solutions for several diseases that share the same biological pathology foster concludes cofounded by dr dalia megiddo and udi gilboa bioblast employs 13 people in tel aviv and is establishing a us headquarters in connecticut for more information click here advertisement
a whistleblower standing before congress a global scandal involving facebook mark zuckerberg missing in action and a series of lesser executives spinning wildly on us television networks so far so 2018 because last week we had 2018 the remake a week that started for facebook with a six hour global outage and ended with one of its most trenchant critics the american filipino journalist maria ressa being awarded a nobel prize and in the middle of it a whistleblower captured the attention of america how is your ptsd i texted chris wylie cambridge analytica s former director of elections because three years ago he was the whistleblower in the spotlight in the observer s investigations into facebook last week it was the turn of frances haugen a calm articulate authoritative voice from inside facebook s civic integrity department whose testimony has proved devastating to the company she not only spoke compellingly about facebook s lies and deceptions its harm to teenagers and devastating impact on democracy she backed up her words with hard evidence in eight complaints to the us securities and exchange commission sec and documents handed to five attorneys general later this month she will testify to the uk parliament if there s one thing last week has proved it s that nothing beats a human face telling a human story there was much of haugen s testimony that was already known or at least glimpsed every day for the last three years has brought a fresh tide of facebook so toxic stories they ve just lost their ability to shock this is a tale of two testimonies two testimonies that bookend the first chapter of the beginning of the end of facebook because that s what we are seeing playing out in slow motion the fall of the house of zuck it won t happen today and it s not going to happen tomorrow but last week the cracks in its foundations became deepening crevasses it is coming wylie s testimony in 2018 set the hares running it precipitated numerous investigations into the company investigations whose failure explains why three years on we are here again haugen testified to problems that are a direct result of a corrupt and corrosive internal corporate culture exposed then facebook s executive suite should have been burned down three years ago it wasn t in 2018 the mask came off but the authorities failed to hold a single person to account and we and our increasingly fragile democracies and fraught teenagers are living with the consequences when the federal trade commission ftc fined facebook a record 5bn 3 6bn for its part in the cambridge analytica scandal the only outcome was to send facebook s stock price even higher after all what s 5bn to a company worth a trillion dollars and although the sec found that facebook had made misleading disclosures including lying to journalists it allowed facebook to settle its suit with a 100m fine no executive was harmed in the making of these penalties zuckerberg was not deposed sheryl sandberg was not forced to account for her actions everyone got away with everything but now facebook is in trouble it is facing many legal and regulatory challenges all the while in a weakened and bloodied state with its workforce shaken and disturbed because its greatest point of failure at the moment is itself one of the most striking differences between 2018 and now was how incredibly organised and supported haugen has been an entire industry now exists to welcome and support tech whistleblowers more will surely come striking too was how expertly briefed and informed were the senators who questioned haugen all this has happened in three years but there s more there are existential threats to facebook s business model not the least of which is the ftc s suit to break the company up state attorney generals many with cases already proceeding are scenting blood a texas lawsuit names sandberg for possible market rigging and perhaps most toxic of all is the radioactive waste left by the cambridge analytica scandal a new shareholder lawsuit filed in delaware based on freshly disclosed internal documents claims it can prove that facebook senior executives and board members lied to investors if it can do that it will set in motion a chain of consequences that will make enron look like a teddy bears picnic in 2018 the mask came off but the authorities failed to hold a single person to account and we and our fragile democracies and fraught teenagers are living with the consequences three years ago sandy parakilas an earlier facebook whistleblower explained to me the power of the sec which regulates the financial markets by telling me that in america money will enable you to get away with most things but the one thing you can t do he said is to fuck with our capitalism the un found facebook helped facilitate a genocide in myanmar we know that it helped foment an insurrection at the us capitol and its own research says it is harming teenagers a 2019 facebook presentation slide just revealed said we make body image issues worse for one in three teenage girls that s all fine it turns out but if this suit can prove it s lied to investors someone is going to jail if i were a facebook employee i d be browsing the whistleblower section of the sec s website which grants immunity from prosecution very very carefully three years ago it was wylie who was caught in the firestorm and as one of the journalists who put him there i ve had my own strange and unsettling flashbacks over the past week but what recent events have reminded me of most forcefully is a judicial report published after the murder of the maltese investigative journalist daphne caruana galizia it described a culture of impunity that had allowed those at the heart of the government to believe they could get away with anything that s what corruption does and a similar culture of impunity exists at facebook but the gig is up no one is immune not even mark zuckerberg carole cadwalladr led the observer s investigations into facebook in 2018 and is a founder of the real facebook oversight board
china us photo vcg following a 9 month long review of donald trump s china policy centering on containing the world s second largest economy by launching a relentless trade war the biden administration plans to ratchet down the fight biden s trade representative katherine tai said last week in washington that the us government s objective is not to inflame trade tensions with china and her office of ustr will start a targeted tariff exclusion process that will benefit the vast majority of manufacturers and consumers in the us chinese vice premier liu he a member of the political bureau of the communist party of china central committee and chief of the chinese side of the china us comprehensive economic dialogue held a video call with tai on saturday during which the two agreed to keep communicating in an attitude of equality and mutual respect trump s tariffs have failed completely for the policy did not stifle china s foreign trade and economic growth but on the contrary backfired on the us as the country s manufacturers faced disrupted global supply chains and acute shortage of materials like semiconductor chips and high tariffs have contributed to elevated consumer prices and inflation levels in the us which are impacting stability of its own domestic financial system as a result the us stock market has seen uncommon levels of volatility lately it s quite strange for the biden administration to take as long as three quarters of a year to appraise trump s legacy and shift back to a pragmatic approach by re engaging with china the reason is not difficult to fathom as biden s top advisors are divided on how to interact with china and trump though tainted by the scandal of january 6 assault on the us capitol orchestrated by the former president still commands a large following among the republican party with trump likely to feature prominently in the 2024 election cycle with himself attempting at another run and biden s 4 5 trillion infrastructure and social security spending agenda being watered down by his fellow democrats in congress biden needs help from china as he cannot afford to continuously fight the trade war with the country s most valuable trading partner biden knows perfectly well that without a strong american economy in 2024 he will lose his bid for reelection trump s trade and technology war with china is a trap prepared for biden to worsen the us economy so that american voters casting no to biden and his fellow democrats in 2022 mid term and 2024 presidential ballots now the us inflation has been hovering at over five percent for four consecutive months drawing disgruntled voices from ordinary americans about higher prices across food clothing fuel and other essentials a majority of american manufacturers have been demanding the white house to scrap trump s high tariffs on chinese products citing a serious semiconductor shortage general motors said last week its auto sales in the us fell a staggering 33 percent in the third quarter the trade war did not crush china s foreign trade nor dent the country s economic momentum major newspapers in the us reported that china has kept on exporting large quantities of goods to americans as if the trade war had never happened the events of the last year have shown how indispensable china is to global manufacturing chain despite trump s tariffs the coronavirus and other disruptions few american companies are re shoring operations with most finding the notion of abandoning china just unrealistic and unthinkable but the us foreign trade has worsened its commerce department reported last week that the us trade deficit widened to a record high in august as american consumers snapped up imported goods such as electronics clothing and pharmaceutical products the deficit expanded to 73 3 billion in august from 70 3 billion in july making the us increasingly a debt ridden country and a superpower living on a credit card the chinese government starting from middle 2018 when trump pre emptively kicked off the tariffs fight has said the trade war was always double edged creating a lose lose for both sides it seems the biden administration has now recognized the great perils behind the tussle tai used the new term durable coexistence when discussing the goals of the biden administration s trade policy toward china when asked about economic decoupling from china tai said it was not realistic for the world s two largest economies to stop trading with each other i think that the issue perhaps is what are the goals we re looking for is a kind of recoupling she said china will be looking closely at how the biden administration attempts to recouple the two giant economies what beijing has proposed to washington is continuing to cooperate and strive for win win effect that helps both sides lately leading chinese officials have kindly suggested the white house throw away defining the relationship between the two heavyweights as rivals or competitors if the biden administration does not like describing the ties as partners maybe stakeholders is an acceptable word as the two nations ought to cooperate on facing a wide range of global challenges like overcoming climate change defeating the coronavirus the emerging variants and fostering a rapid recovery of global economy in addition to economic issues china us ties has more dimensions and it is up to the us government to tone down its geopolitical assault on china and be more cautious not to interfere with china s internal affairs such as refraining from instigating secessionists on taiwan island which would help maintain peace in the taiwan strait in late september the us justice department made a deal with huawei technologies cfo meng wanzhou allowing her to return to china and reunite with her family nearly three years of illegal detention in canada at the behest of us authorities the arrangement has removed one irritant in the estranged relationship between the two countries and to some extent helped the us global reputation the move is a good start for a time the arrival of china as a global economic power has caused heartburn among elites in washington but china has been a major power on this earth for more than 5 000 consecutive years distilling the distinct chinese culture love it or hate it china is not backing down and will

indian banks and financial institutions are lagging behind international financial institutions in helping control the climate crisis research shows indian banks and financial institutions including the state bank of india icici axis bank the trust group and hdfc are among the largest global financial institutions funding fossil fuel projects meanwhile several banks in other countries including the spain based banco santander and the commonwealth bank of australia have promised to phase out financing of coal powered plants and mining by 2030 banks play an important role in financing sustainable sectors such as renewable energy and in stopping the financing of fossil fuels but in india banks have yet to implement policies to reduce their own emissions or ask it of the companies that they finance according to reports and an indiaspend analysis out of the eight indian banks that were assessed only idfc bank now called the idfc first bank demonstrated a policy commitment to mitigating climate change shows a 2019 report by fair finance india a coalition of civil society organisations working towards ensuring a sustainable financial sector in india this is the situation five years after india along with 191 other countries signed the paris agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions and control the rise in world temperatures to 1 5 degrees celsius 2 degrees celsius some countries clearly have not focused on the banking sector as something they need to deal with as they phase out fossil fuels and transition to a renewable energy economy alison kirsch lead researcher at the rainforest action network a us based environmental organisation and co author of the report banking on climate chaos told indiaspend commercial banks are not ready to take action unless central banks do not lead the way in this story we look at why the financial sector needs to help mitigate climate change and what the indian financial sector is doing banks and climate india has no plans to pull out completely from coal the transition to clean energy will take a couple of decades in may 2020 the government pushed for private investment in the costly debt ridden and highly polluting coal sector which would mean financing from banks and financial institutions and delay the finance sector prioritising the transition to renewable energy indiaspend had reported in june 2020 the united nations environment programme issued principles for responsible banking in 2019 to guide banks to consider the environmental and social impacts of the projects they lend to these are also meant to help banks align their visions with the sustainable development goals of 2015 and the paris climate agreement currently 252 banks are signatories to these principles with yes bank being the only one from india so far separately some non banking institutional investors have signed on to a different set of principles the principles for responsible investment to incorporate environment social and corporate governance into investment practices sbi funds management private limited equicap asia management private limited and indus environmental services private limited from india became signatories in 2019 rbi s role the bank of england and the european central bank have already formulated monetary policy addressing climate change and central banks around the world are under pressure from civil society groups to take climate change into account in formulating monetary policy the reserve bank of india supervises all commercial banks financial institutions and non banking financial companies and performs a wide range of functions to support national objectives such as offering priority sector lending to sectors such as renewables agriculture and small and micro enterprises in 2007 it issued a directive encouraging commercial banks to incorporate sustainability and corporate social responsibility into their business strategy rbi has guidelines which includes the amount they can lend for banks to finance infrastructure projects like housing renewable energy projects anirban chatterjee former senior manager of canara bank told indiaspend for instance the rbi included renewable energy in priority sector lending in march 2015 and increased the limits of lending in september 2020 which means that renewable energy developers can avail more loans than developers in other sectors but there are no guidelines limiting funding for fossil fuel projects chatterjee added while issuing credit guidance to support renewable energy projects the rbi has not taken any action such as monetary policy or regulation over tilting financial flows away from fossil fuels as per the report titled how central banks are fueling climate crisis by oil change international a washington dc based research and advocacy organisation working to facilitate the transition to renewable energy we have reached out to the rbi for a response and will update this story when we receive a response in april the rbi also joined the network for greening of the financial systems a group of central banks seeking to mobilise finance to support the transition to renewable energy projects and sustainable businesses the rbi has signalled that it is waking up to the risks that climate disruption poses to the indian economy that should be a precursor to stronger oversight on indian banks ashish fernandes ceo at climate risk horizon a bengaluru based organisation working on the impact of the climate crisis on financial systems told indiaspend banks should assess their vulnerability to climate change risks and to long term disruptions because of the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy fernandes explained but it is important that banks should not wait for the rbi to move given the urgency of controlling the climate crisis photo credit punit paranjpe afp financing fossil fuels globally banks have started taking harsh decisions when the companies they finance do not meet sustainability standards in 2019 citibank cancelled 140 million about rs 998 crore of funds lent to indonesian food giant indofood after the company violated provisions of the roundtable on sustainable palm oil goldman sachs has said it will not fund new arctic drilling for oil and gas yet both these banks were also among the largest investors in fossil fuel projects between 2016 and 2020 according to another august 2021 report banking on climate chaos by oil change international until now over 100 financial institutions have announced their divestment from coal mining and or coal fired power plants according to the institute for energy economics and financial analysis a us based organisation working on energy markets trends and policies none of these are from india financing new fossil fuel infrastructure is going to be extremely risky going forward for indian banks both from a reputational point of view and because of the gathering pace of the transition to renewable energy and electrification of transport fernandes said indian banks rank fourth globally in financing coal plants providing 155 6 billion about rs 11 1 lakh crore per 2019 rates in loans between 2012 and 2019 according to the report how central banks are fueling climate crisis by oil change international the report used data of the 60 largest banks and 12 central banks from the bloomberg terminal that provides real time data on financial markets as of march 2020 outstanding bank credit to the non conventional energy sector was around rs 36 543 crore which is 7 9 of the outstanding bank credit to the power generation sector compared to 5 4 in march 2015 according to the january 2021 rbi bulletin the state bank of india india s largest public sector bank in which the government holds 56 92 of shares is one of the top 12 banks in the world to finance coal plants the report said it has provided 21 5 billion rs 1 57 lakh crore in fossil fuel finance between 2016 and 2020 and has not made any net zero emissions commitment according to the report earlier in 2020 the sbi was in the news for bankrolling the adani group owned carmichael coal mine in australia s galilee basin that threatens to increase carbon emissions harm the fragile ecosystem of the great barrier reef and disrupt the water table while 40 banks had ruled out the possibility of financing the project the sbi had reportedly sanctioned 678 million rs 500 crore it is unclear if the loan has been processed indian banks can finance an offshore fossil or coal project as long as the bank has a positive viability report of the project and the government of the country of origin of the project approves of it according to the rbi rules chatterjee told indiaspend sbi could finance the adani project because the queensland government had approved the carmichael coal project we reached out to the chief general manager credit policy and procedure department at the sbi s corporate centre we will update the story when we receive a response apart from public banks major private banks have also financed coal plants since 2015 for instance in 2019 exim bank financed a rs 150 crore coal project we have also reached out to exim bank hdfc icici and the trust group for their comments on what they are doing to limit fossil fuel financing and push renewable energy financing we will update the story when we receive a response representational image photo credit afp slow change indian banks are changing albeit slowly the indian renewable energy development agency a government backed agency for promoting clean energy investments announced plans to become india s first green bank in may 2016 the rbi said in a bulletin in january in may the state bank of india and the european investment bank together launched a new initiative of 100 million rs 885 crore to finance high impact climate action and sustainable businesses in india banks need to accelerate green financing of sustainable businesses like electric vehicles and sustainable waste management and should undertake structural changes to traditional lending approaches dinesh khara the sbi chairperson said at an event on october 7 sbi aims to become carbon neutral by 2030 and has taken a number of initiatives to reduce its carbon impact by installing solar plants tree plantations and organic farming khara added india s seventh largest commercial bank federal bank limited made a commitment to terminate funding of new coal according to a new report released on october 7 federal bank had earlier provided 14 million rs 104 crores in loans to jsw energy which runs coal plants imports coal from indonesia and south africa and has shares in coal and lignite mines in india and south africa the report said the bank s commitment could be in part because of the international finance corporation which has invested in the federal bank and has said that it would end equity investments in financial institutions that do not have a plan to phase out investments in coal related activities the report said indian banks coal financing decreased in 2019 as compared to earlier years according to a november 2020 report by the centre for financial accountability and climate trends in 2019 banks lent rs 1 100 crore 190 million to two coal fired plants unlike 2018 when they lent rs 6 081 crore 850 million to five coal fired projects the report analysed 43 coal fired and renewable energy projects that had received rs 24 071 crore 3 41 billion in loans 95 to renewable energy projects and 5 to coal power projects yet there are important segments of the renewable market that are starved of finance such as financing for rooftop solar for the small and medium scale enterprises community and agricultural solar said fernandes of climate risk horizon indiaspend had reported from maharashtra in july 2021 on how the high cost of rooftop solar systems and the patchy implementation of its subsidy schemes are holding the sector back it is safe to say the indian banking system is not serving these areas well right now as compared to large scale utility solar said fernandes there is a real need for banks to innovate by financing projects such as roof top solar and de risk or reduce their exposure to fossil fuel projects fernandes added twelve of india s thermal power plants reviewed in december 2019 by the institute of energy economics and financial analysis owe 40 billion to 60 billion in non performing assets or bad loans loans that have not been repaid within the mandated time further a cumulative 3 220 million was loaned to 41 renewable energy projects including solar and wind projects in 2019 according to the centre for financial accountability and climate trends report but the single largest lender was l t finance holdings 21 while state owned banks collectively provided for 24 of renewable financing with little information about indian banks lending practices available in the public domain analysts depend on disclosures such as those made under the basel iii framework a global voluntary regulatory framework that seeks to ensure banks have enough capital and liquidity considering the global climate urgency it is important for banks to make all the information on lending available to all stakeholders said sreedhar ramamurthi managing trustee of environics trust a new delhi based research and community development organisation this is vital to inform the public if banks funds are being channelled into sectors responsible for environmental damage he said this article first appeared on indiaspend a data driven and public interest journalism non profit
a busy week in store another fascinating week in the markets and there s little reason to think there isn t plenty more to come in the final months of the year russian president vladimir putin calmed

controversial nord stream 2 pipeline s approval was accelerated over to you germany the debt ceiling threat has been pushed back to december alleviating mild concerns that lawmakers on both sides may

making any hard decisions over the debt ceiling infrastructure and spending so the focus on wall street will primarily fall on inflation the september inflation report is expected to show pricing pressures remain elevated but any hotter than expected readings could unnerve some investors many traders are closely watching to see what president biden does regarding renominating fed chair powell a decision could happen on or before oct 13 when randal k quarles vice chair for supervision s term expires what has complicated powell s potential renomination has been the fed trading scandal that

julia judy kahrl a lifelong reproductive rights champion and an heir to the procter gamble fortune has made a very public break with pathfinder international the global reproductive health charity founded by her father 64 years ago kahrl who lives in arrowsic and her brother walter gamble resigned from pathfinder s board sept 27 over what they regard as its failure to fully disclose and reckon with the legacy of their father dr clarence gamble who promoted eugenics an early 20th century movement that sought to prevent poor people disabled people racial minorities and others from reproducing as well as concerns about pathfinder s management which has presided over record turnover while paying out six figure severance packages we have lost faith in the organization s current leadership and are gravely concerned about the organization s lack of transparency the two wrote in a letter to senior stakeholders we are withdrawing all financial support of pathfinder and urging all gamble family members to do the same pathfinder has contested their description of events as wholly inaccurate and unfounded and board chair roslyn watson issued a statement sept 28 insinuating that kahrl and gamble had left because they were opposed to exposing their father s eugenicist legacy when pressed in an interview however she conceded that the two had wanted greater exposure than the board believed prudent for the organization whose reproductive rights work faces aggressive opponents at home and in many of the 20 countries it has permanent programs in we do highly controversial work in countries that have strife our abortion work was targeted by the trump administration and this kind of data from our archives could be used against our organization in ways that we cannot even imagine if it were freely available to anybody who would want it watson told the portland press herald maine sunday telegram lifelong commitment advertisement the break is particularly dramatic given the 87 year old kahrl s longstanding commitment to reproductive rights and pathfinder her parents were early activists for legalizing and destigmatizing contraception radical positions in the 1920s and family planning birth control and reproductive health were commonplace dinner table conversations while she was growing up in the 1930s and 40s her father physician clarence gamble and mother sarah were close allies of contraception pioneer margaret sanger founder of planned parenthood and helped her overturn federal laws preventing the mailing of birth control materials and literature when they founded pathfinder in 1957 judy joined the board and her eldest brother richard ran the organization until stepping down in 1985 the organization promotes access to reproductive health services for women across the developing world and today receives the majority of its funding from the u s agency for international development in its public tax returns for 2019 it reported 177 employees a budget of 121 million and a 2 4 million operating deficit for the year primarily due to reduced grant revenues compared with 2018 while traveling to see pathfinder s work in low income parts of asia africa and the middle east she has said she saw how women were empowered to improve their lives and their families prospects by having access to comprehensive reproductive health services she later brought her own children and then grandchildren on these trips her son ben kahrl joined the pathfinder board in 1988 they have close ties to maine kahrl has been summering in arrowsic since 1952 the broader gamble family has spent summers at a cottage in georgetown since 1960 and in his final days in 1966 clarence gamble was transported by ambulance from his home in milton massachusetts so he could die there judy kahrl a counselor moved to neighboring arrowsic full time in 1996 and alarmed over the growing challenge to roe v wade founded the maine based national advocacy group grandmothers for reproductive rights or grr in 2013 but in recent years kahrl said she had grown increasingly concerned about the leadership at pathfinder the organization has experienced a 100 percent turnover in u s personnel in the five years it has been led by ceo lois quam several senior staff members had departed with six figure severance packages in exchange for signing nondisclosure agreements disallowing them from speaking to board members about the circumstances of their departure including the chief human resources officer who kahrl says received 216 000 after just four years on the job advertisement when kahrl and her son tried to access a comprehensive outside review of quam s job performance they were blocked by the board s executive committee which also declined to share the reasoning or wording of the ndas departing staff members had signed all of these things raised red flags for us and yet getting more information was a nonstarter ben kahrl said in an interview with the press herald so people say do you have any evidence of malfeasance and the answer is that we re not sure because we can t get the information to do proper board oversight cate lane a former pathfinder employee who left without signing an nda and who served under quam as a technical adviser for youth and adolescents from 2017 to 2019 told the press herald she left because of quam s toxic leadership style she said experienced people had been systematically driven out of the organization in favor of cheaper less capable replacements undermining capacity and morale unless somebody takes lois out i think pathfinder is on a slide to irrelevance lane said then there was the issue of judy s father an ugly past like margaret sanger clarence gamble had been a devotee of the eugenics movement of the early 20th century which sought to improve humanity s genetic stock by preventing people with allegedly undesirable qualities from reproducing sometimes via forced sterilization undesirables typically included poor people disabled people those alleged to have low intelligence and people of color adolf hitler would become the most infamous of eugenicists but prior to the holocaust such views were broadly held among the white anglo saxon protestant elite of the u s and u k championed by woodrow wilson and winston churchill and funded by the carnegie institution and the rockefeller foundation advertisement gamble co founded the human betterment league of north carolina in 1947 to promote eugenic sterilization under a now notorious state law that allowed social workers to designate people as defective and encourage their sterilization at state expense of the 7 600 people sterilized under the state s program 85 percent were female and 40 percent were minorities the state later negotiated reparations for survivors for a million years dame nature found she could develop her people only by selecting for survival the most prolific the toughest and smartest gamble and a co author wrote in a 1950 pamphlet in our time notwithstanding the rapidly mounting world wide burdens of overpopulation which are increased by limiting epidemics and salvaging weaklings our organized efforts toward fostering breeding for quality rather than quantity can show only three decades of active development judy and ben kahrl told the press herald they were highly supportive of the pathfinder board s decision after the police killing of george floyd last year to hire independent researchers to exhume clarence s legacy from the organization s archives including any lasting imprint his eugenicist views may have left but they became concerned when one year later the archives remained sealed from view by either the board or the public the outside consultant s reports which the kahrls shared with the press herald provided surprisingly little new information on gamble at one point instead of relying on the archives it cites a report by an anti abortion activist group the population research institute at another point they attribute to clarence gamble a note on an office memo from 1972 six years after he d died it was embarrassing a pretty bad report kahrl said i don t know a better word than junk the reports were never discussed by the board she said and even after they were submitted they were told they could not see the company archives judy s nephew jim epstein a grandchild of clarence gamble who served on the pathfinder board through the 1980s said he shared her disappointment there needs to be a full reckoning he said that s an essential part of the process our sense is that the organization has been slow walking it advertisement ben kahrl said he was voted off the board last month after he pushed for fuller disclosure of both the documents related to his grandfather and the internal review of ceo quam s tenure his removal was the final straw prompting his mother and uncle walter the only other gamble family members on the 19 person board to resign i pray that there will be healing but i feel i had done all i could do from the inside judy kahrl said disclosure and transparency board chair roslyn watson one of boston s leading african american businesswomen initially responded to the resignations with a statement suggesting the gambles had left because they were uncomfortable with wider disclosure of their ancestor s legacy it noted their pride in their efforts to recruit a more diverse board and address clarence s racially biased and unscientific personal beliefs through an independent review free from family influence she noted they had resigned in the wake of such efforts and said they sought to distract us from fulfilling our mission including commitments to racial and gender equality when questioned by the press herald watson conceded that the gambles had been pushing for greater disclosure than the board wanted including the public release of 30 boxes of documents from the 1950s and 1960s locked in the company archives we re not a research organization we have an operating responsibility for over 100 million in programs each year and we need to safeguard that and make sure that nothing gets in the way of providing those services said watson a prominent investor in boston and paris real estate and past general manager of the powerful massachusetts port authority which runs logan airport spending the majority of our time trying to protect ourselves from the raw materials out in the international sphere wouldn t serve the organization and its mission she said pathfinder had to have a forward looking lens and not get stuck in a kind of rabbit warren hole of debating past behavior and what it means she also expressed full confidence in quam the consultant s reports on the gamble legacy and the state of the organization annual turnover is not unusually high for the international development nonprofit sector employee satisfaction is good and fundraising is healthy she said advertisement she also said the nonprofit s use of nondisclosures and severance packages is appropriate and that the kahrls had been denied access to the independent review of quam in accordance with board policies restricting access to the executive committee ben kahrl she said had been voted off the board because for two years he consistently behaved in a way that was inappropriate and undermined the board and ceo and organization examples she said included contacting country officers directly to push a personal agenda and implying to staff members that he disagreed with policy decisions made by the board and ceo she noted the organization is amid a strategic pivot to give more power and autonomy to individual country offices which are staffed by people from those countries and reduce the influence of pathfinder s headquarters staff in watertown massachusetts she said quam a former official at the nature conservancy who headed the obama administration s global health initiative had been an exemplary leader quam whose 2018 compensation was 438 066 did not respond to an interview request made via pathfinder s spokesperson pathfinder has a solid 86 7 out of 100 rating from the independent nonprofit rating service charity navigator which reported 89 6 percent of pathfinder s total expenses in 2019 went to programs judy kahrl said she s diverting her attention to other initiatives such as grandmothers for reproductive rights and that pathfinder is now in her past after more than six decades of board service i resigned because i wanted more transparency she said and i wanted to make a strong statement that we are absolutely opposed to eugenics and that board members need to be given the information they need to make responsible accountable decisions send

the pandora papers an expo of the financial secrets and offshore dealings of dozens of heads of state public officials and politicians writes cnn could not have come at a better time for congressional progressives who are seeking to win over enough democrats to pass the massive biden pelosi 3 5 trillion infrastructure bill which is loaded with enough pork to infect the nation with financial trichinosis the pandora papers released by the international consortium of investigative journalists on sunday is not equivalent to the pentagon papers which revealed how the u s government lied to the public about the vietnam war but it might serve the political ends of the left the papers reveal wait for it that rich people have managed to avoid paying taxes by hiding their wealth in foreign countries such as the cayman islands who knew what i like best about this revelation is the double standard it again reveals about wealthy politicians who have been critics of tax avoiders while avoiding taxes themselves one of many examples is former british prime minister tony blair a critic of tax avoiders the pandora papers journalists found that blair and his wife cherie who is a lawyer avoided paying tax on a high priced london office they purchased cherie blair was quoted in the uk daily mail as saying the transaction and avoidance of tax was perfectly legal to paraphrase the writer michael kinsley the real scandal is not what s illegal but what s legal politicians have a vested interest in demonizing the rich because envy of the successful helps solidify their careers in washington where they also can become rich ask yourself how many members of congress arrive as thousand aires with annual salaries of 174 000 leadership gets slightly more and leave as millionaires it isn t because they know how to play the stock market by focusing on fairness and other buzzwords like equity and equality these same politicians manage to distract the public from the real problem to put it succinctly as ronald reagan often did we have a debt not because the american people are taxed too little but because their government spends too much how does what others make and how they choose to live affect your life if you favor punishing the wealthy with higher taxes how does that improve your financial situation it might make you feel better but envy produces no positive outcome the best way to retrieve offshore money from tax avoiders would be for the u s and britain to lower taxes that s what donald trump did for american companies that had moved overseas to escape a higher tax burden a few companies returned and began paying taxes at a lower rate to the u s treasury most did not there remains the issue of revenue verses spending the u s government receives plenty of money the problem is it refuses to live within the means taxpayers provide it as for the rich there are several ways to define the word for some true wealth comes in the form of a loving spouse successful children good health and a feeling that one s life has purpose
we are told that there are always two sides to every story but most of us know that two is really just the minimum a story can have three sides or four or five but if the story s ending is a referendum question there are only two choices yes or no the truth about question 1 according to the ads question 1 is about many things the future of a 1 billion powerline project through western maine public sentiment about central maine power whether the legislature should vote on major projects running through public lands and whether that power should be retroactive at 6 30 p m on monday oct 18 we ll host a virtual journalists roundtable discussion about the referendum that cuts through the myths answers your questions and gets to the truth our panelists are press herald business editor craig anderson press herald energy reporter tux turkel and sun journal reporter andrew rice judy meyer executive editor of the sun journal kennebec journal and morning sentinel will moderate register at pressherald com question1 and that s going to be a problem for some maine voters this year when they are asked to decide question 1 a referendum aimed to kill a 1 billion project that would bring hydroelectric power from canada to the new england power grid via a 145 mile transmission line built by the corporate parent of central maine power for anyone who hasn t made up their mind yet deciding this one is like flipping an eight sided coin it s a multifactorial equation filled with unknowns and we have to find our way through it without the usual guideposts and shortcuts we are used to this is not just a matter of balancing competing interests like the environment vs the economy in this one there are competing interests within the interests debates between environmentalists debates between sportsmen and debates between business groups there are democrats republicans and independents on both sides meanwhile millions of dollars are being pumped into the state to push half truths and misinformation through advertising in the hope of winning a big victory at the polls advertisement what do people do when a problem is too complicated we break it into manageable chunks i expect that s why so many people i talk to about question 1 seem to have settled on one factor that decides it for them and lets them tune out the complexity the one i hear most often is i don t trust cmp and it s hard to say why they should cmp is the name you curse when your lights go out the corporate owned transmission and delivery utility serves 2 2 million maine homes and businesses and sends each of them a bill each month sometimes for the wrong amount cmp is owned by the spanish energy giant iberdrola which pays dividends to stock holders while customers in maine rate the utility s service as some of the worst in the country but look who s on the other side the money behind the yes campaign comes from the owners of fossil fuel burning energy generation plants these out of state polluters want us to kill the project and not because they are concerned about brook trout habitat these companies don t want cheap canadian hydropower to come over the border because it will compete with them in maine s deregulated energy market that s why you see nextera the owner of wyman station in yarmouth the state s only oil burning power plant lined up with the natural resources council of maine which can t make either one feel good about themselves advertisement these alliances are complicated because energy policy is complicated and we get to question 1 by a complicated road related read more from greg kesich everybody knows that the referendum is aimed at killing the cmp corridor project but you won t find any of those words in the law that would be passed if the referendum succeeds that s because a more straightforward referendum was found to be unconstitutional by the state supreme court last year forcing the corridor s opponents to look for a work around question 1 would do three things require the legislature s approval for all high impact electrical transmission lines in the state ban such projects in the upper kennebec region retroactive to sept 16 2020 and require two thirds support in the legislature for all transmission lines that cross public lands retroactive to sept 16 2014 it s easy to see that passing question 1 would be fatal for this project even if it s not specifically mentioned but there is a live debate over what other projects could be affected by this broad language if it were to become law that is if the language survives a threatened lawsuit by the corridor developers assuming they win their appeal of a state superior court ruling that invalidates their lease to a piece of public land our editorial board has discussed this issue extensively and we plan to publish an endorsement later this month in the meantime i plan to tune in to a virtual roundtable with the reporters who have covered this issue closely over the last three years which will be moderated by lewiston sun journal editor judy meyer 6 30 p m monday oct 18 register at pressherald com question1 i m not a lawyer or an engineer or an economist or a

julia judy kahrl a lifelong reproductive rights champion and an heir to the procter gamble fortune has made a very public break with pathfinder international the global reproductive health charity founded by her father 64 years ago kahrl who lives in arrowsic and her brother walter gamble resigned from pathfinder s board sept 27 over what they regard as its failure to fully disclose and reckon with the legacy of their father dr clarence gamble who promoted eugenics an early 20th century movement that sought to prevent poor people disabled people racial minorities and others from reproducing as well as concerns about pathfinder s management which has presided over record turnover while paying out six figure severance packages we have lost faith in the organization s current leadership and are gravely concerned about the organization s lack of transparency the two wrote in a letter to senior stakeholders we are withdrawing all financial support of pathfinder and urging all gamble family members to do the same pathfinder has contested their description of events as wholly inaccurate and unfounded and board chair roslyn watson issued a statement sept 28 insinuating that kahrl and gamble had left because they were opposed to exposing their father s eugenicist legacy when pressed in an interview however she conceded that the two had wanted greater exposure than the board believed prudent for the organization whose reproductive rights work faces aggressive opponents at home and in many of the 20 countries it has permanent programs in we do highly controversial work in countries that have strife our abortion work was targeted by the trump administration and this kind of data from our archives could be used against our organization in ways that we cannot even imagine if it were freely available to anybody who would want it watson told the portland press herald maine sunday telegram lifelong commitment advertisement the break is particularly dramatic given the 87 year old kahrl s longstanding commitment to reproductive rights and pathfinder her parents were early activists for legalizing and destigmatizing contraception radical positions in the 1920s and family planning birth control and reproductive health were commonplace dinner table conversations while she was growing up in the 1930s and 40s her father physician clarence gamble and mother sarah were close allies of contraception pioneer margaret sanger founder of planned parenthood and helped her overturn federal laws preventing the mailing of birth control materials and literature when they founded pathfinder in 1957 judy joined the board and her eldest brother richard ran the organization until stepping down in 1985 the organization promotes access to reproductive health services for women across the developing world and today receives the majority of its funding from the u s agency for international development in its public tax returns for 2019 it reported 177 employees a budget of 121 million and a 2 4 million operating deficit for the year primarily due to reduced grant revenues compared with 2018 while traveling to see pathfinder s work in low income parts of asia africa and the middle east she has said she saw how women were empowered to improve their lives and their families prospects by having access to comprehensive reproductive health services she later brought her own children and then grandchildren on these trips her son ben kahrl joined the pathfinder board in 1988 they have close ties to maine kahrl has been summering in arrowsic since 1952 the broader gamble family has spent summers at a cottage in georgetown since 1960 and in his final days in 1966 clarence gamble was transported by ambulance from his home in milton massachusetts so he could die there judy kahrl a counselor moved to neighboring arrowsic full time in 1996 and alarmed over the growing challenge to roe v wade founded the maine based national advocacy group grandmothers for reproductive rights or grr in 2013 but in recent years kahrl said she had grown increasingly concerned about the leadership at pathfinder the organization has experienced a 100 percent turnover in u s personnel in the five years it has been led by ceo lois quam several senior staff members had departed with six figure severance packages in exchange for signing nondisclosure agreements disallowing them from speaking to board members about the circumstances of their departure including the chief human resources officer who kahrl says received 216 000 after just four years on the job advertisement when kahrl and her son tried to access a comprehensive outside review of quam s job performance they were blocked by the board s executive committee which also declined to share the reasoning or wording of the ndas departing staff members had signed all of these things raised red flags for us and yet getting more information was a nonstarter ben kahrl said in an interview with the press herald so people say do you have any evidence of malfeasance and the answer is that we re not sure because we can t get the information to do proper board oversight cate lane a former pathfinder employee who left without signing an nda and who served under quam as a technical adviser for youth and adolescents from 2017 to 2019 told the press herald she left because of quam s toxic leadership style she said experienced people had been systematically driven out of the organization in favor of cheaper less capable replacements undermining capacity and morale unless somebody takes lois out i think pathfinder is on a slide to irrelevance lane said then there was the issue of judy s father an ugly past like margaret sanger clarence gamble had been a devotee of the eugenics movement of the early 20th century which sought to improve humanity s genetic stock by preventing people with allegedly undesirable qualities from reproducing sometimes via forced sterilization undesirables typically included poor people disabled people those alleged to have low intelligence and people of color adolf hitler would become the most infamous of eugenicists but prior to the holocaust such views were broadly held among the white anglo saxon protestant elite of the u s and u k championed by woodrow wilson and winston churchill and funded by the carnegie institution and the rockefeller foundation advertisement gamble co founded the human betterment league of north carolina in 1947 to promote eugenic sterilization under a now notorious state law that allowed social workers to designate people as defective and encourage their sterilization at state expense of the 7 600 people sterilized under the state s program 85 percent were female and 40 percent were minorities the state later negotiated reparations for survivors for a million years dame nature found she could develop her people only by selecting for survival the most prolific the toughest and smartest gamble and a co author wrote in a 1950 pamphlet in our time notwithstanding the rapidly mounting world wide burdens of overpopulation which are increased by limiting epidemics and salvaging weaklings our organized efforts toward fostering breeding for quality rather than quantity can show only three decades of active development judy and ben kahrl told the press herald they were highly supportive of the pathfinder board s decision after the police killing of george floyd last year to hire independent researchers to exhume clarence s legacy from the organization s archives including any lasting imprint his eugenicist views may have left but they became concerned when one year later the archives remained sealed from view by either the board or the public the outside consultant s reports which the kahrls shared with the press herald provided surprisingly little new information on gamble at one point instead of relying on the archives it cites a report by an anti abortion

a funny thing happened on the way to netflix for the musical diana the company of the show which had a rackety premiere at la jolla playhouse in 2019 appears to have boned up on the crown the musical which is streaming ahead of its broadway premiere in november is still a crassly commercial noise machine but the ensemble has grown a touch more dignified the characters have been flecked with a few human lineaments jeanna de waal who stars as a gullible but quick learning diana and roe hartrampf who plays a bratty playboy prince charles are more plausible as the mismatched royal couple in la jolla they seemed to be impersonating cartoons now they re cartoons with ambiguous smiles and furrowed brows for those encountering this theme park musical for the first time it might strain credulity to hear that the show has actually improved but the fundamental flaw of diana the glaring disconnect between story and score remains unchanged by these cosmetic refinements the book by joe dipietro and the music by david bryan the team behind the tony winning musical memphis still have their insoluble problems together they compound each other s faults nowhere more so than in the co written lyrics which may be the worst i ve heard in a theatre a still from diana the musical the plot is a string of wikipedia moments in the princess diana saga from her courtship with charles and their fairy tale wedding to the collapse of the marriage her escape from her royal prison and eventual tragic death the tale is repackaged as it might be for a pop up book on the royal family everything writ so large that even ryan murphy might be moved to decry the lack of subtlety the songs composed in the cheesiest broadway rock recycle tropes of diana s story with little fresh perspective bryan bon jovi s keyboardist jeopardises his rock roll hall of fame standing with a score that even on second encounter i had to repeatedly ask myself is this really happening diana humble brags that she s underestimated in the opening number and indeed the naive kindergarten teacher s assistant from aristocratic british stock will prove a surprisingly formidable opponent in the machiavellian court but the musical performed on a darkened stage with flashy las vegas lighting effects under the direction of christopher ashley exploits diana s story with the same mercenary glee as the tabloid vultures who tracked her every move when she was alive the paparazzi are portrayed as a lascivious swarm of trench coat wearing men one of them sings snap click snap click give a smile the prince will enjoy you at least for a while in this dental drill of a tune the snap click is inanely repeated with fresh insults added that point out not so much the nightmarish side of fame as the sorry state of broadway songwriting erin davie cuts a diabolically haughty figure as the ubiquitous camilla parker bowles the love of charles life she is a wily manipulator styled like a 1980s evening soap opera villain but cannily underplayed by davie diana confesses that she d like to sock camilla and who could blame her but the number that contains this aside otherwise revolves around her cluelessness bored to death on a classical music date with the prince she wonders if she will be able to turn her future husband into a rocker certainly not with the ersatz tune she s growling out as queen elizabeth judy kaye a treasure of american musical theatre is more direct in her realpolitik than olivia colman s more discreet version of the character on the crown in conference with charles and diana about their careening marriage the queen expresses a twinge of nostalgia for the old days when a defiant princess would simply have had her head chopped off kaye also plays prolific romance novelist barbara cartland who in addition to dispensing earthy wisdom to diana provides an outlet for unmitigated camp she encourages the dissatisfied princess to enjoy a little military beefcake on the side a piece of advice that gives way to the chippendales worthy entrance of james hewitt gareth keegan the musical by this point has no shame left to lose diana as her would be puppet masters come to learn has tricks not only in her bed but also up her sleeve the media initially her enemy are deployed as a weapon of self defense she takes ownership of her image dazzling the public in flamboyant couture and bravely becoming a pioneer in the aids cause in those early days when gay men with the disease were shunned and stigmatised there s a reason diana s story has for so long captured the world s fancy but the musical theater imagination at work is not up to the challenge of retelling the tale there were lyrics so deranged i felt compelled to jot them down almost like a psychiatrist keeping a log of a patient s more unhinged utterances diana princess of wales did dipietro and bryan really rhyme diana and camilla with thrilla in manila does diana actually sing the words serves me right for marrying a scorpio yes and yes and please don t ask about the expletives in the the song the dress diana clarified for me why some people not only hate musicals but also loathe those who unabashedly do the show which was supposed to have opened last year but was forced to close in previews because of the covid 19 pandemic has been generically devised to draw in the tourist hordes ashley who seems never to have met a broadway bound musical he didn t want to shepherd had better luck with his recent live capture of come from away a show with infinitely more heart artistically diana is soulless the raison d etre seems to be to make money the streaming of a filmed performance before the production even opens on broadway is an unusual marketing strategy that perhaps intends to get ahead of what will likely be punishing reviews let s hope the tactic fails not out of any malice but out of the hope that producers won t be rewarded for shamelessly sticking with schlock during the long pandemic pause broadway has been forced to confront not only its dismal record on race but also its checkered history on the rights and dignity of its workers cluttering the space with commercial mediocrity sadly suggests a return to business as usual for this reason diana isn t just bad but dangerous the musical deserves to disappear in the detritus of netflix don t miss it

return to the fusion fuel main page by steven b krivit oct 10 2021 the first of a three part new energy times investigative science report part 2 the tritium fusion fuel discrepancy the misleading claims part 3 serious discrepancies with iter and nuclear fusion abstract significant discrepancies exist about the forthcoming iter fusion reactor these discrepancies could spell disaster for the iter project as well as for future fusion reactors fusion promoters sold the idea of iter to the public news media and elected officials primarily based on these two false claims fuel source they said the fuel for fusion was abundant inexpensive and universally available actually one of the two required fuel components is the other does not exist as a natural resource on earth power gain they said the iter reactor not just the physics reaction was designed to produce 10 times the power it would consume they said iter would be the first fusion reactor not just the physics reaction to demonstrate net power production actually if iter works correctly there will be no reactor power gain the reactor will lose power fusion investigation new energy times uncovered the input power requirement for the jet reactor and thus the discrepancies with the jet and iter reactors on dec 1 2014 we began reporting on the iter power discrepancy on dec 14 2016 we uncovered and published the input power value for iter on oct 6 2017 we began reporting on the fuel discrepancy on july 1 2017 and published extensive reporting on the fuel discrepancy on oct 10 2021 scientists who promoted nuclear fusion research to the public news media and elected officials have long claimed that the fuel needed for nuclear fusion reactors will be abundant inexpensive and virtually unlimited those claims are only half true the main approaches to nuclear fusion require a mixture of two forms or isotopes of hydrogen deuterium and tritium the consensus among fusion scientists is that a 50 50 fuel mixture of the two isotopes will be required for commercial fusion reactors one of these isotopes deuterium can be separated from water in the ocean and can thus legitimately be described as abundant inexpensive and virtually unlimited the other hydrogen isotope tritium does not exist on earth as a natural resource here are some examples of the claims made by fusion scientists if the whole planet was run on fusion there would be enough fuel in the ocean for two billion years michel laberge nobody owns the fusion fuel the machines are expensive but the fuel cost is essentially zero thomas klinger nobody owns the fusion fuel the machines are expensive but the fuel cost is essentially zero thomas klinger fuels are plentiful and available all over the world johannes p schwemmer the energy content stored in the ocean would last humanity for 100 million years mark henderson it s an inexhaustible carbon free source of energy that you can deploy anywhere and at any time dennis whyte lots of deuterium a normal hydrogen isotope contains only a positively charged proton in its nucleus but the deuterium isotope adds a neutral particle a neutron the hydrogen isotope known as tritium has one proton and two neutrons in its nucleus both deuterium and tritium are required for the fuel mixture in fusion reactors when deuterium and tritium react and undergo nuclear fusion a lot of energy is released in the process the tritium and deuterium are transmuted into a single larger atom helium along with a leftover neutron the deuterium tritium fuel mix is necessary to produce energy levels and reaction rates that have any hope of producing practical levels of energy is fusion possible with deuterium but not tritium yes but achieving useful power levels from fusing pairs of deuterium under conditions available on earth is considered impossible can a smaller fraction of tritium permit fusion reactors to produce useful levels of energy no well known scientific data show that a 50 50 mixture of tritium and deuterium is required to provide the necessary output level for useful power would a tritium tritium reaction perform better actually no the deuterium tritium fuel mix gives the highest energy yield among the seven known isotopes of hydrogen normal hydrogen designated with a superscript 1 followed by the letter h comprises 99 985 percent of all forms of hydrogen on earth deuterium designated with a superscript 2 followed by the letter h comprises the remaining 0 015 percent of hydrogen isotopes on earth even at an abundance of only 0 015 percent ocean water has enough deuterium to qualify as a nearly unlimited resource but tritium is another story tritium issue 1 it doesn t exist as a natural resource tiny amounts of tritium are produced by nature in the upper atmosphere when cosmic rays strike nitrogen molecules this tritium is incorporated into water and falls to earth as rain of the three hydrogen isotopes tritium comprises about a billionth of a billionth percent earth has so little tritium that its natural abundance is listed as none therefore we can accurately say that tritium does not exist as a natural resource on earth the situation is not completely hopeless however there are ways to make tritium the u s military had operated complex and costly reactors that could make tritium but they have since been decommissioned according to daniel jassby a retired plasma physicist from the princeton plasma physics laboratory who is the author of two articles in the bulletin of the atomic scientists that s because tritium doesn t last it s radioactive and the moment fresh tritium is produced it starts undergoing radioactive decay and begins changing into non radioactive helium after 12 3 years half of the initial amount of tritium is gone for this reason significant amounts of tritium cannot be produced in advance and stockpiled the military always needs fresh tritium tritium is used as a component of nuclear weapons and the helium 3 decay product must be periodically extracted and replaced with fresh tritium at great expense the military is now forced to generate tritium by implanting lithium control rods in two tennessee valley administration fission power reactors jassby wrote the u s military has no tritium to sell to anybody tritium is also made in nuclear fission reactors it s an unintended radioactive byproduct of fission reactions mohamed abdou a fusion and tritium expert at the university of california los angeles explained this in a 2020 meeting fission reactor operators do not really want to make tritium because of permeation and safety concerns they want to minimize tritium production if possible abdou said abdou is the lead author of a key technical paper on tritium shortfalls for nuclear fusion tritium issue 2 production is scarce but not all nuclear fission reactors produce tritium at useful rates most of the world s fission reactors are light water pressurized water reactor designs they don t produce enough tritium to be recoverable unless special lithium containing control rods are inserted as in the tennessee valley administration reactors only a few fission reactors known as heavy water reactors produce substantial and recoverable amounts of tritium but among those heavy water reactors not all have the special equipment to extract the tritium from the wastewater professor richard pearson open university united kingdom said that tritium must be extracted from the heavy water moderator by means of a tritium removal facility trf of which only two are currently in operation one in canada and one in south korea although there are plans for a third in romania tritium issue 3 end of life for heavy water reactors only a handful of countries in the world have heavy water reactors canada has by far the most and is the biggest tritium producer but its heavy water reactors and the others in the world are approaching or have approached the end of their lifespan with the possible exception of india no countries are planning to build new heavy water reactors the graph below by kovari et al displays the past and projected worldwide tritium production rates from heavy water reactors by 2060 according to the scientists the global production rate of tritium will reach zero kovari et al explained it is worth noting that if scheduled heavy water reactor refurbishments do not go ahead or for some reason heavy water reactors begin to be phased out earlier than expected across the globe this would result in almost no tritium being available for fusion experiments but even after 2060 some tritium will remain in the worldwide inventory the remaining tritium inventory should be just enough to start but not to continuously supply one or maybe two more fusion reactors after iter by 2080 as the authors show in the graph below only 10 kilograms of tritium will remain in the global inventory assuming it has not been used already for fusion reactors however the authors believe that canada is the only country that sells tritium so in effect only the canadian tritium inventory would theoretically be available to the worldwide scientific community tritium issue 4 iter will use almost the entire inventory so how much of the global inventory of tritium will iter consume at a presentation abdou gave 14 years ago at the fusion energy sciences advisory committee meeting he said that a successful iter will exhaust most of the world supply of tritium so the 2080 date is actually irrelevant what will the effect of iter s tritium consumption on the worldwide tritium inventory look like abdou shows us in the graph below the expected scenario shown in the red line from 2035 to 2055 is the global tritium inventory level if iter does use the expected amount of tritium in the year 2055 this will bring the remaining global tritium inventory to about three kilograms if for some reason iter does not get to its final high power stage abdou calculates the worldwide tritium inventory with the blue line terminating in the year 2055 at around 14 kilograms according to kovari et al the amount of tritium required for iter during its total operating period will be 12 3 kg which concurs with abdou s graph kovari et al wrote as other fusion tritium experts have done that the post iter tritium scarcity is going to be a serious problem the iter organization and its closely associated eurofusion organization in their public relations programs imply that a single international demo class reactor will follow iter this helps to maintain the expectation that the costs of the presumed reactor will be shared among the 33 nations that are now partners in the iter project but the iter partners have no plan for a joint international demo reactor and never have had one if the eu is to build its own demo fusion reactor european taxpayers will have to foot the entire bill european taxpayers whether they know it or not are already paying fusion scientists to design the eu demo reactor in the 2019 version of a strategic plan for u s burning plasma research u s fusion expert laila el guebaly showed that demo class reactors are in the planning stages from five of the seven iter partners kovari et al provided additional insight into the impending global competition for the last few kilos of tritium on earth there are likely to be serious problems with supplying tritium for future fusion reactors if iter and fusion development are successful then two or three countries may build their own reactors giving another major source of uncertainty in tritium requirements if canada the republic of korea and romania make their tritium inventories available to the fusion community there is a reasonable chance that 10 kg of tritium would be available for fusion research in 2055 stocks would likely have to be shared if more than one fusion reactor is built tritium issue 5 fusion reactors must make their own fuel the solution fusion scientists propose is that fusion reactors will make their own fuel if this sounds too good to be true skepticism is warranted when neutrons react with the element lithium they produce tritium lithium is relatively abundant on earth as long as there s no competition from the lithium ion battery industry fusion scientists have always known that tritium did not exist naturally as a fuel source they ve also known for decades that tritium was essential as a fuel component for fusion reactors a 1984 conference paper by g w hollenberg explains that fusion reactors will have to make their own tritium the on site production of tritium at a fusion power plant is an established design practice for d t fusion reactors no other alternative is envisioned the hollenberg document refers to a demo class reactor that u s fusion scientists envisioned 40 years ago called starfire the bar on the left shows how much tritium they expected the reactor to consume every day the bars on the right show how much tritium they expected worldwide fission reactors could provide one of the authors was abdou he s been at this a long time tritium issue 6 tritium self sufficiency because virtually no commercially available tritium will be available in the world after iter all fusion reactors planned for operation after iter will need to be tritium self sufficient this means that fusion reactors not only will have to make their own tritium fuel but also won t be able to get tritium from any outside sources this is what it means for fusion reactors to be tritium self sufficient people like abdou have been trying for decades to resolve by calculations and computer modeling whether the achievable rate of tritium that can be produced in a fusion reactor will be sufficient for the continued operation of a fusion reactor according to jassby only one physical experiment in fusion research history has attempted to breed tritium in a fusion reactor it was jassby s experiment performed in 1995 1996 in the princeton tokamak fusion test reactor his experiment showed that the total amount of tritium produced in a breeding medium just outside the tftr vacuum vessel was only 32 percent of the total number of fusion neutrons intersected by that medium but even if a fusion reactor produces tritium at a rate of 100 percent of the tritium it requires to operate fusion is a dead end a reactor has to produce tritium at a higher rate than it consumes tritium in order to compensate for inefficiencies and downtime according to a jan 27 2020 presentation from abdou a fusion reactor would need to produce about 112 percent of the tritium it will consume in order to continue operating so is a production rate technically known as the tritium breeding ratio of 112 percent achievable in a scientific article that abdou and eight co authors published recently they said they don t know they said that they have high confidence that a rate of 105 percent is achievable but that they have less confidence that a rate of 115 percent can be realized the fate of the worldwide effort to commercialize nuclear fusion rests on this razor thin edge of a few percentage points but as the authors wrote the data are not favorable the authors concluded that based on known physics and state of the art technology fusion reactors following iter will not be able to breed enough tritium to be self sufficient here is exactly what the authors said at the beginning of their abstract tritium issue 7 tritium start up inventory even if a tritium breeding ratio issue is solved there s one more problem where will a reactor get the tritium it needs in order to start up will the few remaining kilograms of global tritium after iter be enough which country is going to acquire that tritium the grim reality according to kovari et al is that there may not be enough tritium to start even one demo class reactor the tritium available commercially from the canadian reactor production program after the retirement of iter may not be sufficient to start demo two factors make the tritium supply for demo even smaller than previously considered first iter will be severely delayed and if demo is similarly delayed then all the canadian candu reactors will have been shut down while the civilian tritium stockpile will have undergone decay are there any alternatives is it as bad as it seems can t deuterium deuterium fusion reactions produce tritium yes they can and kovari et al answered this question it is in theory possible to start up a fusion reactor with little or no tritium but at an estimated cost of 2 billion per kilogram of tritium saved it is not economically sensible kovari et al wrote why is a cost saving of only 2 billion per kilogram not economically sensible because as the authors wrote the interest payments alone for the construction costs of the reactor during the time when it s building up an inventory of tritium and generating zero power would be 6 billion will iter breed tritium one final matter needs to be clarified will iter breed its own tritium one scientist who is capable of answering this question is tony donné the head of the eurofusion organization his organization is funded by the eu and is responsible for the design activities for the eu demo reactor the eu demo reactor is expected to use lithium throughout the entire interior structure of the reactor in order to breed the tritium it needs to operate but iter will have no such lithium blanket here s what donné told me about tritium breeding in iter iter will test four different technologies to breed tritium so it will actually breed tritium but less than is needed for its own consumption the experiments in iter will give guidance to the technologies to be used in demo which is envisaged to have a tritium breeding ratio greater than 1 and hence produce its own tritium then i asked abdou and i received a very different answer iter is not designed to breed tritium and it will not breed tritium iter has only limited mockup testing of some breeding blanket concepts the amount of tritium to be produced in these mockups is small and cannot provide a significant fraction for iter to use the mockup is a simulation of a blanket module about one square meter of surface area facing the plasma there will be only four of these iter has about 600 square meters of surface area so all the test mockups cannot produce more than 1 percent of iter s tritium consumption at the best conditions summary of the tritium issues a fusion reactor with a full tritium breeding blanket must be able to achieve a minimum tritium breeding ratio of 1 12 despite the fact that experts do not know how this will be possible the global inventory of tritium must be large enough to start at least the first demo class fusion reactor the first demo class fusion reactor must go into operation before the last of the tritium inventory disappears if successful the first demo class fusion reactor must be able to produce enough tritium to start the second demo class fusion reactor and so on the only other solution is that the world needs to build new heavy water fission reactors to produce fuel for fusion reactors to borrow from the matrix fate it seems is not without a sense of irony fusion scientists have been bashing fission reactor technology for decades next the fusion fuel discrepancy the

per year in the starfire chart it says starfire would burn 0 5kg per day that s about 203 times more than iter why were these tritium consumption numbers are so far apart daniel jassby answers starfire was supposed to operate continuously iter will have at most 1 000 pulses of 400 sec length 400 000 sec is about 1 of a year the projected iter fusion power is about 20 of the starfire fusion power there you have a factor of 500 thanks to daniel jassby for pointing out the following clarification about the alternative tritium sources shown in this graph hollenberg et al show the candu tritium production rate at 2 9 kg year per gw of electric power according to jassby a single candu reactor produces 0 2 kg of tritium yr gw as an unintended byproduct thus the hollenberg et al 1984 value assumes a quantity of 10 tritium producing candu reactors hollenberg et al show the tritium production rate from special light water reactors which must be intentionally equipped to breed tritium at 5 4 kg yr gw according to jassby a single such reactor produces at most 2 kg yr gw of tritium thus the hollenberg et al value assumes a quantity of 3 such reactors

when bidding finally closed last weekend the auction of morrisons turned out to have been less exciting than many of the speculators had been hoping clayton dubilier rice the original bidder walked away with the prize at 286p a share less than the shares were trading at in the week before the auction closed at 7bn whether the retailer will turn out to be a great investment remains to be seen terry leahy the former tesco boss will be advising the new owners and he has a formidable record in retailing if anyone can make morrisons a success leahy can yet it is hard to see how it can be magically transformed morrisons has languished in fourth place in its sector for the last 20 years and has no meaningful brand outside of its yorkshire heartlands the real lesson of the bid is that if morrisons is a target for private equity then so is just about every firm on the ftse 100 the wave of bids washing over britain no one thinks the buyouts will end with this takeover the uk is witnessing wave after wave of private equity firms buying out major british companies in the first half of this year the buyout firms spent 45bn in the uk with a total of 38 acquisitions ranging from john laing to g4s that is double the amount spent in the first half of 2020 or indeed any of the last ten years sainsbury s tesco either of them could be next it is not hard to see a media company being bought such as itv or pearson or indeed one of the banks such as lloyds at this rate in another few years there may be hardly any major companies left on the london market and the entire uk economy will belong to a handful of private equity firms based in new york and tokyo subscribe to moneyweek subscribe to moneyweek today and get your first six magazine issues absolutely free get 6 issues free sign up to money morning don t miss the latest investment and personal finances news market analysis plus money saving tips with our free twice daily newsletter don t miss the latest investment and personal finances news market analysis plus money saving tips with our free twice daily newsletter sign up plenty of investment institutions in the city will feel uneasy about that after all there won t be many companies left for british investors to put their money into and of course the private equity firms don t have a great record lots of businesses are drained of cash starved of investment then dumped back onto the stockmarket a few years later and yet the city also has a very easy way of bringing the waves of takeover bids to a sudden stop simply start valuing british equities properly there is no great mystery about why there are so many takeovers right now it is because the uk market is cheap compared with the rest of the world america s s p 500 and europe s stoxx 600 have risen 65 and 18 respectively in the last three years the ftse 100 has fallen by 8 over that time it trades on just 12 6 times forward earnings compared to 21 times and 16 times respectively for those two rivals in other words if you want a bargain and private equity firms are always looking for one of those then britain is the place to come let s get the ftse to 10 000 on top of that our market is relatively open compared to most others and although it might not look like it right now with fuel shortages across the country and labour shortages snarling up supply lines the uk has good growth prospects it is recovering from the pandemic as fast as most of its major rivals it will soon have recovered from the disruption of leaving the eu and it has plenty of new businesses and levels of venture capital investment far higher than anywhere else in europe the city can t and shouldn t do anything about it being an open market it would be crazy to put up barriers to takeover bids but it can fix the fact that uk equities are so cheap by increasing the weighting of the uk in the typical portfolio and especially in the giant pension funds that dominate the market it is time the uk was re rated and put on a par with other major markets around the world if the ftse 100 was at 10 000 we wouldn t see any more takeover bids they would be way too expensive that may seem a distant prospect but that is simply a measure of how poorly the uk market has done over the last 20 years once it hits those levels and there is no reason why it shouldn t the wave of takeovers will stop dead in its tracks but until it does they will keep on coming
when you re desperate sometimes what seems like a life preserver turns out to be a bald tire with a hole in it the people running lordstown motors think they may have shored up its wobbly fortunes by entering into a purchase agreement with foxconn the largest telecommunications manufacturer for an estimated 230 million foxconn will purchase the lordstown motors plant and invest another 50 million in stock as the company pivots toward entering the ev or electronic vehicle market the deal would be a literal lifeline for lordstown motors which occupies the old gm plant which closed in 2019 after 55 years in the giddiness no one seems particularly worried that in 2017 foxconn committed to building a 10 billion factory in mount pleasant wisconsin only to scale back its commitment to 672 million after receiving tax incentives and eminent domain that consumed whole neighborhoods despite objections and warnings from economists residents and taxpayers promised job openings went from 13 000 positions to 1 454 what was touted as the eighth wonder of the world was one of the reasons former gov scott walker once regarded as a presidential contender was kicked to the curb by voters in 2019 but lordstown motors which has yet to sell a single electric truck is fast running out of cash the last thing workers of the mahoning valley need is another broken promise another evaporating prayer for an economic resurrection here s hoping we haven t already seen this movie in 2019 the oscar winning an american factory documentary told the tale of laid off auto workers in dayton who thought they had secured a savior when fuyao a chinese windshield manufacturer bought their factory in case you might not be sure how things were going to go the film starts with fuyao executives making fun of dayton s housing stock later executives can be heard complaining that american workers are lazy entitled inferior and talk too much jobs at the new company are plentiful at half the wages the workers previously made even as occupational injuries pile up when fed up workers try to unionize well do you even need to be told the rest we all know that the days when american manufacturing stood alone as the colossus astride the world economy have vanished with the rotary phone but the kinds of hardworking people who built those companies still exist they can t be allowed to be fodder just to attract and to appease foreign investment they deserve decent pay and safe working conditions the communities in which they live deserve to know how those companies will impact their environment investment is the life s blood of any community but our country and its people and resources can t and shouldn t be bargained away to the highest bidder as has been the tragic case for several decades now it can only be hoped that lordstown motors won t suffer the same fate as so many companies that created and buoyed the american middle class their demise hollowed out a segment of this country that has yet to recover demise leads to desperation desperation feeds the fires that cause distrust cynicism and ultimately destruction charita m goshay is a canton repository staff writer and a member of the editorial board reach her at 330 580 8313 or charita goshay cantonrep com on twitter cgoshayrep editor s note a headline has been corrected to state that foxconn is a taiwan based company the purchase price for the plant also included an incorrect figure
