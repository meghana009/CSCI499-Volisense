alternative investments are becoming more and more popular as people seek to diversify their portfolios but what are they and should you invest in them alternative investments are usually defined as anything other than stocks bonds and cash that includes things like hedge funds venture capital private equity real estate and commodities these investments have traditionally been reserved for institutional or high net worth investors but are now starting to make their way into the portfolios of retail investors before making any decisions it s important to understand the advantages and disadvantages of alternative investments let s take a look at some of the pros and cons pros of alternative investments 1 diversification as we know diversification is a key to any good investment portfolio and alternative assets can help achieve a certain level of diversification by including alternative assets in your portfolio you can further diversify and reduce overall risk this means that if one asset class takes a hit the portfolio as a whole will be less impacted 2 higher returns another advantage to alternative investments is the potential to generate higher returns than traditional investing however an investor needs to be cautious with the risk since some alternative investments carry a tremendous amount of risk in order to secure the higher returns 3 may not correlate with the stock market the stock market is always fluctuating and it is impossible to predict what will happen next alternative investments may not correlate with the stock market which means they could potentially go up even when the stock market is going down this non correlation can help to diversify a portfolio and insulate it from market volatility 4 tax advantages some alternative investments offer tax advantages that you may not find with other assets for example certain types of real estate investing can offer you the opportunity to write off certain expenses come tax time this means you could potentially save money on your taxes by investing in certain real estate alternative asset classes cons of alternative investments 1 less liquidity one of the biggest disadvantages of alternative investments is that they tend to be less liquid than traditional assets this means it can be more difficult and time consuming to sell your investment and get your money out when it comes to stocks or bonds you can usually sell them relatively quickly and get your money within a few days 2 higher fees another downside of alternative investments is that they often come with higher fees than traditional assets for example you may have to pay a higher management fee to invest in a hedge fund this is because these types of investments are often more complex and require more work on the part of the manager 3 not suitable for everyone alternative investments are not suitable for everyone if you are risk averse or do not have disposable money to invest then these types of investments may not be right for you before investing in any type of asset it is important to understand your risk tolerance and financial goals in addition these types of investments require more research and prior knowledge to make informed decisions 4 less transparency than traditional investments alternative investments also tend to be less transparent than traditional investments this means it can be more difficult to track your investment and understand what is happening with your money for example hedge funds are not required to disclose their holdings or strategies to the public this lack of transparency can make it more difficult to understand what you are investing in and how your money is being used conclusion overall alternative investments can be a great way to diversify your portfolio and potentially generate higher returns however it s important to understand the risks involved before making any decisions these types of investments may not be suitable for everyone and come with higher fees and less liquidity it is important to research and come up with a well informed investment plan before moving forward media contact company name family business fund contact person douglas muir email send email phone 888 884 6442 address 101 plaza real south suite 216 city boca raton state fl 33432 country united states website www familybusinessfund com

follow us today don t mistaken the 2022 toyota tundra s beefy look to be misleading it can handle weight just as well as it can handle a good look in any pickup truck towing is by far the benchmark that all manufacturers need to master in order to call their pickup road worthy now if they market their truck as a towing machine like ford chevy and dodge do then they would really need to make sure that their truck f 150 silverado or ram 1500 can pass the check mark of towing good capacity however smaller trucks like the ford maverik chevy colorado or say the older mazda b series were not marketed as work trucks or trailer haulers toyota rates their 2022 tundra to be able to tow anywhere from 8300 to 12000lbs however 12000 is not the maximum we don t really know what the breaking point weight is for a safe tow but i suggest that if you do tow anything stick to what toyota says is safe on tundras com a popular toyota tundra forum user fordguy1470 ironic name posted a very in depth account of his towing experience from alabama to missouri in his report he stated his weight and basic stats then he went on to give the pros and cons of the entire trip let s take a look and see just how tow friendly the 2022 toyota tundra is for starters his specific tundra is the 2022 tundra sr5 cm short bed 4x2 and stock wheels and tires his trailer is a 2017 keystone laredo 334 re outside length 37 feet unfortunately he did not weigh his final weight so he listed it as unknown according to his testimony it handled okay he cruised at around 1800 rpm on the highway and said the ride was pretty smooth it was mostly flat lands except for one mountainous region he had to drive through the cruise control and brakes were flawless and there were no jolts or rapid movements however when you take into consideration your weight and the terrible aerodynamics of a hitched trailer you start to realize the bad he said he felt some jolting only when winds got high or when he had to change lanes a simple experiment is putting a toy pickup with a trailer on a treadmill and giving it a slight poke you ll see it will rapidly start swaying that s basically what he was explaining here s where it gets worse the brake controller was unreliable and the transmission oil kept rising which gave him error messages however because there were no places to park he simply eased off on the gas and the message went away what do you think how does your 2022 tundra handle towing let us know in the comments below harutiun hareyan is reporting toyota news at torque news his automotive interests and vast experience test riding new cars give his stories a sense of authenticity and unique insights follow harutiun on twitter at hareyanharutiun for daily toyota news

a distillery in new hampshire has come up with a novel way to make a product out of a marine invasive species the notorious green crab the green crab is a voracious predator of native shellfish and it spreads rapidly by means of hull fouling and untreated ballast water it is considered one of the world s worst invasive species and one of the hardest to control especially since it has little commercial value as a fishery it can be found on both coasts of the united states and it is a major threat to shellfish populations particularly soft shelled clams attempts to promote green crab as a food source have had limited success however tamworth distillery a small batch maker in new hampshire has teamed up with the university of new hampshire s green crab project to incorporate this unwanted crustacean into a boutique whiskey the distillery took 90 pounds of locally caught green crab amounting to thousands of tiny individual crabs and boiled them down into a stock along with a dose of spices like paprika mustard seed coriander clove and allspice blended in with an aged bourbon base this mixture provides the flavor for tamworth s new crab trapper whiskey the combination came out like an all natural and sustainable riff on fireball according to tamworth founder steven grasse green crabs are incredibly invasive so one of my goals as a researcher is to try and help create viable fisheries and markets as a solution to help mitigate the problem said gabriela bradt a fisheries specialist with university of new hampshire cooperative extension speaking to food wine this collaboration is a really unique and exciting opportunity to do that

alan guebert farm and food file oftentimes the simple answer to a simple question is the simple truth some people however don t want the simple truth so they bend facts or shave figures so their square pegs replace roundly accepted reality it s commonplace in agriculture for example on april 12 president joe biden traveled to iowa to announce an expansion of the ethanol blend in summertime gasoline from 10 percent to 15 monte shaw the iowa renewable fuels association boss called biden s action the single most important step the president is empowered to take to keep fuel prices down this summer but biden s political gambit and shaw s hefty hyperbole held more gas than any ethanol blend nationwide gasoline prices that day according to aaa averaged 4 per gallon today national gas prices hover around 5 per gallon or 25 higher despite the effort many in farm country continue to blame the biden administration for high fuel prices one reason some conservative critics cite is that crude oil production is slowing due to the white house s allegiance to the green new deal that s a stretch for two reasons first the green new deal isn t law and second data from the u s energy information agency shows that average annual domestic crude oil production rose from 5 3 million barrels per day during the bush administration to 7 2 million barrels per day under obama to 11 million barrels per day under trump to 11 2 million barrels per day under biden but hey facts rarely sidetrack anyone committed to political railroading the same goes for agriculture for months we ve been warned of an impending global famine because of russia s invasion of ukraine an important wheat exporter indeed reported politico june 17 u s officials estimate the russian blockade of ukrainian ports is holding back more than 20 million tons of grain from the world food supply driving food prices and world hunger to near crisis levels twenty million metric tons or about 740 million bushels is a lot of wheat except when compared to global supplies the u s department of agriculture s most recent world agricultural supply and demand estimates forecast 2022 23 world wheat production at 773 4 million metric tons or 28 4 billion bushels as such the bottled up ukrainian wheat is equal to about 2 5 of this coming year s world production not nothing but hardly enough to fuel a famine this year or any year some market worriers though continue to make a mountain out of that molehill on june 20 farm journal s agweb noted that a private forecaster had pegged current global wheat stocks at 20 of yearly production instead of usda s recent estimate of 33 again that sounds like a dramatic drop but as the story goes on to note even at 20 if accurate and there s little proof of that world stocks stand at over 10 week s of wheat consumption in storage historically that s average supply especially when compared to current and forecasted u s stocks of corn and soybeans according to the same usda june report current american soybean stocks now stand at a slim 4 6 of total usage and given a productive 2022 a year from now will still be only 6 8 likewise this year s u s corn stocks are just 10 of usage and estimates usda will slip to 9 6 in 2022 23 and yet despite very tight supplies of u s corn and soybeans in the coming year no one sees either as cause for global concern instead note the cassandras it s wheat with at least a 10 week world supply and more than likely a 15 week supply as the problem i m not alone in my doubt few in the futures market see 2022 23 wheat supplies as worrisome from mid may to late june new wheat crop futures prices dropped 17 while new crop corn futures are just 9 lower and soybean futures are only 2 lower simple numbers simple facts simple truth simple right the farm and food file is published weekly throughout the u s and canada past columns supporting documents and contact information are posted at farmandfoodfile com
even tv lovers who haven t yet made the decision to go all in on streaming know one pretty big thing about it netflix is the granddaddy of our current streaming wars and many many people around the world rely on their netflix subscriptions so that they can watch the nearly innumerable shows on netflix not to mention the best movies on netflix this means that most subscribers were surprised when the service announced earlier this year that it was working on bringing ads to the streaming giant for the first time ever now though co ceo ted sarandos has clarified a big misconception about commercials on netflix what did ted sarandos have to say about the ads coming to netflix while millions of people likely remember not so fondly possibly getting and then returning those flimsy red netflix envelopes in the mail the company has become much better known and beloved for what it s brought to streaming for its entire existence as a streamer so far netflix has been ad free at every price tier but with that changing in the near ish future ted sarandos who spoke at the cannes lions advertising festival recently via the hollywood reporter wanted to make an aspect of this plan crystal clear for subscribers and said we are adding an ad tier we re not adding ads to netflix as you know it today we re adding an ad tier for folks who say hey i want a lower price and i ll watch ads ahhhhh do we all get it now look i completely understand the disappointment and or panic that must have washed over a lot of subscribers when they heard that ads were about to become a thing on netflix right now there are three subscription tiers priced at 9 99 15 49 and 19 99 can you imagine paying for any streaming service spending years without ads and then suddenly having to deal with commercials before during or after your binge of stranger things or love is blind it would be infuriating and the last thing netflix wants to do right now is piss off any subscribers the past several years have seen a number of viewers complain about their favorite shows being cancelled before the stories came to a real conclusion lots of those subscribers would then go on to cancel netflix like the fans of the dearly departed sci fi series the oa who called for mass cancellations over losing the drama but also netflix saw a much larger downturn in subscribers earlier this year right before it was decided that creating an ad supported price tier for people who don t mind commercials would be a good idea netflix reported that it lost around 200 000 subscribers in late april which led the company s stock prices to tumble on top of that many folks have also been pissed with the streamer for how it laid off a number of employees recently so i can certainly see how making this particular move with a new ad based tier would be the best move for netflix to possibly regain some subscribers while also not annoying its current viewers luckily non of us will have to deal with commercials on netflix if we don t want to
overview asia pacific equities were mixed gains were recorded in china hong kong australia and india among the large markets while japan was mostly flat and south korea and taiwan shares fell europe s stoxx 600 is off about 0 7 the same as yesterday us futures are slightly firmer the rally in bonds continues after falling nearly a dozen basis points yesterday the us 10 year yield is off another 5 bp today around 3 10 it is near two and a half week lows european yields are down 14 19 bp the 10 year italian yield that had poked above 4 earlier this month is now near 3 40 it is the sixth session in the past seven that yields have fallen the dollar is trading with a firmer bias except against the yen where the threat of verbal intervention and falling us rates helps the yen recovery despite norway s larger than expected 50 bp move the krone and the swedish krona are the weakest of the g10 currencies emerging market currencies are mostly lower led by central europe gold is consolidating in a narrow range around 1835 august wti fell over 3 yesterday and today it is pinned in the lower end of yesterday s range but looks poised to recover more in north america us natgas is off 2 but the shock in europe continues its benchmark is up for the ninth consecutive session and today s 7 5 surge is the most since the middle of last week the singapore iron ore futures we track jumped nearly 8 today the most in three months however copper is not getting such a reprieve it is off 2 after a similar decline yesterday september wheat is also down about 2 today and is at its lowest level since march asia pacific japan s composite pmi rose for the fourth consecutive month and at 53 2 it stands just below the cyclical high set last november it contrasts with most others who have reported a decline in the june flash pmi composite however that is arguably not the most important development today as japan s recovery has already been in tow instead there are two other developments to note first last week when the boj bought around 80 bln of bonds foreign investors sold a record amount 35 5 bln and liquidated almost jpy945 bln japanese equities second into the fray waded former ministry of finance head of fx nikao who raised the specter of unilateral intervention this threat marks another step up the intervention escalation ladder just because he says it is so does not make is so and we hasten to point out that the sometimes failed intervention is worse than no intervention in an intervention operation japan would be isolated and the action would not signal a change in monetary policy australia s preliminary manufacturing pmi ticked up to 55 8 from 55 7 but was not sufficient to offset the erosion of the service pmi to 52 6 from 53 2 the composite slipped to 52 6 from 52 9 it was the first back to back decline since july and august which was part of a four month fall it is the lowest since january the market is gradually moving away pricing in a 50 bp hike on july 5 the futures market has a 39 bp increase discounted down from 56 bp in the middle of last week central bank governor lowe pushed against a 75 bp hike it is near a two week low today a combination of lower us yields and the threat of unilateral intervention has knocked the greenback down against the yen for a second session it set a high yesterday near jpy136 70 and has been sold to around jpy135 25 today a break of jpy135 would likely spur a test on the week s low set monday near jpy134 55 the australian dollar is also pushing lower for the second consecutive session it is near a six day low by 0 6865 last week s low was closer to 0 6850 and last month s low was near 0 6830 the aussie appears to be trying to stabilize in the european morning the chinese yuan is trading in a narrow range today roughly cny6 70 to cny6 7150 and remains within yesterday s range the pboc set the dollar s reference rate at cny6 7079 a little lower than the median projection of cny6 7084 from the bloomberg survey separately note that the philippine central bank hiked by 25 bp as expected to 2 50 while indonesia stood pat at 3 50 europe the preliminary pmi in the eurozone was weaker than expected the manufacturing pmi ticked down to 52 0 from 54 6 the german reading fell to 52 0 from 54 8 and the french reading fell to 51 from 54 6 the aggregate service pmi dropped to 52 8 from 56 1 germany s stands at 52 4 off from 55 0 france s is at 54 4 down from 58 3 the composite reading for the region stands at 51 9 compared with 54 8 in may germany s composite fell for the fourth consecutive month and stands at 51 3 from 53 3 france s composite fell for the second consecutive month to 52 8 from 57 0 by the time the ecb meets in september where a 50 bp move may be on the table is it unreasonable to suspect the pmi will be below the 50 boom bust level the uk flash pmi was mixed the manufacturing pmi fell to 53 4 from 54 6 however the services pmi was steady at 53 4 the market had looked for a small decline the result was that the composite was also unchanged at 53 1 meanwhile two byelections are being held today and polls warn that the tories could lose both if so the results will further tarnish the prime minister whose ability to lead the tories into victory in the next election will be questioned norway surprised many with a 50 bp hike today the majority of those surveyed by reuters and bloomberg anticipated a quarter point move which the central bank had previously indicated the deposit rate stands at 1 25 now and norges bank said a 25 bp hike in august was likely it now sees the key rate at 3 in the middle of next year up from 2 50 it had previously projected for the end of 2023 it cut its gdp forecast and raised its inflation forecast the focus turns to sweden s riksbank that meets next week it has only hiked rates once and at 0 25 it seems out of line with the 7 3 headline inflation and the 5 4 pace of the underlying rate excluding energy the euro is trading heavily but within yesterday s broad range 1 0470 1 0605 there are options for 1 8 bln euros at 1 05 and around 1 4 bln euros at 1 0455 after trading up to 1 0580 in asia and early europe the single currency sold off after the pmi report it stabilized but is now likely to find the 1 0540 area as the nearby cap the price action also underscores the more formidable cap at 1 06 sterling is also trading lower and is within yesterday s range 1 2160 1 2315 but this does not do justice to the large consolidation for the fifth session sterling remains within last thursday s range 1 2040 1 2405 immediate resistance is seen in the 1 2240 1 2260 area in north america america some argue that in his testimony before congress powell represents the federal reserve not just his opinion fair enough but surely at the press conference after the fomc meeting he is explaining what the fomc decided and talks about its median projection maybe it is too fine of a distinction but in any event powell s remarks in an answer to the senator s questions seemed somewhat more dovish and more cognizant that the effects of the tighter financial conditions are beginning to have the desired impact the fed chair seemed to play down supply chain bottlenecks and sharpened his focus on demand which lends support to some political arguments that the american rescue act is responsible for the inflation at the press conference following the fomc meeting powell seemed to acknowledge that among large countries the us inflation was in the middle of the pack and that fiscal stimulus could not explain the relatively modest inflation differentials yet what may be more relevant for the foreign exchange market was powell s answer to a question from senator warren powell explained that the fed s goal of weakening demand is being pursued over three channels the first is reducing the demand for interest rate sensitive spending housing autos and other durable goods come to mind the fed wants to see a weaker sale the second weakening asset prices to curb the wealth effect and reduce the wherewithal to spend this means weaker stocks so much for the fed put higher interest rates and lower house prices it was the third channel that is arguable most notable a strengthening dollar he recognized that the changes in the exchange rate influenced import and export prices by suggesting that the strong dollar was part of the fight against inflation powell seemed to reduce the likelihood which was not particularly high in the first place of intervention to check the dollar s rise to say it somewhat differently us participation or support of intervention to weaken the dollar is unlikely as long as the fed is tightening financial conditions it also means that the strong dollar policy is alive and well that makes a good segue into today s release of the us q1 current account balance it is going to a blowout deficit the median forecast in bloomberg s survey is for a whopping 275 bln deficit last year it averaged 205 4 bln a quarter in 2018 the current account deficit averaged slightly less than 110 bln a quarter and in 2019 the average was about 118 bln as we have noted before according to the oecd s purchasing power parity model the euro yen and sterling are most under valued in at least 30 years few talk about the current account deficit that is approaching 4 of gdp when the dollar is strong the narrative is about interest rate and or growth differentials when the dollar falls the twin deficits are often part of the narrative we imagine the dollar s bottom will be a process that takes some time to form and that the markets will anticipate the peak in inflation and rate interest rate differentials often turn before the dollar if the key to the fed s decision to hike by 75 bp instead of 50 bp was based on the cpi and preliminary university of michigan s june consumer inflation expectations then the significance of other high frequency data points is somewhat less important that includes today s preliminary pmi where the composite is expected to have fallen for the third consecutive month the decline will likely put it at its lowest level since january which itself was the lowest since july 2020 canada s strong jobs report earlier this month and strong retail sales and firmer than expected inflation have not helped the canadian dollar very much its sensitivity to the general risk environment has weighed on it and although rising oil price did not seem to help it either some are attributing the heaviness now to the drop in crude prices the swaps market has a 75 bp hike early next month nearly fully discounted the us dollar is chopping between cad1 29 and cad1 30 it had reached almost cad1 3080 last week while some observers point to a double top in place the problem is that it will not be confirmed until cad1 25 goes meanwhile it is a big day for mexico the biweekly cpi through mid june followed by april retail sales will be released today but the big event is banxico s meeting and regardless of today s data a 75 bp hike is expected the central bank may also signal its intent for a similar move when it meets next on august 11 the us dollar fell to a seven day low near mxn20 00 yesterday it has recovered to almost mxn20 1425 today yesterday s high was near mxn20 25 a break of mxn20 00 could spur losses toward mxn19 90
washington the united states will send another 450 million in military aid to ukraine including some additional medium range rocket systems to help push back russian progress in the war officials announced thursday the latest package includes four high mobility artillery rocket systems or himars which will double the number they have now all four were prepositioned in europe and training on those systems has already begun with the ukrainian troops who will use them said marine corps lt col anton semelroth a pentagon spokesman the first four himars that the u s previously sent have already gone to the battlefield in ukraine and are in the hands of troops there according to the pentagon the aid also includes 18 tactical vehicles that are used to tow howitzers so the weapons can be moved around the battlefield as well as 18 coastal and riverine patrol boats thousands of machine guns grenade launchers and rounds of ammunition and some other equipment and spare parts the new aid comes just a week after the u s announced it was sending 1 billion in military aid to ukraine and as the russian military continues to slowly expand its control in the eastern donbas region ukrainian leaders have persistently asked for the more advanced precision rocket systems in order to better fight back against russia the russian military captured two villages in eastern ukraine on thursday and is fighting for control of a key highway in a campaign to cut supply lines and encircle frontline ukrainian forces according to british and ukrainian military officials russian forces have been bombarding the city of sievierodonetsk for weeks with artillery and air raids and fought the ukrainian army house to house the himars gives ukraine the ability to strike russian forces and weapons from farther away making it less risky for ukrainian troops the systems are mounted on trucks which carry a container with six precision guided rockets that can travel about 45 miles it took about three weeks to train ukrainian troops on the first four himars before the systems were moved to the fight the aid is part of the 40 billion in security and economic assistance passed last month by congress and signed into law by president biden and it is the 13th package of military weapons and equipment committed to ukraine since the war began overall since the war started in late february the u s has committed about 6 1 billion in security assistance to ukraine including this latest package the 450 million in equipment and weapons will be from drawdown authority which means the defense department will take it all from its own stocks and ship it to ukraine send questions comments to the editors previous next
don t miss out on the headlines from tv followed categories will be added to my news netflix has sacked 300 more staff as it desperately looks to cut costs while also mounting an offensive within the advertising industry in the ramp up to its ad supported tier the american streaming company has been under siege since it revealed a decline in subscribers leading to a dramatic plunge in its share price and market value today we sadly let go of around 300 employees a netflix spokesperson told deadline while we continue to invest significantly in the business we made these adjustments so that our costs are growing in line with our slower revenue growth we are so grateful for everything they have done for netflix and are working hard to support them through this difficult transition the lay offs were expected to come and had been flagged earlier this week by variety but it was initially expected to be around 150 staff netflix s first round of firings came in may affecting roughly 150 staff and dozens more contractors among those let go last month were several roles within the company s animation department as well as writers in netflix s tudum editorial division the company has an estimated 11 000 employees worldwide stream more entertainment news live on demand with flash 25 news channels in 1 place new to flash try 1 month free offer ends 31 october 2022 stranger things season four is the most high profile recent netflix release netflix is attempting to bring costs into line after a disastrous financial report in late april it revealed a net decline of 200 000 subscribers in the first three months of this year a result it attributed to increased competition in the industry and the loss of 700 000 members in russia where it had to suspend service as a result of vladimir putin s invasion of ukraine the shock drop in subscribers as well as forecasting it would shed in the current quarter a further 2 5 million paying accounts led to a precipitous plunge in netflix s stock price in the immediate aftermath its share price lost a third of its value equating to more than us50 billion netflix s share price is currently us170 down from us605 at the beginning of the year and from its 12 month high of us700 netflix axed several titles such as the steve carell comedy space force and the michael b jordan produced superhero series raising dion as well as halting production on in development shows including ava duvernay s wings of fire and meghan markle s pearl the streamer also revealed it would roll out two controversial updates to its platform the first being an advertising supported subscription option which would allow users to pay a lower fee in return for sitting through ads netflix co found reed hastings was previously vehemently against an ad supported level but conceded that the option would give customers a choice lincoln lawyer is in this week s netflix s top 10 shows globally speaking at the global advertising conference cannes lions co chief executive and chief content officer ted sarandos said netflix was speaking to a number of potential partners to help launch the ad supported tier he said the plan was for a pretty easy entry to the market which we ll build on and iterate to make netflix a destination for users what we ll do first is not representative of what the product will be ultimately sarandos also addressed the hammering netflix has taken on the stock market we ve gotten through experiences where the market disconnects from core business and you have to prove the thesis still works and is going to work long term there s a lot of uncertainty in the world today and if they get anything that rocks the foundation of the narrative they get nervous we re in the early days of this evolution of watching the way that people watch and consume television today we re about 10 per cent of what people do on tv and about 30 per cent of the streaming we look at that and say there s still a lot of time that people are watching linear tv you look at the growth of streaming as a percentage of total and there s a lot of room to grow the other move netflix is seeking to make is a crackdown on password sharing a practice which 100 million of its 222 million paying members engaged in it s currently trialling a model in costa rica chile and peru in which subscribers are being asked to pay an extra fee to share their password beyond their household netflix staff have also had a rough trot in their dealings with the company over recent controversial releases including dave chappelle s comedy special in which he made transphobic comments netflix employees who objected to the content of chappelle s program protested internally and physically outside the company s los angeles headquarters after co chief executive and chief content officer ted sarandos distributed memos in defence of the choice to platform chappelle weeks later netflix issued another missive to unhappy staff reiterating its support for artistic expression and encouraged employees who can t commit to the same to leave the business originally published as netflix sacks hundreds of staff in new round of lay offs

berberine s effect on lung cancer has just been published in the journal pharmaceutics showing potent anticancer activity in a study that crosses the divide between eastern and western medicine while the natural compound found in plants such as turmeric and barberry has been used in traditional chinese and ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years it has yet to be widely used in clinics according to kamal dua an australian indian scientist from the university of technology sydney all that historical and ancient knowledge of the medicinal plant known by people for ages but has never been translated in the clinic lead researcher and senior pharmacy lecturer dua told the epoch times modern medicine focuses greatly on diseases and medical students spend many years in school studying the body in a diseased state and the diseases themselves whereas in traditional and ancient medicinal practices using food as medicine is one of the main pillars we all possess both yin cold water and yang hot fire energies to varying degrees norikko shutterstock from all the ayurvedic medicines and indigenous medicinal plants he examined he found the plant compound berberine to be the most surprising demonstrating impressive effects against lung cancer the researchers spanning ireland ronan macloughlin australia prof brian oliver prof phil hansbro keshav raj paudel and bikash manandhar saudi arabia abdullah alnuqaydan and abdulmajeed almutary and india sachin kumar singh and prof monica gulati found that berberine stops the growth of tumour cells in lung cancer the world s leading cause of cancer related deaths with around 1 8 million deaths reported annually this is possible by inhibition of key genes and proteins associated with cancer cell proliferation and migration he explained how to take berberine berberine can be found in a variety of plants such as goldenseal goldthread oregon grape phellodendron and coptis chinensis a species of goldthread flowering plant native to china an earlier study he led found that berberine could also reduce inflammation and damage to healthy lung cells from cigarette smoke berberine can be found in a variety of plants such as goldenseal goldthread oregon grape phellodendron and coptis chinensis a species of goldthread flowering plant native to china it can be taken as directed on the package or you can discuss your options with a trusted healthcare professional and monitor its effectiveness over time dua notes that the benefits of the supplement have been limited by its lack of ability to dissolve in water and be absorbed in the gut as well as toxicity at higher doses digestive side effects including diarrhea constipation flatulence and abdominal pain have been reported berberine being delivered in liquid crystalline nanoparticles adobe stock to overcome these challenges the research team has developed a novel method of using liquid crystalline nanoparticles to safely and effectively encapsulate small doses of berberine inside it means the patient does not have to take multiple doses it also has fewer side effects compared to the various other chemical based drugs he said dr osita onugha thoracic surgeon and assistant professor of thoracic surgery at saint john s cancer institute at providence saint john s health center in santa monica ca told medical news today that it is promising when researchers find new options for cancer treatment and prevention from the east berberine is part of eastern medicine and so it s not something that we traditionally use in western medicine i think it s interesting and intriguing because we re looking at things know have some benefit in eastern medicine into a study to help translate it to western medicine onugha said it s always promising but it is in a lab and a lot of things we find in a lab do not necessarily translate to the treatment of patients onugha continued the next step in this discovery is to move towards pre clinical studies followed by clinical trials to explore its real therapeutic potential to make it reach clinics the future of berberine dua is now working closely with sydney based companies to do further research and deliver these nanoparticles to the bedside its success will lead to the team looking at it being used for other illnesses even alzheimer s dua said we are now we are testing the same thing on other respiratory diseases like asthma and also on pulmonary fibrosis because inflammation is a common condition in every disease he said inflammation happens in every disease whether it is a brain gut or lung and berberine has clearly shown that it is reducing the inflammation when it is reducing the inflammation it may also have the potential to work in various other disease states neurodegenerative diseases and maybe in other gastrointestinal diseases

protecting people from floods requires many technical professionals to make good predictions and decisions meteorologists predict the risk of extreme rainfall hydrologists translate this rainfall into predictions about what the flood will be like in terms of depth flow and speed engineers design roads bridges and buildings to cope with the likely conditions while planners ensure new development is compatible with flood risks no step in this process is easy and most are getting harder climate change is worsening flooding because a hotter atmosphere can hold more water vapour which supercharges clouds a hotter climate provides more energy to lift wet air high into the atmosphere where it cools becomes liquid and forms extreme rainfall in australia s north the intensity of heavy rainfall events has already increased by 10 since 1979 while it is difficult to adapt to unpredictable rainfall events we can improve our flood predictions we focused on improving a common flood prediction technique called the rational method while simple to use it can also get some things very wrong such as underestimating flood peaks by 200 to fix this we worked with the developers of arc hydro a popular software package used by stormwater and flood planners to better describe how the shape of hillslopes affects floods we hope this can help planners gain a better understanding of the true flood risks in specific areas shutterstock why do we need better flood predictions it s particularly hard to predict the risk of extreme storms like those that drove devastating flooding in parts of new south wales and queensland earlier this year because for these storms the past is not a good guide to the future those floods came from a rain bomb which dumped 60 of south east queensland s normal annual rainfall in just three days managing flood risks is hard given the cost of flood protection evacuation and resilience in developed areas and challenges in restricting development in high risk areas in recent years there has been intense pressure on planners in australian cities to provide new housing stock the land development sector also makes substantial political donations unsurprisingly these pressures have led to development on flood prone land flooding during the ongoing la niña events has paused development in some areas australia has robust guidance available to predict flood risk the federal government s australian rainfall and runoff guidance is world leading unfortunately to use this properly you need to undertake high quality analysis detailed physical modelling and thoughtful exploration of uncertainty this can be expensive requiring specialised software highly trained experts and enough data and time that s why many planners in australia and globally still turn to simpler methods of flood assessments like the rational method read more why flooding is still so difficult to predict and prepare for simpler is not always better while appealing simpler methods are more likely to be inaccurate although there are longstanding concerns about the reliability the method remains stubbornly popular and recommended in design standards globally rather than scolding engineers for using the rational method we aimed to improve it to maintain simplicity the rational method overlooks many factors affecting how floods form we looked at one vital factor the shape of the landscape when rain falls on sloping land it flows to the bottom of valleys where stream channels form but hillslopes aren t flat like a sheet of cardboard they curve in different ways we were worried about divergent hillslopes which fan out from a short section of ridge to a long stretch of stream under these conditions the rational method overestimates how long rain needs to fall to produce a worst case flood by overestimating how long a storm will last the rational method underestimates rainfall extremes that can lead to very significant errors such as underestimating the flood peak by 200 to fix this issue we developed a mathematical theory to correct flood predictions based on the shape of the hillslope we tested our new theory using experiments run on carefully engineered model hillslopes and found it worked as expected dana a lapides from theory to practice sadly mathematical theories aren t usually popular outside academic circles to share our new approach with users we worked with esri the developer of the globally popular arc hydro gis package used by stormwater and flood planners together we built new tools for the package which map hillslopes describe the hillslope shape mathematically and use our new theory to improve predictions produced by the rational method so does it work when we applied our tool to test watersheds in california and arizona we found about 40 of the hillslopes were divergent wider at the bottom than the top for these areas using our new methods would improve flood predictions by up to 270 floods are a difficult challenge for societies to deal with around the world that s because coping with floods requires us to make long term decisions about where we live how we live and what we build in the face of a rapidly changing climate to fully address these problems is an international multidisciplinary task for scientists engineers planners policymakers and decision makers we hope our improvement to the rational method will be a small but useful part of this great endeavour read more one in 1 000 years old flood probabilities no longer hold water
bill gates and elon musk are having yet another billionaire food fight this time over climate change musk accused gates of not being a serious climate reformer because he shorted tesla s stock gates was quick to swipe back stating that he gives a lot more money to climate change than elon or anyone else advertisement these billionaire showmen certainly know how to put on a 21st century climate change show musk has said that climate change is the single biggest threat humanity faces aside from artificial intelligence gates for his part has gone so far as to advocate for all rich countries to move to 100 synthetic beef cow farts are really bad for the environment supposedly everyday americans aren t buying what they re selling and understandably so the so called climate change emergency is one of the most manufactured crises in history none of its advocates doomsday predictions have come true over the years from lower manhattan going under water by 2018 to 50 million climate refugees by 2000 to entire nations getting wiped out from global warming by 2000 yet they want you to stop eating meat taking daily showers and driving gas powered cars anyway but here s the thing if one takes their actions at face value gates and musk don t appear to be buying what they re selling either they re certainly not making many sacrifices to save the planet but they still want to inconvenience you with mandate after mandate in contrast to gandhi s advice that we should live simply so that others may simply live these billionaire hypocrites clearly believe that we should do what they say not what they do gates for example owns four private jets and ironically he got in a bidding war for the world s largest private jet operator just one month before releasing a book on climate change this isn t the profile of a climate change reformer it s the profile of a billionaire who appears to put lavish living over everything else advertisement gates bd 700 global express jet aircraft below consumes 486 gallons of fuel each hour a study conducted by stefan gössling of the school of business and economics at linnaeus university in sweden showed that in 2017 gates took 59 flights by private jet and during the over one third of a million kilometers traveled his jets emitted more than 1 600 tons of co 2 that is almost 90 times the average annual carbon footprint per person in the u s for everything they do not just air travel in a recent interview on cbs news 60 minutes gates admitted to anderson cooper i probably have one of the highest greenhouse gas footprints on the planet my personal flying alone is gigantic but gates explained he is paying about 7 million a year a pittance for a billionaire to offset his carbon footprint if only regular people could afford such luxuries yet gates doesn t want you to discharge anything even for transportation because when you re going to zero you don t get to skip anything musk is no better though stating that humanity is faltering and that tesla exists to help reduce risk of catastrophic climate change he too has a penchant for flying on private jets in may business insider reported that musk bought two private jets in the past two years the environmental price of his carbon emitting lifestyle isn t small potatoes in 2019 the washington post reported that his corporate jet flew more than 150 000 miles or more than six times around the earth as he raced between the outposts of his futuristic empire the cherry on top is that the post made it clear that some of the flights were recreational getaways for musk or his family not just business trips advertisement if that s how one can behave when humanity is in crisis then how is the sky not already falling of course musk being a hypocrite in this area is nothing new wired magazine reports that despite their green cred tesla cars create pollution and carbon emissions in ways that are easily overlooked by consumers and investors this theme is explored in detail in the 2021 book clean energy exploitations helping citizens understand the environmental and humanity abuses that support clean energy by engineer and energy consultant ronald stein and todd royal an independent public policy consultant focusing on the geopolitical implications of energy they explain tesla motors dirty little secret is turning into a major problem for the ev industry and perhaps mankind if you think tesla s model s is the green car of the future think again the promises of energy independence a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and lower fuel costs are all factors behind the rise in the popularity of electric vehicles unfortunately under scrutiny all these promises prove to be more fiction than fact related is the green energy climate cabal crumbling musk s spacex has also come under fire from environmental groups for endangering wildlife in texas sometimes violating its faa launch license and of course his falcon 9 rockets don t run on renewable energy they use kerosene a combustible hydrocarbon liquid derived from petroleum however rest assured that musk will keep advising you on what to do to protect the planet advertisement gates and musk can continue arguing all they want but their spat is merely a distraction from the real issue the fact that the climate change movement they both claim to hold so dear has no legs to stand on and their actions appear to prove it so enjoy your cheeseburger take your shower and drive your car to work the climate bosses are doing it so why shouldn t you tom harris is executive director of the ottawa canada based international climate science coalition

gun lobby interest oriented market behind u s gun violence xinhua 09 42 june 24 2022 beijing june 24 xinhua once again the recent fatal shootings across the united states including mass ones have pit advocates for a tightened gun market against those who lobby for and gain from gun sales international media and observers have repeatedly warned of the danger of a loose gun market but see the issue a standstill as it has deeply entrenched social cause besides bipartisan tensions the new york times reported sunday that the loopholes and scrappy data of the national instant background check system which is meant to guarantee gun buyers have clean slates may partially fail such an aim the system operates with serious built in limitations inserted by the gun lobby which pushed to speed up gun sales inserting a provision that allows gun dealers to give purchasers their weapons if an investigation is not completed within three business days said the report the gun lobby in the united states is too strong and politicians are too weak observed the british medical journal in an opinion piece earlier this month noting that prices for major gun related stocks rose the day after the uvalde shooting at an elementary school killing 19 children and two teachers on may 25 u s lawmakers serve as mouthpieces for powerful interest groups which have earned considerable profits from gun sales ezzat saad director of the egyptian council for foreign affairs told xinhua blaming u s legislative bodies for aggravating mass shootings for instance saad said there are lawmakers who instead of calling for stricter laws to curb the arms trade inside the country suggest more investment in psychological therapy touting it as a way to decrease mass shootings deepanshu mohan associate professor of economics at o p jindal global university in india said the u s gun industry is guided by the compulsions of less regulated market forces that can be traced back to the late 20th century when the u s economy was built around an industrialised mass scaling model of weaponizing itself and other nations while designing tools of finance to profit from war he said for a long time the u s market has been based more on maximising self interest while less on the consequences ethics or morals of resulting actions and mohan argued that the value of human life and ethical considerations in economic and social policy making are needed for change more guns lead to more violence amanda marcotte a senior politics writer said in an article published on the website of u s news portal salon adding that research showed that was especially true of the gun buying surge during the covid 19 pandemic in the united states as the percentage of newly purchased guns being used in crime climbed the surge was due to decades of propaganda leading people to think they needed guns to be safe marcotte said so this vicious cycle is perpetuated people buy guns which leads to more gun violence which leads to more gun sales and so on and so forth said marcotte it s another reminder that as long as our country is awash in guns shootings can happen anywhere anytime california senator scott wiener said following a shooting on wednesday which killed one and injured another inside a train in san francisco the united states accounts for less than 5 percent of the global population but owns 46 percent of the world s existing firearms the spanish daily el pais has reported saying the problem fuels divisions and political polarization as of monday june has seen 45 mass shootings across the country bringing 2022 s total to 277 according to the latest data from the nonprofit organization gun violence archive web editor peng yukai liang jun
the anti inflation policies driven by the u s and the eurozone are not going to ease the burdens on the working class in their countries and certainly not in the debt ridden global south writes vijay prashad by vijay prashad tricontinental institute for social research in april the united nations established the global crisis response group on food energy and finance this group is tracking the three major crises of food inflation fuel inflation and financial distress their second briefing released on june 8 noted that after two years of the covid 19 pandemic the world economy has been left in a fragile state today 60 per cent of workers have lower real incomes than before the pandemic 60 per cent of the poorest countries are in debt distress or at high risk of it developing countries miss 1 2 trillion per year to fill the social protection gap and 4 3 trillion is needed per year more money than ever before to meet the sustainable development goals sdgs this is a perfectly reasonable description of the distressing global situation and things are likely to get worse according to the u n global crisis response group most capitalist states have already rolled back the relief funds they provided during the pandemic if social protection systems and safety nets are not adequately extended the report reads poor families in developing countries facing hunger may reduce health related spending children who temporarily left school due to covid 19 may now be permanently out of the education system or smallholder or micro entrepreneurs may close shop due to higher energy bills the world bank reports that food and fuel prices will remain at very high levels until at least the end of 2024 as wheat and oilseed prices have escalated reports are coming in from across the globe including in wealthy countries that working class families have started to skip meals this tense food situation has led the u n secretary general s special advocate for inclusive finance for development queen máxima of the netherlands to predict that many families will move to one meal a day which she says will be the source of even more instability in the world the world economic forum wef adds that we are in the midst of a perfect storm if you take into account the impact of increasing interest rates on mortgage payments as well as inadequate salaries the managing director of the international monetary fund kristalina georgieva kinova said late last month that the horizon has darkened these assessments come from people at the heart of powerful global institutions the imf world bank wef and the u n and even from a queen although they all recognize the structural nature of the crisis they are reluctant to be honest about the underlying economic processes or even about how to adequately name the situation david m rubenstein the head of global investment firm the carlyle group said that when he was part of u s president jimmy carter s administration their inflation adviser alfred kahn warned them not to use the r word recession which scares people instead kahn advised use the word banana along those lines rubenstein said of the current situation i don t want to say we re in a banana but i would say a banana may not be that far away from where we are today marxist economist michael roberts does not hide behind words such as banana roberts has studied the global average rate of profit on capital which he shows has been falling with minor reverses since 1997 this trend was exacerbated by the global financial crash of 2007 08 which led to the great recession in 2008 since then he argues the world economy has been in the grip of a long depression with the rate of profit at a historic low in 2019 just before the pandemic profit drives investment in capitalism writes roberts and so falling and low profitability has led to slow growth in productive investment capitalist institutions have shifted from investment in productive activity to as roberts puts it the fantasy world of stock and bond markets and cryptocurrencies the cryptocurrency market by the way has collapsed by over 60 percent this year dwindling profits in the global north have led capitalists to seek profits in the global south and beat back any country especially china and russia that threatens their financial and political hegemony with military force if necessary ghastly is the way of inflation but inflation is merely the symptom of a deeper problem and not its cause that problem is not merely the war in ukraine or the pandemic but something that is confirmed by data but denied in press conferences the capitalist system plunged into a long term depression cannot heal itself later this year notebook no 4 on the theory of crisis from tricontinental institute for social research written by marxist economists sungur savran and e ahmet tonak will establish these points very clearly for now capitalist economic theory starts with the assumption that any attempt to settle an economic crisis such as an inflationary crisis must not as john maynard keynes wrote in 1923 disappoint the rentier wealthy bondholders and major capitalist institutions control the policy orientation of the global north so that the value of their money trillions of dollars held by a minority is secure they cannot as keynes wrote nearly a hundred years ago be disappointed the anti inflation policies driven by the u s and the eurozone are not going to ease the burdens on the working class in their countries and certainly not in the debt ridden global south the chairman of the u s federal reserve jerome powell admitted that his monetary policy will cause some pain but not across the entire population more honestly amazon s founder jeff bezos tweeted that inflation is a regressive tax that most hurts the least affluent rising interest rates in the north atlantic make money far more expensive for ordinary people in that region but they also make borrowing in dollars to pay off national debts in the global south virtually impossible raising interest rates and tightening the labor market are direct attacks on the working class and developing nations there is nothing inevitable about the class warfare of the governments of the global north other policies are possible a few of them are listed below tax the global wealthy there are 2 668 billionaires in the world who are worth 12 7 trillion the money they hide in illicit tax havens adds up to about 40 trillion this wealth could be brought into productive social use as oxfam notes the richest 10 men have more wealth than 3 1 billion people 40 percent of the world population tax large corporations whose profits have escalated beyond imagination u s corporate profits are up by 37 percent far ahead of inflation and compensation increases ellen zentner the chief u s economist of the leading financial services company morgan stanley argues that during the long depression there has been an unprecedented plunge in the share of gross domestic product earned by the working class in the united states she has called for a return to a more just profit wages balance use this social wealth to enhance social expenditures such as funds to end hunger and illiteracy and build health care systems as well as non carbon forms of public transportation institute price controls for goods that specifically drive up inflation such as prices for food fertilizers fuel and medicines the great bajan writer george lamming 1927 2022 left us recently in his 1966 essay the west indian people lamming said the architecture of our future is not only unfinished the scaffolding has hardly gone up this was a powerful sentiment from a powerful visionary who hoped that his home in the caribbean the west indies would be shaped into a sovereign region that could relieve its people of great problems this was not to be strangely the imf s georgieva kinova quoted this line in a recent article while making the case for the region to collaborate with the imf it is likely that georgieva kinova and her staff did not read all of lamming s speech for this paragraph is instructive today as it was in 1966 there is i believe a formidable regiment of economists in this hall they teach the statistics of survival they anticipate and warn about the relative price of freedom would just like you to bear in mind the story of an ordinary barbadian working man when he was asked by another west indian whom he had not seen for about 10 years and how are things he

a distillery in new hampshire has come up with a novel way to make a product out of a marine invasive species the notorious green crab the green crab is a voracious predator of native shellfish and it spreads rapidly by means of hull fouling and untreated ballast water it is considered one of the world s worst invasive species and one of the hardest to control especially since it has little commercial value as a fishery it can be found on both coasts of the united states and it is a major threat to shellfish populations particularly soft shelled clams attempts to promote green crab as a food source have had limited success however tamworth distillery a small batch maker in new hampshire has teamed up with the university of new hampshire s green crab project to incorporate this unwanted crustacean into a boutique whiskey the distillery took 90 pounds of locally caught green crab amounting to thousands of tiny individual crabs and boiled them down into a stock along with a dose of spices like paprika mustard seed coriander clove and allspice blended in with an aged bourbon base this mixture provides the flavor for tamworth s new crab trapper whiskey the combination came out like an all natural and sustainable riff on fireball according to tamworth founder steven grasse green crabs are incredibly invasive so one of my goals as a researcher is to try and help create viable fisheries and markets as a solution to help mitigate the problem said gabriela bradt a fisheries specialist with university of new hampshire cooperative extension speaking to food wine this collaboration is a really unique and exciting opportunity to do that
the russian invasion of ukraine has already killed tens of thousands displaced millions and thrown global financial markets into chaos but without serious international action moscow s war will lead to another deepening crisis worldwide hunger both russia and ukraine are major producers and exporters of grain and other agricultural goods the conflict has thoroughly disrupted this trade with potentially disastrous consequences russia has blockaded the black sea ports from which ukraine exports nearly all of its grain combined with the unwillingness of maritime insurers to protect cargoes moving through the war zone the conflict will reduce ukrainian and russian wheat and corn exports moving through the bosporus to a trickle international sanctions on russia have restricted its grain exports and interfered with its capacity to finance these cargoes limiting its ability to raise scarce foreign exchange and costing it foreign buyers the war and the blockades have also led to a surge in commodity prices wheat prices rose from 7 79 per bushel at the end of 2021 to 12 83 per bushel in mid may of 2022 an increase of 64 percent the united nations reported an overall year on year global food price increase from march 2021 to march 2022 of over 30 percent some countries notably china and india have reacted to these price hikes by hoarding food and imposing export controls further inflaming food price instability ukraine and russia account for at least a quarter of global wheat exports and nearly 60 percent of sunflower oil exports but the crisis is wider and deeper than the shortfalls in these commodities global food and energy prices were already rising before the russian invasion as a combination of natural and manmade disasters and pandemic related supply chain disruptions created food insecurity hot spots in more than 20 countries according to the united nations from january 2020 to early 2022 the consumer price index for food increased in the united states by nearly 15 percent and in germany by 14 percent but it rose even more sharply in more vulnerable countries in egypt by more than 21 percent and in lebanon by an astounding 402 percent in 2020 438 percent in 2021 and an annual rate of 374 percent in the first four months of 2022 the knock on effects of the russian invasion now threaten to make basic food staples inaccessible to many people particularly in the global south the united states and its allies responded to russia s invasion with alacrity in supplying ukraine with weapons and intelligence to repel russian forces they now need to muster a similar response in staving off a full blown international food crisis to do so the united states can draw from its own history its world war ii era lend lease programs sent copious amounts of food to sustain the british and soviet war efforts the united states remains the world s largest exporter of agricultural produce and can turn that bounty to good use today working with the world food program wfp the private sector and other partners the united states can save millions of lives and demonstrate leadership on the international stage by delivering food to those who need it the most a precedent for action u s actions during world war ii provide a template for policy today in 1940 the united kingdom stood virtually alone against the nazi onslaught the country had its back to the wall with its foreign reserves drained and almost no capacity to fend off what seemed like an imminent nazi invasion of the british isles in the united states president franklin delano roosevelt straddling the politics of an impending foreign war and domestic isolationism sought a solution that would allow his british ally to be both armed and fed the u s response came in march 1941 the lend lease act a program of assistance that underwrote the british war effort lend lease is remembered largely in terms of the u s provision of ships and military hardware to the united kingdom but it also included food aid the united states sent grain fats and oils vegetables canned meat milk butter dried fruits and nuts to feed the british public and sustain british forces this food amounted to over 13 percent of total lend lease tonnage after hitler attacked the soviet union in june 1941 it also became a leading recipient of lend lease largesse between 1941 and 1945 the soviet union received more than 10 billion of the 50 billion in total u s lend lease assistance equivalent to 162 billion in today s money second only to the huge amount of aid received by the british empire that history should embolden policymakers in washington to address the new global food crisis the world is not short of grain and food but many countries are in dire need of aid and assistance for instance egypt the world s largest importer of wheat was sourcing 80 percent of its grain from russia and ukraine before the war began egypt now faces wheat price increases of between 40 and 50 percent as the egyptian scholar ammar ali notes the price of a loaf of bread defines the bond between people and the state and was the key factor that sparked egypt s 2011 revolution over a quarter of egypt s 89 million people live below the poverty line nearly four million egyptians are extremely poor and cannot meet minimum caloric requirements and egypt is hardly alone in this precariousness afghanistan ethiopia kenya nigeria pakistan south sudan yemen and many other countries in the middle east and north africa are staring into the abyss lend lease to feed the world in may biden signed the ukraine democracy defense lend lease act of 2022 resurrecting the lend lease program to provide arms and weapons to ukraine the act authorized the lease or lending of military equipment to ukraine and other eastern european countries and exempted them from five year limits on the duration of the loans and repayment of the costs incurred by the united states in leasing the equipment but u s officials seem not to have recalled the key role of food in past lend lease programs fully following the historical model would mean making use of the lend lease act to tackle the looming global food crisis the supplemental funding bill accompanying the lend lease package makes general reference to emergency food assistance to people around the world suffering from hunger as a result of the war in ukraine but it offers no specific provisions for how this aid is to be raised and delivered the lend lease shipments would most readily dovetail with existing support to countries currently receiving help through the world food program the wfp provides huge quantities of food as well as technical assistance to 120 countries but is currently chronically underfunded and undersupplied both issues that would be relieved by augmented assistance under the lend lease program this june the wfp announced that it was suspending the food assistance it supplies to 1 7 million people in south sudan owing to a lack of funds the organization is currently funded entirely by voluntary donations with nearly 10 billion raised in 2021 5 2 billion short of what it needed even before the outbreak of war in ukraine the wfp s staff of around 21 800 87 percent of whom are based in the countries the organization serves has an unblemished record of honest dealing and preventing profiteers and corrupt middlemen from siphoning away much needed food specific lend lease aid would flow to nutritional support for mothers and children school food programs and food delivery initiatives in rural areas where children are less likely to attend school the war in ukraine might lead to another deepening crisis worldwide hunger the food would be sourced through normal commercial channels in the united states grain companies large cooperatives and dairy firms and other food processing companies in most cases actual exports would be handled by traditional commercial exporting firms these firms own or lease export facilities are familiar with freight brokerage and insurance issues and in many cases have a history of serving markets in north africa the middle east and other food insecure regions the u s government would pay for the food either under direct appropriations for the ukraine legislation or more likely under the authority of the commodity credit corporation of the u s department of agriculture the ccc has bought surplus commodities for storage food aid and school lunch programs for more than 80 years and has ample budgetary resources that do not require special appropriations it was created in 1933 as part of the first new deal agricultural adjustment legislation and is empowered to engage in precisely this sort of assistance the ccc charter authorizes the sale of agricultural commodities to other government agencies and foreign governments and the donation of food to domestic foreign or international relief agencies such as the wfp the largest volumes of this assistance would be wheat corn and rice with lesser quantities of vegetable oils dairy products and bulk processed fruits and vegetables the u s grain marketing system regularly handles production in excess of 500 million tons per year and exports of 100 million to 150 million tons per year shipments from the united states would need to begin immediately and would likely continue for several years the united states has the capacity to provide this assistance without causing major diversions from other export destinations usaid s bureau of humanitarian assistance procured 697 000 metric tons of u s wheat in 2020 for food assistance representing 47 percent of all commodities purchased by the agency with wheat the largest commodity used in emergency and nonemergency food assistance the u s grains council calculates a metric ton as 36 7 bushels of wheat so that 697 000 metric tons amounts to 25 million bushels equal to less than five percent of the 590 million bushels of u s hard winter wheat or seven percent of the 353 million bushels of soft wheat forecast to be harvested in 2022 over five billion bushels of u s corn are now swallowed up in the making of ethanol equal to 40 percent of the huge u s crop a portion of the corn allocated to making ethanol could easily be diverted to exports extending aid to a hungry world would not add much to u s food prices u s consumers spend less on food as a percentage of household income 8 6 percent last year than do consumers in any other country basic grains contribute only pennies on the dollar to the cost of further processed foods the united states has ample export capacity as the above figures indicate there is also no shortage of the bulk ocean vessels necessary to transport food to the places where it is needed the export market has substantial excess capacity in part because of the war s disruption of normal marketing flows the foreign food assistance that could accompany the lend lease proposal would constitute a relatively small part of the global food trade and therefore can be serviced by the routine practices of that trade staving off a crisis the challenges to democracy and human welfare posed by russia s unprovoked aggression have rallied the united states and many of its allies in a fight for ukraine s freedom the united states the european union and their allies have boldly confronted the challenge to geopolitical stability posed by russia s invasion by providing munitions military intelligence and advanced weaponry sanctions on russian oligarchs and russia s economy are beginning to have a meaningful effect as are policies in europe to reduce dependence on russian gas and oil the 2022 ukraine democracy defense lend lease act must now be expanded to mount a similar response to the global food crisis accelerated by the invasion every effort should be made to avoid the bureaucratic mishandling of food aid and assistance the transport and distribution of this food will benefit from the expertise of people and partners skilled in managing global market fluctuations and instability commodity firms practiced at procurement management logistics and deliveries are accustomed to doing business in collaboration with the wfp and other aid agencies distribution within recipient countries through reliable partners such as the wfp also provides assurance against malfeasance but should be accompanied by oversight and audit by the u s government producing agricultural goods is one of the united states fortes in taking serious actions to prevent a global food crisis the united states can begin to restore the respect and legitimacy it has lost in recent years by demonstrating the tangible good it can do for others

menafn asia times the long and short of it is that while the us and nato can fight a short conflict neither can support a long war because there s insufficient equipment in the now depleted inventory and the timelines to build replacement hardware are long despite a history of having done so before starting in 1939 there is little chance that the us today can put in place a surge capacity or that it any longer knows how to do so if it is even feasible based on those circumstances alone and there are additional compelling reasons the us and nato should be thinking about how to end the war in ukraine rather than sticking with the declared policy of trying to bleed russia let s start by looking back at a time when the united states did know how to plan for surge weapons building capacity ww2 precedent in 1939 the roosevelt administration with congressional support passed the protective mobilization act ultimately this would lead to the creation of a war production board the office of production management and the marshaling of us industry to fight the nazis and japanese in 1941 the president declared an unlimited national emergency giving the administration the power to shift industrial production to military requirements between 1940 and 1945 the us supplied almost two thirds of all war supplies to the allies including the ussr and china and for us forces producing some 297 000 aircraft 193 000 artillery pieces all types and 86 000 tanks light medium and heavy russia faced an altogether more difficult challenge because after nazi germany attacked the ussr in june 1941 much of russia s defense industrial infrastructure was threatened russia evacuated 1 500 factories either to the ural mountains or to soviet central asia even lenin s body was moved from moscow to tyumen 2 500 km from moscow notably stalin tank factory 183 would be moved from kharkiv now a contested city in the ukraine war to the urals rebranded as uralvagonzavod and situated in nizhny tagil the facility had been a railroad car maker so it was suitable for tank manufacturing the tank factory relocation was managed by isaac zaltzman inside a tank factory in the soviet union during world war ii photo wikimedia commons at that factory the soviets produced a massive number of tanks light medium and heavy most notably the t 34 the world s most successful tank design based on the christie tank chassis from the united states altogether the soviets produced almost 78 000 tanks and self propelled guns mounted on tank chassis this is now it is noteworthy that today russia as well as the us and america s nato partners all face supply problems as the war in ukraine grinds on while the us and europe maintain a significant commercial industrial base needed to supply key components for defense equipment russia lacks an in depth civilian manufacturing infrastructure especially in advanced electronics sensors and electro optics the us and europe face a risk because they are increasingly dependent on high tech supplies from asia today there are severe supply bottlenecks shortages and risk dependencies even china which has a huge commercial manufacturing infrastructure faces difficulties in obtaining the most sophisticated integrated circuits manufactured only in taiwan by taiwan semiconductor tsmc procurement of defense goods in the us and europe is episodic not continuous funds are allocated to purchase a certain quantity of defense equipment when the contract is completed and there are no immediate follow on purchases production lines are shut down and second and third tier component suppliers also stop production or they shift to work on other projects and in some cases go out of business this means that if a new order comes in later the supplier network and the production lines will have to be started almost from scratch in addition to the loss of infrastructure for certain types of weapons there is the related loss of skilled factory workers and engineers giving away the stores admiral sir tony radkin who is chief of the uk defense staff says that the industrial capacity to backfill has become a significant issue because of the rate of use of weapons in the ukraine where supply shortages are impacting ukraine s ability to continue fighting speaking to the house of lords international and defense committee radkin said we are then talking in years because you cannot whistle up with modern weapons a quick production line yes you can churn out shells and artillery but even at the not super sophisticated end even at the modest end of an nlaw weapon then that s going to take several years to get back to our original stocks in the recent war legislation to support ukraine congress appropriated an additional 9 billion to replace us war stocks suggesting that the costs of manufacturing and inflation have almost doubled reacquisition costs raytheon got a new resupply contract of 634 million to restock stinger missiles but raytheon pointed out it could not begin to do so before next year a shipment of us made missiles to ukraine photo wion in the us big defense companies such as raytheon and lockheed are facing serious difficulties in resupplying the military the us has already sent more than one third of its war stocks of stinger and javelin missiles to ukraine as the war continues it isn t unreasonable to think that as much as half the war stocks for these weapons will be consumed as the us pushes more and more weapons to ukraine in its proxy war with russia important categories of military supply will be impacted not counting stingers and javelins the us has transferred 18 155mm howitzers with 36 000 rounds of ammunition two harpoon coastal defense systems thousands of night vision sets for ukrainian troops as well as an unknown number of thermal imagers thousands of secure radios 700 switchblade drones 75 000 body armor sets with kevlar helmets chem bio defense equipment and much more congress recently passed and the president signed a 40 billion ukraine supplemental appropriations act which supplies another 14 billion for arms and humanitarian supplies for ukraine 2 big dangers there are two major dangers for the us and nato the first is that there is simply not enough equipment in inventory to keep up the pace of supporting ukraine if the war lasts much longer even with orders for new equipment in the pipeline the pipeline probably can t keep up with demand given the long lead times to produce new weapons if the war spreads beyond ukraine then nato could be faced with a huge challenge of defending a vast territory with few weapons there is no sign that such equipment deficits can be overcome over the next few years even if there is a will to do so some european governments have become woke about defense spending but manufacturing arms in europe is very slow even compared with the very long lead times in the united states supply bottlenecks if they continue will add to the problem the second danger is if fighting breaks out in korea or in a taiwan invasion this could put an almost impossible burden on the us there already are serious military supply shortages for us forces in korea and japan taiwan has been told the us can t supply some weapons including the same howitzers being supplied to ukraine wishful thinking the current us house of representatives version of the annual defense authorization act legislation contains a provision for a critical munitions reserve and proposes establishing a pilot program to keep better tabs on subcontractors involved in production in washington this is what is called an unfunded mandate because without a requirement for industrial mobilization and parallel long term funding the house proposal is just wishful thinking us policymakers appear oblivious of the great risk they face in promoting a proxy war in ukraine that could spread beyond ukraine s borders impacting for example eastern europe or germany or beyond perhaps washington policy makers can take some comfort that russia has wasted huge amounts of equipment and sustained the loss of over 30 000 fighting men there is no doubt russia s lack of commercial industrial infrastructure and bad battle management coupled with tenacious reinforced ukrainian fighters put it in a hole but no one knows how deep right now russia is demonstrating that it has a huge store of heavy artillery and rockets even if its mechanized armor force has been depleted a war that spreads could quickly consume what reserves nato and the us have and a conventional war featuring heavy artillery weapons would devastate europe there is a parallel case of sorts in korea where north korea has heavy artillery well dug in and close to vital urban centers in south korea even though north korea is deficient in high tech weapons other than missiles one more thing in addition if russia is pushed too hard the russian army will start demanding the right to use tactical nuclear weapons which russian politicians are already lobbying to use that gets to the other compelling reason to rethink the bleed russia policy that policy ramps up the risk of general war to an unprecedented high level and increases the risk of the use of weapons of mass destruction

kyiv ukraine ukraine is running out of shells for the majority of its artillery in part because of a clandestine russian campaign of bullying and sabotage over the past eight years including bombings of key munitions depots across eastern europe that officials have linked to moscow according to ukrainian government officials and military analysts fighting in eastern and southern ukraine is now almost exclusively a near constant exchange of artillery and ukraine s shortage of shells has exacerbated what was already a mismatch on the battlefield against a russian military with more weapons russia is firing more than 60 000 shells per day 10 times more than the ukrainians deputy defense minister hanna malyar told the washington post most of ukraine s artillery pieces date back to the soviet union meaning they rely on the same 122mm and 152mm caliber rounds that russia uses but outside of russia very little supply exists in large part because russia spent years targeting ukrainian and other eastern european ammunition storage facilities and suppliers before launching its full scale invasion of ukraine in late february russia has also taken other steps to acquire the ammunition or otherwise prevent its sale to ukraine advertisement even if everyone gives us this ammunition it will still not be enough malyar said adding that ukraine uses more of the 152mm shells than are produced globally in one day howitzers used by nato and the united states fire 105mm and 155mm shells western countries supplied ukraine with plenty of those shells but only a limited number of systems to fire them despite u s and european pledges to send more artillery ukraine still does not have enough to replace its old soviet era equipment entirely with nato standard weaponry a sort of shadow war is taking place for what few 152mm shells are available on the global market a u s citizen helping to broker weapons transfers to ukraine said he recently approached an eastern european country to negotiate a purchase of artillery rounds officials in that country said they couldn t make a deal the man said because the russians had already warned that they would kill them if they sold anything to the ukrainians advertisement the arms broker was interviewed on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly the countries that still have stocks of 152mm rounds are largely former soviet republics many of which are hesitant to sell to ukraine because they maintain close ties with russia some african and middle eastern countries which have received weapons and ammunition from russia over the years also have stocks of those shells a few former warsaw pact countries have the capacity to manufacture the shells but not at the scale and speed ukraine needs on the battlefield the arms broker said he has had to make some weapons transfers appear as if they traveled through an unrelated country to obscure the origin of the purchase in other cases ukraine thought it had a deal done but then a buyer working on behalf of russia swooped in at the last minute and aggressively outbid he said advertisement the united states and britain have also attempted to help ukraine obtain soviet era materiel officials said to offer more security to smaller countries who fear retaliation from russia if they provide the weapons to ukraine directly malyar said that the russians are working very hard to ensure that we can t sign contracts for this and then if we sign a contract to prevent us from getting the shells delivered here russia has long known that in a drawn out war of attrition against ukraine kyiv would risk running out of ammunition military analysts said ukraine knew it was a weakness too but the situation didn t become dire until russian troops and tanks rolled across its northern eastern and southern borders on feb 24 the first round of airstrikes early that morning also targeted ukrainian ammunition stocks advertisement there were some concerns and there were constant discussions that we need to produce the ammunition ourselves said andriy zagorodnyuk a former ukrainian defense minister but even if the ukrainian government started manufacturing the facility would ve been destroyed by russians on day 1 he added in 2014 after russia first invaded ukraine and fueled a separatist war in the country s east members of the elite russian military intelligence unit 29155 sabotaged ammunition stored at depots in the czech republic according to czech authorities share this article share the following year according to bellingcat a britain based investigative organization members of the same unit used a nerve agent to poison a bulgarian weapons executive who told the new york times he had been storing ammunition at the czech facilities and had sold arms to ukraine advertisement russian saboteurs are also suspected of causing four explosions at bulgarian arms depots from 2011 to 2020 according to bulgarian prosecutors who have said moscow was aiming to disrupt supplies to ukraine and georgia russia s military intelligence agency the gru appears to have had a campaign across europe to try to suppress the supply of munitions to ukraine said michael kofman a russian military analyst at virginia based cna they were likely doing it with foresight ukrainian officials suspect russian and separatist saboteurs extended the effort inside ukraine in recent years leading to a series of explosions at ammunition storage facilities blasts in 2017 at two big ukrainian depots which together had stored 221 metric tons of ammunition dealt a massive setback to ukrainian forces sapping them of critical supplies that would be difficult and expensive to replace the secretary of ukraine s national security and defense council at the time oleksandr turchynov said the two blasts in march and september 2017 ruined an enormous amount of ammunition and represented the biggest blow to ukraine s defense capability since the start of the conflict with russia an explosion the following year at a depot in the chernihiv region storing another 88 000 metric tons of ammunition was another setback for the ukrainian arsenal advertisement conventional wars over time come down to who has the equipment the ammunition the manpower kofman said this is why fights with powers like russia are dangerous they are dangerous because even if the russian military performs poorly at the beginning and they often do russia is a country with substantial resources the russian military has long emphasized artillery dating back to the soviet era maintaining substantial reserves of artillery shells as well as production capacity it is unclear how much of its ammunition arsenal russia has spent in the war so far the united states has committed 126 howitzers and provided 260 000 corresponding 155mm artillery rounds to ukraine since the beginning of the biden administration equivalent to the amount of ammunition that russia according to the ukrainian officials is expending in the course of about five days advertisement the u s military focused on fighting counterinsurgency wars in iraq and afghanistan for two decades de emphasizing artillery warfare and using artillery batteries as infantry units in counterinsurgency operations the u s army made headlines in 2018 when it requested to purchase nearly 148 297 rounds for 155mm howitzers in its annual budget up from 16 573 the previous fiscal year as the service refocused on conventional warfare amid tension with russia we have all been reminded of the immense amount of ammunition that would be consumed in extensive high intensity combat said ben hodges former commanding general of the u s army in europe hodges expressed optimism that more of the u s and european artillery systems committed to ukraine are beginning to arrive along with the ammunition needed to operate them and should show impact on the battlefield in the next three to four weeks advertisement we are where we are but i do remain optimistic that this tide is going to turn here in the next weeks hodges said hodges lamented that the ukrainians had not been given more nato standard weaponry in the years leading up to the war it was considered a huge step in 2015 when the obama administration provided the ukrainian military with an tpq 36 counter artillery radars he said noting that even then there were limitations built into the systems the idea of giving them tanks and artillery that was not going to happen hodges said because of this exaggerated fear that somehow what we are doing was going to provoke the russians

the retired investor stock market midterm elections the stock market does not perform well in the year leading up to midterm elections this year s election may just add to the overall woes besetting equities historically the average annual return of the benchmark s p 500 index in the 12 months before the nov 5 election is 0 3 percent versus the historical average of 8 1 percent in non midterm years in 2022 of course with the s p 500 down more than 20 percent those historical numbers look pretty good unfortunately volatility also tends to rise before and after midterm elections but this year is different you might say since we are witnessing the first european war in decades as well as the highest inflation rate in 40 years and let s not forget the continued existence of the coronavirus a pandemic the world has not seen in more than a hundred years while all of this is true it does not contradict the data for more than a century the second year of the four year presidential election cycle has always been the weakest in performance so investors should brace for an even worse year than most consumer sentiment is in the dumps and a growing list of issues political social and economic are plaguing voters the economy is giving off conflicting signals it is still growing although that growth is moderating but right now u s gdp remains strong enough to keep employers hiring and wages rising but for how long two big negatives are posing a growing threat to the economy inflation and the fed s determination to fight it through tighter monetary policy both elements are impacting the wealth effect of american voters higher interest rates are hurting the stock market and with it the average americans retirement portfolios housing prices another bright spot for homeowners are also leveling off as mortgage rates climb the two combine to inflict a general feeling of diminishing wealth among many households we are feeling poorer inflation adds to that feeling at the gas pump and in the supermarket skyrocketing inflation has dramatically increased the cost of living for most voters workers are finding that recent pay raises are not covering the effects of inflation on the family budget what is worse more and more economists are beginning to worry that the fed s monetary tightening will ultimately lead to a recession sometime soon whether this year or next if so the macroeconomic data will likely make that apparent just in time for the lead up into november s mid term elections in 2022 the makeup of the congress and the senate adds even more uncertainty to the midterm equation if we look back at midterm elections since 1934 the president s party has lost at least 30 seats in the house and four seats in the senate there are only three years in history where the president s party gained seats democrats cannot afford to lose any seats in the senate and few seats in the house if they hope to maintain their majority at this point history is against that happening investors tend to dislike uncertainty and like the status quo within their governments the stakes are high if the democrats hold firm in both houses of congress the chance of new legislation and possibly new taxes becomes a higher probability if republicans win one or both houses gridlock becomes the likely result within government in that case investors can expect little in the way of new legislation or downside surprises either way we can be sure that the markets will be anything but calm leading up to nov 5 of course there are a host of social issues which may help determine the outcome however the economy usually takes precedence over all else in voters minds in any case readers can expect that politicians on both sides of the aisle will be sure to add to the market s volatility in the months ahead starting now

sanctions have backfired on those described by vladimir putin as the unfriendly nations it is setting in train a series of events likely to undermine the whole western financial system as prices rise driving interest rates higher and economic activity shrinks these developments alone are leading to contracting bank credit crashing stock markets and sharply higher bond yields last week i wrote about the impact on the banking system and the likely consequences russia china and associated nations who depend upon them for trade and economic development are now moving to protect themselves from what is emerging as a full scale systemic and fiat currency crisis for the dollar and the entire western financial system these developments are hastening the end of the petrodollar era and the dollar s role as a reserve currency a central asian replacement is planned to be a new super currency used for cross border payments based on an index of a basket of commodities and currencies of the participating nations including currencies is a mistake but otherwise the proposition has merit this article explains why and how a properly constructed scheme would work i demonstrate why it could act as a de facto gold standard its designers intend this new trade currency to appeal to other important nations such as saudi arabia into using a commodity linked currency for settling their trade payments replacing the dying petrodollar but its success could prove to be fatal for the fiat dollar and other western currencies with the demise of the dollar the new super currency can be expected to lead eventually to some national currencies adopting gold standards the ending of the petrodollar era put ukraine to one side it s not the major issue we should realise what really matters to us all is the real war which is russia s attempts to banish american hegemony in europe while in the west we have an image of president putin as an evil despot determined to take ukraine back under russian control in a speech at st petersburg s international economic forum this week putin s diagnosis of the west s problems was more to the point than anything you will hear from our own dear leaders joe boris emmanuel olaf et al it is worth citing relevant extracts from the official english translation of putin s speech to highlight his economic understanding of the pickle we in the west have got ourselves into surging inflation in product and commodity markets had become a fact of life long before the events of this year the world has been driven into this situation little by little by many years of irresponsible macroeconomic policies pursued by the g7 countries including uncontrolled emission and accumulation of unsecured debt these processes intensified with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 when supply and demand for goods and services drastically fell on a global scale because they could not or would not devise any other recipes the governments of the leading western economies simply accelerated their money printing machines such a simple way to make up for unprecedented budget deficits i have already cited this figure over the past two years the money supply in the united states has grown by more than 38 percent previously a similar rise took decades but now it grew by 38 percent or 5 9 trillion dollars in two years by comparison only a few countries have a bigger gross domestic product the eu s money supply has also increased dramatically over this period it grew by about 20 percent or 2 5 trillion euros lately i have been hearing more and more about the so called please excuse me i really would not like to do this here even mention my own name in this regard but i cannot help it we all hear about the so called putin inflation in the west when i see this i wonder who they expect would buy this nonsense people who cannot read or write maybe anyone literate enough to read would understand what is actually happening the rising prices accelerating inflation shortages of food and fuel petrol and problems in the energy sector are the result of system wide errors the current us administration and european bureaucracy have made in their economic policies that is where the reasons are and only there putin shows that he has at least a superficial understanding of where the west has erred with its neo keynesian monetary and economic policies while some of the economic and monetary elements in his address can be criticised putin s grasp of these subjects puts him head and shoulders above his opposite numbers in the g7 it is from this disadvantage that the us is trying to impose dollar hegemony on russian interests in the financial and currency war we must consider the geopolitics of the matter not that the west s mainstream media tells it this way but this is the story so far having chased the americans out of asia the last failure being afghanistan russia felt that there was one task remaining to drive the americans out of running western europe dominating the nato alliance and with post brexit britain no longer directly involved in the eu the americans were redoubling their efforts to contain russia and hamper the chinese russian partnership which through the shanghai cooperation organisation sco is turning many of the west s former allies away from america s sphere of influence as well as the oil rich middle east most notable are india and pakistan imran khan led pakistan increasingly closer to china while india notionally in the commonwealth was a longstanding client state of russia for defence purposes and is now a member of the shanghai cooperation organisation sco khan has now been deposed allegedly by american interests which have reinstalled the previous regime china s voracious appetite for commodities has made it the largest donor and influencer in sub saharan africa and central and south america brazil is increasingly involved with the sco as a member of the brics group without many people noticing between the sco brics sub saharan africa and latin america russian chinese soft hegemony can now claim to influence states with well over half the world s population consequently america s hegemony is in decline yes the dollar is still the international currency for pricing commodities and cross border transactions but the eurasian economic union eaeu is designing a new commodity linked currency to be used as a medium of exchange between its members and it is anticipated that this will be extended to all inter sco trade sco trade with non member brics and even with oil exporters in the middle east of particular concern for the americans is the middle east and saudi arabia president biden is due to visit in mid july and having flaunted his human rights credentials over the jamal khashoggi affair he has so far refused to say he is meeting the saudis specifically the saudis say otherwise now that us intelligence has openly blamed khashoggi s brutal death on direct instructions from mohammed bin salman called mbs by nearly everyone on the diplomatic circuit mbs has demonstrated he is ruthless in seizing power his disposal of all opposition from other members of the royal family was straight out of machiavelli s textbook written in admiration of the prince cesare borgia how mbs deals with a weak elderly us president who has all but insulted him will be interesting to say the least let us just say that it is unlikely to go well for the american delegation uppermost in biden s mind is likely to be oil supplies and he will want to extract a promise that saudi arabia will increase its production to save america and her allies from the consequences of their own sanctions against russia it will be an uphill struggle with mbs more drawn sympathetically to vladimir putin getting on well with him mbs runs saudi arabia in a similar fashion to putin s leadership in russia when they high fived each other at the november 2018 g20 meeting the body language strongly suggests that they had a personal agreement between them which was going their way it can only have been about cooperating on matters relating to their combined dominance of global energy markets the global oil markets to get a sense of the body language between them it is well worth watching that incident twice it can be found here at stake is the agreement president nixon made with king faisal in 1973 to sell oil exclusively for dollars tying the kingdom into the american banking system it was an astute move by both parties at the time allowing sheik yamani leading opec to raise the oil price from 3 56 per barrel more than tenfold over the next seven years and to ensure the world needed dollars to pay for it there can be little doubt that when putin pulled the same trick on the eu with respect to oil payments in roubles mbs would have noted the parallel with wry amusement the arabs are not stupid in 2014 i was told by the director of a major swiss refinery that they were recasting gold bars for arab customers from lbma 400 ounces to the chinese one kilo 9999 standard it was the earliest indication i have had that the arab nations in the middle east were thinking their future lay more with china rather than the west and there was no doubt that the chinese had not only deliberately set out to become the largest gold mining nation but they were moving to dominate the global physical market ultimately threatening the lbma standard so good luck to joe biden machiavelli wrote that a prince wins prestige for being a true friend or a true enemy that is for revealing himself without any reservation in favour of one side against another this policy is always more advantageous than neutrality given mbs s track record and his apparent adherence to machiavellian principals the meeting with biden will likely involve some straight talking from mbs s point of view everything is stacked against the americans biden is probably seen by him as a supplicant which is associated with weakness honour face and public standing are what command respect in arab culture which will work against the americans as infidels the americans have laid waste to arab lands but as well as a possible distaste for the americans and their culture mbs will also be considering his position vis à vis the russian and chinese axis which has absorbed into itself iran on russian encouragement iran has the power to harry shipping through the straights of hormuz and though it has not yet made any headlines the houthis on iranian instructions could step up their attacks on shipping in the red sea it would be a natural response to lithuania cutting off transport links to kaliningrad this week in defiance of the treaty agreed between lithuania and russia in 1993 the saudis would have to think very carefully about the possible consequences of siding with the americans in making promises it would not be in their interests to keep it may be too early to say it with strong conviction but the days of the petrodollar will probably be numbered when a viable asian alternative becomes available and the saudis know it replacing the petrodollar the petrodollar s strength has not just been its hegemonic status but the relative weakness of commodity exporters currencies who for example would happily pay indonesian rupiah for their copper exports certainly not the indonesians themselves who would prefer dollars nearly all international accounting is in dollars which means that the easiest decision for any international trader is to simply maintain dollar balances it is for this reason that foreign ownership of dollar financial assets and bank balances now exceeds 33 trillion almost one and a half times us gdp that is a hard act to follow under western sanctions and without access to dollars the russians have said they would be content to trade in national currencies for them accepting even turkish lira probably a worse currency than indonesia s rupiah is preferred to any of the unfriendlies currencies which are currently worthless in russia s hands but this can only be a temporary arrangement consequently the russians are looking for a better solution presumably putin will not want to see the rouble exposed to manipulation by russia s enemies and he will have gamed various scenarios for ending the dollar s hegemonic status or at least undermining its credibility which will have alerted him to potential dangers for russia s currency that being so he won t want to see potentially destabilising balances of roubles accumulate in foreign hands to a statist like putin free markets for his currency are likely to be considered potentially dangerous assuming therefore that russia wishes to maintain at least some exchange controls there are two separate issues there is the currency to replace the dollar required for cross border trade settlements which can be freely converted into roubles by the state and russian commercial interests thereby limiting the build up of foreign owned roubles available on the foreign exchanges and there is that of the domestic rouble itself in common with other asian nations government control over their domestic currencies is unlikely to be sacrificed easily plans for a trade settlement currency are already advancing under the aegis of the eurasian economic union eaeu a project being developed by sergey glazyev glazyev is russia s minister in charge of integration and macroeconomics of the eaeu while planning to do away with dollars for trade settlements has been in the works for some time sanctions by the unfriendlies against russia have brought about a new urgency we know little detail other than which was revealed in an interview glazyev gave recently to a media outlet the cradle the new trade currency will be entirely comprised of credit balances at both central and commercial banks presumably price fixed daily giving conversion rates into local currencies the central banks of participating states can create the new currency by buying in their own currencies from importers and exporters for conversion other than the proposed inclusion of national currencies in the basket it is a practical concept it is probably the reason the kremlin is said to be considering it as an option for backing the rouble in future that idea of a commodity basket for the rouble itself is likely to be abandoned as unnecessary while a successful eaeu trade settlement currency can be extended from eaeu nations to both those in the wider sco and the brics members not in the sco it could also be an acceptable replacement of the petrodollar for oil export payments to the middle east the ambition is for it to become the mechanism for freeing over half the world from dollar hegemony including all nations whose export markets now depend more on asia than the current developed world in october 2020 the original motivation was explained by victor dostov president of the russian electronic money association if i want to transfer money from russia to kazakhstan the payment is made using the dollar first the bank or payment system transfers my roubles to dollars and then transfers them from dollars to tenge there is a double conversion with a high percentage taken as commission by american banks having originally had a practical element to it the motivation for change has now become politically urgent due to western sanctions the problems with glazyev s proposals in his interview with the cradle sergey glazyev described the new trade currency for the eaeu as being comprised of a weighted index of the currencies of participating nations bolstered by up to twenty exchange traded commodities it is the inclusion of currencies which is bound to cause difficulties for example glazyev said china s yuan would not be included due to its inconvertibility and the restricted external access to the chinese capital markets but russia has also introduced strict exchange controls in the wake of western sanctions and one can envisage other member states wanting the freedom to do so as well if they haven t already done so the simple and obvious solution is not to include currencies at all if it is to be used solely for international trade then there is no reason to include them and by not involving them any country simply prepared to exchange its own currency for the new trading unit can join it becomes a simple one page agreement the objective is to bypass the dollar to do that successfully the new trade currency must be a better medium of exchange and store of value than the dollar to encourage the businesses of participating nations to hold deposits in it in preference to the dollar simplicity in its construction and transparency in its composition are key and certainty that its administrators are not going to alter its composition without good reason will be important for anyone considering migrating trade settlements from dollars this rules out weighting commodities in an index as well because it is only the aggregated prices that matter it is clear from the cradle interview that glazyev errs badly in his approach he is muddling a political imperative to conflate domestic currency considerations with those of international trade yet he acknowledges that the nature of the proposed currency should permit participating nations to manage their own currencies as they see fit if that s to be the case then it s a further reason why they are not suited for inclusion it is hardly surprising that introducing national currencies and possibly weighting them based on national gdps as glazyev suggested is making it difficult to come to an agreement glazyev admits planning for this new currency started ten years ago when it could have been done and dusted in an afternoon by someone who knew what he was doing as an excuse politics is lame make a properly considered proposal for a simple clear structure and either nations sign up to it or they don t furthermore glazyev s comment that the use of gold as the price reference is constrained by the inconvenience of its use for payments exposes an appalling lack of knowledge about money gold very rarely circulates as money almost always hoarded as the last and not the first means of payment it is credible substitutes for gold that circulate any fiat currency can be turned into a gold substitute by an issuer prepared to exchange its currency on demand on pre agreed terms glazyev should have known this nevertheless so long as a commodity based currency is used and accumulated only for cross border transactions it can be a practical proposition the appropriateness and durability of a properly constructed supranational currency for trade purposes is our next topic how durable will a commodity based trade currency be the long term success of any currency depends on its stability stability in terms of its purchasing power and acceptability as a medium of exchange values which have been lost in the fiat dollar centric world in the planning of such a currency there are issues to be addressed such a currency is a creature of government and not its users so its users must be satisfied with its properties and credibility for a commodity based currency to operate it must be supplied by participating central banks in return for buying in their own currencies thus an exporter paid in a local currency can convert it immediately into the new super currency or an importer can buy it from its central bank on payment of local currency these transactions can be routed through commercial banks having deposit accounts with their central bank for these transactions to take place require daily or even twice daily fixings indexed in all participating currencies the only transactions involving dollars will be conducted directly with commodity exchanges and suppliers not in the scheme so cannot be settled in the new trade currency for it to be otherwise the us authorities would have to be included in the scheme and the participating members would probably veto that anyway but non american banks prepared to issue and deal in offshore dollar credit and domiciled in a participating nation would be able to do so the most likely candidates for this trade would be the chinese banks and import export banks or divisions of banks established for the purpose currency hedging facilities and associated instruments would probably evolve in secondary markets where there is demand for them and when a commodity exporter seeks settlement in the new trade currency it would be done with reference to the buyer s currency converted by the national central bank at the daily fix into the new trade currency designing the new currency given glazyev s interview with the cradle we cannot say for sure that these issues will be credibly addressed but we can assess the likely success of a commodity based currency which is properly designed it must work as if it is a gold substitute unlike many of their western counterparts eurasian traders and consumers have not forgotten that gold is money and while a pure gold standard would be the simplest and best solution by far the likelihood of a new statist currency succeeding must be measured against the people s preferred money gold russia is the world s largest exporter of energy and given that the eaeu s new monetary committee is run by a senior russian we can expect the oil price to be included in the commodity basket furthermore energy is the most fundamental of all commodities the history of oil prices provides a guide to the challenges to be addressed by its inclusion figure 1 shows the oil price in three major currencies and priced in gold from 1950 in sterling the price of oil has soared 83 times since 1950 in dollars 39 times in euros and before 2000 in relatively stable deutsche marks 15 times if euros in their current form had existed earlier we can be sure that the oil price in euros would have risen far more in gold the price has fallen 30 knowing that sound money is gold and the currencies are backed by nothing more than faith and credit in the issuing governments it is noticeable how nearly all the price volatility is not in oil itself but in the currencies this cuts across the basic understanding that in any economic transaction where a medium of exchange is used all price objectivity should be in the medium of exchange and all price subjectivity is in the goods or services being exchanged for the parties in a transaction even though a seller of goods prefers currency to the goods and the buyer prefers the goods to the currency they can both agree that a dollar is a dollar and any variation in value is confined to the goods investment and industry analysts never question the objectivity of currencies assuming all predicted price changes are in the investment or commodity analysed even technical analysts with their charts fall into this trap readers of this nonsense usually expect to be given price forecasts and the answer is always based on an assessment of expected supply and demand for xyz and never ever couched in these more correct terms we can model the likely changes in supply and demand for xyz but cannot forecast price effect because we don t know how the currency might change over time the origin of price objectivity in the currency and price subjectivity in goods and services stems from the economic theory of marginal pricing formulated by carl menger in the 1870s and subsequently developed by austrian economists being fully exchangeable for gold coin currencies at that time took on the characteristics of money proper and menger s findings describe the relationship between sound money and goods which was valid for currencies on a credible gold standard with the abandonment of all forms of gold backing in 1971 fiat currencies became free to vary in purchasing power while participants in transactions believe the objective subjective relationship under a gold standard is still the case today there is an additional chapter yet to be written on price theory as figure 1 above demonstrates until that is done everyone remains unconsciously wedded to the gold standard s pure objective subjective relationship with respect to fiat currencies but then the general understanding of catallactics the theory of exchange ratios and economics of prices was never that great anyway and has almost vanished following the keynesian revolution the value of one commodity good or service will vary against those of the others depending on relative demand for it therefore under the artificial condition of no change in the quantity of money currency and credit and assuming there is no change in the propensity of the population of consumers and producers in aggregate to retain their available liquidity some prices will rise and others fall even then we still cannot claim as leon walrus of the lausanne school attempted that the whole pricing system equilibrates but there is no doubt that not only do values of commodities vary against each other but a basket of them represented in an index can be expected to be a relative stable measure of purchasing power as experience with the gold price of oil suggests this is why metallic money is fundamentally sound over the millennia gold silver and copper have proved to be the best forms of media of exchange and gold with its durability restricted quantity and the fact that it is not consumed emerged as the preferred money standard in the nineteenth century it is said that its purchasing power for common items in roman times is similar to their equivalents today and this is certainly evident from diocletian s edict on prices issued 1 700 years ago in figure 1 above that the gold price of oil has varied little from 1950 to the current day confirms that the objectivity of prices in gold is a valid argument while measured in fiat currencies it is not we can go further and illustrate the point in other commodities figure 2 shows the end of year prices of copper in dollars and gold that copper has become 70 cheaper in sound money over the last 120 years makes sense while demand has increased it has seen supplies increase as well new deposits have been found and the extraction costs per unit of output have fallen as mining methods and technological improvements have developed these have more than supplied demand for new uses for the metal as a commonly used metal demand for copper is widely acknowledged as a forward indicator of overall economic conditions doctor copper is so named as crude oil is to energy copper is to base metals figure 3 shows prices for scrap iron and steel central to construction and other basic industries since 1934 scrap prices have risen 69 times in dollars but only 32 in gold again the chart confirms that for a key material priced in sound money it is little changed over nearly ninety years we can see from only three key components that a basket of commodities used for determining the exchange rate for a new trade currency will ensure the currency retains its purchasing power over time and can be expected to act as a far better trade or reserve store of value than the fiat dollar it would be the closest equivalent to a gold substitute without the involvement of gold itself if such a currency becomes properly established then irrespective of us monetary policies the dollar is likely to be discarded for trade settlement purposes between the nations in the eaeu the sco brazil as the non asian brics participant and potentially all their commodity and trade counterparties in africa south america and the middle east the strength of such a scheme is that the trade currency would be chosen by its users in preference to the dollar the commodity suppliers manufacturers and import exporters not their governments the american hegemonic practices of leaning on governments and organisations such as opec to only trade in dollars would no longer work but the success of a new trade currency raises a question over the future of the 33 trillion of foreign owned us financial assets and deposit balances if the scheme gets off the ground successfully the impact on the dollar will almost certainly be for foreign interests to unwind these assets substantially to replace them with balances in the new trade currency foreign owned capital would be withdrawn from the us economy in devastating quantities a further question is then raised over the common practice of pricing all commodities in dollars a new trade currency indexed to commodities but whose only exchange value is with currencies of the issuers signed up to participate cannot easily be used to price individual commodities on a continual basis so long as the dollar s credibly exists prices are likely to continue to be set in dollars but the superiority of a properly constructed trade currency can be expected to undermine the dollar s purchasing power to the extent that markets are likely to finally abandon it as an objective means of commodity value the solution is obvious the best medium of exchange for commodity pricing purposes is gold itself even if represented by a credible currency and credit substitute it is hard to conclude otherwise a trade currency based on a basket of goods is in effect a means of reintroducing gold as the money standard in which all commodities are priced it will encourage fiat currencies everywhere to be converted into credible gold substitutes to survive the financial war the endgame this article commenced with the assertion that the real war between russia and the west is financial in nature and it has attempted to explain why nevertheless there are many loose ends to consider perhaps the greatest hurdle putin must overcome and for that matter xi in china is the intellectual corruption of his advisers who have adopted many of the west s economic and monetary fallacies glazyev s poor comprehension of catallactics has been pointed out and in his speech in st petersburg putin referred to economic growth this is not the same as what users of the term growth think it means which is economic progress and is a common error misled by western macroeconomics it is likely that putin s advisers will caution against an exchange rate tied to commodities as being too strong undermining the export trade perhaps it is this error which leads glazyev to attempt to soften the proposed trade currency by including currencies even worse keynesian style economic stimulus is almost certainly believed in by russia s western influenced monetary policymakers the best that can be hoped for is that by planning to introduce a new commodity based international trade currency on the lines described above russian and chinese economic advisers understand it allows them to retain the so called benefits of currency and interest rate economic management for their domestic economies perhaps they will not see that the dollar s destruction by establishing a successful commodity based trade currency will permit gold standards to creep in through the back door it is worth reading in full the official translation of putin s speech which can be found here the prince niccolo machiavelli xxi how a prince must act to win honour the views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author s and do not reflect those of goldmoney unless expressly stated the best of

on june 7 2022 the fourth circuit court of appeals unanimously held that the exceptions to discharge found in section 523 a of the bankruptcy code which ordinarily exclusively apply to individual debtors also apply to small business corporate debtors in chapter 11 bankruptcy under subchapter v if the debtor confirms a cramdown plan in re cleary packaging llc no 21 1981 signals a departure from the trend of lower courts that have considered the issue and places more pressure on subchapter v debtors to confirm consensual plans in the fourth circuit the court s analysis applied principles from chapter 12 case law to reach the result the fourth circuit s decision can be read here background in 2018 mr vincent cleary left his position at cantwell cleary co inc the plaintiff creditor and founded cleary packaging llc the defendant debtor which began competing with the plaintiff creditor plaintiff creditor alleged that mr cleary took with him employees and sensitive customer information and it initiated state court litigation against the defendant debtor and mr cleary for intentional interference with contracts tortious interference with business relations and related claims the plaintiff creditor secured a jury verdict in its favor and an approximately 4 72 million judgment the judgment the defendant debtor thereafter filed a bankruptcy petition under chapter 11 and elected to proceed as a small business debtor under subchapter v in its subchapter v plan the defendant debtor proposed to pay the plaintiff creditor on account of the judgment the aggregate total of only 140 489 77 over the five year term of the plan and to discharge the 4 58 million remainder in response the plaintiff creditor filed an adversary proceeding seeking a declaratory judgment that the judgment is not dischargeable in bankruptcy under bankruptcy code sections 1192 2 and 523 a section 1192 provides that subchapter v debtors with non consensual plans are entitled to a discharge of most of their debts but not among other things any debt of the kind specified in section 523 a section 523 a provides a list of certain types of debts that cannot be discharged by individual debtors in bankruptcy under chapters 7 11 12 and 13 and subchapter v including debts arising from a debtor s willful and malicious injury to another entity or to the property of another entity in the litigation that went to the fourth circuit it was not disputed that the judgment was a debt for willful and malicious injury in line with other bankruptcy courts that have considered the issue the bankruptcy court agreed with the defendant debtor that the exceptions to discharge embodied in section 523 a are not applicable to corporate debtors only to individual debtors and dismissed the adversary proceeding like the other courts the bankruptcy court reasoned that the section 523 a discharge exceptions can only apply to individual debtors because the introductory language of section 523 a reads does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt implying that section 523 a is inapplicable to corporate debtors analysis the fourth circuit disagreed held that 523 a s discharge exceptions apply to corporate debtors with non consensual plans in subchapter v cases and reversed and remanded the bankruptcy court s decision notwithstanding the restrictive language in 523 a s preamble the fourth circuit reasoned that section 1192 2 s reference to debts of the kind specified in section 523 a indicates that congress intended to reference only the list of non dischargeable debts found in 523 a and not the type of debtors to which section 523 a s discharge exceptions apply additionally the fourth circuit reasoned that this interpretation is consistent with that of virtually identical language under chapter 12 which is limited to family farmer and family fisherman debtors like subchapter v s section 1192 2 section 1228 a 2 also provides chapter 12 debtors with a discharge of their debts except in pertinent part any debt of a kind specified in section 523 a like the fourth circuit s reasoning in the present case courts have interpreted the section 523 a discharge exceptions to apply to both individual and corporate chapter 12 debtors notwithstanding section 523 a s introductory language restricting its application to individual debtors according to the fourth circuit if congress did not intend for section 1192 2 to be interpreted the same as section 1228 a 2 has been interpreted congress would not have used virtually identical language takeaways up until now corporate debtors have been able to discharge virtually all debts in chapter 11 cleary products is a substantial disruption for potential subchapter v debtors with debts of the kind listed in section 523 a of the bankruptcy code and for the subchapter v trustees of such debtors whose mission is to facilitate the confirmation of consensual subchapter v plans the decision is a boon for creditors who can allege that they hold such claims the fourth circuit s decision results in an inconsistent and uncertain scope of the discharge for corporate subchapter v debtors that cannot be ascertained until late in the debtors bankruptcy cases section 1192 s incorporation of section 523 a discharge exceptions does not apply to consensual subchapter v plans whether a subchapter v plan is consensual or not turns on class voting which is not set until solicitation of the plan is complete late in a debtor s case and is not determined by the actions of individual creditors if the defendant debtor in cleary products happened to have some other large unsecured creditors that voted in favor of the plan it could have carried the class over the objections of the plaintiff creditor in such case the subchapter v plan would have been consensual and section 523 a s discharge exceptions would not apply on the contrary as was the case in cleary products because the plaintiff creditor s claim was large enough to carry the class the subchapter v plan was non consensual the section 523 a discharge exceptions applied and the corporate defendant debtor could not receive a discharge of the plaintiff creditor s claim the distinction between these two scenarios occurs irrespective of any actions of the defendant debtor or plaintiff creditor and may not be fixed until late in the subchapter v cases this the bankruptcy court reasoned leads to arbitrary results that undermine the equality principles of creditor treatment under the code moreover creditors who can allege they hold claims of the kind listed in section 523 a large enough to control a class will now have little to no motivation to consent to any impaired plan treatment for their claims absent concessions a debtor would not otherwise have to make if a proposed subchapter v plan does not pay the creditors claims in full the creditors can block the consensual confirmation of such plan necessitating the confirmation of a non consensual plan under which their claims are not discharged if they are found in fact to fall under 523 a for now the cleary products decision is only binding on subchapter v cases pending in districts in maryland north and south carolina virginia and west virginia nonetheless as the first circuit level decision on the issue cleary products may be highly persuasive to courts in other districts corporate entities with debts that could be alleged to be of the kind identified in section 523 a of the bankruptcy code that are contemplating a subchapter v filing need to consider this before filing a case potential corporate debtors who are able to file only in a district in the fourth circuit or who are otherwise wary that their potential bankruptcy court may adopt cleary products holding must evaluate whether filing as a subchapter v debtor in lieu of a traditional chapter 11 filing is the prudent choice arentfox schiff s bankruptcy financial restructuring group will continue

training young people for employment it is also discouraging them from being recruited by the terrorists according to nuland the fund has already been approved by the united states congress and the agreement could be signed within the next two months she said cabo delgado a coastal province in mozambique s north was besieged by jihadist terrorists in march 2021 and the insurgency forced the french energy giant total to halt all operations at its natural gas processing plant near the cabo delgado resort town of palma the month after effectively shutting down the regional economy total s natural gas liquefaction plant near palma accounted for the single largest source of foreign investment in africa at 20 billion before it was forced to cease production the jihadist raid on palma was perpetrated by hundreds of terrorists allied with the group al shabaab which is the colloquial name for a mozambique affiliate of the islamic state of iraq and syria isis however mozambique sâ al shabab is distinct from somalia s own terror group which is loyal to al qaeda related â ukrainian president calls for international foreign legion of volunteers to help fight off russian invasion putin raises nuclear weapons readiness that s 140 million for mozambique have you been to new york city lately it s a s hole shroyer said butâ hey let s buildâ mozambique you re gonna be going to mozambique soon biden to implement a 10 year strategy to contain conflicts biden s implementation to contain conflicts in mozambique among other countries is based on a law approved by congress in 2019 establishing that 200 million per year must be allocated to development plans that create long term stability the countries that will benefit from the funds include mozambique haiti libya papua new guinea benin ivory coast ghana guinea and togo a letter made public by the white house also noted that the united states should have a leadership position and be a force for peace and stability with which other governments can work together the same document also said the new strategy represents a reaffirmation of the u s leadership to face current challenges including pandemics the climate crisis and the rise of autocracies that believe democracy cannot thrive in the 21st century these moves by biden also had americans questioning his priorities the 14 million a year to mozambique could be put instead toward improving the u s especially as it is being impacted by the global inflation the u s is giving all of its money away to foreign aid most of which may just end up getting stolen because all the countries that the u s provide foreign aid to never seem to improve related â watch ukrainian soldiers film themselves using phones of dead russian soldiers to call their families and mock them just look at central america look at haiti and now probably mozambique if it s really overrun by radical islamic terrorists â where do you think that money is gonna go folks what do you think is gonna happen in mozambique with that money he asked this is similar to the u s giving 100 billion to ukraine shroyer pointed out you re working five jobs to keep a roof over your head and gas

transmitted by dgap a service of eqs group ag the issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement bp p l c report on payments to governments year ended 31 december 2021 contents introduction 2 basis of preparation 2 payments overview 5 payments by country 6 other sources 28 introduction bp p l c has prepared the following consolidated report report on payments to governments in accordance with the reports on payments to governments regulations 2014 2014 3209 as amended by the reports on payments to governments amendment regulations 2015 2015 1928 the regulations the report also addresses bp p l c s reporting obligations under dtr 4 3a of the financial conduct authority disclosure guidance and transparency rules the basis of preparation section below contains information about the content of the report the types of payments included and the principles that have been applied in preparing the report bp s socioeconomic contribution bp makes a broader socioeconomic contribution to countries in which we operate in addition to the payments that are required to be reported under the regulations we also make payments to governments in connection with parts of our business other than extractive activities for example in relation to the transportation trading manufacture and marketing of oil and gas as well as government payments bp contributes to the economies of the countries in which we operate by providing jobs for employees and contractors purchasing materials from local suppliers and undertaking social investment activities see the other resources section at the end of the report for more information on our socioeconomic contribution and our position on tax and financial transparency bp s position on revenue transparency bp supports transparency in the flow of revenue from oil and gas activities to governments this helps citizens hold public authorities to account for the way they use funds received through taxes and other agreements basis of preparation under the regulations the directors of bp p l c are required to prepare a consolidated report on payments made to governments for each financial year in relation to relevant activities of both bp p l c and any of its subsidiary undertakings included in the consolidated group accounts the term bp is used interchangeably within this report to indicate bp p l c or any subsidiary undertaking within the scope of the report activities within the scope of the report payments made to governments that relate to bp s activities involving the exploration prospection discovery development and extraction of minerals oil natural gas deposits or other materials extractive activities are included in this report payments made to governments that relate to trading export pipelines refining and processing renewables projects and other activities that are not within the scope of extractive activities as defined by the regulations are not included in this report where a payment relates to activities that are reportable under the regulations as well as to activities which are not reportable bp reports the payment in its entirety if it is not possible to disaggregate it government under the regulations a government is defined as any national regional or local authority of a country and includes a department agency or undertaking that is a subsidiary undertaking controlled by such an authority in some countries certain local indigenous organizations fall within this definition of government where this is the case payments made to such organizations have been included in this report where a state owned enterprise undertakes activities outside of its home jurisdiction then it is not considered to be a government cash basis payments are reported on a cash basis meaning that they are reported in the period in which they are paid as opposed to being reported on an accruals basis which would mean that they were reported in the period for which the liabilities arise refunds are also reported in the period they are received by bp and are shown as negative amounts in the report where payments in kind are made to a government they are valued and footnotes are included to help explain the valuation method and any related volumes reporting principles the regulations require payments to be reported where they are made to governments by bp p l c and its subsidiary undertakings in respect of extractive activities in preparing a report the regulations also require the disclosure of payments to reflect the substance of each payment and the relevant activity or project concerned in light of these requirements bp has assessed its reporting obligations to be as follows where bp has made a payment to a government such payment is reported in full whether made in bp s sole capacity or in bp s capacity as the operator of a joint venture payments made to governments in connection with joint ventures are included in the report if and to the extent that bp makes the relevant payment typically such circumstances will arise where bp is the operator of the joint venture payments made by an incorporated joint venture which is not a subsidiary of bp are not included within this report in some instances bp is a partner in unincorporated joint ventures where the role of operator is performed through a non typical operatorship model whereby multiple entities contribute to an unincorporated body which has the role of operator in relation to such joint ventures payments actually made by bp to the government are reported and payments for which bp has direct responsibility to the government but which are paid on its behalf are also reported bp s equity accounted investments for the financial year ended 31 december 2021 such as rosneft pan american energy group and aker bp are not bp subsidiaries and therefore in accordance with the regulations payments made by such entities are not included in this report project definition the regulations require payments to be reported by project as a sub category within a country they define a project as the operational activities which are governed by a single contract licence lease concession or similar legal agreement and form the basis for payment liabilities with a government if these agreements are substantially interconnected then they can be treated as a single project under the regulations substantially interconnected means forming a set of operationally and geographically integrated contracts licences leases or concessions or related agreements with substantially similar terms that are signed with a government giving rise to payment liabilities these agreements may themselves be governed by a single contract joint venture production sharing agreement or other overarching legal agreement factors used to determine whether contracts or licences are operationally and geographically integrated may include their common management framework proximity and use of common infrastructure the number of projects will depend on the contractual arrangements within a country and not necessarily on the scale of activities moreover a project will only appear in this report where relevant payments occurred during the year in relation to that project the regulations acknowledge that for some payments it may not be possible to attribute a payment to a single project and therefore such payments may be reported at the country level corporate income taxes which are typically not levied at a project level are an example of this materiality threshold the regulations require that payments made as a single payment exceeding 86 000 or as part of a series of related payments within a financial year exceeding 86 000 be included in this report reporting currency all payments have been reported in us dollars payments made in currencies other than us dollars are typically translated at the exchange rate at the date of payment payment types the regulations define a payment as an amount paid whether in money or in kind for relevant activities where the payment is of any one of the types listed below production entitlements under production sharing agreements psas the production is shared between the host government and the other parties to the psa the host government typically receives its share or entitlement in kind rather than being paid in cash in this report such production entitlements volumes to the government are reported on a lifting basis i e when the government takes possession of its share of production a market value is applied usually using the valuation method from the relevant psa for joint ventures in which bp is the operator government production entitlements are reported in their entirety in accordance with the notes above where the national oil company noc is also a partner in the joint venture their production entitlement is reported in addition to the government share of production the noc s entitlement as a partner will include both their share of production as investor s return as well as their entitlement for the reimbursement of their costs taxes the report includes taxes levied on income production or profits or withheld from dividends royalties and interest received by bp in addition taxes paid on behalf of bp by the noc out of production entitlements are reported taxes levied on consumption personnel sales procurement contractor s withholding taxes environmental property customs and excise are not reportable under the

john kirby the former pentagon spokesperson told voa s ukrainian service on thursday the united states is focused on making sure that ukraine can continue to defend itself and its sovereignty kirby who recently became the coordinator for strategic communications at the national security council said since russia invaded ukraine on feb 24 the united states has provided nearly 6 billion worth of assistance including military equipment such as himars high mobility artillery rocket systems ukraine determines what operations they re going to conduct and that s their right to the material that they get from the united states now theirs it s ukrainian property and they get to determine how they re going to use it kirby said here is the interview edited for brevity and clarity voa we know that american himars arrived today in ukraine what impact do we expect them to make on a battlefield at this stage national security council spokesperson john kirby the big difference that these himars which stands for high mobility artillery rocket system can make is distance its range it s giving the ukrainians the benefit of farther standoff from russian forces as they continue to fight them every single day which is now a much more concentrated geographic area voa the united states is providing ukraine unprecedented levels of military assistance still some in kyiv and washington are saying it s not enough it s not fast enough do you think the administration is providing enough weapons to ukraine to make a difference on the battlefield kirby all these systems are making a difference even today they re making a difference and the ukrainians will tell you that and it s not just the big systems it s the small arms and ammunition which they re using literally every day in this fight with the russians so it s already making an impact and we re obviously the largest donor of security assistance to ukraine or any other nation around the world almost 6 billion since the beginning of the invasion so it s a lot of material that s going in and the president has made clear that we re committed to continuing that assistance going forward voa should we expect more himars to be sent to ukraine and what is the absolute maximum amount that united states can provide himars and mlrs given its own stocks kirby i do think you ll continue to see systems like himars going in in future deliveries i think that that s very likely i don t want to get ahead of specific announcements here but again the president was very clear with president zelenskyy so once again we re going to help them as much as we can as fast as we can and i ll tell you the material is going in at record speed it s just unprecedented the speed with which security assistance is actually reaching the front lines in ukraine there s literally shipments going in every single day and it s not just from the united states we are the biggest donor but more than 40 other nations around the world are also contributing security assistance in some type of form to ukraine secretary austin just held the most recent ukraine contact group in brussels last week almost 50 nations showed up not just from europe but from around the world to look at ways they can continue to continue to support ukraine and their ability to defend themselves voa can you clarify what weapons the administration is providing to ukraine to defend themselves and to push russia outside ukraine kirby we are really focused on making sure that ukraine can continue to defend itself and its sovereignty its people its territorial integrity and obviously the ukrainians are in this fight they determine what operations they re going to conduct and that s their right the material that they get from the united states is now theirs it s ukrainian property and they get to determine how they re going to use it now obviously we want to see ukraine s sovereignty fully respected we want to see ukraine s territorial integrity fully restored but how that gets determined and it should be determined by mr putin ending this war but mr zelenskyy is going to get to determine what victory looks like voa if ukrainians determined that they want to win this war push russians back to the february 23 lines would you also support that and for them to use the provided weapons to conduct counteroffensives a couple look at destroyed russian tanks installed as a symbol of war in front of st michael cathedral in kyiv ukraine june 23 2022 kirby well ukrainians are already conducting counteroffensives in their own country i mean look at what they ve been doing in the south look at khakiv in the north where the russians almost had the city completely encircled ukrainians pushed them away pushed them back toward the border mr zelinskyy is the commander in chief of his armed forces we respect that he gets to determine how he s going to use those forces and how he s going to define victory our job is to make sure that he has the tools available to him to do that in the most efficient effective way voa is the administration preparing for this war to become a protracted war we hear stoltenberg say that we should expect this war to last for a long time what is the expectation on american side kirby once mr putin decided to concentrate on the donbas you heard american officials say almost from the very beginning that this was the potential that there could be a prolonged fight here in the donbas region we have to remember this is a part of ukraine that the russians and ukrainians have been fighting over literally since 2014 we tend to think of feb 24 as a watershed moment and it was but ukrainian soldiers were dying fighting and dying for their country years before that so this is a part of the country that both armies know well and both are digging in the russians are making incremental but not consistent progress ukrainians are pushing back and it certainly could end up being a prolonged conflict voa july 9 will mark 60 days since president biden signed into law the lend lease act when is the united states planning to use this mechanism and would weapons the united states would be sending through this mechanism be any different from what the united states is sending right now kirby we certainly welcome the support that congress gave with additional authorities to help ukraine defend itself we re still working our way through that particular act and sort of what authorities and capabilities might help us provide ukraine in the meantime we re already continuing to flow a lot of material through drawdown authority just pulling it from our own stocks we have the authorities to do that the president s not been bashful about using that and you re going to continue to see those flow going forward we got a supplemental request of some 40 million from congress just a few weeks ago not all of it for security assistance but a lot of it is and we also have authorities through the ukraine security assistance initiative this is authorities and we just used some last week where the department of defense can go contract for items that go directly to ukraine so there s an awful lot of tools available in the toolbox and we re open minded about using all of them voa there are some reports indicating that american intelligence agencies have less information than they would like about ukrainian operations personnel and equipment losses does this administration see this as an issue in the context of providing military aid for ukraine kirby i d rather not talk about intelligence matters here in an interview i would just tell you that the relationship with the ukrainian armed forces is very very strong and we re talking to them literally almost every single day at various levels all the way up to the secretary of defense and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff down to working staff levels including military to military contact and the idea of those conversations is to help give us a better idea of what ukraine needs in the fight one of the things we didn t talk about was when we talked about aid and how much they re getting and how fast you re getting it is we re doing this in parcels so that deliberately so that we can continue to give them assistance in ways that are relevant to the fight that they re in and the ukrainians have been very honest and open with us about the fight that they re in and what they need and they ve been honest with the rest of the world and so those conversations are going to continue and that s what really matters voa we heard from secretary austin and secretary blinken that they want to see ukraine win that they want to see ukraine prevail is it still the position of the administration kirby of course we want ukraine to succeed on the battlefield and we want them to succeed at the negotiating table if and when it comes to that now obviously we re not at that stage right now but we believe that president zelenskyy is the one who gets to determine what victory looks like i mean it s his country he s the commander in chief and we respect him unlike the russians we respect the decision by the ukrainian voters to elect him into office and we respect his leadership and his responsibilities voa what results is president biden expecting from his visit to europe g 7 group of seven summit nato summit what is the major expectation kirby this is a very exciting trip a year ago when president biden was at the g 7 and he s now attended several nato summits the theme in the past has been look america is back american leadership is back and now i think without getting into specific deliverables ahead of these meetings i can tell you that we re very much looking forward to a theme of now it s american leadership delivering delivering for our allies and partners delivering for the american people producing results that will actually improve our national security help with energy security at home and around the world and also continue to impose costs and consequences on mr putin for this unprovoked war voa russia s envoy in afghanistan said moscow can recognize the taliban government regardless of the american position do you think this kind of move by russia could further worsen the relationship between moscow and washington kirby i think there s enough tension between the united states and russia right now that that we need to continue to focus on what mr putin has done for security across the european continent and quite frankly across the globe russia can speak for themselves in terms of what governments they intend to recognize or not we are not at a stage where we re willing to do that with respect to the taliban what we would ask of any nation in the world certainly any nation bordering afghanistan is to not make decisions that are going to make it less stable and less secure than it is right now for the afghan people voa the white house says biden s upcoming meeting with king salman and prince bin salman will advance national security interests what s the rationale for where the white house decides that national interests trump objections to authoritarian leaders and do you see that anytime in the foreseeable future where the white house might decide it s in national interest to sit down even with putin kirby well the president has spoken to vladimir putin spoke to him before the invasion the president will speak he will meet he will discuss with any leader around the world things that he believes are in the national security interests of the american people that s his job as commander in chief and he takes that responsibility seriously and i would you know go back on some of the critics here i mean the fact that an adherence to values and human rights and civil rights is somehow at odds with a pragmatic foreign policy is just foolishness they go hand in hand they have to go hand in hand and the president has been very clear that our foreign policy
