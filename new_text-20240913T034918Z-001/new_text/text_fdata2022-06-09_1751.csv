an analyst issued a pessimistic note on chipzilla what happened shares of intel intc 1 74 were trading down by 5 25 as of 2 06 p m et wednesday the chip stock fell following the release of a negative note from a citibank analyst that was based on his takeaways from a semiconductor industry conference hosted by bank of america earlier this week apparently the tone of intel s presentation was enough to make the already pessimistic analyst even more cautious about intel stock at least in the near term so what on wednesday morning citi analyst christopher danley wrote that his bear case scenario for intel appeared to be taking shape danley already had a neutral rating on the stock and he did not downgrade it to a sell he also maintained his 45 price target on it what he did though was reduce his revenue and earnings estimates for the company for the quarter and the year citing the cautious tone of chief financial officer david zinsner at the conference in danley s view zinsner s comments indicated that the current quarter is turning out to be more challenging than anticipated and intel had already given conservative guidance on its first quarter earnings call a big part of intel s business involves chips for personal computers sales of which have weakened as people in much of the world try to put the pandemic behind them and as inflation bites into consumer discretionary purchases we re going to go through some choppiness for sure in the near term as everyone else will as well zinsner said at the conference and you know what we ve got to do is kind of keep our heads down and drive the business execute to the plan and things will have a good outcome for us of course while analysts mostly focus on the next quarter and the next 12 months intel is aiming for a larger and longer term turnaround story under new ceo pat gelsinger not only is the company ramping up efforts to catch up to its rivals on leading edge chipmaking but it s also planning to become a foundry that third parties can outsource chip manufacturing to these huge moves won t pay off in the near term but rather over a span of three to five years therefore shareholders may have a while to wait before they can see signs of more tangible progress now what it was curious that one cautious analyst note that was specific to intel seemed to drag down share prices across the entire semiconductor sector while intel used to be a bellwether for the industry that isn t really the case anymore for one thing intel has lost its lead in cutting edge production taiwan semiconductor manufacturing tsm 1 67 surpassed it a few years ago allowing intel s competitors like advanced micro devices amd 1 81 to leap ahead by using tsm s foundry services amd has been gaining market share at intel s expense so it s a bit difficult to distinguish what is really an industrywide issue and what s an intel specific issue when intel gives a negative outlook speaking of taiwan semi that company actually held its annual shareholder meeting tuesday night and management reiterated its outlook for 30 plus growth this year amid a tight market apparently whatever is ailing intel isn t affecting tsm that could either be due to tsm s technological lead its exposure to a broader array of chips or both while sales of pcs and smartphones may be soft this year demand for high performance computing chips and automotive chips is apparently still incredibly strong either way while citibank s note may be bad news for intel i wouldn t necessarily extrapolate it to the rest of the industry therefore wednesday s action may be opening up buying opportunities elsewhere in the chip sector

source usccb after multiple mass shootings in the usa in recent weeks four leading bishops have written a letter to congress expressing their grief over these incomprehensible tragedies and calling on congress to unite in our humanity to stop the massacres of innocent lives archbishop paul s coakley of oklahoma city chairman of the us conference of catholic bishops usccb committee on domestic justice and human development archbishop salvatore j cordileone of san francisco chairman of the committee on laity marriage family life and youth archbishop william e lori of baltimore chairman of the committee on pro life activities and bishop thomas a daly of spokane chairman of the committee on catholic education wrote we urge all members of congress to reflect on the compassion all of you undoubtedly feel in light of these tragic events and be moved to action because of it there is something deeply wrong with a culture where these acts of violence are increasingly common there must be dialogue followed by concrete action to bring about a broader social renewal that addresses all aspects of the crisis including mental health the state of families the valuation of life the influence of entertainment and gaming industries bullying and the availability of firearms they point out it should not be the case that in the united states a person needs character references to apply for a job but not to purchase military style assault weapons we support a total ban on assault weapons and limitations on civilian access to high capacity weapons and ammunition magazines they say we implore you to join the holy father who in his continued expression of grief over the tragedy in texas declared it is time to say no more to the indiscriminate trafficking of weapons the full letter text follows dear senator representative june 3 2022 last week an eighteen year old carrying an ar 15 entered an elementary school and murdered nineteen children and two teachers fourth graders looking forward to their final week of classes some of whom celebrated their place on the honour roll mere hours before were brutally and senselessly massacred this incomprehensible tragedy at uvalde texas comes as we are still grieving the loss of innocent lives in buffalo dallas laguna woods and now tulsa these tragedies can only bring us to one conclusion we must unite in our humanity to stop the massacres of innocent lives in our own sadness and prayerfulness we echo pope francis words that my heart is broken over the massacre at the primary school in texas i pray for the children and adults killed and for their families as we continue to grieve these losses we are reminded of the times the gospels tell us jesus was moved by pity moved by pity jesus fed the hungry matthew 15 32 healed the blind matthew 20 34 and comforted the widow whose only son had died luke 7 13 we urge all members of congress to reflect on the compassion all of you undoubtedly feel in light of these tragic events and be moved to action because of it there is something deeply wrong with a culture where these acts of violence are increasingly common there must be dialogue followed by concrete action to bring about a broader social renewal that addresses all aspects of the crisis including mental health the state of families the valuation of life the influence of entertainment and gaming industries bullying and the availability of firearms among the many steps toward addressing this endemic of violence is the passage of reasonable gun control measures in this we implore you to join the holy father who in his continued expression of grief over the tragedy in texas declared it is time to say no more to the indiscriminate trafficking of weapons although much more work will be necessary to address the root causes of gun violence we encourage you to make two incremental but meaningful improvements in the firearm background check process by voting in favour of the bipartisan background checks act of 2021 h r 8 and the enhanced background checks act of 2021 h r 1446 we have also spoken favourably of extreme risk protection orders and support the passage of the federal extreme risk protection order act of 2021 h r 2377 pope francis has warned many times that we live in a world marked by a globalization of indifference which makes us slowly inured to the suffering of others and closed in on ourselves as he had also said in his address to a joint meeting of the us congress in 2015 here we have to ask ourselves why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society sadly the answer as we all know is simply for money money that is drenched in blood often innocent blood in the ten years since the massacre of children at sandy hook very little has been done by congress to regulate these weapons and prevent another catastrophe we urgently call on members of congress to work together in a bipartisan fashion to make these horrific attacks less likely to happen again for many years the us conference of catholic bishops has supported a number of reasonable measures to address the problem of gun violence and continues to support efforts by the us congress to advance these policies in legislation it should not be the case that in the united states a person needs character references to apply for a job but not to purchase military style assault weapons we support a total ban on assault weapons and limitations on civilian access to high capacity weapons and ammunition magazines data show that limitations on high capacity magazines can reduce the number of people killed in mass shootings by as much at 38 and those injured by as much as 77 we also support measures that control the sale and use of firearms such as universal background checks for all gun purchases we ask that congress pass a federal law to criminalize gun trafficking this is of particular importance since the united states not only suffers from domestic gun violence but is a major international exporter of weapons finally the usccb also supports recent proposals to set a more appropriate minimum age for gun ownership and to ban bump stocks while strengthened gun laws could reduce mass casualty events not even the most effective gun laws by themselves will suffice to address the roots of these violent attacks in our country we need to acknowledge that the weakening of the family poses a threat to the mature growth of individuals the cultivation of community values and the moral progress of cities and countries many of the perpetrators of mass violence in schools have experienced childhood trauma including familial instability and suffering or witnessing physical abuse emotional abuse or substance abuse as we said in our pastoral statement confronting a culture of violence we have to address simultaneously declining family life and the increasing availability of deadly weapons we therefore in addition to seeking for all manner of policies be crafted to encourage cultivation of strong family life call for improved access to and increases in resources for mental health care and earlier interventions we also encourage peacebuilding in our communities through restorative justice models bipartisanship is never more important than when it is required to protect life and end the culture of death we invite you to support these measures and to be part of building up the culture of life that is so needed in our society not just as elected officials but as mothers and fathers grandparents and aunts and uncles of little children or teachers whom you expect to return home safely today sincerely most reverend paul s coakley archbishop of oklahoma city chairman committee on domestic justice and human development most reverend thomas a daly bishop of spokane chairman committee on catholic education most reverend salvatore j cordileone archbishop of san francisco chairman committee on laity

if your current health plan doesn t provide the coverage you need you may want to consider getting supplemental health insurance when shopping for the best rate on a supplemental policy you ll need to consider the premium and the deductible health insurance premiums are the amounts you pay to maintain your health coverage and the deductible is the max amount you ll pay for care before your insurance covers the rest supplemental health insurance plans can vary in cost but the same general rule applies the higher the premium the lower the deductible and vice versa in this article we ll compare the benefits of paying higher premiums vs lower premiums to help you in your search for supplemental health insurance reasons to pay higher premiums you can get a few nice benefits in exchange for paying higher premiums frequent care is more affordable the higher your premiums are the lower deductible you ll have to meet when you need care this often makes higher premium plans suitable for seniors and those with chronic health issues they may also work well for someone who has a procedure coming up soon and needs to see their doctor several times to prepare you may get a tax deduction if self employed self employed people generally get to deduct all the supplemental health insurance premiums they pay if they aren t eligible for insurance through their spouse s employer or their own employer if they also work a job this makes it a little more affordable for self employed people to increase their premiums and get a lower deductible reasons to pay lower premiums lower premiums may cause you to pay more out of pocket if you need care but these plans also work for certain policyholders you don t need care often if you don t have any ongoing health problems you won t need to visit a health provider beyond your yearly physical or an emergency in this case it could make sense to get a plan with lower premiums since there s a lower chance you ll have to meet a high deductible as a result plans with lower premiums tend to suit younger people well many may not face the same health issues that seniors may face and their incomes may be lower which can make these plans a better fit for their budgets you can open a health savings account hsa if your plan qualifies as a high deductible health plan hdhp you may qualify to open a health savings account hsa your hsa contributions are tax deductible up to a certain limit 3 650 for individuals and 7 300 for families in 2022 this number adjusts for inflation each year you can then invest your contributions in stocks and other assets and growth within the account is tax deferred you can also withdraw money tax free if it s used for qualifying medical expenses as defined by the irs that your insurance doesn t cover such as prescription glasses or a wheelchair after age 65 you can use hsa funds on anything without facing the penalty you d pay for nonqualified expenses before age 65 the bottom line determining your supplemental health insurance budget comes down to estimating your risk if you re young and healthy you may not need healthcare beyond your physical and a potential emergency like a broken bone on the other hand perhaps you re older or have an ongoing health issue paying higher premiums to get a lower deductible could be well worth the savings on frequent care all that said you can gain some wiggle room on both by shopping around gathering and comparing several quotes can help you get adequate coverage at the best rate the content herein is provided for general informational purposes and is not provided as tax legal health or financial advice for any person or for anyspecific situation employers employees and other individuals should contact their own advisers about their situations for complete details including availability andcosts of aflac insurance please contact your local aflac agent aflac insurance coverage is underwritten by aflac in new york coverage underwritten by aflac new york aflac wwhq 1932 wynnton road columbus ga 31999 z2200457 exp 5 23 see campaign contact information name michael bertini email job title consultant tags go media

lawmakers are facing mounting pressure to respond to a scourge of mass shootings and gun violence at least nine witnesses will testify wednesday washington house lawmakers voted to raise from 18 to 21 the minimum age to buy semi automatic rifles following a day of poignant testimony from survivors of mass shootings including a fourth grader a mother taking care of her wounded son and parents who lost a 10 year old daughter the house approved raising the age from 18 to 21 as part of a package of gun reform measures that also would clamp down on gun trafficking ban bump stocks and require safe storage of firearms the bill known as the protecting our kids act heads to the senate where it s not expected to pass because republicans have enough votes to block gun legislation the measure passed

various financial services in switzerland europe the middle east africa the americas and asia pacific the company offers private banking and wealth management solutions including advisory investment financial planning succession planning and trust services and financing and lending and multi shore platform solutions credit suisse has a history of business dealings with russian oligarchs or ultra high net worth business leaders possessing significant political influence for example an article published by financial times on february 7 2022 entitled credit suisse securitizes yacht loans to oligarchs and tycoons cited a recent investor presentation for a synthetic securitization deal in which credit suisse sold off 80 million worth of risk related to a 2 billion portfolio of loans backed by assets owned by certain of the bank s ultra high net worth clients the securitization deal which disclosed that in 2017 and 2018 credit suisse experienced 12 defaults on yacht and aircraft loans a third of which were related to u s sanctions against russian oligarchs press reports at the time indicated that russian billionaires oleg deripaska arkady rotenberg and boris rotenberg had to terminate private jet leases with credit suisse in those years beginning in or around october 2021 russia commenced a major military build up near the russo ukrainian border in apparent preparation for an invasion of ukraine although the russian government repeatedly denied it had plans to invade or attack ukraine the u s later released intelligence of russian invasion plans including satellite photographs showing russian troops and equipment near the russo ukrainian border in november 2021 as russia s military buildup on the russo ukrainian border continued the company entered the securitization deal just months later on february 24 2022 russian military forces invaded ukraine in the immediate aftermath of the invasion western governments including among others the u s canada and the european union imposed significant sanctions on russia the sanctions included inter alia measures targeting russia s ultrawealthy oligarchs by denying them access to the global financial system and by in some cases authorizing the seizure of certain of their high value assets located outside of russia barely a week after the commencement of the russian invasion and the retaliatory sanctions imposed by western nations news outlets reported that credit suisse had requested non participating investors who received information about the company s loan portfolio to destroy and permanently erase any confidential information that credit suisse provided to them regarding the securitization deal the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the company s business operations and compliance policies specifically defendants made false and or misleading statements and or failed to disclose that i credit suisse had deficient disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting ii credit suisse s practice of lending money to russian oligarchs subject to u s and international sanctions created a significant risk of violating rules pertaining to those sanctions and future sanctions iii the foregoing conduct subjected the company to an increased risk of heightened regulatory scrutiny and or enforcement actions iv the securitization deal concerned loans that credit suisse made to russian oligarchs previously sanctioned by the u s v the purpose of the securitization deal was to offload the risks associated with these loans and mitigate the impact on credit suisse of sanctions likely to be implemented by western nations in response to russia s invasion of ukraine vi credit suisse s request that non participating investors destroy documents related to the securitization deal was intended to conceal the company s noncompliance with u s and international sanctions in its lending practices vii the foregoing once revealed was likely to subject the company to enhanced regulatory scrutiny and significant reputational harm and viii as a result the company s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times on march 28 2022 the u s house of representatives committee on oversight and reform sent credit suisse a letter asking the company to turn over information and documents about a portfolio of loans backed by yachts and private jets owned by clients potentially including sanctioned russian individuals in the letter house oversight chair carolyn maloney and rep stephen lynch chair of the subcommittee on national security questioned credit suisse s request that hedge funds and other non participating investors destroy documents related to yachts and private jets owned by the bank s clients given the timing of this request and its subject matter the house democrats wrote credit suisse s action raises significant concerns that it may be concealing information about whether participants in the deal may be evading sanctions imposed by the west after russia s invasion of ukraine on this news

with the popularity of crypto assets on the rise there are bound to be gift and estate tax questions when a person transfers crypto assets during life or at death the irs treats crypto assets as property for federal tax purposes stating that eneral principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency notice 2014 21 therefore the same gift and estate tax rules that apply to property transfers of real estate and stocks apply to crypto assets in 2022 at the federal level a person can pass 12 06 million 24 12 million for a married couple with portability to his or her beneficiaries without incurring a gift or estate tax this elevated exemption amount is due to expire at the end of 2025 and revert back to 5 million per person 10 million for a married couple adjusted for inflation on january 1 2026 in massachusetts a person can pass 1 million to his or her beneficiaries without incurring estate tax there is no portability of the estate tax exemption for married couples in the commonwealth there are planning techniques that can minimize estate taxes married couples can set up revocable trusts with credit shelter provisions also gifts made during life grow outside of a person s taxable estate thereby protecting future appreciation from generating estate tax for example a person can gift his or her individual crypto assets to a spousal lifetime access trust slat for the benefit of his or her spouse and descendants the value of the crypto assets upon being gifted to the trust are frozen for transfer tax purposes furthermore if an independent trustee is serving and has the sole discretion to make distributions then the crypto assets held in trust are protected from most creditors of the beneficiaries and the donor the basis of a lifetime gift of a crypto asset is the same as lifetime gifts of other property generally speaking it is usually the donor s adjusted basis in the asset with some nuances the internal revenue code provides a step up in basis on certain assets at death changing the basis of an inherited asset to the fair market value as of the date of the donor s death this step up has the benefit of potentially eliminating capital gains on crypto assets if the date of death value exceeds the donor s adjusted basis the one notable exception is crypto assets held in a traditional ira which do not receive a step up in basis on the participant s death

esg securitisation has the potential to play a key role in achieving sustainable finance objectives in the european union there have been a number of regulatory developments and other advances in this area including the joint consultation paper recently published by the european supervisory authorities regarding the draft regulatory technical standards with respect to certain sustainability disclosures for simple transparent and standardised securitisations esg securitisations there is a strong drive towards sustainable finance in the european union it has been recognised that securitisation could play a significant role in achieving this objective amid increasing investor demand for sustainable investments market participants are considering how to incorporate environmental social and governance esg and sustainability principles in their securitisation transactions in addition rating agencies may take esg factors into account where this has a material impact on their credit analysis the european esg securitisation market is still in its early stages and lags behind that in the united states however there have been a number of sustainable securitisations issued in the european union including green and social residential mortgage backed securitisations rmbs green securitisations backed by commercial mortgages cmbs and auto loans and leases and green synthetic transactions there is as yet no standard approach to sustainability disclosures for securitisation transactions and a range of approaches has been seen in the market to date the international capital market association icma have published various voluntary sets of principles and some transactions have been aligned with the icma green bond principles or the icma social bond principles and also in some cases certification under the climate bonds standard rating agencies and third party verifiers may provide evaluations second party opinions and or certifications based on assessments of esg and sustainability principles and other considerations esg considerations are also increasingly relevant in the context of clos with investors seeking disclosures to facilitate their compliance with certain requirements under the sfdr as defined below eu legislation and other developments in relation to sustainability there are a number of key pieces of eu legislation and other proposals which relate to sustainability while some of these are not directly applicable to securitisation transactions they are nonetheless relevant in the broader context they include the following the non financial reporting directive the non financial reporting directive directive 2014 95 eu nfrd requires disclosure by certain large undertakings of information relating to environmental social and employee matters respect for human rights and anti corruption and bribery matters the application of the disclosure requirements is expected to be expanded to include certain other companies under the proposed corporate sustainability reporting directive csrd the eu taxonomy regulation the eu taxonomy regulation regulation eu 2020 852 of 18 june 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment and amending regulation eu 2019 2088 sets out a classification system in order to assess the extent to which an economic activity is environmentally sustainable under article 3 and sets out certain environmental objectives under article 9 it also contains requirements under article 8 for certain undertakings that are within the scope of the nfrd to disclose information on how and to what extent the activities of such an undertaking are associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable under articles 3 and 9 of the eu taxonomy regulation this has been followed by a delegated regulation commission delegated regulation eu 2021 2178 specifying the content and presentation of such information and the related methodology the taxonomy disclosures delegated regulation in particular certain key performance indicators kpis will need to be reported for banks the main kpi is the green asset ratio gar being the proportion of their assets which are invested in economic activities aligned with the eu taxonomy as a share of their total covered assets as described therein the sustainable finance disclosure regulation the sustainable finance disclosure regulation regulation eu 2019 2088 as amended sfdr requires certain financial market participants and financial advisers to make various sustainability related disclosures including principal adverse impacts pais on sustainability factors it does not apply to securitisation as this is not within the definition of a financial product regulatory technical standards will be put in place by way of a delegated regulation the sfdr rts to provide more details in relation to the required information article 449a of the capital requirements regulation under article 449a of the capital requirements regulation regulation eu no 575 2013 as amended the crr from 28 june 2022 certain large institutions as defined in the crr which have issued securities that are admitted to trading on a regulated market of any eu member state will be required to disclose information on esg risks on an annual basis for the first year and biannually thereafter this has been supplemented by implementing technical standards the eu green bond standard following the publication of a proposal by the european commission the commission a green bond standard is expected to be put in place in the european union the eu green bond standard the objective is to enhance the effectiveness transparency comparability and credibility of the green bond market and to encourage market participants to issue and invest in eu green bonds the eu green bond standard is expected to be available on a voluntary basis and to require the use of proceeds from the bonds to be allocated to projects aligned with the eu taxonomy detailed reporting and verification by a third party which would be supervised by the european securities and markets authority esma the eba report on developing a framework for sustainable securitisation under the eu securitisation regulation regulation eu 2017 2402 as amended the european banking authority the eba was mandated to prepare a report on developing a framework for sustainable securitisation this was published by the eba on 2 march 2022 the eba report this is to be followed by a report by the commission accompanied if appropriate by a legislative proposal the eba report notes that only a limited number of securitisations categorised as sustainable have been issued in the european union it identified the shortage of sustainable assets and the lack of standards and data as particular challenges in the eba report the eba expressed the view that the eu green bond standard should apply to securitisation however it recommended that the eu green bond standard be adjusted in order to apply the use of proceeds approach at the originator level rather than at the level of the securitisation special purpose entity sspe this would require additional disclosures including the gar or similar kpis for non bank financial institutions while the eba considered that there is a rationale for establishing a dedicated framework for sustainable securitisation in addition to the eu green bond standard in the case of green true sale transactions it concluded that it would be premature to establish such a framework at present in the case of synthetic securitisation more time would be needed to assess how this should be reflected in a green framework with respect to social securitisation the eba also considered that it would be premature to establish a dedicated framework at the moment in each of these cases a framework may be developed in the future in addition the eba considered the question of sustainability related disclosures and due diligence for securitisations and concluded that the application of the pai disclosures for simple transparent and standardised sts securitisations backed by residential loans and auto loans and leases as discussed further below should be extended to non sts securitisations in these asset classes it also recommended that there should be mandatory pai disclosures for all securitisations in the medium term once the sustainable securitisation market has matured further and more experience of sustainability related disclosures has been obtained sts disclosure requirements the eu securitisation regulation sets out the criteria for a securitisation to be considered sts among other things this enables certain investors to benefit from improved regulatory capital treatment with respect to asset backed commercial paper abcp and non abcp securitisations while synthetic securitisations were originally excluded from the sts framework it is now also possible for on balance sheet synthetic securitisations to be sts in the eu following the amendments to the eu securitisation regulation which came into force in april 2021 the eu securitisation regulation amendment the sts criteria for non abcp true sale securitisations and on balance sheet synthetic securitisations provide that in the case of securitisations of residential loans or auto loans or leases the originator should publish available information related to the environmental performance of the assets financed by such residential loans auto loans or leases as part of the reporting required under article 7 of the eu securitisation regulation this requirement applies only to these types of asset classes and only to non abcp sts securitisations the eu securitisation regulation amendment added some wording to give originators the option instead of publishing such information on environmental performance to publish available information related to the pais of such assets on sustainability factors the european supervisory authorities the eba esma and the european insurance and occupational pensions authority eiopa together the esas were required to develop through the joint committee of the esas draft regulatory technical standards on the content methodologies and presentation of such information in respect of the sustainability indicators in relation to adverse impacts on the climate and other esg related adverse impacts the draft sustainability rts consultation paper on the draft sustainability rts the esas published a consultation paper on 2 may 2022 with the draft sustainability rts and including a summary of the related background and rationale the esas considered the taxonomy disclosures delegated regulation in preparing the draft sustainability rts and in addition aimed to ensure a high degree of consistency with the sfdr and the sfdr rts below is a summary of some of the key aspects of the draft sustainability rts format of disclosures the consultation paper indicates that in the case of public securitisations disclosure of the relevant information would need to be made available via a securitisation repository however it was decided not to build these disclosures into the existing reporting templates put in place under article 7 of the eu securitisation regulation for the time being although such templates may be revised in the future instead it is proposed that disclosure will initially be achieved by way of a stand alone principal adverse impact statement which would be closely aligned to the template developed for the purposes of the sfdr rts the information would be required to be provided quarterly as part of the information disclosed under article 7 1 a of the eu securitisation regulation residential loans the draft sustainability rts contain mandatory pai indicators for loans backed by residential real estate and are aligned with the draft sfdr rts these are exposures to energy inefficient assets and the proportion of non green exposures i e 100 gar there are also some additional environmental indicators relating to greenhouse gas emissions energy consumption waste resource consumption and biodiversity no indicators have been included with respect to social or governance aspects auto loans and leases in the case of auto loans and leases there are no specific pai indicators in the draft sfdr rts and so the indicators have been drawn from other sources the proposed mandatory indicators relate to greenhouse gas emissions air pollution water waste and material emissions the non green asset ratio and social and employee matters there are some additional environmental indicators and indicators for social and employee respect for human rights anti corruption and anti bribery matters other types of securitisation while the draft sustainability rts are required to cover non abcp sts securitisations of residential loans and auto loans and leases the esas are also of the view that originators should have the option of providing information on the pais on sustainability with respect to securitisations with other underlying exposures consequently the draft sustainability rts set out proposed pai indicators based on the sfdr rts for securitisations of commercial real estate loans although it is worth noting that cmbs transactions are not generally capable of obtaining sts treatment and for corporates including smes although there would be a reduced number of indicators for smes and trade receivables the esas found it difficult to develop pai indicators for securitisations backed by consumer loans and credit cards and so did not include these in the draft sustainability rts next steps for the draft sustainability rts the esas have asked for feedback on the draft sustainability rts via responses to a set of questions the closing date for responses to the consultation is 2 july 2022 market participants will want to consider the extent to which the disclosures will be beneficial as a result of increased standardisation and provision of information to investors but at the same time will want the disclosures to be proportionate and not unduly burdensome on originators both in terms of the amount of information to be provided and the frequency of reporting this is particularly key given the possibility as indicated in the eba report that such disclosures will be extended to non sts transactions and to other asset classes and may become mandatory at some point in the future conclusion the regulatory framework in relation to sustainable securitisation is complex and is still in the process of being developed it seems likely that disclosure of sustainability related information will become increasingly important and that the development and use of standardised principles will become more prevalent furthermore given the increased focus on sustainability and the level of interest in esg securitisations the number of these securitisations is likely to increase sustainable securitisation will certainly be an area to watch

cnn the house voted wednesday 223 204 to pass a wide ranging package of gun control legislation called the protecting our kids act after lawmakers faced intense pressure to act in the wake of recent mass shootings five republicans voted for the bill reps anthony gonzalez of ohio fred upton of michigan brian fitzpatrick of pennsylvania adam kinzinger of illinois and chris jacobs of new york two democrats reps jared golden of maine and kurt schrader of oregon voted against it the measure is not expected to pass the senate however amid widespread gop opposition to stricter gun control a bipartisan group of senators is engaging in talks in an attempt to find common ground on gun policy but it is still unclear what if anything will come of the effort passage of the legislation also took place hours after an emotional hearing on gun violence in which families of victims pleaded for more action the legislation that passed in the house includes a series of individual bills aimed at preventing gun violence the measure would raise the legal age to buy certain semiautomatic centerfire rifles from 18 to 21 years old establish new federal offenses for gun trafficking and for selling large capacity magazines and allow local governments to compensate individuals who surrender such magazines through a buyback program it would create a tax incentive for retail sales of safe storage devices and criminal penalties for breaking new requirements regulating firearm storage on residential premises the measure would also take steps to strengthen existing federal regulations on bump stocks and ghost guns video ad feedback spare me the bulls democratic lawmaker fires back at gop during hearing 02 45 source cnn we are on a crusade for the children and sadly now by the children children testifying in committee house speaker nancy pelosi said during the floor debate in the house chamber referencing robb elementary school fourth grader miah cerrillo who offered videotaped testimony before the house judiciary committee on wednesday morning america has lost more children from gun violence than any other cause does that embarrass you to think that in our country more children have died from gun violence than any other cause these stories are tragically all too common in america today pelosi had requested in a dear colleague letter that her fellow democrats be present in the chamber during the floor debate but only about a quarter of the caucus was present as the debate began house republicans railed against the legislation describing the package as trampling on americans rights here they come going after law abiding citizens second amendment liberties ohio rep jim jordan said the speaker started by saying this bill is about protecting our kids that is important that s what she said protecting our kids is important yes it is but this bill doesn t do it what this bill does is take away second amendment rights god given rights protected by our constitution from law abiding american citizens that s what this legislation does and that s why we should oppose it prior to the debate the house took a procedural vote that also deemed as passed a resolution by democratic rep jamaal bowman of new york condemning the buffalo mass shooting and resolving that the great replacement theory as a white supremacist conspiracy theory and reaffirming the house of representatives commitment to combating white supremacy hatred and racial injustice his resolution also called out many individuals in positions of power and media institutions with widely viewed public platforms who have contributed to the normalization and legitimization of the underlying principles of the great replacement theory when asked why he didn t insist on a separate floor vote on his resolution bowman said that the bottom line for us is that the resolution passes however it comes to the floor it s something that is really important for congress to take a position he said earlier on wednesday during a hearing before the house committee on oversight and reform family of gun violence victims and survivors called for legislative action on guns lawmakers who continuously allow these mass shootings to continue by not passing stricter gun laws should be voted out zeneta everhart mother of zaire goodman a survivor of the buffalo supermarket shooting said in her testimony as an elected official it is your duty to draft legislation that protects zaire and all of the children and citizens in this country
as the house select committee to investigate the january 6th attack on the united states capitol starts public hearings we must ask what motivates those on the committee is the sole concern the ideals of the declaration of independence and the constitution of the united states or is it to get media to attack and undermine political opponents it is indeed possible that infractions of law can be investigated without a carnival platform designed to mobilize media and national attention the public material of the committee already reeks of motivations other than seeking truth the committee has already announced on its website that the jan 6 incident was one of the darkest days of our democracy really against a civil war where some three quarters of a million americans were killed fighting over what american freedom is about one incident of a few hours where law enforcement finally prevailed was one of our darkest days there are just 24 hours in any day so time taken on one matter means attention not given to other matters if these members of congress really cared about our principles of freedom and democracy they wouldn t be ignoring every day other pressing matters in which the freedom of american citizens is blatantly violated take for example that as the jan 6 investigation monopolizes media attention on june 3 the trustees of medicare and social security issued their annual report both systems are bankrupt and in dismal shape financially the cash shortfall of medicare in 2021 was 409 billion projection is that social security will be out of adequate cash flow to meet obligations to retirees by 2035 just 13 years from now the trustees estimate that there are only adequate funds in social security to meet 80 of benefits in 2035 the payroll tax now 12 4 would have to be raised 26 in order to generate sufficient funds to meet those obligations in other words today every working american age 55 and below who plans to collect social security benefits at age 67 is paying a payroll tax into a system that cannot provide the benefits promised can you imagine a private insurance company sending a letter to policy holders saying that in 13 years they will only be able to meet 80 of the payments promised to policy holders the lawsuits would be flying let s forget about the fiscal situation of the system for a minute and whether it is even worth saving this program how about the issue of freedom that our members of congress want us to believe they care about so much take a young citizen age 21 fresh with his or her new degree entering the work force for the first time immediately 12 4 of their paycheck is deducted into a system they involuntarily enter in which there are inadequate funds to meet promised benefits shouldn t this new young worker be able to say no thank you i don t want to participate even if the system were not broken and benefits could be met in our free country shouldn t everyone be free to manage their own retirement according to the committee to unleash prosperity the average return of social security over the last 40 years was 1 over the same period average return on stocks was 6 back to this new young worker by the calculations of the committee to unleash prosperity this single worker if they earned the median national income and were able to invest 10 of their income into a diversified stock and bond portfolio over 40 years instead of paying the payroll tax could have annual income at retirement of 55 143 against 19 646 from social security so hey members of the select committee enough of pretending that you care about american freedom how about wrapping up the carnival and getting down to the real challenges every american faces today copyright 2022 creators com the daily signal publishes a variety of perspectives nothing written here is to be construed as representing the views of the heritage foundation have an opinion about this article to sound off please email letters dailysignal com and we ll consider publishing your edited remarks in our regular we hear you feature remember to include the url or headline of the article plus your name and town and or state
lawmakers are facing mounting pressure to respond to a scourge of mass shootings and gun violence at least nine witnesses will testify wednesday washington house lawmakers voted to raise from 18 to 21 the minimum age to buy semi automatic rifles following a day of poignant testimony from survivors of mass shootings including a fourth grader a mother taking care of her wounded son and parents who lost a 10 year old daughter the house approved raising the age from 18 to 21 as part of a package of gun reform measures that also would clamp down on gun trafficking ban bump stocks and require safe storage of firearms the bill known as the protecting our kids act heads to the senate where it s not expected to pass because republicans have enough votes to block gun legislation the measure passed the house 223 204 largely on a party line vote the vote came after a full and emotional push from advocates even actor matthew mcconaughey who urged congress to tighten the nation s gun laws after

minutes before help arrived and that she s afraid to go to school after surviving a mass shooting i don t want it to happen again when asked if she thinks it will happen again she shook her head up and down and said yes her testimony no matter how stirring is unlikely to move lawmakers from their entrenched positions democrats supporting gun restrictions as a way to prevent mass shooting while most republicans argued that such steps would undermine constitutional protections guaranteed by the second amendment democrats who have majority leadership in the house also want to ban assault weapons boost background checks and pass red flag laws which allow courts to remove firearms from those deemed a threat to themselves or others their bills are expected to hit a roadblock in the

rating from the national rifle association doesn t seem to be an obvious choice to support bipartisan efforts to reforming the nation s gun safety laws but the number of constituents calling her

the house on june 8 voted to pass several bills including the protecting our kids act a democrat sponsored omnibus package of gun control legislation the bill will now head to the senate where it is all but doomed to fail to overcome the 60 vote filibuster threshold the final vote on the bill in the democrat majority chamber was preceded by a series of motions to retain various sections of the legislation each section was ultimately retained and the house voted 223 204 to pass the legislation to the senate five republicans voted for the bill and two democrats voted against it the bills were split into several pieces and confirmed in bipartisan votes the legislation included various previously introduced gun control bills the first of these would ban the sale of any semi automatic centerfire rifle or semi automatic centerfire shotgun that has or has the capacity to accept an ammunition feeding device with a capacity exceeding 5 rounds to citizens below the age of 21 currently anyone 18 and over can buy such a weapon the house voted 228 199 to retain the title 10 republicans joined democrats in supporting the measure 2 democrats voted against their party in electing to strike down the measure the legislation would also codify the department of justice s controversial ban on bump stocks a weapon modification that increases the fire rate of a semi automatic firearm the house voted 233 194 to retain that title including 13 republican votes no democrats voted against it in addition the bill would make it a federal crime to possess weapons that critics have pejoratively labeled ghost guns a term usually describing homemade or 3d printed weapons without a serial number the house voted 220 205 to retain the title including three republican votes in favor and two democrat votes against the title another title of the bill that bans high capacity magazines was passed 220 207 with four republicans voting for the measure and four democrats voting against it democrats have pushed for the package as urgently necessary in the wake of a uvalde texas school shooting that left 19 children and two adults dead it s past time that the congress particularly the senate but the congress act to crush this gun violence epidemic said democrat caucus chairman hakeem jeffries d n y at a june 8 press conference house democrats are gonna respond as we ve typically done with the fierce urgency of now jeffries added protecting our kids what could be more important than that speaker of the house nancy pelosi d calif said in a speech on the house floor supporting the bill everything we do is for the children and we must stop this gun violence in our country pelosi said thoughts and prayers aren t enough congressional progressive caucus chairwoman pramilla jayapal d wash said on twitter ahead of the vote we can never let this happen again by contrast republicans in both chambers of congress have pushed for legislation to address what they say are the root causes of violence including widespread mental health issues that have ravaged young people in the aftermath of covid 19 gop critics of tighter gun control say that the bills put forward by democrats will do nothing to address the root issue and will instead make americans less safe by taking firearms out of the hands of law abiding citizens the protecting our kids act does nothing to address the breakdown of society and family mental health violent crime and school safety in our country said rep andy biggs r ariz in a june 8 twitter post representative of the gop position instead it violates the 2nd amendment rights of millions of law abiding americans our hearts go out to those who have been impacted rep jim jordan r ohio said in a speech opposing the gun control package but the answer is not to destroy the second amendment but that is exactly where the democrats wanna go protecting our kids is important yes jordan continued but this bill doesn t do it rep chip roy r texas also blasted the bill the very children my colleagues say they wish to protect in order to do this democrats in this body are willing to take away citizens god given right yes god given right that was mocked earlier to protect himself or herself or her family or his family from harm the very harm they foster by appeasing lawlessness and importantly from the very tyranny being applied to them to deny that right that is what is at stake the real litmus test for any bill is in the senate where most legislation must overcome a 60 vote filibuster threshold to pass sen john cornyn r texas with minority leader mitch mcconnell s r ky blessing is leading bipartisan negotiations in the upper chamber to find another compromise but the process has been a slow one and cornyn has said that the negotiations will need at least another week to find some agreement still senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y has suggested that the senate will move forward with a vote on this or another bill later this week we have a moral obligation to take action to break this cycle schumer said in a june 8 tweet this senate will vote on gun safety legislation however it remains unclear what any compromise deal in the senate will look like

washington house lawmakers want the army to assess the feasibility of adding autonomy into its fleet of stryker vehicles according to draft legislation from a house armed services committee panel the draft fiscal 2023 national defense authorization act language from the hasc subcommittee on tactical air and land forces would direct the army s top acquisition official to brief hasc on the advisability feasibility and estimated cost of creating a program to develop and prototype stryker vehicles outfitted with autonomous optionally manned or advanced operator assistance systems given the army s commitment to the stryker vehicle and its apparent adaptability to a variety of tactical functions the committee considers this system a likely candidate for research development testing and operational experimentation with installed autonomous and advanced operator assistance systems the committee wrote the legislation markup orders a report that must include performance objectives a plan for testing in relevant environments and scenarios as well as an estimated schedule and cost the concept is not entirely new as the army s tank automotive research development and engineering center demonstrated an autonomous stryker as far back as 2003 at fort bliss according to an army newsletter at the time the army has a number of ongoing ground vehicle autonomy research programs through its major modernization effort the army s ground vehicle system center has an autonomous technology demonstrator called project origin that is informing requirements for the service s robotic combat vehicle signature program that vehicle has fought as part of the opposing force in training center rotations led special operations forces into missions during an exercise earlier this year and is currently in germany for an experiment on european terrain the army is also planning to have autonomous capabilities in its optionally manned fighting vehicle platform a top modernization priority but the hasc subcommittee is pressing for more details from the army on transitioning those programs into acquisition programs the subcommittee draft would direct the army to brief congress on its development and acquisition strategy for autonomous ground vehicles including the planned systems for acquisition projected timeline quality and safety metrics and identification and assessment of any viable commercially available systems given the level of effort the army has made with various classes of autonomous or optionally manned vehicles the committee would like a better understanding of the army s plans if any to transition from developmental projects to acquisition programs the bill s report reads after stingers and javelins sent to ukraine concerns about weapons stockpiles recent shipments of stinger anti aircraft weapons and javelin anti tank weapons to ukraine have caught the attention of lawmakers causing concern among committee members about the industrial base s capacity to replenish those stocks thus the committee directs the army to submit a report on the service s plans to reduce risk to its tactical missile industrial base and supply chain including specific risks to its current stockpiles as well as future options for surging capacity to fill shortfalls in the us and allies anti tank and anti air inventory recent activities in ukraine have increased demand for ground launched short range air defense munitions and ongoing risk of conflict with major state actors raises questions about capacity risk associated with our current stockpiles of anti air and anti tank capability the report notes additionally the committee remains concerned that the army is underestimating risk to its small arms industrial base it specifically calls attention to the service s m240 medium machine gun for which the army didn t request funding in its fy23 budget request the report notes that army has hit its procurement objective for the weapon and its m240 acquisition and sustainment strategy relies on the replacement of individual parts instead of new production the committee wants a wide ranging report detailing the state of the army s small arms industrial base as well as the impact of shutting down older production lines such as those for the m240 the report must specify options to sustain that industrial base through upgrades to older weapons army tow ing the line on missile programs elsewhere in the markup lawmakers say they re worried that the army is creating redundant missile capabilities under its tube launched optically tracked wireless guided tow missile system modernization the service has two emerging requirements for modernizing the tow missile the close combat missile system heavy and multi purpose guided missile that s associated with optionally manned fighting vehicle the committee is concerned that the army may be developing duplicative or redundant combat vehicle missile programs that may be unaffordable and could require a change in the tow missile infrastructure fielded today the committee wrote the committee wants the army submit a report providing details about the requirements close combat missile system heavy and multi purpose guided missile along with schedules and cost estimates it also wants more information on whether the new missile requirements will maintain current tow missile size and any costs associated with modifying current tow launchers the report must include details on using the tow form factor to address other combat requirements such as short range air defense and counter unmanned aerial systems studying gaps in isr augmenting the army s intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities is also top of mind for the lawmakers the report directs the army secretary to submit a report to hasc regarding a plan to develop a program of record to fill gaps in the service s isr capabilities and specifically at high altitudes the army is currently relying on contractor owned contractor operated coco platforms such as the artemis aircraft to reduce the cost burden the artemis aircraft has been particularly active in europe in recent weeks given the ongoing conflict in ukraine it s a strategy the committee is fine with for now the committee encourages the secretary of the army to continue utilizing the coco model for isr requirements in areas of operation of high value at the direction of the geographic combatant commanders while developing an acquisition strategy to meet enduring isr requirements the report notes

damage that has been caused to my son and my community she said school hardening argument republicans on the committee criticized democrats for politicizing a tragedy and argued the schools need to be hardened meaning that they have too many doors and need tighter security the ranking member rep james comer r ky said democrats were pushing a radical left wing agenda by trying to pass gun control legislation republican reps andrew clyde of georgia and clay higgins of louisiana said gun legislation proposed by democrats would infringe on law abiding second amendment users but rep jamie raskin d md said that firearm injuries are now the leading cause of death for children and adolescents will we continue to accept the slaughter of innocents including innocent children as acceptable collateral damage for loyalty to a completely bogus and distorted misreading of the second amendment raskin asked house debates gun control on wednesday night the house passed 223 204 a package of eight bills relating to gun control the protect our kids act raises the age of purchasing semiautomatic rifles from 18 to 21 creates new requirements for storing guns in a home with children prevents gun trafficking requires all firearms to be traceable and closes the loophole on bump stocks devices that increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic weapons among other things rep madeleine dean a pennsylvania democrat challenged republican arguments that regulating guns would violate second amendment rights do these tragedies from guns in the hands of bad actors sound like the well regulated militia explicitly mentioned in the second amendment of course not it s outrageous dean said the package of measures is unlikely to advance to a final vote in the senate where democrats are still trying to strike a deal on passable gun control legislation in an evenly divided senate they will need 10 republicans on board the house is also scheduled on thursday to vote on a bill by georgia democrat lucy mcbath known as a red flag bill red flag laws allow the courts or law enforcement to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who is adjudged to pose a threat to themselves or others senate negotiations extend negotiations continued among senators over gun control legislation that could pass there connecticut sen chris murphy the democrats top negotiator said wednesday morning that he wasn t going to settle for a bill that isn t substantial that isn t really truly meaningful the entire nation is expecting us to put our politics aside and get something done both to save lives but also to give peace of mind to this country that we understand the trauma this nation is going through right now he said murphy said he wanted his colleagues watching the house panel s testimony to try to understand the reality of what it s like when you lose a loved one to gun violence as well as the trauma that these victims go through and how wide ranging the trauma is these communities never recovered from a mass shooting murphy said several republican senators have said that raising the age from 18 to 21 to buy an assault weapon should be considered those senators include lisa murkowski of alaska and joni ernst of iowa according to capitol hill pool reports senate majority leader chuck schumer a new york democrat said wednesday morning on the floor that gun safety negotiators deserve the space they need to produce meaningful results i hope my colleagues continue to make progress toward an effective agreement hopefully by the end of the week schumer said urging gop lawmakers to support a possible agreement between democratic and republican negotiators schumer said the sooner we act the greater chance we have of preventing another senseless mass shooting in america republican sen john cornyn of texas his party s top negotiator on gun safety said wednesday afternoon that he s optimistic congress will be able to enact legislation that can save lives noting lawmakers are making steady progress i m optimistic that we could pass a bill in the senate it can pass the house and it will get a signature by president biden cornyn said it will become the law of the land lawmakers he said are discussing ways to encourage states to upload juvenile records to the national instant criminal background check system the database that gun dealers are supposed to check before selling a firearm this is not about creating new restrictions on law abiding citizens it s about ensuring the system we already have in place works as intended he said cornyn said he believes the ongoing mass shootings throughout the country represent a failure of the mental health system and that the legislation could also address that though he didn t get into specifics i think there s a consensus that criminals and people experiencing severe mental health crises shouldn t have access to guns cornyn said noting that s the goal of the nics system the texas lawmaker said he is optimistic because of the progress lawmakers have made so far that congress will be able to enact legislation that can save lives i sense a feeling of urgency and a desire actually to get things done cornyn said around here if you know people have the will there is a way and i believe there is a collective bipartisan will

miah cerrillo a fourth grader at robb elementary school in uvalde texas and a survivor of the mass shooting there speaks in a video shown at a house oversight and reform committee hearing on gun violence washington the house on wednesday endorsed some of the most aggressive gun control measures taken up on capitol hill in years including raising the minimum age for the purchase of most semiautomatic rifles to 21 and banning high capacity ammunition magazines as washington seeks to mount a tough response to recent high profile mass shootings the 223 to 204 vote took place just hours after a house committee heard searing testimony from a young survivor of the may 24 shooting in uvalde texas as well as the parents of a victim and a pediatrician who responded to the tragedy that left 19 fourth graders and two teachers dead advertisement five republicans joined most democrats in backing the legislation two democrats voted no somewhere out there there is a mom listening to our testimony thinking i can t even imagine their pain not knowing that our reality will one day be hers unless we act now said kimberly rubio the mother of 10 year old lexi rubio who was killed in the attack the house votes however will amount to little more than a political messaging exercise because of firm republican opposition to substantial new gun restrictions that has left hopes for a bipartisan deal that could be signed into law in the hands of a small group of senators who are exploring much more modest changes to federal gun laws those talks continued wednesday in hopes of sealing a deal in the coming days advertisement still democrats said this week s house votes were necessary to show americans that more can be done to prevent not only mass casualty incidents such as the killings last month in buffalo and uvalde but the hundreds of less deadly mass shootings and everyday incidents of gun violence that have long scourged america even if our senate colleagues do not take up these exact bills i will tell you what this process we are going through will absolutely do and why our efforts here are worthwhile this process will unequivocally show where each and every one of us stand in the wake of this unspeakable tragedy said rep jim mcgovern d mass adding that the votes would send a clear message to the senate negotiators republicans attacked the bills as an unserious partisan effort that would infringe on americans constitutional rights at a news conference wednesday republican rep jim jordan of ohio called them an effort to destroy the second amendment advertisement the bill under consideration wednesday jordan said in short tells americans law abiding american citizens when they can buy a firearm what kind of firearm they can get and where and how they have to store it in their own darn home a direct attack on second amendment rights besides the minimum age measure and the ban on high capacity magazines the house legislation passed wednesday includes proposals that would crack down on gun trafficking create new safe storage requirements for gun owners and codify executive orders that ban untraceable ghost guns as well as bump stock devices that allow a semiautomatic rifle to mimic machine gun fire house lawmakers will vote thursday on a separate bill dealing with red flag laws that could allow authorities to keep guns out of the hands of people judged to represent a threat to themselves or their communities the bill combines legislation from rep salud carbajal d calif that would create a federal grant program to encourage states to adopt their own red flag laws with a measure from rep lucy mcbath d ga that would allow federal courts to issue red flag orders which are formally known as extreme risk protection orders advertisement the house last year passed two bills dealing with federal background checks one that would expand their applicability to all commercial sales including gun shows and internet transactions and another that would extend the time frame for completing a check neither has come to a vote in the senate because of gop opposition the senate is exploring a narrower package that could include legislation encouraging states to create red flag systems a modest expansion of background checks to incorporate juvenile records as well as funding for mental health programs and school security improvements sen john cornyn r texas the lead gop negotiator cited steady progress wednesday but he declined to say when a deal might be reached and counseled against artificial deadlines senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y has signaled a desire to accelerate the talks lest the recent shootings fade from public attention advertisement but i sense a feeling of urgency and a desire actually to get things done cornyn said around here if you know people have the will there is a way and i believe there is a collective bipartisan will house speaker nancy pelosi d calif said wednesday she was prayerful about the senate talks and suggested that her chamber stood ready to pass whatever package the negotiators could agree upon hopefully we can make some advancement because for all of us who have met again and again and again with the survivors of gun violence some coming time and again to check up on what s happening others new to that horrible club that none of us wants to be a member of they just want something to happen she said advertisement each of the adults from uvalde who testified wednesday to the house oversight and reform committee asked congress to take action as did zeneta everhart the mother of a young man wounded in the buffalo shooting the hearing featured a videotaped account of the uvalde shooting from survivor miah cerrillo 11 who described wiping her dead classmate s blood on herself to fool the shooter into believing she was dead she asked for security and said i don t want it to happen again asked by an interviewer if she thought it would happen again she nodded advertisement i wish something would change not only for our kids but every single kid in the world because schools are not safe anymore miah s father miguel cerrillo then told the panel something needs to really change rubio the mother whose 10 year old was killed was more direct calling on congress to raise the minimum age for assault weapon purchases repeal gunmakers immunity from product liability lawsuits and approve red flag laws and stronger background checks so was pediatrician roy guerrero who described young bodies pulverized by bullets fired at them decapitated whose flesh had been ripped apart keeping safe from bacteria and brittle bones i can do but making sure our children are safe from guns that s the job of our politicians and leaders he said in this case you are the doctors and our country is the patient we are lying on the operating table riddled with bullets like the children of robb elementary and so many other schools we are bleeding out and you are not there advertisement the testimony came as the justice department on wednesday outlined the review it will conduct of the uvalde massacre officials said the assessment conducted by the office of community oriented policing services will examine policies training communications and tactics as well as the post incident response but will not be a criminal investigation nothing can undo the pain that has been inflicted on the loved ones of the victims the survivors and the entire community of uvalde attorney general merrick garland said but the justice department can and will use its expertise and independence to assess what happened and provide guidance moving forward as the hearing concluded oversight committee chairwoman carolyn maloney d n y said her panel intended to continue an investigation focused on the firearms industry to get to the bottom of how much these companies are profiting from selling weapons of war and how they are marketing these weapons to civilians advertisement maloney said the committee has already gotten troubling written responses from gun manufacturers and said she intended to call their executives to testify it is clear they are reaping enormous profits from assault weapons that are used in mass shootings of innocent civilians she said inside the room and elsewhere around the capitol on wednesday republicans offered sympathies to the victims but no indication that they intended to change their views on gun rights rep andrew s clyde r ga a gun store owner said at the hearing that the tragedies highlight the need for additional school security and condemned democrats for seeking to restrict firearms advertisement while every loss of life is a tragedy no one should weaponize or politicize these abhorrent acts to punish law abiding citizens he said rep richard hudson r n c a leading gun rights supporter among house republicans promoted legislation at a news conference wednesday that would put billions of federal dollars into school security programs but not touch gun laws gop leaders forced a vote on hudson s bill wednesday as an alternative to the democratic gun bill it failed along party lines hudson accused democrats of exploiting these tragedies to advance their radical gun control agenda and criticized pelosi and other leaders for inviting victims to testify and call for measures that cannot pass congress advertisement the bills on the floor this week would have done nothing to stop any of these tragedies and they will never become law he said they re exploiting the pain of these people these children these parents to advance their radical interests and i say shame on them during floor debate rep thomas massie r ky called on officials to quit advertising our schools as soft targets and that these kids are sitting ducks encouraging legislation that would put more armed personnel inside schools and he dismissed the minimum age provision as immoral we re telling 18 19 and 20 year olds you can go die for your country we expect you to defend us but we re not going to give you the tools to defend yourself and your family he said advertisement while those hard line voices dominated the floor debate wednesday another group of house republicans stood on the sideline waiting alongside democrats to see if the senate could produce a passable bill depends what s in it obviously said rep don bacon r neb a moderate but john cornyn i trust him i think he s a good man and he s going to give it a sincere good faith effort to protect the second amendment we

mass shootings are good for gun sales in the days following the horrific massacre of 19 children and two teachers in uvalde texas firearm manufacturers stock prices predictably rose gun owners who have been conditioned to purchase weapons out of fear of not being able to buy more guns tend to run out and buy more weapons in anticipation of coming restrictions that in turn boosts gun profits and stock prices it is a macabre cycle that appears to be fueled by republican led fear based culture wars gun buyers behave in ways that suggest they logically anticipate that lawmakers will respond to a mass shooting by making it harder to buy a gun after all when consumer products are found to be a danger to humans they are often regulated the federal government routinely recalls dangerous products such as a line of children s bunk beds whose defective ladder resulted in the death of a 2 year old child from ohio in that case nearly 40 000 units sold to the public were recalled the us public interest research group has a lengthy list of toys that the federal government has recalled that have posed choking hazards for kids it makes sense to regulate harmful products especially where children s health and safety are concerned the government doesn t sidestep the issue by saying that it was the fault of the child or the parents that a product caused harm instead it acts on the assumption that only safe products should be available for purchase and it punishes the manufacturer but time and again gun owners very rational fears remain unfounded as thousands of children are victims of gun violence each year and yet firearms manufacturers are absolved of blame and weapons of war remain easily available for purchase the uvalde shooter reportedly bought two ar 15 style rifles legally from a federally licensed gun store just days before the massacre and used one of them to end 21 lives a group of pediatricians published a plea in scientific american in response to the uvalde shooting and to the fact that gun violence is now the leading cause of death among young people aged 1 to 19 the doctors wrote we must do better for our children and pointed to the politicization of guns taking priority over public health how else to explain the endless proliferation of deadly killing machines when we won t even tolerate a faulty ladder on a bunk bed it s true that gun sales are big business with millions of firearm sales each year some gun manufacturers with lucrative federal contracts are even using their profits to lobby the government against gun control but the hold that guns have on the nation goes deeper than plain economics it s also true that the national rifle association holds great sway in washington via its political affiliates making large campaign donations to gop politicians like senator ted cruz r tx to ensure inaction on gun control but the nra alone is not driving the tightened grasp on guns at the heart of the matter is how guns have become central to the right wing culture wars in the us today they have become synonymous with freedom or rather with a perverse interpretation of the word they are also associated with defense a word that appears in the name of the manufacturer daniel defense whose rifle was used to kill the uvalde elementary school victims the freedom to defend oneself has become a powerfully compelling cultural idea for a shrinking white population whose paranoia is being stoked incessantly by fox news the republican party and gun manufacturers like daniel defense the gun maker engages in aggressive marketing in one commercial founder marty daniel narrated there are two types of people in the world good people and evil people he continued and just in case evil people get in charge good people need to have the ability to fight back while the language of good versus evil sounds simple and even benign in fact it is often coded language for good white heterosexual guys versus evil black and brown people or lgbtq folks or undocumented immigrants or woke white folks what is often left unanswered is the question of guns offering the freedom to defend oneself from what or from whom it s certainly not wild animals in spite of louisiana senator bill cassidy s recently ludicrous assertion that americans need ar 15 rifles because of feral pigs there is a fear that there are all these criminals out there they re going to break into your house in the middle of the night michael siegel a visiting professor in the department of public health and community medicine at the tufts university school of medicine told me in a recent interview it s a racialized fear he added so convinced are right wing mostly white male gun owners that they need to defend themselves against imagined evil others that in the hours after the uvalde shooting some went as far as speculating that since border patrol had killed the shooter he must have been an illegal alien others were convinced the shooter was a transgender woman the facts about gun ownership and self defense show just how ludicrous the idea of freedom to defend is the polling company gallup found that in 2000 65 percent of americans cited protection against crime as a reason for owning firearms in 2021 that number jumped to 88 percent at the same time violent crime and property crime rates nationwide have dramatically fallen since the 1990s meanwhile studies show that guns are extremely rarely used in self defense and that it is far more common that they are used to commit assaults homicides or suicides or are accidentally discharged this is a charade said siegel of the self defense trope this is not an issue of freedom the republicans who are refusing to support these laws they re not standing up for freedom if parents and children are justifiably afraid of school because of gun violence that s not much of a free society he asserted hollywood also bears some blame using gun violence as a way to raise tension in the plotlines of movies and television shows in what amounts to a massive public relations campaign for gun manufacturers researchers brad bushman and dan romer writing in quartz found that acts of gun violence in pg 13 movies nearly tripled over the 30 years between 1985 the year after the rating was introduced and 2015 excerpted our country is trading

u s lawmakers are calling out the biden administration for its move to not enforce a divestment obligation for federal government entities on blacklisted chinese military firms a decision that s foolish and naive according to one of them under an executive order president joe biden issued in june 2021 u s investors had 365 days to divest their shares in 59 entities linked to the chinese military two days before the june 3 deadline however the treasury department quietly issued new guidance telling u s investors that they wouldn t face punishment for holding on to such securities after the divestment period according to london based law firm herbert smith freehills llp this means that the 365 day divestment window isn t mandatory but rather an authorization to purchase or sell these securities solely for the purpose of divestment such a policy lacks foresight and advances the interest of the chinese communist party ccp to the detriment of the united states according to sen rick scott r fla the administration is foolish and naive to not enforce these restrictions scott s office told the epoch times in a statement instead of protecting americans biden is choosing to placate beijing and globalist business elites who care more about profit than american security senator scott is calling on biden to reverse this short sided decision enforce the law and put american interests first sen marco rubio r fla similarly voiced his frustration what is the point of a required divestment period if it doesn t actually require divestment rubio told the epoch times once again the biden administration has watered down and weakened critical national tools to take on the chinese communist party biden s order signed on june 3 2021 expanded a trump era ban on u s investment in china based firms to address the threat posed by china s military industrial complex and its involvement in advancing military intelligence and security research as well as weapon production i find that the use of chinese surveillance technology outside the prc and the development or use of chinese surveillance technology to facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse constitute unusual and extraordinary threats which have their source in whole or substantial part outside the united states to the national security foreign policy and economy of the united states biden said in a statement at the time a security guard mans his post in front of cnooc global headquarters in beijing in 2007 frederic j brown afp getty images
