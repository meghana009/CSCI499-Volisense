the claim comes from a court ruling on the state s process for flagging noncitizen voters the ruling doesn t allow texas to revoke registrations without notice on nov 8 residents of texas will head to the polls in order to cast their ballots in a number of high profile races including the race for governor incumbent greg abbott a republican is facing off against democratic challenger beto o rourke other seats on the ballot include the lieutenant governor attorney general comptroller land commissioner and agriculture commissioner all of which are four year terms with the voter registration deadline coming up on oct 11 one tiktoker went viral advising texans to check and re check their voter registration status the poster claims a recent court ruling makes it possible for the state to pull the voter registration for anyone the state thinks is a noncitizen if you re in texas you need to check your voter registration every day until voting because of course a texas appeals judge just said they can withhold the list of people they think are noncitizens and shouldn t be able to vote the tiktoker says and they re not telling who s on that list if they think you re a noncitizen they can withhold you and your vote won t count verify viewer kimberly also asked us if it was true the state of texas is revoking people s voter registrations without telling them the question is the state of texas revoking people s voter registrations without telling them the sources the answer no the state of texas is not revoking people s voter registrations without telling them what we found the court ruling the tiktoker mentions dealt with noncitizen voters but it did not allow the state to revoke people s registration without notice before we get into the details of the ruling it s important to understand the state s process for flagging noncitizen voters and who is allowed to vote in the state of texas to vote in texas or any other state election you must be a u s citizen and 18 years of age or older on election day a full list of eligibility requirements is here according to sam taylor a spokesperson with the texas secretary of state which is the state s chief election officer the process to determine eligibility works like this if a person registers to vote then later goes into a texas department of public safety driver license office and indicates he or she is a non u s citizen then the person s registration is flagged to the county voter registrar with whom they are registered the county then sends a notification to the voter via mail that their registration has been flagged for potential non u s citizenship and the person has 30 days to respond to the county voter registrar with proof of u s citizenship if the person does not respond within 30 days the voter registration is canceled however the voter s registration can be reinstated immediately including at the polling place if the voter provides proof of u s citizenship taylor said in an email to verify according to texas election code a person who needs to prove citizenship can provide a certified copy of the voter s birth certificate united states passport or certificate of naturalization to re register to vote if they had their registration stripped texas is required to notify people that have been flagged as noncitizens under the national voter registration act of 1993 nvra which set the guidelines and voter registration requirements across the u s now to explain the details behind the court ruling according to court records earlier this year a coalition of civil rights groups sued the state after it refused to provide the list of more than 11 000 people the state said were identified as noncitizens and were ineligible to vote the goal of the suit was to make sure the state was complying with the nvra and that all the people on that list were actually not eligible to vote the groups asked the secretary of state to provide data about each individual including the date the person registered to vote the date their driver s license was issued and voting history the state denied the request saying releasing the list violated privacy laws in august a district court judge sided with the civil rights groups saying the state had to disclose the records but the appellate court reversed that decision on sept 29 saying the organizations named in the original case didn t have the authority to sue the state in the first place and therefore the state doesn t have to release the list that doesn t mean every voter in texas needs to check their registration status regularly to see if they have been labeled as a non citizen as the tiktoker claimed we can verify the court ruling was about releasing a list not about how the state flags who can and can t register to vote or be registered to vote
washington president joe biden took steps to overhaul u s policy on marijuana on thursday by pardoning thousands of people with federal offenses for simple marijuana possession and initiating a review of how the drug is classified biden said thousands of people with prior federal convictions could be denied employment housing or educational opportunities and his executive action would relieve such collateral consequences biden s move fulfills a campaign promise and is likely to please members in his left leaning political base ahead of the november midterm elections in which the president s fellow democrats are defending control of the house of representatives and senate too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana it s time that we right these wrongs biden said he urged state governors to follow suit advertisement just as no one should be in a federal prison solely due to the possession of marijuana no one should be in a local jail or state prison for that reason either biden said shares of cannabis growers and sellers surged following biden s comments with tilray brands and canopy growth both jumping more than 20 the results of a classification review could have wide ramifications presently the drug falls under the same classification as heroin and lsd and is in a higher classification than fentanyl and methamphetamine the president said if marijuana classification were to ease at the federal level that could allow major stock exchanges to list businesses that are in the cannabis trade and potentially allow foreign companies to begin selling their products in the united states while many states have legalized the medical or recreational use of cannabis the substance remains illegal under u s federal law forcing most major banks to deny their services to cannabis related businesses the issue has forced u s marijuana companies to trade their shares over the counter or by listing in canada with the nasdaq and new york stock exchange prohibited from listing them the president s action drew praise from some members of congress the progressive caucus applauds this action by president biden today to advance criminal and racial justice said representative pramila jayapal who chairs a group of left leaning lawmakers in a statement advertisement biden said he had directed attorney general merrick garland to develop an administrative process to issue certificates of pardon to those who are eligible the justice department will expeditiously administer the president s proclamation which pardons individuals who engaged in simple possession of marijuana restoring political civil and other rights to those convicted of that offense the department said in a statement biden said certain rules needed to stay in place even as regulations around the country loosened finally even as federal and state regulation of marijuana changes important limitations on trafficking marketing and under age sales should stay in place biden said

financial planner john boyd thinks in 10 years time most everyday investors will have at least part of their portfolios in real estate trusts private equity or other sorts of alternative assets what s likely holding them back now is a lack of widespread understanding among advisors of these options as well perhaps their fear of legal consequences over perceived breaches of their fiduciary duties it s anxieties of this sort that a new bill in congress is meant to allay if adopted the retirement savings modernization act would make it clear that 401 k plan sponsors like vanguard and fidelity cannot be held liable merely for recommending or choosing investments such as commodities public and private debt digital assets like cryptocurrencies hedge funds infrastructure private equity real estate and venture capital funds investments of this sort are already legal under the employee retirement income security act adopted in 1974 to govern private pension funds and should the retirement savings modernization act pass any plan sponsor recommending them would still be bound by its fiduciary duties and face consequences for advice not proffered in clients best interests but there would be a shade more legal protection for sponsors that look past more traditional investments like stocks and bonds originally introduced in 1974 mainly as a supplement to employer provided pensions 401 k s have gone on to become the main type of retirement fund relied on by people working in the private sector of the employer respondents to a 2017 survey conducted by the insurance firm willis towers watson 81 said they plan to offer only a defined contribution plan like a 401 k to new hires the investment company institute has reported that 7 3 trillion was held in 401 k s as of june 30 2021 accounting for nearly a fifth of all u s retirement savings some 401 k sponsors have given investors the option to choose alternative investments fidelity announced in april the start of its d igital assets account allowing investments in a fund holding as much as 20 of its assets in bitcoin boyd said that in founding his own firm mdrn wealth in scottsdale arizona one of his biggest goals was to help individual investors find ways to put their money into assets that have mostly been the preserve of large institutions in the past he s not necessarily pushing for cryptocurrency but boyd said virtually all of his clients have some stake in alternative investments primarily non traded real estate investment trusts boyd said alternative assets have provided his clients with a bulwark this year when both stock and bond values have been depressed a time will come soon he said when most investors will want a similar hedge in their 401 k s retail investors are getting wiser boyd said hopefully soon we ll see a day when alternative assets aren t associated with the bogeyman others are skeptical katherine fox the founder of sunnybranch wealth in portland oregon questioned whether most advisors have a deep enough knowledge of alternative assets to be able to make prudent recommendations about them even if they ve already been selected as part of a 401 k plan she would be extremely wary herself of going anywhere near something like cryptocurrencies you still have the fiduciary standard and these investments are complicated and complex fox said they can come with a much higher degree of risk than stocks and bonds the retirement savings modernization act was introduced on sept 29 by three republican lawmakers sens pat toomey of pennsylvania and tim scott of south carolina and rep peter meijer of michigan the main impetus of the proposal is a june 2018 georgetown university report finding that target date funds which are designed to maximize their returns by a certain date and tend to have holdings in alternative assets often outperform standard 401 k s the georgetown researchers found that the use of a sufficiently diversified target date fund can increase a retiree s annual retirement income by 17 on average our legislation will provide the millions of american savers invested in defined contribution plans with the option to enhance their retirement savings through access to the same wide range of alternative assets currently available to savers with defined benefit pension plans toomey said in a statement this reform will open the door to higher returns and a more secure retirement for millions of americans so if the advantages to diversification are so great why aren t 401 k sponsors offering more options according to the georgetown report plan sponsors may be hesitant to implement changes to their programs given the higher perceived fiduciary risks and concerns about possible litigation the legal obligations of plan fiduciaries such as the prudent selection of investment options or a reasonable level of fees have been the subject of a significant number of lawsuits in recent years the retirement savings modernization act s supporters include the small business investors alliance voya financial and the american securities association also among them are the institute for portfolio alternatives and the defined contribution alternatives association lobbying groups that generally push for greater investment options kevin walsh a member of dcalta and a lawyer with expertise in fiduciary compliance said one large goal of the bill is to give investors in defined contribution plans like 401 k s the same options that have long been enjoyed by beneficiaries of defined benefit plans like traditional pensions i think we ve seen arguments that fiduciaries shouldn t do new or complex things walsh said but the fiduciary rule doesn t say certain types of investments should be excluded just because they re difficult to understand according to national association of state retirement administrators data cited in the georgetown report the largest corporate pensions among companies worth more than 2 1 billion had 4 2 of their investments in hedge funds 3 4 in private equity 3 in real estate and 3 6 in other asset classes in 2016 data from the same source showed that public pensions had even more in alternative investments about 25 of the total walsh said he thinks too much has been made of the greenlight the bill would ostensibly give to putting money into cryptocurrencies and other digital assets he said most pension funds and other defined benefit plans instead tend to concentrate their alternative investments in real estate private credit and private equity i think it s pretty wild how much of the attention has been focused on cryptocurrency walsh said the retirement savings modernization act has yet to attract a democratic sponsor that and the relatively little time left in congress s legislative calendar have anya coverman president and ceo of the institute for portfolio alternatives not especially optimistic the legislation will advance this year but that doesn t mean the effort will be abandoned we certainly believe this is about helping people with retirement she said so we hope this will eventually become a bipartisan effort should the retirement savings modernization act or something like it become law it s likely to be greeted in the industry with everything from wild cheers to guarded wariness for every financial advisor like boyd who only wishes 401 k plans would give him more diversified options to recommend there will be plenty of others who will dread the pitfalls these choices bring john bovard founder of incline wealth advisors in cincinnati said he already advises some of his clients to invest in real estate through the blackstone real estate investment trust but rather than through a 401 k this is usually done through a taxable account that ensures any gains will be taxed at the lower capital gains rate than the higher rate for income he said the blackstone trust commonly known as breit has provided a hedge against market turmoil it s up about 9 1 this year while the stock market is down more than 20 still bovard tends to recommend it only to specific investors usually those with a net worth of 1 million or more he said he wonders if the majority of americans most of whom rely heavily on 401 k s for retirement need to be exposed to such complicated products similarly noah damsky a founder of marina wealth advisors in los angeles said he will often advise clients who want to invest in alternative assets to use taxable accounts for that purpose he said he s generally a fan of giving people more choices so i do think something like this could be beneficial to everyday people if it s used correctly he said but there s always that potential for abuse and that it ll end up biting people backers of the retirement savings modernization act are at pains to explain that anyone making recommendations for alternative investments will be bound by the same fiduciary duties as before boyd for his part thinks both advisors and the investing public will come around to embracing alternative investments people need to get over the idea he said that when they hear the word alternative that equals risk

london with much of the world facing unavoidable health energy cost of living and climate challenges progressive political leaders have an opportunity to articulate a meaningful alternative to traditional economic policymaking that requires conveying a bold and coherent vision for how to achieve inclusive and sustainable growth at the uk labour party s annual conference last week party leader keir starmer spelled out his own ambitions to turn britain into a green growth superpower capable of creating new jobs industries and technologies having spoken with the labour party about putting green concerns at the heart of the united kingdom s industrial transformation i am delighted to see starmer channeling the kind of ambition that is needed progressive leaders around the world should take note labour s vision stands in stark contrast to the hackneyed 1980s style package of disastrous trickle down tax cuts policies to reduce worker power even more and enterprise zones that prime minister liz truss s government has just announced while the conservative gamble with fiscal stability has now forced the government to execute a major u turn on the proposed tax cuts for the highest income earners little is being said about the public investments in areas like infrastructure innovation and education needed to drive economic growth on the contrary the tax cuts will increase public debt causing the government to cut the much needed investment unfortunately the absence of bold clear progressive policies has allowed the far right to gain traction across europe not least in italy which is poised to be governed by giorgia meloni s post fascist alliance whenever low income groups suffer as they are now and will continue to do this winter xenophobic parties will exploit their hardship pinning the blame on others as donald trump did to distract from their own weak incoherent or nonexistent policy proposals past policy failures and unmet populist promises represent an opportunity for progressive leaders but to navigate so many economic and political headwinds they will need to think about not only redistribution but also wealth and value creation the goal cannot be just to mitigate the damage from today s shocks progressive arguments against austerity need to move beyond the traditional appeal for shovel ready projects and promote comprehensive economic strategies to deliver a strong sustainable and inclusive recovery the transition to a net zero economy for example must be led by ambitious industrial and innovation missions that transform the entire economy from how we build to what we eat and how we get around this would generate sustainable growth with governments setting the direction and crowding in investment rather than cleaning up the messes left by bad policies and harmful business practices there are five key dimensions to a winning progressive economic policy agenda first it must offer a new narrative about how value is created to replace the old entrenched narrative in which only the private sector plays the leading role and the state merely fixes market failures along the way what is needed is a clear notion of collective investment for the common good with the public sector as investor of first resort not just lender of last resort second a progressive agenda must deliver both a well resourced welfare state and a dynamic innovation state because the two go hand in hand without social services too many people will remain vulnerable and unable to access the basic ingredients for well being and economic participation including education job security and health and without innovation economic growth and solutions to pressing societal problems be it a pandemic climate change or the digital divide will remain out of reach to that end progressives must use current social challenges as focal points for industrial strategy from making school meals healthier tastier and more sustainably sourced to accelerating the pace of innovation in our mobility systems outcomes based procurement can be used to drive innovation in all types of public activities from schools to health and transport and the energy crisis must become an opportunity to reorient growth so that it is both inclusive and sustainable led by green innovation in all industrial sectors including steel and cement third we need a green deal that emphasises the deal as much as the green this means a new social contract both the risks and rewards associated with public investments in the green transition should be socialised it is no accident that profits are growing while investment is not that is simply a reflection of increasing financialisation across the fortune 500 more than 5 trillion has gone toward stock buybacks over the past decade and the majority of private funds go back into finance insurance or real estate governments have many tools dynamic procurement methods grants loans and regulations to drive investment aligned with strategically important goals and to ensure that business profits are reinvested in socially and environmentally beneficial ways for example while the uk government mindlessly lent 683 million to easyjet with no strings attached france made its pandemic era loans to air france and renault conditional on emissions reduction commitments in the united states the new chips and science act which consists of 52 billion in subsidies for domestic semiconductor manufacturers has reassuringly introduced some conditionality and more can be done to ensure that the value created benefits people and the planet fourth new institutional structures are needed to make the most of collective wealth creation given the short termism that is so prevalent in modern finance public banks and other public funding structures including community wealth funds should be leveraged to create a greater store of patient capital with financing going toward those businesses that are willing to invest and innovate progressives should also push for a data commons so that this critical twenty first century resource is owned and governed not only by big tech but also by citizens barcelona mayor ada colau has set an inspiring example by bringing hackers into city government to help improve data governance for the public good progressive governments must invest in their own organisational capabilities and reverse the trend toward ever more outsourcing a practice that even some on the right think has gone too far lastly a progressive economic agenda needs to be inspirational progressive economic policies must be accompanied by citizen engagement to forge a clear link with improvements in people s lives imagine for example if the arts were leveraged today as they were in us president franklin roosevelt s works progress administration unless progressive leaders promote a positive and inclusive narrative about the future they won t win elections but to formulate a winning strategy they first must break clearly with the thinking that has shaped economic policymaking for too long starmer s plan is a welcome step in this direction but such bold commitments will need to be incorporated into a comprehensive inclusive and sustainable economic agenda as the italian left has just learned if progressives fight more among themselves than with their opponents they can hardly complain about the result mariana mazzucato founding director of the ucl institute for innovation and public purpose is chair of the world health organisation s council on the economics of health for

updated october 6 2022 at 5 54 pm et some democrats in congress are furious about opec s decision to cut production by 2 million barrels of oil per day starting next month and are calling to reexamine ties with key oil producers and even withdraw u s military support from saudi arabia and the united arab emirates a trio of house democrats all in competitive reelection contests pennsylvania rep susan wild illinois rep sean casten and new jersey rep tom malinowski called the move a hostile act and a turning point in the relationship between the u s and the two gulf states late wednesday night and introduced legislation to remove u s military support from the two countries malinowski told npr that he believes the move was deliberate to hurt the u s as it supports ukraine in the war the russian invasion and deserves a swift response in an interview thursday he said i just don t see any good reason for us to maintain troops that are there almost solely for the purpose of protecting their oil fields and their security interest it just doesn t make sense to me pool getty images getty images rep tom malinowski d n j is one of several democrats pushing to withdraw u s military support from saudi arabia and the uae following opec decision to cut oil production the move comes weeks before the midterm elections with gas prices rising again malinowski said there s no question that mbs particularly the crown prince of saudi arabia shares putin s worldview more than he shares ours he doesn t appreciate american advocacy for democracy in the world legislation uses u s military support as leverage the new jersey democrat said the bill is an exact copy of a bill that senate republicans pushed when trump was in the white house to give him leverage when the saudis were producing more oil to push the price down to harm u s production he said gop lawmakers at the time were on board and the threat of pulling out military support worked then and he hopes they will support this effort malinowski has spoken with officials at the white house and state department but declined to describe their reaction democrats were divided on whether it was a good idea for president biden to travel to saudi arabia and meet with the leadership over the summer malinowski said i felt that the trip was ill advised i didn t think we d get much from it at the same time i didn t think the saudis would go to these lengths to screw us the number 2 senate democratic leader sen dick durbin tweeted sharp criticism of the saudi royal family saying they have never been a trustworthy ally and it s time for our foreign policy to imagine a world without their alliance according to a recent report from the white house to congress roughly 2 700 u s personnel are deployed to saudi arabia to protect u s interests and protect against hostile action from iran or iranian backed groups there are roughly 2 000 troops in the uae the decision is already having an impact on gas prices which had been trending down in recent weeks according to aaa the national average for regular gasoline rose from 3 831 per gallon to 3 867 just a day later due to tight supply and steady demand with the midterm elections less than 5 weeks away and the country facing record high inflation democrats were already concerned that economic concerns would help fuel the ability of republicans to retake one or both chambers of congress the gop is favored to win a majority in the house of representatives and control of the senate is a jump ball with tight races in a small number of swing states last month an effort pushed by sen joe manchin d w va to include legislation reforming the permitting process for energy projects to a government funding bill was blocked facing bipartisan opposition manchin tweeted that the opec decision called for a renewed effort to find agreement on the issue to decrease american dependence on foreign oil my statement on the agreement by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to cut oil production by 2 million barrels per day pic twitter com sep4n2lcwl senator joe manchin sen_joemanchin october 5 2022 biden looks for alternatives to opec oil on thursday president biden told reporters he was disappointed in the decision by opec and said we re looking at what alternatives we might have asked whether easing sanctions on venezuela was under consideration biden said there s a lot of alternatives we haven t made up our mind yet malinowsi said i find it incredibly distasteful and disturbing that we depend on dictators who hate us for our energy and the way to avoid that was to accelerate a transition to clean energy and get away from relying on places like russia iran venezuela and saudi arabia for the global energy supply biden administration officials have recently discussed ramping up pressure on u s oil companies to increase production specifically for the gap in prices between the wholesale price and the price consumers are paying at the pump other options to offset the decrease in supply would be to tap additional oil from the strategic petroleum reserve or work with european allies to purchase oil at below market prices from russia top house republicans response to opec s announcement focused less on their squeeze and its impact on u s consumers and instead used the news to redouble their criticism of biden s radical climate agenda in a joint statement rep steve scalise r la rep jeff duncan r s c and rep markwayne mullin r okla urged a pivot to a strategy the gop has pushed for years instead of begging foreign countries for oil and raiding our strategic petroleum reserve president biden should reverse his anti american policies and unleash domestic energy production making the united states energy independent again would lower energy costs for americans and reduce our reliance on opec for oil by once again becoming a net exporter of energy the united states can harness its resources to meet not only our needs but also the needs of our allies many democrats maintain that biden has pressed u s oil companies to increase production but they have been resistant and have been reaping profits that have gone to stock buybacks instead of investing in new capacity no quick action on punitive measures any legislative efforts would have to wait until after the election both chambers are in recess with members focused on the final five week stretch until the midterms on nov 8 according to some aides familiar with discussions on the issue lawmakers may push to attach something to the annual defense authorization bill that is expected to be considered in the lame duck session in november for now malinowski acknowledged the bill was a signal to the president about the need to change the posture toward a longtime ally and he would need to sign off on it if the measure made to his desk malinowski added it s unclear how quickly the cuts would go into effect and impact prices at the pump but argued i do think it s important for the president to get ahead of that and to show the saudis the emiratis and the american people that we re not going to stand for this durbin who chairs the senate judiciary committee called for quick passage when congress returns of a bill called the nopec no oil producing and exporting cartels act that measure which cleared the committee with bipartisan support would allow the justice department to bring antitrust lawsuits against members of the oil cartel and clarify that existing laws can t shield foreign countries from charges of illegal price fixing senate majority leader chuck schumer mentioned that bill as one option he is considering bringing up later this fall what saudi arabia did to help putin continue to wage his despicable vicious war against ukraine will long be remembered by americans we are looking at all the legislative tools to best deal with this appalling and deeply cynical action including

strong hedge against inflation according to the u s bureau of labor statistics cpi grew at an annual rate of 8 3 through august 2022 however food prices have continued to outpace the rate of inflation with the overall food segment increasing by 11 4 over that same period and the food at home segment which encompasses the majority of the crops grown on gladstone land s farms growing by 13 5 in addition according to the ncreif farmland index which as of june 30 2022 consisted of over 14 6 billion of farms across the u s the total return on u s farmland including appreciation and income was 9 7 for the 12 months ended june 30 2022 results released quarterly occupancy and cash collections gladstone land s farms continue to be 100 leased and the company has collected approximately 97 7 of year to date base cash rents owed through september 30 2022 the remaining portion of approximately 1 2 million is currently expected to be collected in full by the end of the year lease renewals and upcoming expirations since june 30 2022 the company has renewed or extended six leases on certain of its farms located in arizona california and florida in aggregate these renewals are expected to result in an increase in annual net operating income of approximately 281 000 or 9 8 from that of the prior leases the company does not have any more agricultural leases expiring in 2022 and only has one agricultural lease expiring in the first half of 2023 which makes up less than 0 5 of its total annual lease revenues management currently expects the renewal of this lease to be flat to slightly higher relative to the current lease current debt and increases in interest rates gladstone land currently has approximately 642 7 million of total debt outstanding excluding mandatorily redeemable term preferred stock over 99 8 of these borrowings are at fixed rates and on a weighted average basis the interest rate on these borrowings is fixed at just 3 26 for the next 5 1 years as such

approximately 172 3 million consisting of approximately 45 0 million in cash on hand and approximately 127 3 million of availability under our credit facility with metlife and other undrawn notes or bonds in addition gladstone land currently has certain properties valued at a total of approximately 104 8 million that are unencumbered and eligible to be pledged as collateral hurricane ian representatives from gladstone land have spoken with its tenant partners across the state of florida while the company is still assessing the overall impact of the hurricane early reports indicate only minor damage to a couple of farm related buildings and irrigation systems all of which is covered by insurance some farmers also reported delayed plantings for certain crops and crop loss in some fields due to the amount of surface water produced by hurricane ian however the company does not currently anticipate these delays to cause any interruption in rental payments the company notes that its two citrus groves in st lucie county the only permanent crop farms it owns in the state made it through the storm without any notable damage to the trees gladstone land is grateful to have come out relatively unscathed given the strength of this historic storm and continues to keep those in mind who were negatively impacted as a result of the hurricane western drought the drought in the west continues to persist and many farmers are in need of more rain and a strong snowpack this winter to maintain optimal yields on their farms including certain of our tenants but at this time none of the company s farms are impaired as a result of the drought the company continues to see increasing demand for farmland by growers in certain markets resulting in upward pressure on rental rates in addition values of farmland with poor water resources are generally trending down while farmland with good water access is showing a sharp increase in value hence gladstone land s continued efforts to increase the amount of water availability on its farms the company continues to work on projects to enhance the water security of its western portfolio including but not limited to additional water purchases installation of new pipelines and improvements to existing irrigation systems critically dry cycles like the one the west is currently experiencing is why the company purchased 45 000 acre feet equal to approximately 14 7 billion gallons of banked water last year none of which has been used to date and continues to look at other opportunities to acquire additional water comments from david gladstone farmland investments are often viewed as a vehicle to hedge against certain negative macroeconomic factors of both high inflation and recessionary concerns we believe our portfolio of farmland holdings is poised to benefit from continued high inflation as inflation typically puts upward pressure on both land values and rental rates thus increasing the value of our portfolio and its income stream crop pricing is also expected to see inflationary increases over time which will benefit our tenants profit margins as well as lead to higher participation rents for us outside of the almond market most crops grown on our properties are seeing strong demand and increasing prices that are mostly outpacing the cost increases of growing these crops as the probability of a recession looks more likely we expect demand for food and crop pricing to stay strong with some sectors experiencing exceptionally strong increases as an overall asset class farmland investments have

updated october 6 2022 at 5 54 pm et some democrats in congress are furious about opec s decision to cut production by 2 million barrels of oil per day starting next month and are calling to reexamine ties with key oil producers and even withdraw u s military support from saudi arabia and the united arab emirates a trio of house democrats all in competitive reelection contests pennsylvania rep susan wild illinois rep sean casten and new jersey rep tom malinowski called the move a hostile act and a turning point in the relationship between the u s and the two gulf states late wednesday night and introduced legislation to remove u s military support from the two countries malinowski told npr that he believes the move was deliberate to hurt the u s as it supports ukraine in the war the russian invasion and deserves a swift response in an interview thursday he said i just don t see any good reason for us to maintain troops that are there almost solely for the purpose of protecting their oil fields and their security interest it just doesn t make sense to me pool getty images getty images rep tom malinowski d n j is one of several democrats pushing to withdraw u s military support from saudi arabia and the uae following opec decision to cut oil production the move comes weeks before the midterm elections with gas prices rising again malinowski said there s no question that mbs particularly the crown prince of saudi arabia shares putin s worldview more than he shares ours he doesn t appreciate american advocacy for democracy in the world legislation uses u s military support as leverage the new jersey democrat said the bill is an exact copy of a bill that senate republicans pushed when trump was in the white house to give him leverage when the saudis were producing more oil to push the price down to harm u s production he said gop lawmakers at the time were on board and the threat of pulling out military support worked then and he hopes they will support this effort malinowski has spoken with officials at the white house and state department but declined to describe their reaction democrats were divided on whether it was a good idea for president biden to travel to saudi arabia and meet with the leadership over the summer malinowski said i felt that the trip was ill advised i didn t think we d get much from it at the same time i didn t think the saudis would go to these lengths to screw us the number 2 senate democratic leader sen dick durbin tweeted sharp criticism of the saudi royal family saying they have never been a trustworthy ally and it s time for our foreign policy to imagine a world without their alliance according to a recent report from the white house to congress roughly 2 700 u s personnel are deployed to saudi arabia to protect u s interests and protect against hostile action from iran or iranian backed groups there are roughly 2 000 troops in the uae the decision is already having an impact on gas prices which had been trending down in recent weeks according to aaa the national average for regular gasoline rose from 3 831 per gallon to 3 867 just a day later due to tight supply and steady demand with the midterm elections less than 5 weeks away and the country facing record high inflation democrats were already concerned that economic concerns would help fuel the ability of republicans to retake one or both chambers of congress the gop is favored to win a majority in the house of representatives and control of the senate is a jump ball with tight races in a small number of swing states last month an effort pushed by sen joe manchin d w va to include legislation reforming the permitting process for energy projects to a government funding bill was blocked facing bipartisan opposition manchin tweeted that the opec decision called for a renewed effort to find agreement on the issue to decrease american dependence on foreign oil my statement on the agreement by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to cut oil production by 2 million barrels per day pic twitter com sep4n2lcwl senator joe manchin sen_joemanchin october 5 2022 biden looks for alternatives to opec oil on thursday president biden told reporters he was disappointed in the decision by opec and said we re looking at what alternatives we might have asked whether easing sanctions on venezuela was under consideration biden said there s a lot of alternatives we haven t made up our mind yet malinowsi said i find it incredibly distasteful and disturbing that we depend on dictators who hate us for our energy and the way to avoid that was to accelerate a transition to clean energy and get away from relying on places like russia iran venezuela and saudi arabia for the global energy supply biden administration officials have recently discussed ramping up pressure on u s oil companies to increase production specifically for the gap in prices between the wholesale price and the price consumers are paying at the pump other options to offset the decrease in supply would be to tap additional oil from the strategic petroleum reserve or work with european allies to purchase oil at below market prices from russia top house republicans response to opec s announcement focused less on their squeeze and its impact on u s consumers and instead used the news to redouble their criticism of biden s radical climate agenda in a joint statement rep steve scalise r la rep jeff duncan r s c and rep markwayne mullin r okla urged a pivot to a strategy the gop has pushed for years instead of begging foreign countries for oil and raiding our strategic petroleum reserve president biden should reverse his anti american policies and unleash domestic energy production making the united states energy independent again would lower energy costs for americans and reduce our reliance on opec for oil by once again becoming a net exporter of energy the united states can harness its resources to meet not only our needs but also the needs of our allies many democrats maintain that biden has pressed u s oil companies to increase production but they have been resistant and have been reaping profits that have gone to stock buybacks instead of investing in new capacity no quick action on punitive measures any legislative efforts would have to wait until after the election both chambers are in recess with members focused on the final five week stretch until the midterms on nov 8 according to some aides familiar with discussions on the issue lawmakers may push to attach something to the annual defense authorization bill that is expected to be considered in the lame duck session in november for now malinowski acknowledged the bill was a signal to the president about the need to change the posture toward a longtime ally and he would need to sign off on it if the measure made to his desk malinowski added it s unclear how quickly the cuts would go into effect and impact prices at the pump but argued i do think it s important for the president to get ahead of that and to show the saudis the emiratis and the american people that we re not going to stand for this durbin who chairs the senate judiciary committee called for quick passage when congress returns of a bill called the nopec no oil producing and exporting cartels act that measure which cleared the committee with bipartisan support would allow the justice department to bring antitrust lawsuits against members of the oil cartel and clarify that existing laws can t shield foreign countries from charges of illegal price fixing senate majority leader chuck schumer mentioned that bill as one option he is considering bringing up later this fall what saudi arabia did to help putin continue to wage his despicable vicious war against ukraine will long be remembered by americans we are looking at all the legislative tools to best deal with this appalling and deeply cynical action including

macon father overcomes addiction uses experiences to help others at no wrong door when tanner duvall was getting ready to graduate from franklin high school in 2009 at 17 years old a dirt bike accident landed him in the hospital with a broken collarbone while his family and friends celebrated his graduation a few weeks later watching him remove his sling just to walk across the stage what they didn t know at the time was the pain medicine that gave tanner the strength to heal from his injury had already begun to take over his life and send him into an opiate addiction that 2009 injury was the first in a series of events over the next 10 years of tanner s life that resulted in multiple arrests drug use losing custody of his daughter and ultimately spending 8 months incarcerated in the macon county detention center today tanner uses the struggles he has endured over the last decade his climb back to the top from rock bottom to help others facing similar fates through serving as a peer support specialist at no wrong door tanner is one of seven peer support specialists working at no wrong door to meet people where they are in hopes of helping them begin their own recovery journey because he has lived the same situations and experiences that individuals struggling with substance use disorder or mental health issues many of the people he encounters are facing he is able to relate better and offer a listening non judgmental ear tanner s story i was accepted into western carolina but decided to enroll in southwestern to save money tanner said of his plans after high school i wanted to be a physical therapist to be able to help people after his first semester at southwestern community college tanner said he wasn t making the grades he needed and his addiction to opiates really took front and center so he left class one day and didn t return soon after his injury doctors would no longer prescribe pain medications for tanner so he started to look for them elsewhere tanner s downward spiral was exacerbated in october 2010 when his best friend parker mathis was killed in a drunk driving accident when parker died i lost my best friend that is when i went from just recreational use of drugs and drinking to anything and everything to numb the pain said tanner tanner pinpoints october 2010 and parker s death as being the worst downward spiral that he had ever experienced he said nothing else mattered at that point i was a snowball headed for hell i fell in love with percocet they just numbed every feeling i had life just seemed brighter when i was on them said tanner i was really surprised how easy it was to just buy them on the streets when i started getting them from anywhere i could find the pills got stronger and i started doing more and more of them i was working construction and i would work for a paycheck just to spend the paycheck to get high and then work to make enough to get me until the next paycheck and the next high tanner s first run in with the law came in 2011 but it wasn t for drugs he was 20 years old and arrested for driving under the influence as part of his sentence for that dui tanner was placed on probation i just couldn t ever pass a drug test so i kept getting violated and then ended up back in court said tanner that is when the judge ordered me to a treatment facility tanner was ordered to spend three months in goldsboro north carolina at dart cherry now referred to as dart center tanner received substance use treatment at the 300 bed residential treatment facility that was the first time since i first started taking opiates in 2009 that i was able to not actually be physically dependent on drugs he remembered my addiction changed because i wasn t physically dependent on the drugs but i still wasn t in the mindset to take the steps needed for recovery tanner recalls his first encounter with a peer support specialist nearly 10 years ago while in treatment he remembers immediately seeing the stark differences he saw in talking with the therapist right out of college that had never lived the same kind of life as him compared to the therapist who was a recovering addict i think the problem at that stage in my life was that i never went to rehab to quit anything tanner said i was there because the judge ordered me to be there so when i got out instead of getting sober i just started substituting opiates for meth and more and more alcohol then in 2014 tanner again found himself in trouble with the law with a second dui tanner was once again placed on probation and this time he was able to follow the rules and had good check ins with his probation officer alise sutton he stayed clean all the way until his first daughter was born in 2017 then he started to fail drug tests being violated for both meth use as well as weed he was working full time and had become a functioning addict the people he was around at the time were living the same life he was as functioning addicts making it harder to see the problem with what the was doing i was at work and got a call from dss they told me that due to something that happened my daughter was being placed in emergency custody said tanner that was a huge wake up call looking back i was really fortunate that my daughter was able to stay with family and didn t end up in the system placed in a home with people she didn t know but at the time i wasn t thinking that clearly tanner and his then girlfriend did everything dss asked them to do for the three month time period that their daughter was in custody with a family member they took all the classes passed all the drug screens and were a few days away from dss terminating their case against the new parents when tanner s family filed a civil lawsuit to keep custody of his daughter the dss case ended but then with the civil suit that started a whole other fight said tanner it wasn t long after that when my probation officer violated me for trying to cheat one of my drug tests i went before a judge and he revoked the suspended sentence i was serving for my second dui and ordered i served eight months in jail the eight months tanner spent incarcerated at the macon county detention center in 2018 11 years after he first started abusing opiates was when he had his first encounter with no wrong door which he credits for giving him his life back tanner said a couple of days after being sent to jail a peer support specialist named samantha visited the jail and he went to one of the classes but buzzed the detention staff and left because he didn t think it was for him i don t know if i just didn t have my head on straight or if i just didn t have all the drugs out of my system yet or not but i just wasn t ready then but then a couple of weeks later they came back and from that point forward i never missed a class that no wrong door had while i was locked up said tanner during his eight months in jail tanner took the prime for life class offered to inmates and graduated with a certificate he attended narcotics anonymous meetings went to church services that were offered and did everything else offered to him tanner says he had sort of a spiritual awakening that helped him see clear and sober for the first time sitting in jail i had time to think and that is when i was abel to see the bigger picture clearly for the first time tanner said i remember thinking that parker wouldn t have wanted that for me parker wouldn t have wanted me to be sitting in a jail cell high because of the grief i held on to from losing him parker would want me to be right he would want me to be better for my daughter i had gotten to the point where everything had been taken from me and i just realized that if was ever going to have a chance to get those things back and to be in her life that i had to be right there isn t a drug or a high worth missing out on the relationship i have with my daughter time in jail away from people he thought were friends helped him appreciate the help no wrong door offered him when i was in jail howard and the others at no wrong door kept telling me that when i got out they would be there for me so the very first place i went during business hours was no wrong door and they were there just like they promised they were going to be said tanner that first year clean was so lonely the people in my life who i thought were friends weren t friends at all they were just trying to bring me down so being at no wrong door it really helped to be around like minded people with shared experiences tanner was living with his mom and working for a local timber framing company when shelia jenkins director of no wrong door asked him if he wanted to serve as a board member of no wrong door tanner jumped at the opportunity a couple of months after that jenkins asked if tanner would be interested in volunteering in the jail to talk to inmates like him and tanner never hesitated he changed his work schedule to work 4 10s so he could have fridays free to volunteer in the jail with the help of no wrong door tanner started to earn back more and more time with his daughter through visitations until finally his dad saw the real changes he had made and agreed to return full custody to tanner both tanner and his daughter s mother share custody and remain clean and sober today after nearly a year of volunteering at no wrong door in december 2021 tanner fell and broke his hip nothing able to work his physical labor job for more than six months jenkins asked tanner if he would consider taking the classes to become a peer support specialist i never thought that i would be here doing this but now that i am doing it there isn t anywhere else or anything else that i want to be doing he said i have such a respect for this place and the power that it can give people it gave me my life back and if the work i can do here can reach just one person then it is all worth it taking a decade of addiction and loss tanner began his official work as a peer support specialist specializing in detention engagement tanner goes into the macon county detention just about every day on monday he teaches a parenting class for female inmates a course called love logic the course focuses on techniques for taking responsibility lowering stress level and building positive cause and effect scenarios with children on tuesdays tanner facilities a peer led group within the jail that gives inmates an opportunity for whatever they need if it wasn t for no wrong door i don t know where i would be today it is because of them showing up like they told me they would it is because of people like detention officer costin jiglau who told me point blank duvall you are better than this you know you come from good stock you can be better and you need to get out here and show everyone you can be better it s because of detention officers like karen afonso and sheree poling who saw me not an inmate not a criminal but me that i am doing what i am doing here today tanner said it took some time but he even thanked his dad for what he did for his daughter and thanked his probation officer alise sutton for violating him and sending him to jail which was a crucial part of tanner s recovery if it wasn t for them and what they did and for my mom grandma and the support of my wife anna who i married back in june i couldn t have made it through all of this said tanner everybody s recovery pathway is different not a one is the same that is why i make sure to let inmates know that at no wrong door we welcome any recovery pathways anyone that wants to start that journey we will help them find what works for them there are 7 peers here and not one of us have the same story for anyone looking to take

mclean va accesswire october 6 2022 gladstone land corporation nasdaq land gladstone land or the company announced that in light of the recent price volatility of its common stock largely consistent with the overall market it is providing the following business update inflation hedge with inflation continuing to hover near the highest rates seen in over four decades farmland continues to act as a strong hedge against inflation according to the u s bureau of labor statistics cpi grew at an annual rate of 8 3 through august 2022 however food prices have continued to outpace the rate of inflation with the overall food segment increasing by 11 4 over that same period and the food at home segment which encompasses the majority of the crops grown on gladstone land s farms growing by 13 5 in addition according to the ncreif farmland index which as of june 30 2022 consisted of over 14 6 billion of farms across the u s the total return on u s farmland including appreciation and income was 9 7 for the 12 months ended june 30 2022 results released quarterly occupancy and cash collections gladstone land s farms continue to be 100 leased and the company has collected approximately 97 7 of year to date base cash rents owed through september 30 2022 the remaining portion of approximately 1 2 million is currently expected to be collected in full by the end of the year lease renewals and upcoming expirations since june 30 2022 the company has renewed or extended six leases on certain of its farms located in arizona california and florida in aggregate these renewals are expected to result in an increase in annual net operating income of approximately 281 000 or 9 8 from that of the prior leases the company does not have any more agricultural leases expiring in 2022 and only has one agricultural lease expiring in the first half of 2023 which makes up less than 0 5 of its total annual lease revenues management currently expects the renewal of this lease to be flat to slightly higher relative to the current lease current debt and increases in interest rates gladstone land currently has approximately 642 7 million of total debt outstanding excluding mandatorily redeemable term preferred stock over 99 8 of these borrowings are at fixed rates and on a weighted average basis the interest rate on these borrowings is fixed at just 3 26 for the next 5 1 years as such management believes its current debt situation is well protected against continued interest rate increases as is currently expected current liquidity the company currently has available liquidity of approximately 172 3 million consisting of approximately 45 0 million in cash on hand and approximately 127 3 million of availability under our credit facility with metlife and other undrawn notes or bonds in addition gladstone land currently has certain properties valued at a total of approximately 104 8 million that are unencumbered and eligible to be pledged as collateral hurricane ian representatives from gladstone land have spoken with its tenant partners across the state of florida while the company is still assessing the overall impact of the hurricane early reports indicate only minor damage to a couple of farm related buildings and irrigation systems all of which is covered by insurance some farmers also reported delayed plantings for certain crops and crop loss in some fields due to the amount of surface water produced by hurricane ian however the company does not currently anticipate these delays to cause any interruption in rental payments the company notes that its two citrus groves in st lucie county the only permanent crop farms it owns in the state made it through the storm without any notable damage to the trees gladstone land is grateful to have come out relatively unscathed given the strength of this historic storm and continues to keep those in mind who were negatively impacted as a result of the hurricane western drought the drought in the west continues to persist and many farmers are in need of more rain and a strong snowpack this winter to maintain optimal yields on their farms including certain of our tenants but at this time none of the company s farms are impaired as a result of the drought the company continues to see increasing demand for farmland by growers in certain markets resulting in upward pressure on rental rates in addition values of farmland with poor water resources are generally trending down while farmland with good water access is showing a sharp increase in value hence gladstone land s continued efforts to increase the amount of water availability on its farms the company continues to work on projects to enhance the water security of its western portfolio including but not limited to additional water purchases installation of new pipelines and improvements to existing irrigation systems critically dry cycles like the one the west is currently experiencing is why the company purchased 45 000 acre feet equal to approximately 14 7 billion gallons of banked water last year none of which has been used to date and continues to look at other opportunities to acquire additional water comments from david gladstone farmland investments are often viewed as a vehicle to hedge against certain negative macroeconomic factors of both high inflation and recessionary concerns we believe our portfolio of farmland holdings is poised to benefit from continued high inflation as inflation typically puts upward pressure on both land values and rental rates thus increasing the value of our portfolio and its income stream crop pricing is also expected to see inflationary increases over time which will benefit our tenants profit margins as well as lead to higher participation rents for us outside of the almond market most crops grown on our properties are seeing strong demand and increasing prices that are mostly outpacing the cost increases of growing these crops as the probability of a recession looks more likely we expect demand for food and crop pricing to stay strong with some sectors experiencing exceptionally strong increases as an overall asset class farmland investments have

alongside the static maps present in this report russia s use of iranian made drones is not generating asymmetric effects the way the ukrainian use of us provided himars systems has done and is unlikely to affect the course of the war significantly the deputy chief of the main operational department of the ukrainian general staff brigadier general oleksiy hromov stated on october 6 that russian forces have used a total of 86 iranian shahed 136 drones against ukraine 60 of which ukrainian forces have already destroyed as isw reported yesterday russian forces do not appear to be focusing these drones on asymmetric nodes near the battlefield they have used many drones against civilian targets in rear areas likely hoping to generate nonlinear effects through terror such efforts are not succeeding ukrainian air force command spokesperson yuri ignat stated that the russian army is increasingly using the iranian made drones to conserve its stock of high precision missiles russian forces have likely used a non trivial percentage of the shahed 136 supply so far if the claims of an anonymous us intelligence official at the end of august were correct that iran would likely provide hundreds of drones to russia the wagner private military company announced the creation of its own private telegram channel on october 6 indicating that wagner financier yevgeny prigozhin may want a voice that is clearly his own to compete with milbloggers and possibly chechen warlord ramzan kadyrov who all have their own telegram channels a telegram channel affiliated with prigozhin shared the invitation to the wagner channel peacekeeper the russian language invitation reads we arrived from hell we are wagner our business is death and business is going well in addition to peacekeeper the channel suggested that followers subscribe to the novorossiya z project another private channel the creation of a group for wagner to share uncensored materials from the front may be in part a recruitment tool but is likely also an attempt to establish a formal means for prigozhin and his allies to directly influence the information space in much the same way that kadyrov and the russian nationalist milbloggers use telegram key takeaways russia s use of iranian made drones is not generating asymmetric effects the way the ukrainian use of us provided himars systems has done and

from their own budgets the ukrainian resistance center reported on october 6 that russian forces began the forced mobilization of ukrainian citizens in russian occupied kremmina and starobilsk luhansk oblast we do not report in detail on russian war crimes because those activities are well covered in western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting we will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in ukrainian urban areas we utterly condemn

ukrainian troops are sending reinforcements to this pocket the deputy chief of the main operational department of the ukrainian general staff brigadier general oleksiy hromov reported that russian troops are attempting to slow ukrainian advances in the kupyansk svatove direction suggesting that russian troops around kupyansk are concerned that ukrainians will use positions in this area to threaten svatove from the northwest ukrainian troops likely continued counteroffensive operations to threaten russian positions along the kreminna svatove road in western luhansk oblast on october 6 luhansk people s republic lnr ambassador to russia rodion miroshnik claimed that over 10 000 ukrainian troops have amassed west of kreminna and that russian forces have largely lost contact with svatove and kreminna several russian sources stated that ukrainian troops are continuing sabotage and reconnaissance activities along the r66 svatove kreminna road and that russian troops are

recent ukrainian advances in northeast kherson oblast russian milbloggers claimed that ukrainian forces largely focused on regrouping in northern kherson oblast and did not conduct ground attacks on october 6 the russian mod echoed claims made by some milbloggers that ukrainian troops conducted limited ground attacks to break through new russian defensive lines in northern kherson particularly from piatykhatky about 35km south of the dnipropetrovsk oblast border russian sources also suggested that ukrainian troops conducted limited ground attacks northwest of kherson city on october 6 a

direction of kherson city the milblogger claimed that ukrainian troops attacked russian positions near novohryhorivka about 25km northwest of kherson city ukraine s southern operational command noted that a reinforced russian tactical unit of an unspecified echelon attempted to attack in the direction of lyubomirivka 27km northwest of kherson city likely in an attempt to push the frontline further north of kherson city to afford russian troops a wider buffer zone between ukrainian positions and critical concentration areas near the dnipro river on october 5 ukrainian forces additionally continued their interdiction campaign in support of ground operations on october 6 social media footage shows the aftermath of a himars strike on a building used by russian forces in kherson city on

mykolaiv and odesa oblasts melitopol mayor ivan fedorov reported that ukrainian forces struck and destroyed russian ammunition depots in melitopol on october 6 mobilization and force generation efforts russian objective expand combat power without conducting general mobilization local russian officials appear to be frantically looking for ways to fund their mobilized units as the kremlin increasingly expects local administrations to pay for the war effort from their own budgets as isw has previously reported a russian opposition outlet reported on october 5 that the ministry of industry and trade for the republic of mari el forced business owners to donate 1 of their earnings to fund mobilized personnel in the republic the ministry reportedly threatened to mobilize the employees of businesses that did not comply one businessman told the outlet that he had to transfer money despite personal opposition to the war in order to protect his employees and that the stated purpose of the funds was voluntary donations to provide humanitarian assistance to military personnel called up for partial mobilization an anti war russian outlet reported that public employees and teachers in krasnodar krai were forced to voluntarily deduct one day of october pay to transfer to a fund to support mobilized personnel the outlet noted that authorities in krasnodar previously

of more than 13 billion rubles and was unable to pay for the additional benefits for mobilized omsk citizens like childcare support that other wealthier regions of russia were able to provide burkov was responding to a video circulated by omsk servicemembers who alleged that their salaries were unpaid it is unclear whether omsk oblast is providing any salary to its mobilized citizens or which government entities are responsible for paying mobilized men the russian ministry of defense the federal government or local administrations however moscow oblast governor andrei vorobyov told mobilized men from moscow on october 6 that the moscow administration has purchased necessary equipment for them his remarks received general acclaim from the milblogger community the ministry of defense is demonstrably not providing even basic military equipment to mobilized personnel it appears to be leaving wealthy oblasts to fill that gap while mobilized men from poorer oblasts may be going without non crowdsourced equipment entirely the ukrainian resistance center reported on october 6 that russian forces began the forced mobilization of ukrainian citizens in russian occupied kremmina and starobilsk luhansk oblast the center reported that russian forces are sending ukrainians of all ages and health statuses to the frontlines without proper training or ammunition because russian forces benefit from regardless of which side we are fighting for because it breaks the mental ties between the regions unidentified hackers used fake mobilization notices purportedly from military commissariats to install malware on russian computers according to a russian cybersecurity company kasperskylabs reported on october 6 that men received fake subpoenas from military registration offices calling on recipients to urgently appear at a place and time with a pdf download purportedly containing more information the pdfs contained malware used for corporate espionage

that the newly mobilized men will undergo intensive on the ground training that takes into account russia s recent experiences with combat in ukraine the russian ministry of defense had told interfax on october 2 that after the training is completed these units will begin to carry out tasks for the control and defense of the liberated territories and will also operate as part of reserve and

a five day trial was scheduled to begin on october 17 and musk expected to be deposed on thursday a delaware judge has ordered a halt to twitter inc s lawsuit against elon musk until 5pm et 9pm gmt on october 28 to permit the billionaire s takeover deal to close according to a thursday court filing earlier twitter had expressed opposition to musk s request a judge halt its lawsuit against him saying musk should close his purchase of the company for 44bn next week and the litigation should head to trial until he closes the deal musk said this week he would buy twitter at the price he agreed in april 54 20 per share but conditioned the deal on receiving debt financing banks are working cooperatively to fund the deal which is expected to close on or around october 28 the court filing said as a result there is no need for an expedited trial to order defendants to do what they are already doing and this action is now moot said the filing musk committed to buying twitter in april but soon soured on the deal the social media company then went to court seeking an order for musk to go through with the deal a five day trial is scheduled to begin on october 17 and musk was expected to be deposed on thursday although the parties mutually agreed to postpone his interview sources told reuters news agency musk said lawyers representing the debt financing parties have reassured him they are prepared to honour their obligations continuing the litigation would require a trial and appeals and could drag out payment to twitter s shareholders by months the filing said twitter will not take yes for an answer astonishingly they have insisted on proceeding with this litigation recklessly putting the deal at risk and gambling with their stockholders interests the filing said musk who is also chief executive of tesla inc asked for an immediate hearing according to a letter to chancellor kathaleen mccormick of delaware s court of chancery twitter shares ended the day down 3 7 percent at 49 39 on the new york stock exchange a lot of mistrust since musk made his offer on monday talks have dragged on longer than some initially expected according to sources close to the litigation wedbush analyst dan ives said it would be an understatement to say talks between both sides were going poorly there is a lot of mistrust for obvious reasons he said major banks that committed to funding 12 5bn or about 28 percent of the deal could be facing hefty losses as the swift pace of interest rate hikes has ratcheted up market volatility and dampened appetite for leveraged financing there s still some uncertainty based on whether or not elon can find the actual financing to do the deal said randy frederick managing director of trading and derivatives for the schwab center musk has raised 15 4bn by selling tesla shares this year and is leaning on large investors for a chunk of the financing leading to speculation he may sell more of the electric vehicle maker s stock to fund the deal financing will eventually end up going through one way or another it is just a point of negotiating terms at this stage said robert gilliland managing director at concenture wealth management
any country can be thrown off course more easily and more often the imf chief has warned the international monetary fund imf will next week downgrade its forecast for 2 9 percent global growth in 2023 managing director kristalina georgieva said on thursday citing rising risks of recession and financial instability georgieva said the outlook for the global economy was darkening given the shocks caused by the covid 19 pandemic russia s invasion of ukraine and climate disasters on all continents and it could well get worse we are experiencing a fundamental shift in the global economy from a world of relative predictability to a world with more fragility greater uncertainty higher economic volatility geopolitical confrontations and more frequent and devastating natural disasters she said in a speech at georgetown university in washington dc georgieva said the old order characterised by adherence to global rules low interest rates and low inflation was giving way to one in which any country can be thrown off course more easily and more often she said all of the world s largest economies china the united states and europe were now slowing down which was dampening demand for exports from emerging and developing countries already hit hard by high food and energy prices the imf would lower its 2023 growth forecast from 2 9 percent its fourth downward revision this year when it releases its world economic outlook next week she said the global lender would leave its current forecast for 3 2 percent growth in 2022 unchanged she said and gave no number for the new 2023 forecast the war in ukraine and global economic risks will dominate next week s annual meetings of the imf and the world bank in washington dc which bring together finance ministers and central bankers from around the world the imf estimates countries accounting for about one third of the world economy will see at least two consecutive quarters of contraction this year or next georgieva said and even when growth is positive it will feel like a recession because of shrinking real incomes and rising prices she said overall the imf expects global output to shrink by 4 trillion between now and 2026 that is roughly the size of the german economy and amounts to a massive setback she added global divisions georgieva said the division of the global economy into blocs that are either supporting russia opposing it or sitting on the bench following its invasion of ukraine would wind up reducing important efficiencies and hurting poor people the most we cannot afford the world to break apart she said if we go to a point where we cut off parts of the world from each other it will be the poor in rich countries and it will be the poor countries that will bear the brunt of the impact of it uncertainty remained high and more economic shocks were possible she said warning that high debt levels and liquidity concerns could amplify the rapid and disorderly repricing of assets on financial markets georgieva said inflation remained stubbornly high but central banks should continue to respond decisively even if the economy slowed down she told cnbc in an interview that us federal reserve chair jerome powell was walking a very very narrow path in shaping monetary policy but the imf expected interest rates to be somewhere in the 4 percent territory in 2022 and 2023 if he doesn t tighten enough inflation may de anchor if he tightens too much there could be a recession so jay powell is doing his best to watch the parameters in the economy to calibrate what he does and i trust that he will make the right call she said fiscal measures adopted in response to high energy prices should be targeted and temporary she said in the speech in other words while monetary policy is hitting the brakes you shouldn t have a fiscal policy that is stepping on the accelerator this would make for a very rough and dangerous ride the united kingdom this week reversed plans to cut taxes for the richest which had sparked market turmoil and a sharp rebuke from the imf that warned the country s financial plans risked increasing inequality and were at cross purposes with tightening monetary policy asked on cnbc about the imf s criticism of uk policy georgieva said this is a message we convey to everybody georgieva urged greater support for emerging markets and developing countries noting that high interest rates in advanced economies and the strong dollar had triggered capital outflows the probability of portfolio outflows had risen to 40 percent she also called on china and private creditors who hold the lion s share of global debt to address the risk of a widening debt crisis in emerging markets

elon musk s lawyers said thursday that twitter is refusing to accept the tesla billionaire s renewed 44 billion bid for the social media company and are asking a delaware court to halt an upcoming trial musk made a renewed offer to take over the social media platform earlier this week hoping to end a protracted legal dispute that began when musk tried to back out of the april deal and twitter sued representatives for twitter did not immediately respond to messages for comment twitter said earlier this week that it intends to close the deal at the agreed upon price but the two sides are still booked for an oct 17 trial in delaware over musk s earlier attempts to terminate the deal on wednesday the judge presiding over the case said she will continue to press on toward the trial because at the time neither side had formally moved to stop it musk s attorneys said the trial should be adjourned to leave more time for musk to secure the financing twitter will not take yes for an answer said the court filing signed by musk attorney edward micheletti astonishingly they have insisted on proceeding with this litigation recklessly putting the deal at risk and gambling with their stockholders interests since twitter sued musk to force him to complete the purchase after he tried to back out four months ago it is unlikely the san francisco based company whose shareholders have voted to approve the deal will walk away from the agreement rather it s likely twitter is seeking assurances from musk s side that this time he s serious and won t walk away again eric talley a columbia university law professor tweeted thursday that twitter is absolutely right not to take yes for an answer and everyone knows why they tried that in april and it didn t go so well he added that twitter would however take a certified bank transfer from musk musk attorneys argue that twitter is disagreeing with the trial delay based on the theoretical possibility of musk not coming up with the financing which they call baseless speculation they said musk s financial backers have indicated that they are prepared to honor their commitments and are working to close the deal by oct 28 roughly a week after the trial was set to conclude twitter s shares fell 1 91 or 3 7 to close at 49 39 on thursday it was the stock s second day of declines following a surge of more than 22 on tuesday after musk made his renewed offer to buy the company

a preliminary analysis of the university of oxford s open label prospective real world evidence study panoramic conducted in the uk in highly vaccinated adults mostly the main secondary endpoint time to first self reported recovery in the panoramic study was 6 days shorter with the lagevrio group compared to the usual care group in addition the use of lagevrio also was associated with earlier recovery across a wide range of other symptom measures as compared to the usual care group an analysis of real world data from a separate observational retrospective study conducted by investigators in israel known as the clalit study showed that in a cohort of non hospitalized high risk patients lagevrio reduced hospitalizations and mortality due to covid 19 in patients 65 years and above no

deaths in the lagevrio treated group occurred in patients 60 64 years of age the totality of the data from both panoramic and clalit give us critical insights into the ways certain patients may benefit from treatment with lagevrio these data also emphasize the critical need and value for lagevrio in the treatment of mild to moderate covid 19 for appropriate high risk patients most significantly the clalit study reinforces what the phase 3 move out study demonstrated a reduction in hospitalizations and mortality in an older population at high risk for progression to severe disease where a clinically meaningful benefit was observed said dr dean y li president merck research laboratories these findings particularly with regard to symptomatic improvement seen in a secondary objective in panoramic and the reduction in hospitalization and death rates seen in the older part of the patient population in clalit further support the urgent need for global access to lagevrio for the treatment of covid 19 in appropriate high risk patients with the continuing uncertainty about potential severity of emerging variants we are pleased that the real world data from israel showed that in an older part of the study population that experienced more hospitalizations rates of hospitalization and death were reduced in patients taking lagevrio also notable is the substantial reduction in time to symptom resolution observed on a secondary endpoint in panoramic even when background hospitalization rates were low the observed six day improvement symptom resolution in the panoramic study is an important finding as we look for ways to further reduce the burden of this virus as studies begin to assess how this medicine could potentially treat other significant illnesses with pandemic potential we will remain steadfast in our commitment to ensuring global access to this important treatment said wendy holman chief executive officer ridgeback biotherapeutics additional results panoramic secondary and virology endpoints on additional secondary objectives in the panoramic study compared to usual care lagevrio treated participants reported reduced time to sustained recovery 21 days vs 24 days reduced time to sustained alleviation of all symptoms 9 days vs 12 days reduced time to reduction of symptom severity 8 days vs 12 days higher self rating of wellness on days 7 14 and 28 fewer moderate or severe symptoms at day 7 14 and 28 for cough shortness of breath loss of taste smell and fatigue less health care seeking in primary care including less contacts with a general practitioner or the uk national health service nhs additionally a greater proportion of lagevrio patients reported early sustained recovery defined as recovered by day 14 and remained recovered until day 28 32 receiving lagevrio vs 23 receiving usual care sustained recovery defined as date participant first reported recovery and subsequently remained well until 28 days 69 vs 60 sustained alleviation of all symptoms defined as date symptoms first reported as minor or none and subsequently remained minor or none until 28 days 84 vs 79 in a substudy in which a cohort of participants was sampled for virology outcomes on day 7 sars cov 2 virus was below detection in 21 receiving lagevrio vs 3 receiving usual care the mean viral load on day 7 was lower on lagevrio 3 82 log10 viral load as compared to usual care 4 93 log10 viral load lagevrio was generally well tolerated with serious adverse events reported at a rate of 0 4 in both study groups and a low treatment withdrawal rate 1 1 about the panoramic study the panoramic trial platform adaptive trial of novel antivirals for early treatment of covid 19 in the community led by the university of oxford and funded by uk research and innovation ukri and national institute for health research nihr studied treatments approved by the uk medicines and health care products regulatory agency mhra including lagevrio in patients with confirmed covid 19 and ongoing symptoms the study is a pragmatic design trial intended to inform policy and public on treatments for covid 19 the study began recruitment in december 2021 and completed enrollment in april 2022 all during the era of the omicron variant the study was designed as an open label prospective individually randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety for lagevrio added to usual care compared to usual care alone in participants who have confirmed covid 19 infection in adults who were either 50 years of age or 18 years of age with comorbidities known underlying chronic health conditions making them clinically vulnerable to covid 19 infection usual care was predominantly focused on managing symptoms with antipyretics however participants at highest risk very impaired immunity or extremely clinically vulnerable were eligible for additional therapies including monoclonal antibodies sotrovimab and intravenous remdesivir overall 25 783 participants were randomized in the trial to lagevrio added to usual care or usual care alone the participant demographics baseline characteristics and other covid related characteristics at baseline were similar in the 2 groups the trial sample size was intentionally expanded during the course of the trial from the initial goal of 10 600 due to a very low observed event rate for the primary endpoint of hospitalizations deaths through day 28 observed treatment with lagevrio standard dose 800 mg twice daily for 5 days added to usual care or usual care alone was initiated within 5 days of covid 19 symptom onset in participants confirmed to have a positive pcr or rapid antigen test for sars cov 2 in the past 7 days prior to treatment onset the median duration of covid 19 symptoms prior to treatment onset was 3 days overall 87 of participants received treatment within 5 days of symptom onset more than 95 of the participants reported taking lagevrio for the full 5 day treatment course about the clalit health services trial the clalit trial an observational retrospective cohort study evaluated data obtained from the electronic medical records of members of clalit health services chs a large healthcare organization covering approximately 65 of the elderly israeli population the study assessed the real world effectiveness of lagevrio in preventing severe covid 19 outcomes in patients 40 years of age and older estimated to be at high risk of progression to severe disease who were infected by the omicron variant and were not eligible for ritonavir boosted nirmatrelvir therapy due to drug drug interactions or impaired kidney function high risk was defined according to a predictive risk score developed in chs to evaluate the risk for severe covid 19 in sars cov 2 infected patients patients with a score of 2 points or more were considered high risk the most common coexisting conditions were obesity hypertension and diabetes the study period started on january 16 2022 the first day lagevrio was administered to chs patients and ended on march 31 2022 while the omicron variant ba 1 was the dominant sars cov 2 strain in israel a total of 1 166 404 chs members were infected with sars cov 2 during the study period of them 19 868 patients were eligible for lagevrio therapy 1 069 5 patients received at least one dose of lagevrio the mean age of the study participants was 69 years with 68 of the participants aged 65 years and older eighty two percent of participants had previous covid 19 immunity either by vaccination prior sars cov 2 infection or hybrid immunity patients residing in long term care facilities patients hospitalized before or on the same day of a positive sars cov 2 test and patients treated with ritonavir boosted nirmatrelvir or monoclonal antibodies were all excluded from the study recent hospitalizations active cancer and diabetes were associated with high rates of hospitalizations due to covid 19 across both age groups chronic heart failure active cancer disease prior cva and copd were prominent risk factors in patients aged 65 years or older in the younger age group immunosuppression and lack of prior immunity were strongly associated with the risk of hospitalizations related to covid 19 update on results from recent carcinogenicity study results from a recent study tg rash2 evaluating carcinogenicity in transgenic mice that received molnupiravir orally for six months at doses of 30 100 or 300 mg kg day demonstrated that lagevrio was not carcinogenic

the claim comes from a court ruling on the state s process for flagging noncitizen voters the ruling doesn t allow texas to revoke registrations without notice on nov 8 residents of texas will head to the polls in order to cast their ballots in a number of high profile races including the race for governor incumbent greg abbott a republican is facing off against democratic challenger beto o rourke other seats on the ballot include the lieutenant governor attorney general comptroller land commissioner and agriculture commissioner all of which are four year terms with the voter registration deadline coming up on oct 11 one tiktoker went viral advising texans to check and re check their voter registration status the poster claims a recent court ruling makes it possible for the state to pull the voter registration for anyone the state thinks is a noncitizen if you re in texas you need to check your voter registration every day until voting because of course a texas appeals judge just said they can withhold the list of people they think are noncitizens and shouldn t be able to vote the tiktoker says and they re not telling who s on that list if they think you re a noncitizen they can withhold you and your vote won t count verify viewer kimberly also asked us if it was true the state of texas is revoking people s voter registrations without telling them the question is the state of texas revoking people s voter registrations without telling them the sources the answer no the state of texas is not revoking people s voter registrations without telling them what we found the court ruling the tiktoker mentions dealt with noncitizen voters but it did not allow the state to revoke people s registration without notice before we get into the details of the ruling it s important to understand the state s process for flagging noncitizen voters and who is allowed to vote in the state of texas to vote in texas or any other state election you must be a u s citizen and 18 years of age or older on election day a full list of eligibility requirements is here according to sam taylor a spokesperson with the texas secretary of state which is the state s chief election officer the process to determine eligibility works like this if a person registers to vote then later goes into a texas department of public safety driver license office and indicates he or she is a non u s citizen then the person s registration is flagged to the county voter registrar with whom they are registered the county then sends a notification to the voter via mail that their registration has been flagged for potential non u s citizenship and the person has 30 days to respond to the county voter registrar with proof of u s citizenship if the person does not respond within 30 days the voter registration is canceled however the voter s registration can be reinstated immediately including at the polling place if the voter provides proof of u s citizenship taylor said in an email to verify according to texas election code a person who needs to prove citizenship can provide a certified copy of the voter s birth certificate united states passport or certificate of naturalization to re register to vote if they had their registration stripped texas is required to notify people that have been flagged as noncitizens under the national voter registration act of 1993 nvra which set the guidelines and voter registration requirements across the u s now to explain the details behind the court ruling according to court records earlier this year a coalition of civil rights groups sued the state after it refused to provide the list of more than 11 000 people the state said were identified as noncitizens and were ineligible to vote the goal of the suit was to make sure the state was complying with the nvra and that all the people on that list were actually not eligible to vote the groups asked the secretary of state to provide data about each individual including the date the person registered to vote the date their driver s license was issued and voting history the state denied the request saying releasing the list violated privacy laws in august a district court judge sided with the civil rights groups saying the state had to disclose the records but the appellate court reversed that decision on sept 29 saying the organizations named in the original case didn t have the authority to sue the state in the first place and therefore the state doesn t have to release the list that doesn t mean every voter in texas needs to check their registration status regularly to see if they have been labeled as a non citizen as the tiktoker claimed we can verify the court ruling was about releasing a list not about how the state flags who can and can t register to vote or be registered to vote

updated october 6 2022 at 5 54 pm et some democrats in congress are furious about opec s decision to cut production by 2 million barrels of oil per day starting next month and are calling to reexamine ties with key oil producers and even withdraw u s military support from saudi arabia and the united arab emirates a trio of house democrats all in competitive reelection contests pennsylvania rep susan wild illinois rep sean casten and new jersey rep tom malinowski called the move a hostile act and a turning point in the relationship between the u s and the two gulf states late wednesday night and introduced legislation to remove u s military support from the two countries malinowski told npr that he believes the move was deliberate to hurt the u s as it supports ukraine in the war the russian invasion and deserves a swift response in an interview thursday he said i just don t see any good reason for us to maintain troops that are there almost solely for the purpose of protecting their oil fields and their security interest it just doesn t make sense to me pool getty images getty images rep tom malinowski d n j is one of several democrats pushing to withdraw u s military support from saudi arabia and the uae following opec decision to cut oil production the move comes weeks before the midterm elections with gas prices rising again malinowski said there s no question that mbs particularly the crown prince of saudi arabia shares putin s worldview more than he shares ours he doesn t appreciate american advocacy for democracy in the world legislation uses u s military support as leverage the new jersey democrat said the bill is an exact copy of a bill that senate republicans pushed when trump was in the white house to give him leverage when the saudis were producing more oil to push the price down to harm u s production he said gop lawmakers at the time were on board and the threat of pulling out military support worked then and he hopes they will support this effort malinowski has spoken with officials at the white house and state department but declined to describe their reaction democrats were divided on whether it was a good idea for president biden to travel to saudi arabia and meet with the leadership over the summer malinowski said i felt that the trip was ill advised i didn t think we d get much from it at the same time i didn t think the saudis would go to these lengths to screw us the number 2 senate democratic leader sen dick durbin tweeted sharp criticism of the saudi royal family saying they have never been a trustworthy ally and it s time for our foreign policy to imagine a world without their alliance according to a recent report from the white house to congress roughly 2 700 u s personnel are deployed to saudi arabia to protect u s interests and protect against hostile action from iran or iranian backed groups there are roughly 2 000 troops in the uae the decision is already having an impact on gas prices which had been trending down in recent weeks according to aaa the national average for regular gasoline rose from 3 831 per gallon to 3 867 just a day later due to tight supply and steady demand with the midterm elections less than 5 weeks away and the country facing record high inflation democrats were already concerned that economic concerns would help fuel the ability of republicans to retake one or both chambers of congress the gop is favored to win a majority in the house of representatives and control of the senate is a jump ball with tight races in a small number of swing states last month an effort pushed by sen joe manchin d w va to include legislation reforming the permitting process for energy projects to a government funding bill was blocked facing bipartisan opposition manchin tweeted that the opec decision called for a renewed effort to find agreement on the issue to decrease american dependence on foreign oil my statement on the agreement by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to cut oil production by 2 million barrels per day pic twitter com sep4n2lcwl senator joe manchin sen_joemanchin october 5 2022 biden looks for alternatives to opec oil on thursday president biden told reporters he was disappointed in the decision by opec and said we re looking at what alternatives we might have asked whether easing sanctions on venezuela was under consideration biden said there s a lot of alternatives we haven t made up our mind yet malinowsi said i find it incredibly distasteful and disturbing that we depend on dictators who hate us for our energy and the way to avoid that was to accelerate a transition to clean energy and get away from relying on places like russia iran venezuela and saudi arabia for the global energy supply biden administration officials have recently discussed ramping up pressure on u s oil companies to increase production specifically for the gap in prices between the wholesale price and the price consumers are paying at the pump other options to offset the decrease in supply would be to tap additional oil from the strategic petroleum reserve or work with european allies to purchase oil at below market prices from russia top house republicans response to opec s announcement focused less on their squeeze and its impact on u s consumers and instead used the news to redouble their criticism of biden s radical climate agenda in a joint statement rep steve scalise r la rep jeff duncan r s c and rep markwayne mullin r okla urged a pivot to a strategy the gop has pushed for years instead of begging foreign countries for oil and raiding our strategic petroleum reserve president biden should reverse his anti american policies and unleash domestic energy production making the united states energy independent again would lower energy costs for americans and reduce our reliance on opec for oil by once again becoming a net exporter of energy the united states can harness its resources to meet not only our needs but also the needs of our allies many democrats maintain that biden has pressed u s oil companies to increase production but they have been resistant and have been reaping profits that have gone to stock buybacks instead of investing in new capacity no quick action on punitive measures any legislative efforts would have to wait until after the election both chambers are in recess with members focused on the final five week stretch until the midterms on nov 8 according to some aides familiar with discussions on the issue lawmakers may push to attach something to the annual defense authorization bill that is expected to be considered in the lame duck session in november for now malinowski acknowledged the bill was a signal to the president about the need to change the posture toward a longtime ally and he would need to sign off on it if the measure made to his desk malinowski added it s unclear how quickly the cuts would go into effect and impact prices at the pump but argued i do think it s important for the president to get ahead of that and to show the saudis the emiratis and the american people that we re not going to stand for this durbin who chairs the senate judiciary committee called for quick passage when congress returns of a bill called the nopec no oil producing and exporting cartels act that measure which cleared the committee with bipartisan support would allow the justice department to bring antitrust lawsuits against members of the oil cartel and clarify that existing laws can t shield foreign countries from charges of illegal price fixing senate majority leader chuck schumer mentioned that bill as one option he is considering bringing up later this fall what saudi arabia did to help putin continue to wage his despicable vicious war against ukraine will long be remembered by americans we are looking at all the legislative tools to best deal with this appalling and deeply cynical action including

washington president joe biden took steps to overhaul u s policy on marijuana on thursday by pardoning thousands of people with federal offenses for simple marijuana possession and initiating a review of how the drug is classified biden said thousands of people with prior federal convictions could be denied employment housing or educational opportunities and his executive action would relieve such collateral consequences biden s move fulfills a campaign promise and is likely to please members in his left leaning political base ahead of the november midterm elections in which the president s fellow democrats are defending control of the house of representatives and senate too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana it s time that we right these wrongs biden said he urged state governors to follow suit advertisement just as no one should be in a federal prison solely due to the possession of marijuana no one should be in a local jail or state prison for that reason either biden said shares of cannabis growers and sellers surged following biden s comments with tilray brands and canopy growth both jumping more than 20 the results of a classification review could have wide ramifications presently the drug falls under the same classification as heroin and lsd and is in a higher classification than fentanyl and methamphetamine the president said if marijuana classification were to ease at the federal level that could allow major stock exchanges to list businesses that are in the cannabis trade and potentially allow foreign companies to begin selling their products in the united states while many states have legalized the medical or recreational use of cannabis the substance remains illegal under u s federal law forcing most major banks to deny their services to cannabis related businesses the issue has forced u s marijuana companies to trade their shares over the counter or by listing in canada with the nasdaq and new york stock exchange prohibited from listing them the president s action drew praise from some members of congress the progressive caucus applauds this action by president biden today to advance criminal and racial justice said representative pramila jayapal who chairs a group of left leaning lawmakers in a statement advertisement biden said he had directed attorney general merrick garland to develop an administrative process to issue certificates of pardon to those who are eligible the justice department will expeditiously administer the president s proclamation which pardons individuals who engaged in simple possession of marijuana restoring political civil and other rights to those convicted of that offense the department said in a statement biden said certain rules needed to stay in place even as regulations around the country loosened finally even as federal and state regulation of marijuana changes important limitations on trafficking marketing and under age sales should stay in place biden said

updated october 6 2022 at 5 54 pm et some democrats in congress are furious about opec s decision to cut production by 2 million barrels of oil per day starting next month and are calling to reexamine ties with key oil producers and even withdraw u s military support from saudi arabia and the united arab emirates a trio of house democrats all in competitive reelection contests pennsylvania rep susan wild illinois rep sean casten and new jersey rep tom malinowski called the move a hostile act and a turning point in the relationship between the u s and the two gulf states late wednesday night and introduced legislation to remove u s military support from the two countries malinowski told npr that he believes the move was deliberate to hurt the u s as it supports ukraine in the war the russian invasion and deserves a swift response in an interview thursday he said i just don t see any good reason for us to maintain troops that are there almost solely for the purpose of protecting their oil fields and their security interest it just doesn t make sense to me pool getty images getty images rep tom malinowski d n j is one of several democrats pushing to withdraw u s military support from saudi arabia and the uae following opec decision to cut oil production the move comes weeks before the midterm elections with gas prices rising again malinowski said there s no question that mbs particularly the crown prince of saudi arabia shares putin s worldview more than he shares ours he doesn t appreciate american advocacy for democracy in the world legislation uses u s military support as leverage the new jersey democrat said the bill is an exact copy of a bill that senate republicans pushed when trump was in the white house to give him leverage when the saudis were producing more oil to push the price down to harm u s production he said gop lawmakers at the time were on board and the threat of pulling out military support worked then and he hopes they will support this effort malinowski has spoken with officials at the white house and state department but declined to describe their reaction democrats were divided on whether it was a good idea for president biden to travel to saudi arabia and meet with the leadership over the summer malinowski said i felt that the trip was ill advised i didn t think we d get much from it at the same time i didn t think the saudis would go to these lengths to screw us the number 2 senate democratic leader sen dick durbin tweeted sharp criticism of the saudi royal family saying they have never been a trustworthy ally and it s time for our foreign policy to imagine a world without their alliance according to a recent report from the white house to congress roughly 2 700 u s personnel are deployed to saudi arabia to protect u s interests and protect against hostile action from iran or iranian backed groups there are roughly 2 000 troops in the uae the decision is already having an impact on gas prices which had been trending down in recent weeks according to aaa the national average for regular gasoline rose from 3 831 per gallon to 3 867 just a day later due to tight supply and steady demand with the midterm elections less than 5 weeks away and the country facing record high inflation democrats were already concerned that economic concerns would help fuel the ability of republicans to retake one or both chambers of congress the gop is favored to win a majority in the house of representatives and control of the senate is a jump ball with tight races in a small number of swing states last month an effort pushed by sen joe manchin d w va to include legislation reforming the permitting process for energy projects to a government funding bill was blocked facing bipartisan opposition manchin tweeted that the opec decision called for a renewed effort to find agreement on the issue to decrease american dependence on foreign oil my statement on the agreement by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to cut oil production by 2 million barrels per day pic twitter com sep4n2lcwl senator joe manchin sen_joemanchin october 5 2022 biden looks for alternatives to opec oil on thursday president biden told reporters he was disappointed in the decision by opec and said we re looking at what alternatives we might have asked whether easing sanctions on venezuela was under consideration biden said there s a lot of alternatives we haven t made up our mind yet malinowsi said i find it incredibly distasteful and disturbing that we depend on dictators who hate us for our energy and the way to avoid that was to accelerate a transition to clean energy and get away from relying on places like russia iran venezuela and saudi arabia for the global energy supply biden administration officials have recently discussed ramping up pressure on u s oil companies to increase production specifically for the gap in prices between the wholesale price and the price consumers are paying at the pump other options to offset the decrease in supply would be to tap additional oil from the strategic petroleum reserve or work with european allies to purchase oil at below market prices from russia top house republicans response to opec s announcement focused less on their squeeze and its impact on u s consumers and instead used the news to redouble their criticism of biden s radical climate agenda in a joint statement rep steve scalise r la rep jeff duncan r s c and rep markwayne mullin r okla urged a pivot to a strategy the gop has pushed for years instead of begging foreign countries for oil and raiding our strategic petroleum reserve president biden should reverse his anti american policies and unleash domestic energy production making the united states energy independent again would lower energy costs for americans and reduce our reliance on opec for oil by once again becoming a net exporter of energy the united states can harness its resources to meet not only our needs but also the needs of our allies many democrats maintain that biden has pressed u s oil companies to increase production but they have been resistant and have been reaping profits that have gone to stock buybacks instead of investing in new capacity no quick action on punitive measures any legislative efforts would have to wait until after the election both chambers are in recess with members focused on the final five week stretch until the midterms on nov 8 according to some aides familiar with discussions on the issue lawmakers may push to attach something to the annual defense authorization bill that is expected to be considered in the lame duck session in november for now malinowski acknowledged the bill was a signal to the president about the need to change the posture toward a longtime ally and he would need to sign off on it if the measure made to his desk malinowski added it s unclear how quickly the cuts would go into effect and impact prices at the pump but argued i do think it s important for the president to get ahead of that and to show the saudis the emiratis and the american people that we re not going to stand for this durbin who chairs the senate judiciary committee called for quick passage when congress returns of a bill called the nopec no oil producing and exporting cartels act that measure which cleared the committee with bipartisan support would allow the justice department to bring antitrust lawsuits against members of the oil cartel and clarify that existing laws can t shield foreign countries from charges of illegal price fixing senate majority leader chuck schumer mentioned that bill as one option he is considering bringing up later this fall what saudi arabia did to help putin continue to wage his despicable vicious war against ukraine will long be remembered by americans we are looking at all the legislative tools to best deal with this appalling and deeply cynical action including

look if you were the world s richest man you would probably have your own perspective on a lot of things too elon musk has proven this concept again and again the latest development in musk s formerly scuttled attempt to buy social media giant twitter shows that just about anyone can take good legal advice the billionaire has indicated that he is now willing to acquire twitter at his original offer price to catch up anyone late to the party on this in the first half of 2022 elon musk suggested buying twitter at about 44 billion twitter itself was initially very opposed to this and the company adopted a shareholder rights poison pill to prevent the acquisition then twitter reversed course and warmed to the deal while in the meantime musk got cold feet the billionaire and world s richest man depending on stock prices voiced serious concerns with the number of bots and fake accounts on twitter and with the company s level of disclosure or lack thereof cue twitter attempting to enforce the agreement for musk to purchase the company in a monthslong dance musk s lawyers voiced reasons why the billionaire shouldn t have to purchase the company even as twitter lawyers advanced plenty of arguments in favor of the forced acquisition some recent reporting indicated that musk was in talks with twitter to cut the original asking price of approximately 44 billion it ultimately didn t happen though and in a stunning reversal musk s lawyers just sent a two sentence letter to twitter with a proposal to move forward on the original terms now elon musk never had the strongest case to back out of the twitter acquisition deal recognizing this and relying on the advice of competent legal counsel is the mark of a savvy corporate client still it s an unusual circumstance that leads any individual or entity to backtrack so completely on a legal challenge such as to give the other side essentially everything they are asking for so what s going on here the honest answer is that the case defies traditional legal analysis elon musk is at various times depending on stock prices pursuant to a full throated journalistic caveat the world s richest man he can kind of do what he wants but in this case musk came up against an opponent who called his bluff there were talks in recent weeks about a potential discount of up to 10 percent for musk s acquisition of twitter yet even these did not move forward twitter s market cap at midweek was 39 2 billion just shy of the approximately 44 billion purchase price originally proposed by musk a traditional investor might have suggested a more fundamental based approach to coming at a purchase price for twitter at least the latter portion of musk s 54 20 per share bid for twitter seemed as much based on his obsession with 420 related marijuana puns as on any realistic fair market valuation for the company even so not many people have come out ahead in betting against elon musk moving forward with the twitter purchase at the original price might simply represent good business judgment given the posture of the pending legal case there s reportedly no solid deal to end litigation yet although it s only a matter of time with musk publicly caving to the original purchase price in the past i have certainly opined that administering twitter was beneath elon musk s many talents perhaps it is just what he needs though following a few increasingly detached public statements lately it seems clear that musk needs something to reconnect him to the average american perspective and based on past experience elon musk just might turn twitter around from the societal dumpster fire it has become daunting though that may seem it can t be harder than vertical rocket landings or a profitable electric car company jonathan wolf is a civil litigator and author of your debt free jd affiliate link he has taught legal writing written for a wide variety of publications and made it both his business and his pleasure to be financially and scientifically literate any views he expresses are probably pure gold but are nonetheless solely his own and should not be attributed to any organization with which he is affiliated he wouldn t want to share the credit anyway he can be reached at jon_wolf hotmail com

conclusion many we have spoken with have reached is that not only will the fed not help markets but in their dogged pursuit of price stability keep going until something breaks in the capital markets said christopher harvey an equity analyst at wells fargo securities what appears to be their increasingly singular focus price stability will likely help catalyze the dislocation so far half the companies that have reported q3 results have cited adverse currency movement it s a small sample so far but half of the s p 500 companies that have so far reported third quarter results have said they were hurt by the strong dollar and weak every other currency in the latest three months only 4 of s p 500 companies have already reported q3 earnings according to factset senior earnings analyst john butters 65 of companies reporting thus far have cited high labor costs as a check on earnings while 55 mentioned supply chain disruptions those numbers are in keeping with recent trends factset said what s changed is the 50 of companies that have so far said adverse currency moves have held back earnings that s significantly higher than the recent trend in fact the third quarter marked the fourth consecutive quarter that this number has increased and the first time in the past four quarters that the number reflected at least 50 of the companies reporting at this point in time in the earnings season factset said of the 12 factors tracked for this analysis only higher interest rates witnessed a larger quarter over quarter increase in q3 2022 relative to q2 2022 current street estimates call for 2 4 earnings growth in q3 down from 9 9 on june 30 but factset thinks the final number could be closer to 6 7 based on the average improvement in earnings growth during the past few earnings seasons due to companies reporting positive surprises if results do come in at 2 4 it ll be the weakest year over year earnings growth since q3 2020 in the midst of the first year of covid scott

direction said andrew hunter senior u s economist at capital economics but he doesn t see it as convincing to the federal reserve to change course from its strategy of raising rates as a means to fight inflation the 263 000 gain in non farm payrolls in september is another signal that labor market conditions are cooling hunter said but with the unemployment rate dropping back to 3 5 the report is unlikely to significantly alter the fed s view that the labor market is out of balance alex harring oil hits 90 per barrel heating oil also jumps oil prices are surging following opec major

twitter told a judge the billionaire refuses to accept the contractual obligations of his april agreement to buy the social media company for 44 billion example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video new york a judge has delayed a looming trial between twitter and elon musk giving the tesla ceo more time to close his 44 billion deal to buy the company after months spent fighting to get out of it musk had asked to halt the upcoming delaware court trial where the tesla billionaire was expected to fare poorly against twitter s lawsuit to force him to complete his april merger agreement musk revived the takeover offer on monday but said he needed time to get the financing in order chancellor kathaleen st jude mccormick head of the delaware chancery court said thursday that musk and twitter now have until oct 28 to close the deal a trial originally set for oct 17 will happen in november if they don t she said twitter had asked mccormick earlier thursday to proceed with the trial saying the billionaire refuses to accept the contractual obligations of his april agreement to buy the social media and take it private twitter disputed musk s claim that the san francisco based company is refusing to accept the new bid which musk told the company about earlier this week after trying to terminate the deal over the summer the company has been seeking a court order to force the completion of the merger and said it intends to close the deal at the agreed upon price but described musk s move to delay the trial as an invitation to further mischief and delay twitter said musk should be have been aiming to close the deal by monday but they aren t instead they refuse to commit to any closing date said the letter from twitter lawyer kevin shannon they ask for an open ended out at the expense of twitter s stockholders who are owed 44 billion plus interest all the while remaining free to change their minds again or to invent new grounds to avoid the contract brooklyn law school professor andrew jennings said twitter wants to be certain that the deal will get done and not allow wiggle room for musk to walk away again twitter apparently hasn t got the certainty it wants otherwise we would ve seen a joint filing to the court on how the two sides want to proceed jennings said as of right now the trial train keeps rolling until both parties or the court apply the brakes eric talley a columbia university law professor tweeted thursday that twitter is absolutely right not to take yes for an answer and everyone knows why they tried that in april and it didn t go so well he added that twitter would however take a certified bank transfer from musk musk attorneys argued that twitter was disagreeing with the trial delay based on the theoretical possibility of musk not coming up with the financing which they call baseless speculation they said musk s financial backers have indicated that they are prepared to honor their commitments and are working to close the deal by oct 28
the claim comes from a court ruling on the state s process for flagging noncitizen voters the ruling doesn t allow texas to revoke registrations without notice on nov 8 residents of texas will head to the polls in order to cast their ballots in a number of high profile races including the race for governor incumbent greg abbott a republican is facing off against democratic challenger beto o rourke other seats on the ballot include the lieutenant governor attorney general comptroller land commissioner and agriculture commissioner all of which are four year terms with the voter registration deadline coming up on oct 11 one tiktoker went viral advising texans to check and re check their voter registration status the poster claims a recent court ruling makes it possible for the state to pull the voter registration for anyone the state thinks is a noncitizen if you re in texas you need to check your voter registration every day until voting because of course a texas appeals judge just said they can withhold the list of people they think are noncitizens and shouldn t be able to vote the tiktoker says and they re not telling who s on that list if they think you re a noncitizen they can withhold you and your vote won t count verify viewer kimberly also asked us if it was true the state of texas is revoking people s voter registrations without telling them the question is the state of texas revoking people s voter registrations without telling them the sources the answer no the state of texas is not revoking people s voter registrations without telling them what we found the court ruling the tiktoker mentions dealt with noncitizen voters but it did not allow the state to revoke people s registration without notice before we get into the details of the ruling it s important to understand the state s process for flagging noncitizen voters and who is allowed to vote in the state of texas to vote in texas or any other state election you must be a u s citizen and 18 years of age or older on election day a full list of eligibility requirements is here according to sam taylor a spokesperson with the texas secretary of state which is the state s chief election officer the process to determine eligibility works like this if a person registers to vote then later goes into a texas department of public safety driver license office and indicates he or she is a non u s citizen then the person s registration is flagged to the county voter registrar with whom they are registered the county then sends a notification to the voter via mail that their registration has been flagged for potential non u s citizenship and the person has 30 days to respond to the county voter registrar with proof of u s citizenship if the person does not respond within 30 days the voter registration is canceled however the voter s registration can be reinstated immediately including at the polling place if the voter provides proof of u s citizenship taylor said in an email to verify according to texas election code a person who needs to prove citizenship can provide a certified copy of the voter s birth certificate united states passport or certificate of naturalization to re register to vote if they had their registration stripped texas is required to notify people that have been flagged as noncitizens under the national voter registration act of 1993 nvra which set the guidelines and voter registration requirements across the u s now to explain the details behind the court ruling according to court records earlier this year a coalition of civil rights groups sued the state after it refused to provide the list of more than 11 000 people the state said were identified as noncitizens and were ineligible to vote the goal of the suit was to make sure the state was complying with the nvra and that all the people on that list were actually not eligible to vote the groups asked the secretary of state to provide data about each individual including the date the person registered to vote the date their driver s license was issued and voting history the state denied the request saying releasing the list violated privacy laws in august a district court judge sided with the civil rights groups saying the state had to disclose the records but the appellate court reversed that decision on sept 29 saying the organizations named in the original case didn t have the authority to sue the state in the first place and therefore the state doesn t have to release the list that doesn t mean every voter in texas needs to check their registration status regularly to see if they have been labeled as a non citizen as the tiktoker claimed we can verify the court ruling was about releasing a list not about how the state flags who can and can t register to vote or be registered to vote
mr musk had asked to halt the upcoming delaware court trial where the tesla billionaire was expected to fare poorly against twitter s lawsuit to force him to complete his april merger agreement mr musk revived the takeover offer on monday but said he needed time to get the financing in order chancellor kathaleen st jude mccormick head of the delaware chancery court said on thursday that mr musk and twitter now have until october 28 to close the deal a trial originally set for october 17 will happen in november if they do not she said twitter had asked chancellor mccormick earlier on thursday to proceed with the trial saying the billionaire refuses to accept the contractual obligations of his april agreement to buy the social media company and take it private elon musk susan walsh ap twitter disputed mr musk s claim that the san francisco based company is refusing to accept his renewed bid mr musk told twitter earlier this week he is ready to buy the company once again after trying to back out of the deal over the summer accusing it of refusing to give him information about spam bot accounts on the service twitter described mr musk s move to delay the trial as an invitation to further mischief and delay after his arguments for terminating the agreement have not had merit but after the judge s ruling twitter reiterated in a statement that it was ready to close the deal on the share price agreed upon in april we look forward to closing the transaction at 54 20 dollars by october 28th referring to the price mr musk originally offered for each twitter share brooklyn law school professor andrew jennings said twitter wants to be certain that the deal will get done and not allow wiggle room for musk to walk away again musk lawyers argued that twitter was disagreeing with the trial delay based on the theoretical possibility of mr musk not coming up with the financing which they called baseless speculation they said mr musk s financial backers have indicated that they are prepared to honour their commitments and are working to close the deal by october 28 musk lawyer alex spiro said in a statement on thursday that twitter offered mr musk billions off the transaction price but mr musk refused because twitter attempted to put certain self serving conditions on the deal he did not elaborate on what those conditions were twitter has not described the talks beyond what its lawyers have said in court twitter s shares fell 1 91 dollars or 3 7 to close at 49 39 dollars on thursday it was the stock s second day of declines following a surge of more than 22 on tuesday after mr musk made his renewed offer to buy the company
key points originally poised to be one of the broadest non compete bans in the country washington d c s scaled back non compete law became enforceable on october 1 2022 the new law prohibits non competition provisions for covered employees but allows non competes with highly compensated employees that meet certain drafting and procedural requirements the new law does not prohibit non competition provisions with the seller of a business otherwise lawful confidentiality provisions or certain anti moonlighting provisions all d c employers with permissible workplace policies restricting employees use or disclosure of confidential information or outside employment activities must provide copies of the policies to affected d c employees by october 31 2022 and comply with additional notice requirements d c employers who violate the law will be subject to penalties after two years of delays and amendments washington d c s new non compete law finally became legally effective on october 1 2022 as summarized in our prior alert washington d c s original ban on non compete agreements amendment act of 2020 the 2020 legislation would have banned non competition agreements and anti moonlighting policies for virtually all d c employees backlash from the d c business community led the d c council to delay implementation of the 2020 legislation and pass a scaled back version in the form of the non compete clarification amendment act of 2022 amended act although non competition provisions entered into with covered employees on or after october 1 2022 are void and unenforceable the amended act permits non competition agreements with highly compensated employees and allows employers to utilize confidentiality agreements and anti moonlighting policies in certain circumstances the amended act also includes employer notice requirements and imposes penalties for violations non competition agreements entered into before october 1 2022 are not affected by the amended act however the new law applies to preexisting workplace policies and practices covered employers the amended act broadly applies to all employers defined as any individual partnership general contractor subcontractor association corporation or business trust operating in d c or any person or group of persons acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer operating in d c in relation to an employee the definition includes prospective employers but excludes the d c and united states governments scope of employees subject to non compete ban under the amended act non competition provisions are banned for any covered employee which is defined as an employee who is not a highly compensated employee and 1 spends more than 50 percent of his or her work time for the employer working in d c or 2 whose employment for the employer is based in d c and the employee regularly spends a substantial amount of his or her work time for the employer in d c and not more than 50 percent of his or her work time for that employer in another jurisdiction the term covered employee also includes new hires who have not yet started work if the employer reasonably anticipates that they will fall into one of the two foregoing groups employers navigating remote work arrangements and return to office requirements should keep this definition in mind for example assuming equal workdays the amended act would apply to a non highly compensated employee who regularly works from the employer s office in virginia two days a week but works remotely from his or her home in d c three days a week the following categories of people are excluded from the non compete ban and therefore can still be bound by non competition provisions 1 highly compensated employees 2 casual babysitters in or about the residence of the employer 3 partners in a partnership and 4 d c and federal government employees the term highly compensated employee means an employee other than a broadcast employee 1 who is reasonably expected to earn in a consecutive 12 month period or who has earned in the preceding 12 month period compensation greater than or equal to the minimum qualifying annual compensation which is currently 150 000 or if the employee is a medical specialist 250 000 beginning january 1 2024 these thresholds will increase each year based on increases in the department of labor s consumer price index for all urban consumers in the washington metropolitan statistical area for purposes of determining whether an employee meets these thresholds compensation is broadly defined as all monetary remuneration the employer may pay or promise the employee including hourly wages salary bonuses or cash incentives commissions overtime premiums vested stock including restricted stock units and other payments provided on a regular or irregular basis the definition of compensation however does not include fringe benefits other than those paid to the employee in cash or cash equivalents prohibited agreements and policies under the amended act eginning october 1 2022 no employer may require or request that a covered employee sign an agreement or comply with a workplace policy that includes a non compete provision the term non compete provision is defined as a provision in a written agreement or a workplace policy that prohibits an employee from performing work for another for pay or from operating the employee s own business of note the term workplace policy includes both written and unwritten rules and practices the amended act sets forth four categories of provisions that are excluded from the definition of non compete provision and therefore not affected by the new law provided that they are otherwise lawful non competition provisions in the sale of business context non disclosure or confidentiality provisions that prohibit or restrict an employee from disclosing using selling or accessing the employer s confidential or proprietary employer information anti moonlighting provisions that prohibit or restrict an employee from ccepting money or a thing of value for performing work for a person other than the employer during the employee s employment with the employer because the employer reasonably believes the employee s acceptance of money or a thing of value under such circumstances will a esult in the employee s disclosure or use of confidential employer information or proprietary employer information b onflict with the employer s industry s or profession s established rules regarding conflicts of interest c onstitute a conflict of commitment if the employee is employed by a higher education institution or d mpair the employer s ability to comply with district or federal laws or regulations a contract or a grant agreement a provision that provides a long term incentive which is defined as bonuses equity compensation stock options restricted and unrestricted stock shares or units performance stock shares or units phantom stock shares stock appreciation rights and other performance driven incentives for individual or corporate achievements typically earned over more than one year although the amended act clarifies some issues that arose under the 2020 legislation related to the scope of the ban a couple issues remain outstanding and will be subject to further legislation or judicial interpretation first the fourth exception related to long term incentives is unclear as the amended act does not specify whether the exception applies to any non competition covenants in a long term incentive agreement or whether it is limited to forfeiture for competition provisions or similar provisions under which the penalty imposed on the employee for competing against the employer is limited to forfeiture of the long term incentive as opposed to any ban or limitation on future employment the written testimony received by the d c council in july 2021 advocated for an exception under which the non compete ban would not apply to long term incentive awards that are forfeited if an employee joins a competitor suggesting that the exception may not have been intended to apply to all non competition covenants in a long term incentive agreement 2 second the amended act is silent about whether other restrictive covenants in the employment setting are permissible for covered employees such as prohibitions on the solicitation of customers or employees although it remains to be seen how courts interpret the amended act prior reports by the d c council s committee on labor and workforce development suggested that non solicitation provisions are not intended to be covered by the non compete ban 3 while the lack of any express mention of such provisions in the amended act suggests that they are not covered by the legislation employers can hedge against the possibility of courts applying the statute to non solicitation provisions by treating them in the same fashion under the amended act as express non competition clauses until there is definitive authority to the contrary requirements for non competition agreements with highly compensated employees for non competition agreements with highly compensated employees the amended act requires that such agreements include three things 1 he functional scope of the competitive restriction including what services roles industry or competing entities the employee is restricted from performing work in or on behalf of 2 the geographic scope of the restriction and 3 the term of the restriction which cannot exceed 365 days from the date of the employee s separation from employment or 730 days if the employee is a medical specialist these statutory requirements are in addition to the usual contractual requirements necessary for an enforceable agreement such as a valid offer acceptance and consideration to support the undertakings employers must provide highly compensated employees with a written copy of the non competition provision at least 14 days before the individual commences employment or if the individual is already employed at least 14 days before the individual must execute the agreement additionally whenever the non competition provision is proposed to a highly compensated employee the employer must provide the employee with a statutory notice that states the following the district s ban on non compete agreements amendment act of 2020 limits the use of non compete agreements it allows employers to request non compete agreements from highly compensated employees as that term is defined in the ban on non compete agreements amendment act of 2020 under certain conditions has determined that you are a highly compensated employee for more information about the ban on non compete agreements amendment act of 2020 contact the district of columbia department of employment services does required disclosures of workplace policies in addition to providing the above notice to highly compensated employees an employer with a workplace policy that includes one or more of the exceptions to the definition of non compete provision shall provide a written copy of the provisions to an employee 1 within 30 days after the employee s acceptance of employment 2 within 30 days after october 1 2022 i e by october 31 2022 and 3 any time such policy changes this disclosure requirement applies to all affected d c employees not only highly compensated employees although it appears that this disclosure requirement primarily was intended to require employers to disclose conflicts of interest restrictions the requirement can be read to apply more broadly to any workplace policy that is permitted under the amended act based on its exclusion from the definition of non compete provision 4 therefore employers should plan to provide affected employees with copies of any confidentiality or non disclosure policies anti moonlighting policies conflicts of interest policies or other policies that fit under the exception prohibited retaliation the amended act prohibits employers from retaliating against or threatening to retaliate against covered employees i e employees who cannot be subject to non competition provisions for 1 refusing to agree to a non competition provision 2 the covered employee s alleged failure to comply with a non competition provision that is prohibited under the amended act 3 asking informing or complaining to an employer coworker lawyer agent or governmental entity about the existence applicability or validity of a non competition provision that the employee reasonably believes is prohibited under the amended act 4 requesting a copy of the non competition provision or 5 asking the employer to provide the information required under the amended act s disclosure requirements the amended act also includes similar anti retaliation protections for highly compensated employees recordkeeping requirements the amended act instructs the mayor to issue rules to implement its provisions including ules requiring the preservation and retention of workplace policies non compete provisions non compete agreements the written disclosures required by and other records related to demonstrating compliance the amended act authorizes the mayor and the d c attorney general to inspect such records upon demand at any reasonable time collective bargaining agreements the amended act does not supersede the terms of a valid collective bargaining agreement consequences of violations any non competition agreement entered into on or after october 1 2022 that violates the amended act is void and unenforceable the amended act also subjects employers to administrative and civil penalties for violations the mayor may assess administrative penalties between 350 and 1 000 for each violation except that the penalty for each retaliatory act will be at least 1 000 additionally each aggrieved employee may pursue relief by filing an administrative complaint with the mayor or by filing a civil action in court to recover between 250 and 2 500 for each violation depending on the violation or at least 3 000 for certain subsequent violations recommended steps for employers employers should consider the following steps to ensure compliance with the new law evaluate the company s employee population including remote workers to identify all covered employees and all employees who meet the criteria for highly compensated employees review and update form offer letters non competition agreements and other agreements that will be provided to covered employees to remove any non competition provisions employers also should be sure to evaluate whether there is sufficient consideration to support such updated agreements for incumbent employees ensure that any new non competition agreements entered into with highly compensated employees comply with the amended act s drafting requirements and are supported by consideration agreements entered into before october 1 2022 do not need to be altered prepare procedure to comply with the 14 day advance notice and the written statutory notice requirements for highly compensated employees review and update written policies such as employee handbooks and codes of conduct and unwritten practices to ensure that they do not violate the amended act prepare plan to provide copies of any confidentiality or non disclosure policies anti moonlighting policies conflicts of interest policies or other applicable policies to all affected d c employees by october 31 2022 and any time these policies are changed and to new hires within 30 days after their acceptance of employment provide training to managers and hr personnel about the amended act s prohibitions and requirements keep an eye out for the rules to be issued by the mayor and comply with any recordkeeping requirements set a reminder to check for the new compensation threshold for highly compensated employees that will apply as of january 1 2024 1 broadcast employees as defined in the amended act cannot be bound by non competition provisions even if they earn 150 000 or more 2 see report on b24 256 the non compete clarification amendment act of 2022 committee on labor and workforce development council of the district of columbia at 27 june 16 2022 3 see e g id at 7 this committee has pointed out that non solicitation and non disclosure agreements are better suited and narrowly tailored to protecting trade secrets and other confidential information than non compete agreements 4 see id at 5 6 in most of the cases detailed by the businesses amendments allowing conflict of interest restrictions on employees would simply maintain the status quo that existed in those workplaces however with

recent international sorties by president marcos and his economic team appeared to bear fruit as the government raised a total of 2 billion in commercial bonds on thursday just a day after launching them in the global market despite volatile conditions the bureau of the treasury btr said the transactions cover 500 million in five year bonds 750 million in 10 5 year bonds and 750 million in 25 year green bonds the transactions are expected to be settled on oct 13 advertisement government bonds are essentially public debt and the bond buyers are the creditors the government intends to use the proceeds from the sale of the five and 10 5 year bonds for general purposes mainly budgetary support proceeds from the 25 year bonds will be used to finance or refinance assets under the government s sustainable finance framework the treasury said the total amount was a little less than the 2 25 billion raised in the national government s previous outing in march but with a much higher cost according to the btr the five year bond bears a coupon rate of 5 17 percent in march the duterte administration raised 500 million from five year bonds at 3 229 percent also the 10 5 year bonds have a coupon rate of 5 609 percent compared to 750 million at 3 556 percent in march the 25 year bonds were priced at 6 1 percent 1 billion at 4 2 percent in march in march the russian invasion of ukraine was just starting to send ripples of uncertainty across the global economy similarly just beginning was the trend of monetary policy normalization among central banks especially among developed economies like the united states which has sent the us dollar to its strongest position against other currencies in decades ny singapore briefings last month before this latest foray into the global bond market the president and his economic managers held economic briefings in singapore and new york receiving strong interest and attendance from international investors according to the btr advertisement the government navigated the volatile market and successfully priced the bonds despite the ongoing weakness in global credit markets amid high inflation and rising us interest rates it said the strong demand for our first international bond offering under president marcos administration demonstrates investor confidence in the new government and the administration s six year plan of economic transformation to a more inclusive resilient and prosperous economy finance secretary benjamin diokno said the eight point agenda of the new administration will improve real gdp growth improve government finances protect purchasing power mitigate socioeconomic scarring and create more quality jobs he said robust credit profile the latest global bond issues also follow the government s more recent outing in the japanese yen denominated debt market raising 70 1 billion yen about p29 billion from five seven 10 and 20 year green bonds finance undersecretary mark dennis joven said the repeated successes of the government s international bond issuances were a testament to the republic s robust credit profile and sound government finances in general a government that issues bonds is relatively less likely to default compared to a corporate borrower as a borrower the philippine government has investment grade credit ratings as assessed by major credit watchers such as moody s investors service fitch ratings and s p global ratings investment grade means that the borrowing has a relatively low risk of default and the borrower is capable of repaying the debt the new bonds would eventually form part of the national government s debt stock which was pegged at a record high of p13 02 trillion in august of that total 31 percent or p4 08 trillion is owed to foreign lenders as of end june the share of the philippines public debt to the economy was 62 1 percent the country s debt to gdp ratio fell to a record low 39 6 percent in 2019 but massive borrowings to finance cash assistance to poor households and the purchase of covid 19 vaccines bloated the debt pile the department of finance earlier said that the duterte administration contracted a total of 120 loans and global bond offerings worth 50 8 billion from july 2016 to december 2021 in may 2019 the philippines returned to the european bond market after 13 years selling 750 million in euro bonds under president benigno aquino iii the philippines issued its first peso denominated global bond raising p44 1 billion and becoming the first asian country to conduct a float using its own currency fear of more debts activists fear the marcos bonds would bury the country deeper in debt which he would pass on to future administrations he would be freed from the obligation of paying and would leave behind a huge debt said danilo ramos chair of the progressive farmers group kilusang magbubukid ng pilipinas kmp the philippines is already deep in debt with its p13 trillion existing debt which means every filipino essentially owes p118 000 he said bayan secretary general renato reyes was wary about where the fresh funds might be used especially if they were allocated for confidential and intelligence expenses pork barrel and counterinsurgency if malacañang insists that there should be no transparency when it comes to spending by the president then these new loans will only burden taxpayers he said referring to statements by executive secretary lucas bersamin on mr marcos two day visit to singapore to watch the formula 1 grand prix first 100 days bersamin had said that questions on whether public funds were used for that trip were irrelevant the bond sale comes as mr marcos is set to mark his first 100 days as president when he assumed office he promised to lower poverty to single digits and pledged to uplift the condition of farmers teachers health workers and migrants but instead of coming closer to fulfilling his promises mr marcos is enlarging public debt amid rising inflation reyes said we do not see real comprehensive solutions only speeches aimed at pleasing foreign interests and the local elite he said mr marcos has exhibited a knack for lavish living amid an

as the market cools aggressive tiger global looks to raise a fund that s half the size as its last in recent years assets under management at the investment firm tiger global have exploded now the firm is taking stock and winnowing down its operations per a new investor letter first seen by axios and obtained subsequently by techcrunch most significantly whether for lack of other options or just as likely in reaction to the changing market landscape the firm just let its limited partners know it plans to raise 6 billion for its newest fund for which it expects to hold a first close at least by mid january as an added sweetener investors in the first close will receive a discounted management fee of 1 75 states the letter while still a lot of moolah 6 billion is less than half the 12 7 billion that tiger global secured from investors back in march of this year money it began investing last fall and tore through quickly a source familiar with the firm says it is still investing out of that vehicle also shrinking is the capital that tiger global employees will be committing to the new fund whereas employees contributed 1 5 billion to tiger s 12 7 billion fund or 12 of the total amount this time they are committing to invest a minimum of 500 million to the 6 billion effort or a little less than 9 of the total amount this could rise what isn t getting smaller is the size of tiger global s bench suggests the firm while much was made on monday of the departure of john curtius a software investor who joined tiger global in 2017 tiger global has a slightly larger team than it did at the beginning of this year says a source familiar with the firm indeed in an investor letter that also came out monday tiger global stated it has recently hired five new investors including two individuals from blackstone two recent harvard graduates and a fifth investor evan stanleigh who joined the firm after a seven year stint as a partner with the new york hedge fund cadian capital either way low flying tiger global apparently didn t like the attention that curtius attracted as he segued out the door he confirmed to the information today that earlier reported plans for him to stay on with the 160 person outfit until june have changed and that he has already left tiger is going to do amazingly well and i m very excited for my next venture curtius told the outlet tiger s newest fund is its 15th though it s titled tiger global private investment partners xvi the outfit was a little superstitious when it reached fund 13 so skipped ahead one number fundraising for the vehicle won t be as easy as in recent years surely the market has changed dramatically since its team was last in the market and tiger global was particularly hard hit in the market downturn owing to an aggressive investing strategy that saw it writing massive checks into tech companies that in many cases are less valuable than they once were hopin for example a struggling young virtual events company backed by tiger is presumably valued nowhere near the 7 8 billion that investors deemed it was worth during the pandemic of course like a lot of investors having a lousy time of it tiger global is pointing to its historic returns and stating in its new investor memorandum that since inception in 2003 its funds have called down 36 billion and distributed 30 billion roughly 8 billion of which has flowed back to its investors over the past two years alone says a source close to the firm tiger global also says in that letter that it has a 34 gross irr and 24 net irr dating back to its earliest days that net irr is off by just 1 from earlier this year per an investor memo techcrunch obtained even while one might guess it would be more given current market conditions tiger global also says that its remaining portfolio represents 45 billion of fair value thanks largely to still private internet companies like bytedance shein stripe and razorpay whether those stakes will be enough to persuade currently capital constrained investors is the question they have reason to feel less confident in tiger global s heavily outsourced approach as the firm itself readily acknowledges this is not a year in which the scoreboard will make us proud said the firm in the investor letter that went out on monday e have a lot of work to do to earn back recent losses it added as always tiger global will also have plenty of challengers with which to contend including now the firm that curtius is reportedly creating called cedar investment management it is expected to compete on earlier stage deals with tiger whose average investment size once jaw dropping has decreased to 30 million over the last year the firm says in its investor letter editor s note this piece has been updated to remove speculation about employee moves inside of tiger global

economic overview for the 3rd consecutive meeting the us federal open market committee raised the short term fed funds rate by 75 basis points this latest hike reinforced what has been one of the most aggressive series of rate hikes in modern times investors meanwhile remained focused on inflation sensitive economic data in september looking for signs that hawkish fed policy was having an effect while core inflation may have peaked we have yet to see a meaningful decline in overall prices with energy perhaps the exception consumer prices edged up 0 1 in august while core cpi ex food energy rose a greater than expected 0 6 this translates into an 8 3 yoy move in headline inflation and a 6 3 yoy move in core cpi both numbers exceeded analyst estimates at the producer level we saw headline ppi drop 0 1 in august while core ppi surged higher by 0 4 on a trailing 12 month basis producer prices are up 8 7 yoy while core ppi is higher by 7 3 the fed s favored measure of inflation the pce deflator rose 6 2 yoy while the core deflator is higher by 4 9 versus one year ago content continues below advertisement the one area where higher interest rates are beginning to have an impact is housing with 30 year mortgage rates now firmly above 6 the fhfa house price index dropped 0 4 in july while the s p corelogic cs 20 city hpi fell by 0 44 existing home sales fell by 0 4 in august while pending home sale dipped 2 0 for a yoy decline of 22 5 housing data tends to come with a 1 to 2 month lag and we would anticipate further declines in home prices and sales as move further into the fall season the fomc s aggressive rate tightening shows little sign of abating any time soon at least according to fomc members most support a terminal rate somewhere in the 4 to 4 5 range with an intention of getting there sooner rather than later with the old adage being that the fed tends to tighten until something breaks that something may be upon us shortly as volatility picks up and credit availability dissipates more benign inflation readings may sway the fed to ease up on the pace of hikes but that data has not been reported yet domestic equity u s equities closed out the month of september on a low note with the benchmark s p 500 index falling 9 2 on the month to close at 3 586 september s closing print marked a new year to date low for the index which lost 4 9 during the quarter and is down 23 9 for the year markets fell sharply in september as the federal reserve remained steadfast in its quest to quash inflation the federal open market committee s fomc summary of economic projections showed a committee that expects gdp growth to slow markedly in 2022 unemployment to tick up and inflation to remain more elevated than previously projected taken together the fed s outlook pushed short term interest rates decisively above 4 on both the 1 and 2 year treasury to the highest levels in 15 years treasuries now offer investors a compelling alternative for incremental dollars in the short run with the super majority of s p 500 stocks now yielding less than short treasuries for the first time in more than a decade from a sector standpoint all 11 sectors finished the month in negative territory healthcare was the notable standout losing only 2 6 whereas other defensive sectors sold off with the market traditional defensive sectors such as utilities and consumer staples lost 11 3 and 8 0 respectively as their dividend yields now appear less attractive than short term treasuries the other notable laggard was information technology which lost 12 0 on the month as apple underperformed the broader market during the period despite having a positive return on the quarter with that said equity valuations reflect not only the higher short term yields mentioned earlier but also a level of market uncertainty not seen in a long time the s p 500 trades at 15 1x 2023 earnings estimates while the s p 600 smallcap trades at a mere 10 7x both attractive starting points for long term investors ahead of key company updates this month earnings season gets ready to kick off next week and all eyes will be on forward guidance and whether 2023 bottoms up earnings estimates are too high or not they ve remained somewhat resilient this year only down about 4 from their highs however companies are likely to blame a strong usd up 20 year to date and a soft chinese economy in their numbers perhaps more so than blaming inflation in past quarters how much of that is priced in already remains to be seen given both are widely known at this point when it comes to forward guidance it also remains to be seen just how resilient the us consumer is and whether or not corporate margins can hold up if the consumer is still strong consumption was positive within gdp in q1 and q2 despite headline contractions and inflationary factors are receding margins may come in better than feared this remains of paramount concern for investors as the questions of what multiple to use on what level of earnings both remain up for debate resulting in a wider than normal range of s p 500 price targets for the year ahead stay tuned international equity international risk assets continued their decline during the month of september as the msci acwi ex usa index fell 9 95 in usd terms emerging markets em as measured by the msci em index fell 11 71

briefly surged to 140 34 to the dollar but then fell to 144 60 late on friday the yen selling has been driven by the boj s ultra loose monetary policy in an environment where almost all major central banks have become more restrictive in an effort to tame global inflation fears over a worsening recession and the weakening currency caused the nikkei 225 index to fall 6 99 in jpy terms and 10 85 in usd terms during the month again highlighting the strength of the u s dollar abroad the msci china index posted a staggering 14 54 drop in usd terms during the month of september contributing to em s underperformance relative to dm beijing s zero covid quest regulatory crackdowns tensions with the west and a strengthening u s dollar all contributed to the negative performance year to date the

the federal reserve met this month announcing an increase in the federal funds target interest rate on wednesday september 21st they increased the target rate by 75 basis points the third consecutive increase of that size chairperson powell has remained focused in his recent public appearances avoiding any mealy mouthed statements that allow market participants to speculate that the fed will pivot in the near future and resume accommodative monetary policy he made that mistake during his press conference after the july meeting and it cost him and the fed significant credibility the fed s aggressive stance against inflation pushed interest rates higher across the treasury curve federal reserve members now expect to raise the federal fund rate to at least 4 by year end from its current target range of 3 3 25 the dot plot of rate expectations also shows that the fed expects rates to remain elevated throughout 2023 participants gdp growth expectations were revised lower and unemployment expectations were revised higher these changes are consistent with more restrictive monetary policy for an extended period corporate credit spreads moved wider in september as the risk off trend took over the markets investment grade corporate bond spreads charted new wides for 2022 surpassing the levels witnessed in june of this year high yield credit spreads remained slightly tighter than june levels but are close to the widest levels experienced this year the interest rate movement higher combined with spreads moving wider created a very difficult environment for corporate bonds in september investment grade bonds declined a little more than 5 while high yield fell close to 4 municipal bonds slightly underperformed treasury bonds in the month with shorter maturity issues declining in price at a faster rate than equivalent maturity treasury bonds even with this adjustment short maturity muni bonds remain less attractive than longer maturity muni bonds relative to treasury bond yields emerging market bonds continue to have a tough time in 2022 as riskier allocations underperform the exposure declined over 5 in september and has fallen over 20 year

recession grew the us dollar as measured by the bloomberg dollar spot index gained 3 23 in september and 6 13 during q3 this is the best quarterly performance for the us dollar since 2016 as the fed continued to raise rates swiftly in response to stickier and higher than expected inflation additionally the us dollar s reserve currency status led to its relative strength versus almost all other major currencies as global economic conditions worsened the dollar s strength was a headwind for commodities as the bloomberg commodity index finished the month down 8 35 oil prices as measured by wti crude oil declined 10 09 during the month and 19 62 for the quarter dollar strength higher interest rates and continued covid lockdowns in china the world s largest crude oil importer contributed to

economically vulnerable spot specifically when it comes to energy the nord stream 1 and nord stream 2 natural gas pipelines had multiple leaks in the same area during late september which appeared to be targeted attacks caused by explosions although those particular pipelines were inactive natural gas supply from russia has already been substantially cut to europe in recent months as a retaliation

merck nyse mrk known as msd outside the united states and canada and ridgeback biotherapeutics today issued the following announcement regarding data from two real world evidence studies evaluating lagevrio molnupiravir an investigational oral antiviral covid 19 medicine the first study panoramic was conducted by the university of oxford in the uk in highly vaccinated adults mostly less than age 65 during the period when the circulating sars cov 2 variant was predominantly omicron the second study clalit was conducted by investigators in israel in mostly older adults with underlying chronic health conditions that make them vulnerable to severe covid 19 disease also when omicron was the most dominant strain the panoramic pre print was published today and the clalit pre print was published last week additionally merck is reporting results from a recent carcinogenicity study in transgenic mice which demonstrated that lagevrio was not carcinogenic at any dose tested preliminary results from the panoramic study the panoramic study a uk based clinical trial sponsored by the university of oxford included 25 783 participants who were randomized to open label treatment with lagevrio plus usual care n 12 821 or usual care alone n 12 962 mean age of participants was 56 6 years primary outcome data were available in 25 000 97 participants nearly all 98 participants were vaccinated with approximately 95 receiving three or more doses of a sars cov 2 vaccine in the preliminary analysis the primary endpoint of reduction of hospitalizations and deaths within 28 days of randomization compared to usual care was not met 0 8 of patients in both the lagevrio group n 103 12 516 and the usual care group n 96 12 484 were hospitalized or died in the first 28 days on secondary objectives lagevrio was associated with improvement on a range of measures compared to usual care the observed median time to first self reported recovery the main secondary endpoint was 6 days shorter in the lagevrio group the median time to first recovery was 9 days on lagevrio range 5 23 days vs 15 days on usual care range 7 to not reached following adjustment for age and baseline comorbidity there was a substantial estimated improvement of 4 days in time to first recovery in the lagevrio group vs usual care group 10 4 days vs 14 5 days treatment benefit ratio 1 36 95 bayesian credible interval bci 1 3 1 4 the finding on time to first recovery was consistent for lagevrio across key subgroups secondary objectives were not adjusted for multiplicity results from the clalit study in this observational retrospective cohort study lagevrio was associated with a lower rate of hospitalizations and mortality due to covid 19 in patients 65 years and above but not in younger adults in patients 65 years of age and above n 13 569 hospitalizations related to covid 19 the primary endpoint occurred in 18 lagevrio treated patients 74 6 per 100 000 person days and in 513 untreated patients 127 6 per 100 000 person days adjusted hazard ratio hr for hospitalization was 0 55 95 confidence interval ci 0 34 to 0 88 the secondary endpoint of death due to covid 19 in this same age group occurred in 4 of 845 lagevrio treated and 137 of 12 724 untreated patients adjusted hr 0 26 95 ci 0 10 to 0 73 in patients 40 to 64 years of age n 6 229 hospitalizations related to covid 19 the primary endpoint occurred in 8 treated patients 125 8 per 100 000 person days and 97 untreated patients 49 1 per 100 000 person days and adjusted hr for hospitalization was 1 80 95 ci 0 86 to 3 77 the secondary endpoint of death due to covid 19 in this same age group occurred in 4 of 224 lagevrio treated and 7 of 6 075 untreated patients adjusted hr 12 82 95 ci 3 41 to 48 17 all four deaths in the lagevrio treated group occurred in patients 60 64 years of age the totality of the data from both panoramic and clalit give us critical insights into the ways certain patients may benefit from treatment with lagevrio these data also emphasize the critical need and value for lagevrio in the treatment of mild to moderate covid 19 for appropriate high risk patients most significantly the clalit study reinforces what the phase 3 move out study demonstrated a reduction in hospitalizations and mortality in an older population at high risk for progression to severe disease where a clinically meaningful benefit was observed said dr dean y li president merck research laboratories these findings particularly with regard to symptomatic improvement seen in a secondary objective in panoramic and the reduction in hospitalization and death rates seen in the older part of the patient population in clalit further support the urgent need for global access to lagevrio for the treatment of covid 19 in appropriate high risk patients with the continuing uncertainty about potential severity of emerging variants we are pleased that the real world data from israel showed that in an older part of the study population that experienced more hospitalizations rates of hospitalization and death were reduced in patients taking lagevrio also notable is the substantial reduction in time to symptom resolution observed on a secondary endpoint in panoramic even when background hospitalization rates were low the observed six day improvement symptom resolution in the panoramic study is an important finding as we look for ways to further reduce the burden of this virus as studies begin to assess how this medicine could potentially treat other significant illnesses with pandemic potential we will remain steadfast in our commitment to ensuring global access to this important treatment said wendy holman chief executive officer ridgeback biotherapeutics additional results panoramic secondary and virology endpoints on additional secondary objectives in the panoramic study compared to usual care lagevrio treated participants reported reduced time to sustained recovery 21 days vs 24 days reduced time to sustained alleviation of all symptoms 9 days vs 12 days reduced time to reduction of symptom severity 8 days vs 12 days higher self rating of wellness on days 7 14 and 28 fewer moderate or severe symptoms at day 7 14 and 28 for cough shortness of breath loss of taste smell and fatigue less health care seeking in primary care including less contacts with a general practitioner or the uk national health service nhs additionally a greater proportion of lagevrio patients reported early sustained recovery defined as recovered by day 14 and remained recovered until day 28 32 receiving lagevrio vs 23 receiving usual care sustained recovery defined as date participant first reported recovery and subsequently remained well until 28 days 69 vs 60 sustained alleviation of all symptoms defined as date symptoms first reported as minor or none and subsequently remained minor or none until 28 days 84 vs 79 in a substudy in which a cohort of participants was sampled for virology outcomes on day 7 sars cov 2 virus was below detection in 21 receiving lagevrio vs 3 receiving usual care the mean viral load on day 7 was lower on lagevrio 3 82 log10 viral load as compared to usual care 4 93 log10 viral load lagevrio was generally well tolerated with serious adverse events reported at a rate of 0 4 in both study groups and a low treatment withdrawal rate 1 1 about the panoramic study the panoramic trial platform adaptive trial of novel antivirals for early treatment of covid 19 in the community led by the university of oxford and funded by uk research and innovation ukri and national institute for health research nihr studied treatments approved by the uk medicines and health care products regulatory agency mhra including lagevrio in patients with confirmed covid 19 and ongoing symptoms the study is a pragmatic design trial intended to inform policy and public on treatments for covid 19 the study began recruitment in december 2021 and completed enrollment in april 2022 all during the era of the omicron variant the study was designed as an open label prospective individually randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety for lagevrio added to usual care compared to usual care alone in participants who have confirmed covid 19 infection in adults who were either 50 years of age or 18 years of age with comorbidities known underlying chronic health conditions making them clinically vulnerable to covid 19 infection usual care was predominantly focused on managing symptoms with antipyretics however participants at highest risk very impaired immunity or extremely clinically vulnerable were eligible for additional therapies including monoclonal antibodies sotrovimab and intravenous remdesivir overall 25 783 participants were randomized in the trial to lagevrio added to usual care or usual care alone the participant demographics baseline characteristics and other covid related characteristics at baseline were similar in the 2 groups the trial sample size was intentionally expanded during the course of the trial from the initial goal of 10 600 due to a very low observed event rate for the primary endpoint of hospitalizations deaths through day 28 observed 1 vs initial estimate of 3 approximately 20 of participants were aged 50 to 65 years without additional risk factors treatment with lagevrio standard dose 800 mg twice daily for 5 days added to usual care or usual care alone was initiated within 5 days of covid 19 symptom onset in participants confirmed to have a positive pcr or rapid antigen test for sars cov 2 in the past 7 days prior to treatment onset the median duration of covid 19 symptoms prior to treatment onset was 3 days overall 87 of participants received treatment within 5 days of symptom onset more than 95 of the participants reported taking lagevrio for the full 5 day treatment course about the clalit health services trial the clalit trial an observational retrospective cohort study evaluated data obtained from the electronic medical records of members of clalit health services chs a large healthcare organization covering approximately 65 of the elderly israeli population the study assessed the real world effectiveness of lagevrio in preventing severe covid 19 outcomes in patients 40 years of age and older estimated to be at high risk of progression to severe disease who were infected by the omicron variant and were not eligible for ritonavir boosted nirmatrelvir therapy due to drug drug interactions or impaired kidney function high risk was defined according to a predictive risk score developed in chs to evaluate the risk for severe covid 19 in sars cov 2 infected patients patients with a score of 2 points or more were considered high risk the most common coexisting conditions were obesity hypertension and diabetes the study period started on january 16 2022 the first day lagevrio was administered to chs patients and ended on march 31 2022 while the omicron variant ba 1 was the dominant sars cov 2 strain in israel a total of 1 166 404 chs members were infected with sars cov 2 during the study period of them 19 868 patients were eligible for lagevrio therapy 1 069 5 patients received at least one dose of lagevrio the mean age of the study participants was 69 years with 68 of the participants aged 65 years and older eighty two percent of participants had previous covid 19 immunity either by vaccination prior sars cov 2 infection or hybrid immunity patients residing in long term care facilities patients hospitalized before or on the same day of a positive sars cov 2 test and patients treated with ritonavir boosted nirmatrelvir or monoclonal antibodies were all excluded from the study recent hospitalizations active cancer and diabetes were associated with high rates of hospitalizations due to covid 19 across both age groups chronic heart failure active cancer disease prior cva and copd were prominent risk factors in patients aged 65 years or older in the younger age group immunosuppression and lack of prior immunity were strongly associated with the risk of hospitalizations related to covid 19 update on results from recent carcinogenicity study results from a recent study tg rash2 evaluating carcinogenicity in transgenic mice that received molnupiravir orally for six months at doses of 30 100 or 300 mg kg day demonstrated that lagevrio was not carcinogenic these results further support the safety profile of lagevrio about merck s global efforts to

updated october 6 2022 at 5 54 pm et some democrats in congress are furious about opec s decision to cut production by 2 million barrels of oil per day starting next month and are calling to reexamine ties with key oil producers and even withdraw u s military support from saudi arabia and the united arab emirates a trio of house democrats all in competitive reelection contests pennsylvania rep susan wild illinois rep sean casten and new jersey rep tom malinowski called the move a hostile act and a turning point in the relationship between the u s and the two gulf states late wednesday night and introduced legislation to remove u s military support from the two countries malinowski told npr that he believes the move was deliberate to hurt the u s as it supports ukraine in the war the russian invasion and deserves a swift response in an interview thursday he said i just don t see any good reason for us to maintain troops that are there almost solely for the purpose of protecting their oil fields and their security interest it just doesn t make sense to me pool getty images getty images rep tom malinowski d n j is one of several democrats pushing to withdraw u s military support from saudi arabia and the uae following opec decision to cut oil production the move comes weeks before the midterm elections with gas prices rising again malinowski said there s no question that mbs particularly the crown prince of saudi arabia shares putin s worldview more than he shares ours he doesn t appreciate american advocacy for democracy in the world legislation uses u s military support as leverage the new jersey democrat said the bill is an exact copy of a bill that senate republicans pushed when trump was in the white house to give him leverage when the saudis were producing more oil to push the price down to harm u s production he said gop lawmakers at the time were on board and the threat of pulling out military support worked then and he hopes they will support this effort malinowski has spoken with officials at the white house and state department but declined to describe their reaction democrats were divided on whether it was a good idea for president biden to travel to saudi arabia and meet with the leadership over the summer malinowski said i felt that the trip was ill advised i didn t think we d get much from it at the same time i didn t think the saudis would go to these lengths to screw us the number 2 senate democratic leader sen dick durbin tweeted sharp criticism of the saudi royal family saying they have never been a trustworthy ally and it s time for our foreign policy to imagine a world without their alliance according to a recent report from the white house to congress roughly 2 700 u s personnel are deployed to saudi arabia to protect u s interests and protect against hostile action from iran or iranian backed groups there are roughly 2 000 troops in the uae the decision is already having an impact on gas prices which had been trending down in recent weeks according to aaa the national average for regular gasoline rose from 3 831 per gallon to 3 867 just a day later due to tight supply and steady demand with the midterm elections less than 5 weeks away and the country facing record high inflation democrats were already concerned that economic concerns would help fuel the ability of republicans to retake one or both chambers of congress the gop is favored to win a majority in the house of representatives and control of the senate is a jump ball with tight races in a small number of swing states last month an effort pushed by sen joe manchin d w va to include legislation reforming the permitting process for energy projects to a government funding bill was blocked facing bipartisan

organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to cut oil production by 2 million barrels per day pic twitter com sep4n2lcwl senator joe manchin sen_joemanchin october 5 2022 biden looks for alternatives to opec oil on thursday president biden told reporters he was disappointed in the decision by opec and said we re looking at what alternatives we might have asked whether easing sanctions on venezuela was under consideration biden said there s a lot of alternatives we haven t made up our mind yet malinowsi said i find it incredibly distasteful and disturbing that we depend on dictators who hate us for our energy and the way to avoid that was to accelerate a transition to clean energy and get away from relying on places like russia iran venezuela and saudi arabia for the global energy supply biden administration officials have recently discussed ramping up pressure on u s oil companies to increase production specifically for the gap in prices between the wholesale price and the price consumers are paying at the pump other options to offset the decrease in supply would be to tap additional oil from the strategic petroleum reserve or work with european allies to purchase oil at below market prices from russia top house republicans response to opec s announcement focused less on their squeeze and its impact on u s consumers and instead used the news to redouble their criticism of biden s radical climate agenda in a joint statement rep steve scalise r la rep jeff duncan r s c and rep markwayne mullin r okla urged a pivot to a strategy the gop has pushed for years instead of begging foreign countries for oil and raiding our strategic petroleum reserve president biden should reverse his anti american policies and unleash domestic energy production making the united states energy independent again would lower energy costs for americans and reduce our reliance on opec for oil by once again becoming a net exporter of energy the united states can harness its resources to meet not only our needs but also the needs of our allies many democrats maintain that biden has pressed u s oil companies to increase production but they have been resistant and have been reaping profits that have gone to stock buybacks instead of investing in new capacity no quick action on punitive measures any legislative efforts would have to wait until after the election both chambers are in recess with members focused on the final five week stretch until the midterms on nov 8 according to some aides familiar with discussions on the issue lawmakers may push to attach something to the annual defense authorization bill that is expected to be considered in the lame duck session in november for now malinowski acknowledged the bill was a signal to the president about the need to change the posture toward a longtime ally and he would need to sign off on it if the measure made to his desk malinowski added it s unclear how quickly the cuts would go into effect and impact prices at the pump but argued i do think it s important for the president to get ahead of that and to show the saudis the emiratis and the american people that we re not going to stand for this durbin who chairs the senate judiciary committee called for quick passage when congress returns of a bill called the nopec no oil producing and exporting cartels act that measure which cleared the committee with bipartisan support would allow the justice department to bring antitrust lawsuits against members of the oil cartel and clarify that existing laws can t shield foreign countries from charges of illegal price fixing senate majority leader chuck schumer mentioned that bill as one option he is considering bringing up later this fall what saudi arabia did to help putin continue to wage his despicable vicious war against ukraine will long be remembered by americans we are looking at all the legislative tools to best deal with this appalling and deeply cynical action including

q3 results have cited adverse currency movement it s a small sample so far but half of the s p 500 companies that have so far reported third quarter results have said they were hurt by the strong

reporting thus far have cited high labor costs as a check on earnings while 55 mentioned supply chain disruptions those numbers are in keeping with recent trends factset said what s changed is the 50

this number has increased and the first time in the past four quarters that the number reflected at least 50 of the companies reporting at this point in time in the earnings season factset said of the

achieving a soft landing for the u s economy amid rate hikes to tame high inflation is looking less likely amid continued labor market strength according to ron temple head of u s equity strategy at lazard asset management while job growth is slowing the us economy remains far too hot for the fed to achieve its inflation target temple said in a friday note the path to a soft landing keeps getting more challenging the friday jobs report showed that employers added 263 000 jobs in september and that the unemployment rate fell to 3 5 that s a relatively strong labor market even if job gains are slowing it means the fed will likely be aggressive with interest rate hikes going forward if there are any doves left on the fomc today s report might have further thinned their ranks said temple carmen reinicke employment data unlikely to push fed off course economist says friday s employment data shows the job market is heading in the right direction said andrew hunter senior u s economist at capital economics but he doesn t see it as convincing to the federal reserve to change course from its strategy of raising rates as a means to fight inflation the 263 000 gain in non farm payrolls in september is another signal that labor market conditions are cooling hunter said but with the unemployment rate dropping back to 3 5 the report is unlikely to significantly alter the fed s view
