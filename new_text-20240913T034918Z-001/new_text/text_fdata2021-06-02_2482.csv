over her career dr kristen hege has come to see cell therapies that once hoped to target hiv now helping cancer patients live years longer hege s work came to a head in march when the food and drug administration approved bristol myers squibb co s nyse bmy abecma to treat relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients the company is presenting fresh data from abecma s 127 patient pivotal trial at this week s american society of clinical oncology conference one of the biggest cancer meetings of the year that show patients treated with certain types of immune system modulating drugs who then received abecma lived a median of 24 8 months this really does feel like a leap forward said hege site head of bms s 100 person san francisco research center in mission bay it s more than data for hege while she was an oncology fellow at the university of california san francisco hege joined a small south san francisco biotech company cell genesys inc as vice president of clinical research and development she and her team dove into chimeric antigen receptor t cell car t therapies that take the immune system s infection fighting t cells and re engineer them to help the cells track down specific proteins only cell genesys originally thought cell therapies would fight off hiv the virus that causes aids the company also launched the first solid tumor car t trial in colorectal cancer it was the mid 1990s and there were a lot of things we still didn t know hege said the trial failed to proceed and cell genesys shifted to cancer vaccines and prostate cancer the company also dabbled preclinically in boosting t cells with a protein called cd28 but never got to the point where we could advance that because we ran out of money hege said cell genesys closed in 2008 but as so often happens in the biotech industry hege three years later reconnected with cell genesys former head of research who had landed at bluebird bio nasdaq blue by then she was vice president of translational development in hematology oncology at celgene corp s san francisco research site car t work was starting to take off again now focused primarily on blood cancers instead of solid tumors with university of pennsylvania scientist dr carl june and others leading the way celgene and cambridge massachusetts based bluebird linked up and jumpstarted work on idecabtagene vicleucel which would be branded as abecma i like to think of it as kind of coming full circle hege said but that s not the end of the story bms bought celgene in november 2019 for 74 billion and the fda on march 26 approved abecma to treat adults with multiple myeloma that has relapsed or is refractory or unmanageable after four or more prior lines of therapy the drug is what s known as a b cell maturation antigen directed or bcma directed autologous car t therapy in simpler terms the therapy involves harvesting t cells from a patient s own body and re engineering them to target the bcma protein on multiple myeloma cells abecma has potentially life threatening side effects including difficulty breathing fever and twitching as well as a boxed warning that it could induce cytokine release syndrome the explosion of inflammation also seen in covid 19 patients still abecma was bms s second entry into the car t space which includes its breyanzi which won approval in february and yescarta from foster city based gilead sciences inc s nasdaq gild kite pharma unit there also is renewed interest in turning car t therapies against solid tumors just like hege and her team tried to do at cell genesys 20 years ago in fact hege pulled her old team together again a few years ago to finally publish the results of that cell genesys trial in solid tumors in the journal for immunotherapy of cancer in 2017 it sat on my to do list for 20 years she said adding that publishing the article involved pulling some data off an old computer stored in her garage what s happened in the intervening two decades she said is the discovery that adding certain receptors in the car meant that t cells could receive primary signals about the targeting protein as well as stimulate the t cell to act on the signal what s more the national cancer institute and others fine tuned chemotherapy given before the infusion of car t cells helping the freshly engineered cells expand as the body tries to rebuild its own t cell population that was sort of the difference between middling data in the early days and high rates of frequency and comparable responses in the modern era of car t cells hege said bms s work on cell therapy against solid tumors depends largely on finding the right targets that don t show up on normal tissue hege said the company has partnerships with small biotech companies including a deal disclosed earlier this year with ucsf spinout arsenal bio inc of south san francisco in search of novel t cell receptor targets for example bms s targets include so called endogenous antigens generated by previously normal cells that show up on the surface of a cancer cell it opens up a whole new field of potential targets she said
nominal and real interest rates in the major advanced economies short term and long term have trended downwards since the early 1980s we see this in figures 1 and 2 figure 1 short term nominal and real interest rates in germany and the us 1965 2020 source oecd and esrb calculations note short term interest rates are based on three month money market rates real rates are calculated by subtracting the annual cpi inflation rate figure 2 nominal and real ten year government bond yields in germany and the us 1957 2020 source oecd and esrb calculations note yields are based on ten year constant maturity government bond yields real yields are calculated by subtracting the annual cpi inflation rate the natural or neutral equilibrium real interest rate r that would support full employment at stable and low inflation is not directly observable many efforts to estimate it reach similar results however as shown for the euro area in figure 3 figure 3 estimates of euro area equilibrium real interest rate q1 1999 to q4 2019 source schnabel 2020 notes ranges span point estimates across models to reflect model uncertainty and no other source or r uncertainty the dark shaded area highlights smoother r estimates that are statistically less affected by cyclical movements in the real rate of interest latest observation q4 2019 with low and stable inflation the decline in r has forced policy rates down towards their effective lower bound this now appears to be somewhat though not much below zero market rates too are very low whether policy rates or market rates the low interest rate environment lire has implications for financial stability and therefore raises issues for macroprudential policy the european systemic risk board esrb which oversees macroprudential policy in the eu has just published a second report discussing macroprudential policy issues arising from the lire in the eu financial system esrb 2021 this work began at the end of 2019 and builds on an earlier report which the esrb published in 2016 the time horizon for our analysis is medium term five to ten years ahead while the report acknowledges cross country heterogeneity its focus is mainly on the eu financial system as a whole and on interest rates in the eu the report begins with an analysis of how the lire has been driven mainly by structural factors such as demographic developments including rising life expectancy and falling population growth rates acemoglu and johnson 2007 backus et al 2014 aksoy et al 2019 falling relative price of investment goods and the rising share of intangible investment karabarbounis and neiman 2014 thwaites 2015 slowing pace of technological innovation gordon 2016 falling marginal product of capital related to demography and technical progress cochrane 2021 rising wealth and income inequality summers 2014 rachel and summers 2019 rising savings rates in developing countries and the consequent rising demand for assets issued by advanced economies bernanke 2005 and evolution of the consumption wealth ratio gourinchas et al 2020 this literature is related to the secular stagnation hypothesis revived by summers in his speech at the imf research conference in 2013 in addition regulatory changes and the more risk averse positioning adopted by financial institutions after the global financial crisis gfc have further boosted the demand for safe assets putting more downward pressure on real interest rates and on risk premia many of these developments and the trend decline in r hold not just for the euro area but also for the us and japan and to some extent interest rates are transmitted globally the global financial cycle see rey 2013 two recent analyses support low for long kiley 2020 reviews the literature and adds his own econometric study concluding a range of approaches to estimating the equilibrium real interest rate confirm a pronounced downward trend among advanced economies in the level of real short term interest rates likely to prevail over the longer term gourinchas et al 2020 agree our estimates indicate that short term real risk free rates are expected to remain low or even negative for an extended period of time but what about the covid 19 shock the report acknowledges that contractionary monetary policies responding to a temporary rise in inflation and increases in term premia due to a temporary surge of uncertainty could increase rates if they were to occur we would not expect such effects to be lasting as long as the structural factors that have exerted downward pressure on the natural rate of interest persist the lire will remain in place at least in the medium term according to the report in fact the report s detailed overview of the effects of the covid 19 shock concludes that it may have increased the probability and persistence of a low for long scenario so even lower for even longer the risk analysis of the report identifies four key areas of concern in the lire the profitability and resilience of banks as the lire accentuates the negative effects of existing structural problems in the eu banking sector including overcapacity and cost inefficiencies the indebtedness and viability of borrowers as the lire facilitates higher leverage and encourages search for yield behaviour systemic liquidity risk as the lire and structural changes have made the financial system more sensitive to market shocks the sustainability of the business models of insurers and pension funds offering longer term return guarantees as they experience increasing pressures in the lire for example the search for yield in a fragile banking sector is clear figure 4 eu banks credit allocation and net interest income net interest margins and portfolio shifts december 2014 to june 2020 data for eu banks provide evidence of the search for yield in the lire of recent years net interest margins trended downwards banks responded by increasing interest earning assets and shifting the composition of their assets towards riskier market segments including towards commercial real estate consumer lending and smes further examples abound systemic liquidity risks the fragility of money market funds and the destabilising role of highly levered non bank intermediaries were all manifest in the march 2020 market disruptions the eu 2019 pension fund stress test found that even under the baseline scenario the institutions for occupational retirement provision iorps were underfunded by 41 billion on aggregate 4 of their liabilities when using the regulator s common methodology the report s risk analysis gives details of these and many other lire related risks addressing such risks requires broad ranging macroprudential policy responses beyond the scope of existing instruments which are limited mainly to the banking sector and borrower based measures for households based on national legislation the current macroprudential toolkit does not provide instruments that can be used to deal directly with risks related to structural changes in the financial system for example a move from traditional banking activities and related risks to non bank financial intermediation requires the development of macroprudential policy beyond banking and of activity based regulation the rise of indebtedness and leverage the risks to market liquidity the weaknesses in the eu banking insurance and pension fund sectors all pose risks to financial stability that the macroprudential framework should recognise for each of the four areas of concern the report suggests a range of policy options to mitigate systemic risk and to improve systemic risk analysis policy options for mitigating systemic risks 1 the profitability and resilience of banks address overcapacity by removing potential obstacles to banking sector consolidation and restructuring reconsider the framework for dealing with weak banks re evaluate incentives for banks digital transformation and improving cost efficiency assess legal restrictions on the application of negative interest rates to deposits 2 the indebtedness and viability of borrowers develop measures to prevent and resolve high levels of corporate indebtedness develop a common minimum toolkit of borrower based measures targeted at households 3 systemic liquidity risk move towards macroprudential liquidity requirements 4 the sustainability of the business models of insurers and pension funds offering longer term return guarantees include macroprudential measures for the insurance sector in the solvency ii review in line with a separate esrb report on macroprudential policy for the insurance sector establish a recovery and resolution framework for insurance companies consider issues and policy proposals raised in this and the 2016 lire reports for pension funds in the eu s review of the current directive on institutions for occupational retirement provision policy options for improving systemic risk analysis 1 the indebtedness and viability of borrowers build an enhanced credit and debt monitoring capacity 2 systemic liquidity risk improve liquidity reporting and a more efficient use of already available data implement system wide liquidity stress tests 3 the sustainability of the business models of insurers and pension funds offering longer term return guarantees create an eu wide monitoring framework of lire related risks for icpfs for each of the objectives set out above the report identifies specific policy options for instance the relevant authorities should continue their efforts to improve the current framework for dealing with distressed banks in europe to facilitate and ensure the orderly exit of non viable institutions in particular small and medium sized banks in view also of the need to reduce overbanking and foster system profitability in the lire relevant authorities are also encouraged to consider eliminating legal obstacles to charging negative rates in their jurisdictions with no requirement for banks to apply negative rates to deposits or loans at this stage these should not be seen as esrb recommendations but instead as blueprints for medium term policy objectives the esrb may selectively choose some of these proposals to be refined and further developed into more concrete esrb recommendations an appendix with three analytical boxes and over 50 charts and tables supports the text of the report authors note the authors served as co chairs of the esrb task force on the low interest rate environment we are very

results are being presented at the virtual annual european congress of rheumatology eular june 2 5 2021 in a post hoc analysis of the phase 3 ra beam study patients treated with olumiant 4 mg saw greater improvements in pain relief and physical function as well as reduced duration of morning joint stiffness at 12 weeks compared to humira and placebo these differences in pain relief were not influenced by disease activity during treatment in this analysis improvements in fatigue with olumiant 4 mg were greater than with placebo and similar to humira after 12 weeks of treatment safety

opportunistic pathogens carefully consider the risks and benefits of olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with olumiant including the possible development of tb in patients who tested negative for latent tb infection prior to initiating therapy malignancies lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with olumiant thrombosis thrombosis including deep venous thrombosis dvt and pulmonary embolism pe has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with olumiant compared to placebo in addition there were cases of arterial thrombosis many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated warnings and precautions serious infections the most common serious infections reported with olumiant included pneumonia herpes zoster and urinary tract infection among opportunistic infections tuberculosis multidermatomal herpes zoster esophageal candidiasis pneumocystosis acute histoplasmosis cryptococcosis cytomegalovirus and bk virus were reported with olumiant some patients have presented with disseminated rather than localized disease and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids avoid olumiant in patients with an active serious infection including localized infections consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating olumiant in patients with chronic or recurrent infection who have been exposed to tb with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses or with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection closely monitor patients for infections during and after olumiant treatment interrupt olumiant if a patient develops a serious infection an opportunistic infection or sepsis do not resume olumiant until the infection is controlled tuberculosis before initiating olumiant evaluate and test patients for latent or active infection and treat patients with latent tb with standard antimycobacterial therapy olumiant should not be given to patients with active tb consider anti tb therapy prior to initiating olumiant in patients with a history of latent or active tb in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed and for patients with a negative test for latent tb but who have risk factors for tb infection monitor patients for tb during olumiant treatment viral reactivation viral reactivation including cases of herpes virus reactivation e g herpes zoster were reported in clinical studies with

the financial standing of black and white americans is anything but equal when it comes to wealth and income major disparities persist despite the years of economic prosperity that preceded the coronavirus pandemic this long standing racial divide has garnered renewed attention in the biden administration which has committed to improving equity as it guides the nation out of the virus fueled economic downturn also bringing the unequal fortunes of blacks and whites into the spotlight the centennial of the race massacre that destroyed of the greenwood section of tulsa oklahoma which was known as black wall street the numbers are staggering the typical non hispanic white family had nearly eight times the net worth of the typical non hispanic black family in 2019 according to the most recent federal reserve bank data that gap stems in part from lower rates of home ownership and smaller inheritances among blacks wealth is all the more important these days since it serves as a safety net during economic downturns and black americans are not benefiting from the run up in stock prices and home values as much as white americans are since they are less likely to own these assets the median income of black americans in 2019 tied prior highs according to the most recent us census bureau data but non hispanic white americans saw their median income hit a record thanks to the booming economy so the racial divide remained black workers face significant wage gaps in the labor market and these differentials have grown since 2000 according to the economic policy institute the disparity is another reason why it s more difficult for black families to save and build wealth than it is for white households one area that has improved over time is the gap in unemployment rates for decades the jobless rate for black americans was typically more than twice that for white americans but it had narrowed to the smallest pre pandemic differential on record in 2019 amid the economic prosperity black americans however were hit very hard by the coronavirus fueled downturn suffering a record number of job losses in the early months of the outbreak last year according to the economic policy institute they are also seeing a slower recovery as the economy improves the unemployment rate for black americans was 9 7 in april compared to 6 in february 2020 before the pandemic began according to the us labor department but for white americans the rate is 5 3 compared to 3 in february 2020 the poverty rate for black americans in 2019 was the lowest on record according to the census bureau but at 18 8 it remains far more than double that of non hispanic white americans who had a poverty rate of 7 3 the gap is even more striking among children more than a quarter of black children fell below the poverty line in 2019 compared to 8 3 of white children

if you think about since 2017 you think about 18 19 and 20 it s just been busy all all above average years so as a result the pattern looks the same so we re really looking at some sort of hurricane season in 2021 that probably will be above average again yeah six years in a row we ve actually had um systems developed before the hurricane season in the atlantic so it s it s one of these things that were warmer the oceans have been prime everything has really come together before the season most of those storms aren t very strong but they still can bring heavy rainfall that can still bring those gusty winds and some of that storm surge so six years in a row we ve seen that happen but we re still looking at the strongest storms in that august september october time frame advertisement amazon opens disaster relief hub to help with quick delivery of supplies during hurricane season share copy link copy the 2021 atlantic hurricane season officially begins tuesday and it is forecast to be yet another busy one with an active season in mind amazon and the red cross are hoping a brand new disaster relief hub and partnership will allow for a faster response to locations hit by hurricanes and other natural disasters our disaster relief and response team is partnering with global humanitarian relief organizations to leverage amazon s scale to help improve response time to large scale natural disasters around the world alicia boler davis vice president of global customer fulfillment at amazon said in a news release to cnn amazon is announcing the opening of its disaster relief hub in georgia to quickly help respond to natural disasters and its partnership with six global humanitarian aid organizations including the red cross trevor riggen senior vice president for disaster services with the american red cross says that this new venture blends its own disaster response background with amazon s delivery know how this most recent effort in the disaster relief hub is an opportunity for us the red cross to leverage their amazon s expertise in logistics and be able to work with them to get resources just in time to places that are hard to get stuff to riggen said places that are difficult to move resources without a plane and amazon has that capability to move things quickly this includes places like puerto rico the u s virgin islands latin america the caribbean and even rural and remote regions of the united states the amazon hub located in atlanta will stock over half a million amazon donated relief supplies there will be enough supplies stocked up to immediately fill an amazon air 767 airplane to quickly deliver critical goods to community partners when a disaster strikes the program started because of a letter to the former ceo of amazon jeff bezos actually received a letter from somebody in louisiana in 2016 when floods hit and said amazon is the best at getting stuff into the most remote areas of the united states how can you help us get supplies here said bettina stix director of disaster relief at amazon that was really the vision i had we can reach even the most rural communities we have transportation methods to get there after a natural disaster emergency teams assess what supplies they have procure items they need and then consolidate pack and ship supplies into disaster zones this process can take several days to shorten the procedure amazon studied its disaster support data across four years and formed a strategy location is everythingthe organizations chose the atlanta location due to its close proximity to the areas most often hit by hurricanes atlanta for example is just 300 miles from the gulf coast around 700 miles from the bahamas and within 1 500 miles of puerto rico and other caribbean islands in the u s rural locations can pose problems when roads get washed away southwest louisiana was hit multiple times last year by different tropical systems during hurricane sally last year the pensacola bay bridge was heavily damaged limiting not only people trying to evacuate out but aid from getting in in the caribbean many islands can be difficult to reach right after a disaster hits making planes the only accessible way to get in since 2017 we ve had hurricane maria irma dorian they all hit islands and as we know the crucial way to get in there is by airplane that s the fastest way stix said not only did all of those hurricanes hit islands but all reached category 5 strength the highest level possible for a tropical cyclone hurricane dorian was uniquely devastating not only was it one of the strongest on record in the atlantic basin but it was stationary or nearly stationary over the bahamas for more than 24 hours as a category 4 5 storm said taylor ward a cnn meteorologist this made for one of the worst natural disasters in the country s history the extreme strength devastated the area and the slow movement delayed humanitarian relief from arriving the hope is that if a similar disaster occurs precious time won t be lost from locating sorting and packing the relief items forecast calls for another active hurricane seasonthis year could see the sixth consecutive above average hurricane season according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration this year also marked the seventh year in a row that at least one named tropical system has formed in the atlantic prior to the official start of the season we do prepare every year as if it is going to be a very busy disaster season but when we see these forecasts with almost a guarantee that there is going to be an above average amount of activity that tells us that we re going to be busy all summer and into the fall riggen said a lot of pre planning goes into a busy season like this to make sure regardless of the level of activity that we ve got enough resources and we re able to move those just in time he said since its inception in 2017 amazon s disaster relief and response efforts have provided over 13 million items and tens of millions of dollars to support community partners worldwide during 59 separate natural disasters according to amazon how to prepare for the unknownthere s three phases that the red cross goes through during an operation the what where and when people don t always need the cleanup supplies minute one they need the relief supplies they need to make sure they can keep their family safe that they have food and water right after the storm that s the what riggen said then there s the where where are the people you have to take into account that some people move to a shelter stay with family members or in some cases an entire community is evacuated to a neighboring community so those supplies need to go to where people are after the disaster not before there s also another factor to consider connectivity people want wifi connections and the ability to use their cell phones not just the people who live in those communities affected by the storms but also the first responders and aid workers the ability to communicate with your loved ones to tell them that you are ok after disaster strikes or the ability of responders to communicate with the communities and with each other is critical the amazon web services disaster response program which tracks global disasters will also partner with organizations like help ngo and information technology disaster resource center by helping people access critical data locally the aws and itdrc will show up to a disaster scene with generators satellite dishes wi fi repeaters and miles of cable these volunteers work to establish temporary connectivity when the power is out and there are zero bars of cell phone service at the same time telecommunications and utility companies can focus on repairing the permanent infrastructure food water and shelter are essential for disaster recovery but the ability to distribute those essentials relies heavily on good communication about 30 of all atlantic hurricanes make u s landfall however you don t need to have all of the forecast storms make landfall in the u s for it to be a destructive season it doesn t matter if there s 30 storms or one if it impacts you it s a busy season said ken graham director of the national hurricane center if that one strikes this partnership may help lessen the inevitable disruption an unwelcome system from the tropics brings

oral small molecule inhibitor of hypoxia inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase activity that acts by stimulating the body s natural pathway for red cell production the class period commences on october 18 2017 when fibrogen announced that the china food and drug administration cfda had accepted its new drug application nda for roxa based on two phase 3 studies in china one study in ckd comparing roxadustat against a branded epoetin alfa and one study in ckd non dialysis comparing roxadustat against placebo both studies had met their primary efficacy endpoints with no new or unexpected safety signals identified fibrogen touted these studies positive safety throughout the class period having overcome the hurdle of demonstrating to the cfda that roxa was safe enough to submit an nda fibrogen proceeded to present itself as ready to conduct phase 3 trials sufficient to support an nda to the u s food and drug administration fda in 2019 fibrogen filed its nda with the fda for the approval of roxa for the treatment of anemia due to ckd the truth began to emerge on march 1 2021 when after the market closed fibrogen announced that the fda was scheduling an advisory committee meeting to review roxa s nda well over a year after its initial submission an advisory committee meeting this late in the review process indicates that there is a problem with the application and could at best delay the fda s approval decision and at worst signal that the fda may not approve the drug following this news fibrogen s stock price fell by 12 46 per share or 25 then on april 6 2021 after the

reduce the risk of cardiovascular events or hospitalization as compared to a currently approved anemia injection used as a control based on pre specified stratification factors following this news fibrogen s stock price fell 14 90 or 43 to close at 19 74 per share on april 7 2021 the complaint alleges that throughout the class period the defendants made false and or misleading statements or failed to disclose that 1 based on the safety data from fibrogen s two phase 3 trials in china any safety data obtained from the global phase 3 trials would require post hoc changes to the stratification factors to meet the fda s requirements 2 fibrogen s disclosures of u s primary cardiovascular safety analyses from the roxa global phase 3 program for the treatment of anemia submitted in connection with ckd included post hoc changes to the stratification factors 3 fibrogen s analyses with the pre specified stratification factors resulted in higher hazard ratios point estimates of relative risk and 95 confidence intervals 4 based on these analyses fibrogen could not conclude that roxa reduces the risk of or is superior to mace in dialysis and mace and mace in incident dialysis compared to epoetin alfa 5 as a result fibrogen faced significant uncertainty that its nda for roxa as a treatment for anemia of ckd would be approved by the fda and 6 as a result of the foregoing the

if there are things that you need to stock up on you should do it right away for weeks i have been writing articles about the rampant inflation that we are witnessing right now we haven t seen anything like this since the jimmy carter era of the 1970s and many are warning that it is going to get even worse in the months ahead so that means that prices are never going to be lower than they are at this moment even more importantly we are also being warned that the widespread shortages in our economy are about to get even worse in fact the largest meatpacker in the entire world was just hit by a cyberattack and this has forced it to stop activity at its plants in several u s states the white house said on tuesday that brazil s jbs sa has informed the u s government that a ransomware attack against the company that has disrupted meat production in north america and australia originated from a criminal organization likely based in russia jbs is the world s largest meatpacker and the incident caused its australian operations to shut down on monday and has stopped livestock slaughter at its plants in several u s states many of you may not be familiar with jbs but this is a very big deal according to bloomberg a fifth of america s production will be wiped out while these plants are down jbs s five biggest beef plants in the u s which altogether handle 22 500 cattle a day have halted processing following a weekend attack on the company s computer networks according to jbs posts on facebook labor unions and employees those outages alone have wiped out nearly a fifth of america s production slaughter operations across australia were also down according to a trade group one of canada s largest beef plants was idled for a second day until this crisis passes and hopefully that will be as soon as possible meat will be harder to get and prices will be higher the biden administration is once again blaming russia for this latest cyberattack whether that is true or not relations between the u s and russia will continue to rapidly deteriorate and many are deeply concerned about where all of this hostility will eventually take us sadly this new meat shortage is just the tip of the iceberg earlier today the drudge report linked to an article with this stunning headline how the world ran out of everything the following is a short excerpt from that article in conshohocken pa mr romano is literally waiting for his ship to come in he is vice president of sales at van horn metz company which buys chemicals from suppliers around the world and sells them to factories that make paint ink and other industrial products in normal times the company is behind in filling perhaps 1 percent of its customers orders on a recent morning it could not complete a tenth of its orders because it was waiting for supplies to arrive you may have noticed that products are increasingly going out of stock and this trend isn t going away for the foreseeable future meanwhile inflation threatens to spiral wildly out of control at this point even costco executives are publicly warning that inflation has become a major problem don t tell costco executives that inflation is low the big box club chain said it s been seeing accelerating prices across a range of products including shipping containers aluminum foil and a 20 spike in meat prices over the past month inflationary factors abound cfo richard galanti said on the company s fiscal third quarter earnings call thursday if you know that you are going to need something in the months ahead buy it now because with the way things are going there is a very good chance that you will be paying much more if you wait have you noticed that some companies are trying to hide inflation by shrinking package sizes this is a phenomenon that is known as shrinkflation consumers are paying more for a growing range of household staples in ways that don t show up on receipts thinner rolls lighter bags smaller cans as companies look to offset rising labor and materials costs without scaring off customers it s a form of retail camouflage known as shrinkflation and economists and consumer advocates who track packaging expect it to become more pronounced as inflation ratchets up taking hold of such everyday items such as paper towels potato chips and diapers for example i absolutely love tillamook ice cream it is the best ice cream that i have ever had in my entire life and if you have tasted it then you know what i am talking about unfortunately they recently felt forced to shrink the size of their packaging from 56 ounces to 48 ounces but they kept the price the same lots of companies are now doing this because the cost of raw materials is going through the roof even elon musk is complaining about rising prices for raw materials perhaps finally realizing it can t turn a profit selling vehicles or perhaps truly between a rock and a semiconductor hard place tesla is raising prices and ditching features from its vehicles ceo elon musk took to twitter late on memorial day to explain the hikes blaming them on the convenient scapegoat of supply chain issues prices increasing due to major supply chain price pressure industry wide raw materials especially musk wrote in a tweet late on memorial day sadly this is just the beginning governments around the world continue to borrow and spend money as if tomorrow will never come and global central banks continue to pump gigantic mountains of new money into their respective financial systems in this sort of environment an invisible sculpture that is nothing but air can literally be sold for 18 000 an italian artist was able to sell his invisible immaterial sculpture which technically does not exist in this plane at least for thousands of euros salvatore garau 67 challenged the boundaries of contemporary art even further after cashing in 15 000 around 18 000 or p875 000 for his work titled io sono i am at a recent auction as per il giorno on may 21 the inflationary nightmare that so many of us have been relentlessly warning about is here and it is going to continue to get worse in addition i have a

tsx expected to move higher despite hitting 20 000 but risks of correction remain toronto canada s main stock index still has room to move higher this year even after hitting 20 000 points for the first time tuesday although the winding down of stimulus measures could put a damper on that growth experts say the toronto market has the wind at its back despite gaining 14 6 per cent so far in 2021 to outpace all north american stock markets and is up 78 per cent from the march 2020 lows said mike archibald vice president and portfolio manager with agf investments inc it continues to exhibit good momentum characteristics and i think if cyclicals continue to work and the global demand picture continues to improve canada is going to be a good place to be for money he said in an interview commodities have fuelled the charge with materials rising on higher gold prices and energy recovering from years of underperformance crude oil prices have reached more than two year highs amid an anticipated growth in demand from people travelling more and life returning to a new normal following covid 19 lockdowns however what s most likely to prompt a correction is if the u s federal reserve begins to taper its monetary stimulus to prevent the economy from overheating the bank of canada has already said it would do so that ll likely give the market a little bit more pause and you ll probably see a bit of a pullback in broader equities and of course there s always the unknowns that happen in this business archibald added the climb higher is being supported by good corporate earnings that are being driven by an improving economic environment as covid issues are starting to appear in the rear view mirror said kevin headland senior investment strategist at manulife investment management the risk is more like an exogenous shock he said noting that valuations are still elevated it s not as expensive as it once was so any type of shock to the market that s unexpected could quickly drive the market lower a small dip could quickly accelerate to something bigger if expectations build about a long lasting shock to the market but headland said he remains optimistic that the tsx still has some decent upside potential noting that the canadian equity market has been undervalued relative to the u s and other markets for quite some time the composition of the tsx s p composite index should also help as the focus continues to shift amid the economic reopening to energy materials financials and industrials from growth sectors like technology that outperformed during the downturn that lockdown play helped shopify inc to become canada s most valuable company archibald said he expects the summer could be a more volatile period if the fed starts talking about tapering which could unnerve investors who are already on edge about rising inflation a five to 10 per cent correction is possible something he describes as very normal i think most market participants that have cash will be buying that as we move into the fourth quarter i still think equities look fairly attractive just given the growth trajectory we re likely to see for 2021 going back 100 years there s a 10 per cent correction an average of once a year said michael currie vice president and investment adviser at td wealth it wouldn t be unusual to see some slowdown in the summertime he said currie said hitting 20 000 is a nice milestone that grabs attention even though the climb up isn t mathematically significant it generally does give people a bit more optimism in the market that things are heading in the right direction even though monetarily it s not a huge difference he said the tsx s climb has caught some analysts a bit by surprise and forced them to revisit their forecasts for the year candice bangsund portfolio manager for fiera capital upped her estimate after originally predicting the tsx would end the year at 19 000 sentiment was buoyed by the u s central bank s bullish outlook for economic growth and reduced unemployment that should keep its benchmark interest rate near zero through 2023 despite increased inflation the tsx hit 19 000 for the time in march 70 days after reaching 18 000 it took another 77 days for it to reach 20 000 canada s main stock index closed up 245 02 points to 19 976 01 on tuesday after trading as high as 20 022 13 this report by the canadian press was first published june 1 2021

her on her travels from her childhood in durban to her time as a teacher in the himalayas weaving together memories that are raw and intimate and speak to the spirit of adventure and our yearning for connection in fact khan s writing is like an extended conversation with her reader about culture religion relationships and womanhood amongst many other topics she makes space for reflection in between descriptions of sweeping scenery and bustling streets i really want to explore what it means to be a woman a woman of colour and a muslim woman in different spaces khan says exploration of the concepts of identity and belonging is carried through every story every travel literally checked in at every gate what is it like to fly to america alone as a muslim after 9 11 the author ponders it is hard to pray khan writes a plane is more complicated i m normally seated next to my family so my slight prostrations in my seat don t even get a second glance but when you re alone the person next to you might think you re having a seizure or worse realise you re a muslim praying on the plane and have a heart attack a girl was now sitting at a fire somewhere in the himalayas beneath a sky so full of stars she could reach out and touch them if she wanted khan responds with humour in a chapter jestingly titled i almost went to guantánamo bay but the underlying anxiety is tangible it is complicated indeed at times painful or disorienting what do you do as a woman alone in dehli the rape capital of the world barely a year after the 2012 bus gang rape that horrified the world writes khan i went on a tour of gutab minar wandered the lanes of khan market did a book reading in noida ate biryani at nizamuddin shopped in connaught place and i always returned early to my room at night then she adds she propped a chair under the doorknob to bar access to possible intruders warned by many that the city is not safe the cold reminder that even in the vibrancy of new places amongst all there is to see touch and taste your femaleness follows you there is a certain bravery that comes when you choose to see the light in the world while still acknowledging the fear that comes from darkness in doing so khan has also identified the particular experience that comes with being a woman travelling alone it s messy scary and a whole different experience she says if you re a woman you re completely aware of your environment and i really resent that i felt that male gaze wherever i ve been and it really affects how you move and navigate through a space she explains further in the book khan explores what it means to be your own company on a journey with no one to share experiences with yet this is not a lonely book but rather one that explores connection and intimacy even in occasional solitude inviting the feel moments with the author typical of a travel memoir khan shares the beauty and awe of being in new spaces describing scenes visually and emotionally instead of looking out khan encourages the reader to look up and it is in those moments with eyes turned upwards towards dark clouds packed with snow falling on new york or into the expanse of sky spreading across the himalayas that one is truly transported a girl was now sitting at a fire somewhere in the himalayas beneath a sky so full of stars she could reach out and touch them if she wanted she could pick them out of the sky fill her hands carry the light in her pockets hold it close and just so khan is reaching out into memories filling her pages with these bright living and breathing moments telling stories of places with heartbeats so loud you forgot about your own yet the book is more than a travelogue and more than a memoir both straddling and defying genre to instead be a love letter to a world suddenly erupted in colour this is what makes the book beyond journeys taken as khan pays homage to human connection writing during a year of pandemic life that demanded separation and left the world yearning i am anti social i am a bit of an introvert but i realised the fundamental thing of life to connect with people khan acknowledges dm ml

article president joe biden proposed his 6 trillion budget on friday outlining his plan to rebuild america s infrastructure it focuses on funding affordable housing education and health care while raising capital gains taxes on high earning households if passed the budget would make sweeping changes to how the federal government issues and collects funding and some of these changes might affect your personal finances make sure your decisions are well informed by utilizing an online financial marketplace like credible here s what you should keep your eye on from college debt to mortgage forbearance taxes will go up for the wealthiest americans biden s proposed budget aims to eliminate tax loopholes that reward wealth over work such as the lower capital gains tax financial planners say that if this version of the budget passes americans making more than 400 000 per year will see higher taxes on income assets and investments households earning more than 1 million would pay a 43 4 tax on capital gains devin pope a certified financial planner cfp in salt lake city utah said that this could hurt the entrepreneurial spirit our country has embraced for decades the capital gains tax would be retroactive taking effect in late april it doesn t allow for people to plan ahead or prepare for what is coming said monica dwyer a cfp and wealth advisor based out of west chester ohio had we known this was coming clients and i would have done some trades to take advantage of the lower tax last year said rose swanger a cfp in knoxville tenn it may be a moot point now but generally speaking clients and i will be very careful of how we invest in their taxable account during the next few years the future of investing for high income earners may shift toward tax friendly retirement accounts over other investment accounts how a biden administration could affect your mortgage more affordable housing will be added to the market in an effort to address the affordable housing crisis

rural housing grants loans and loan guarantees 2 billion expanding the low income housing tax credit 31 9 billion despite efforts to increase access to affordable housing it s unlikely that home prices will decrease anytime soon even if this budget is adopted take advantage of low mortgage rates and rising home equity with a cash out refinance explore your options on credible students would have access to two years of tuition free community college the rising cost of getting a college education has led to many graduates looking into alternatives to a four year university such as community colleges and trade schools biden s proposed budget would make community college tuition free for two years funding free community college would cost 55 7 billion between 2022 and 2026 and 108 5 billion by 2031 what qualifies you for free college fha borrowers may see extended covid 19 pandemic relief the federal housing agency fha will continue to provide urgent relief to homeowners suffering financially due to the covid 19 pandemic the budget states however the document doesn t state specifics for this plan and the deadline for homeowners to request covid 19 forbearance from their mortgage servicer is still june 30 2021 covid 19 mortgage forbearance can be a lifeline for mortgagors who can t afford to make any monthly mortgage payment but it may be a better long term option for borrowers to refinance since rates are historically low if you re thinking about refinancing your mortgage to save some money shop around for the lowest possible mortgage rate for your situation on credible doing so won t affect your credit score fixed rate student loan refinancing rates stick at historical lows your federal student loans won t be forgiven anytime soon one thing missing from biden s budget proposal student loan forgiveness the president has supported canceling up to 10 000 worth of student loan debt for every borrower he says he believes it s important for congress to enact this legislation rather than rely on an executive order however biden s budget proposal to congress which allocates federal spending for the next 10 years doesn t include canceling college debt this may leave some borrowers wondering what to do with their student loan balances federal student loan borrowers can continue taking advantage of the zero interest forbearance period which expires on sept 30 2021 borrowers can still make payments during this time to decrease the principal balance of the loan since interest doesn t accrue during this time though borrowers might consider using the extra cash to pay down high interest debt or save for future student loan payments private student loan borrowers aren t likely to be affected by college debt forgiveness and they re not protected by the federal forbearance moratorium these borrowers should continue making payments and consider refinancing their student loans while rates are historically low student loan refinancing may help you save thousands of dollars on your college debt borrowers saved 17 344 on average when they refinanced to a shorter term loan on credible a student loan refinancing calculator

toronto canada s main stock index still has room to move higher this year even after hitting 20 000 points for the first time tuesday although the winding down of stimulus measures could put a damper on that growth experts say the toronto market has the wind at its back despite gaining 14 6 per cent so far in 2021 to outpace all north american stock markets and is up 78 per cent from the march 2020 lows said mike archibald vice president and portfolio manager with agf investments inc it continues to exhibit good momentum characteristics and i think if cyclicals continue to work and the global demand picture continues to improve canada is going to be a good place to be for money he said in an interview commodities have fuelled the charge with materials rising on higher gold prices and energy recovering from years of underperformance crude oil prices have reached more than two year highs amid an anticipated growth in demand from people travelling more and life returning to a new normal following covid 19 lockdowns however what s most likely to prompt a correction is if the u s federal reserve begins to taper its monetary stimulus to prevent the economy from overheating the bank of canada has already said it would do so that ll likely give the market a little bit more pause and you ll probably see a bit of a pullback in broader equities and of course there s always the unknowns that happen in this business archibald added the climb higher is being supported by good corporate earnings that are being driven by an improving economic environment as covid issues are starting to appear in the rear view mirror said kevin headland senior investment strategist at manulife investment management the risk is more like an exogenous shock he said noting that valuations are still elevated it s not as expensive as it once was so any type of shock to the market that s unexpected could quickly drive the market lower a small dip could quickly accelerate to something bigger if expectations build about a long lasting shock to the market but headland said he remains optimistic that the tsx still has some decent upside potential noting that the canadian equity market has been undervalued relative to the u s and other markets for quite some time the composition of the tsx s p composite index should also help as the focus continues to shift amid the economic reopening to energy materials financials and industrials from growth sectors like technology that outperformed during the downturn that lockdown play helped shopify inc to become canada s most valuable company archibald said he expects the summer could be a more volatile period if the fed starts talking about tapering which could unnerve investors who are already on edge about rising inflation a five to 10 per cent correction is possible something he describes as very normal i think most market participants that have cash will be buying that as we move into the fourth quarter i still think equities look fairly attractive just given the growth trajectory we re likely to see for 2021 going back 100 years there s a 10 per cent correction an average of once a year said michael currie vice president and investment adviser at td wealth it wouldn t be unusual to see some slowdown in the summertime he said currie said hitting 20 000 is a nice milestone that grabs attention even though the climb up isn t mathematically significant it generally does give people a bit more optimism in the market that things are heading in the right direction even though monetarily it s not a huge difference he said the tsx s climb has caught some analysts a bit by surprise and forced them to revisit their forecasts for the year candice bangsund portfolio manager for fiera capital upped her estimate after originally predicting the tsx would end the year at 19 000 sentiment was buoyed by the u s central bank s bullish outlook for economic growth and reduced unemployment that should keep its benchmark interest rate near zero through 2023 despite increased inflation the tsx hit 19 000 for the time in march 70 days after reaching 18 000 it took another 77 days for it to reach 20 000 canada s main stock index closed up 245 02 points to 19 976 01 on tuesday after trading as high as 20 022 13 this report by the canadian press was first published june 1 2021 ross marowits the canadian press

dan hurt explains covid 19 s impact on the universal basic income movement the global covid 19 pandemic has sparked additional interest and discussion in the universal basic income ubi movement as a major basis for public policy while the exact definitions vary dan hurt describes the features of ubi as a broad coverage to citizens by providing a guaranteed minimum income regardless of events and if recipients receive payments from other sources florida based information technology guru with a passion for the movement dan hurt further explains what ubi is and how its popularity has grown because of covid 19 below what is the ubi movement ubi programs provide an opportunity by which citizens cannot fall by offering unconditional payments to the population ubi is not a new societal invention since it has considerably been discussed in economic literature and related to health inequality in practice multiple existing plans have provided guaranteed income as governments have tested the waters of this idea what are the benefits the first national trial started in 2017 in finland whereby 2000 unemployed citizens were paid 560 euros per month over two years the most relevant evidence is derived from less developed countries in sub saharan africa where the same idea was implemented and resulted in a reduction in short term poverty latin american trials found a significant reduction in short term poverty with the poverty level in brazil falling to its lowest level in 40 years with a quarter of the population receiving monthly payments since march 2020 all these studies in less developed countries also showed improved overall health since poverty and income are intertwined with poorer health results also studies show that childhood poverty is inversely related to the working memory of young adults that means impoverished children are 4 5 times more likely to develop some form of severe mental health issues than those in the highest income bracket dan hurt further cites that ubi recipients in finland reported lower depression sadness and loneliness rates with a decrease in overall mental strain in summary 27 studies published in 2020 reported improved health benefits from ubi including an increase in nutrient consumption for those with low birth weight infants improved adult health and a reduction in mortality how has covid 19 impacted ubi given the relationship between money and health especially in developing nations those in poorer neighborhoods have not been able to get the required treatment to help during the pandemic this has led to many countries considering ubi to raise the general health and welfare of the population dan hurt has studied the many benefits of ubi and with the covid 19 pandemic impact on the entire global population many governments are not considering this approach to prevent future issues many studies have been performed to showcase the success stories of this concept the post how covid 19 has popularized the universal basic income movement according to dan hurt appeared first on financial market brief

requires certain reductions in a borrower s loan forgiveness amount based on reductions in full time equivalent employees it includes an important statutory exemption for borrowers that have eliminated the reductions on or before december 31 2020 or for a ppp loan made on or after december 27 2020 not later than the last day of the loan s covered period the small business act also allows exemptions from reductions in loan forgiveness amounts based on employee availability and business activity in addition the sba and treasury have adopted regulatory exemptions to the reduction rules for borrowers that 1 have offered to restore employee hours at the same salary or wages even if the employees have not accepted 2 fired an employee for cause or have an employee who voluntarily resigns or voluntarily requests a schedule reduction 3 eliminate reductions by december 31 2020 or for a ppp loan made after december 27 2020 the last day of the loan s covered period or 4 have a ppp loan of 50 000 or less there is some guidance in the 2021 forgiveness ifr the loan forgiveness applications and the forgiveness faqs on implementation of statutory exemptions from loan forgiveness reduction based on reductions in full time equivalent employees including the calculation of the average full time equivalency fte 40 hour week the fte reduction safe harbors and the fte reduction exceptions in general a reduction in fte employees during the covered period reduces the loan forgiveness amount by the same percentage as the percentage reduction in fte employees if the average number of fte employees during the covered period is less than during the reference period defined below the total eligible expenses available for forgiveness is reduced proportionally by the percentage reduction in fte employees the borrower is exempt from this proportional reduction if the borrower is able to document in good faith the following 1 an inability to rehire individuals who were employees of the borrower on february 15 2020 and 2 an inability to hire similarly qualified individuals for unfilled positions on or before december 31 2020 or for a ppp loan made on or after december 27 2020 not later than the last day of the loan s covered period see below under fte reduction exceptions borrowers are also exempted if the borrower is able to document in good faith an inability to return to the same level of business activity as the borrower was operating at before february 15 2020 due to compliance with certain requirements see below under fte reduction safe harbors a reduction in fte employees during the covered period reduces the loan forgiveness amount by the same percentage as the percentage reduction in fte employees if the average number of fte

the same level of business activity as the borrower was operating at before february 15 2020 due to compliance with certain requirements see below under fte reduction safe harbors full time equivalent employee means an employee who works 40 hours or more on average each week the hours of employees who work less than 40 hours are calculated as proportions of a single full time equivalent employee and aggregated means an employee who works 40 hours or more on average each week the hours of employees who work less than 40 hours are calculated as proportions of a single full time equivalent employee and aggregated reference period the reference period is at the borrower s election either i february 15 2019 through june 30 2019 ii january 1 2020 through february 29 2020 or iii in the case of seasonal employers either of the preceding periods or any consecutive 12 week period between february 15 2019 and february 15 2020 the reference period is at the borrower s election either i

february 15 2019 and february 15 2020 calculation of fte employees borrowers seeking forgiveness must document their average number of fte employees during the covered period and their selected reference period if applicable a borrower must perform this calculation for both its first draw ppp loan and second draw ppp loan for purposes of this calculation borrowers must divide the average number of hours paid for each employee per week by 40 capping this quotient at 1 0 for example an employee who was paid 48 hours per week during the covered period would be considered to be an fte employee of 1 0 for employees who were paid for less than 40 hours per week borrowers may choose to calculate the full time equivalency in one of two ways 1 the borrower may calculate the average number of hours a part time employee was paid per week during the covered period for example if an employee was paid for 30 hours per week on average during the covered period the employee could be considered to be an fte employee of 0 75 or similarly if an employee was paid for 10 hours per week on average during the covered period the employee could be considered to be an fte employee of 0 25 or 2 for administrative convenience borrowers may elect to use a full time equivalency of 0 5 for each part time employee borrowers may select only one of these two methods and must apply that method consistently to all of their part time employees for the covered period and the selected reference period in either case the borrower must provide the aggregate total of fte employees for both the selected reference period and the covered period by adding together all of the employee level fte employee calculations the borrower must then divide the average fte employees during the covered period by the average fte employees during the selected reference period resulting in the reduction quotient borrowers seeking forgiveness must document their average number of fte employees during the covered period and their selected reference period if applicable a borrower must perform this calculation for both its first draw ppp loan and second draw ppp loan for purposes of this calculation borrowers must divide the average number of hours paid for each employee per week by 40 capping this quotient at 1 0 for example an employee who was paid 48 hours per week during the covered period would be considered to be an fte employee of 1 0 for employees who were paid for less than 40 hours per week borrowers may choose to calculate the full time equivalency in one of two ways 1 the

social distancing or any other worker or customer safety requirement related to covid 19 safe harbor 2 if both of the following conditions are met 1 the borrower reduced its fte employee level in the period beginning february 15 2020 and ending april 26 2020 and 2 the borrower then restored its fte employee levels in the borrower s pay period that included february 15 2020 by not later than i december 31 2020 for a ppp loan made before december 27 2020 or ii the last day of the covered period for a ppp loan made after december 27 2020 there are two separate safe harbors that exempt certain borrowers from any loan forgiveness reduction based on a reduction in fte employee levels fte reduction exceptions any fte reductions in the following cases do not reduce the borrower s loan forgiveness the fte of 1 any positions for which the borrower made a good faith written offer to rehire an individual who was an employee on february 15 2020 and the borrower was unable to hire similarly qualified employees for unfilled positions on or before a december 31 2020 for a ppp loan made before december 27 2020 or b the last day of the covered period for a ppp loan made after december 27 2020 2 any positions for which the borrower made a good faith written offer to restore any reduction in hours at the same salary or wages and same number of hours as earned by such employee in the last pay period prior to the reduction in hours during the covered period the employee rejected the offer and the borrower maintained records documenting the offer and rejection and 3 any employees who during the covered period a were fired for cause b voluntarily resigned or c voluntarily requested and received a reduction of their hours in all of these cases the borrower may count such employee at the same full time equivalency level before the fte reduction event when calculating the fte employee reduction penalty borrowers that avail themselves of this de minimis exemption must maintain and provide records upon request any fte reduction in these cases does not reduce the borrower s loan forgiveness employee declines the offer to rehire the 2021 forgiveness ifr emphasizes that the borrower is required to inform the applicable state unemployment insurance office of any employee s rejected rehire offer within 30 days of the employee s rejection of the offer the documents that the borrower should maintain to show compliance with this exemption include the written offer to rehire an individual a written record of the offer s rejection and a written record of efforts to hire a similarly qualified individual include employees who made more than 100 000 according to the forgiveness faqs the fte reduction exceptions apply to all employees not just those who would be listed in table 1 of the form 3508 or lender equivalent a borrower must include employees who made more than 100 000 in the table 1 of the ppp schedule a worksheet a borrower with a loan of 50 000 or less is exempt from any reductions in the borrower s loan forgiveness amount based on reductions in fte employees unless the borrower together with its affiliates received first draw ppp

in hours during the covered period the employee rejected the offer and the borrower maintained records documenting the offer and rejection and 3 any employees who during the covered period a were fired for cause b voluntarily resigned or c voluntarily requested and received a reduction of their hours in all of these cases the borrower may count such employee at the same full time equivalency level before the fte reduction event when calculating the fte employee reduction penalty borrowers that avail themselves of this de minimis exemption must maintain and provide records upon request any fte reduction in these cases does not reduce the borrower s loan forgiveness 8 forgiveness reductions based on salary or wages under section 7a d 3 of the small business act a reduction in an employee s salary or wages in excess of 25 will generally result in a reduction in loan forgiveness amount unless an exception applies specifically for each new employee in 2020 and 2021 as well as each existing employee who was not paid more than the annualized equivalent of 100 000 in any pay period in 2019 the borrower must reduce the total forgiveness amount by the total dollar amount of the salary or wage reductions that are in excess of 25 of base salary or wages of the employee during the most recent full quarter during which the employee was employed before the covered period the reference period subject to exceptions for borrowers who restore reduced wages or salaries this reduction calculation is performed on a per employee basis not in the aggregate additionally this reduction is performed based on the covered period and reference period applicable to the first draw loan or second draw loan examples of how to calculate the reduction in loan forgiveness amount

require that they be accompanied with detailed documentation and that additional documents be retained by the borrower if the lender identifies errors in the borrower s calculations or material lack of substantiation in the borrower s supporting documents in the loan forgiveness applications the lender is to work with the borrower to remedy the issue borrowers should take the time to make sure they have both the accompanying documentation and the documents to be maintained available at the time of the submission a borrower should not put off getting the retained documents together the sba has a right to request that information as part of its review if the borrower does not promptly provide documents this might cause delays and possibly denial of forgiveness in addition certain

if you think about since 2017 you think about 18 19 and 20 it s just been busy all all above average years so as a result the pattern looks the same so we re really looking at some sort of hurricane season in 2021 that probably will be above average again yeah six years in a row we ve actually had um systems developed before the hurricane season in the atlantic so it s it s one of these things that were warmer the oceans have been prime everything has really come together before the season most of those storms aren t very strong but they still can bring heavy rainfall that can still bring those gusty winds and some of that storm surge so six years in a row we ve seen that happen but we re still looking at the strongest storms in that august september october time frame advertisement amazon opens disaster relief hub to help with quick delivery of supplies during hurricane season share copy link copy the 2021 atlantic hurricane season officially begins tuesday and it is forecast to be yet another busy one with an active season in mind amazon and the red cross are hoping a brand new disaster relief hub and partnership will allow for a faster response to locations hit by hurricanes and other natural disasters our disaster relief and response team is partnering with global humanitarian relief organizations to leverage amazon s scale to help improve response time to large scale natural disasters around the world alicia boler davis vice president of global customer fulfillment at amazon said in a news release to cnn amazon is announcing the opening of its disaster relief hub in georgia to quickly help respond to natural disasters and its partnership with six global humanitarian aid organizations including the red cross trevor riggen senior vice president for disaster services with the american red cross says that this new venture blends its own disaster response background with amazon s delivery know how this most recent effort in the disaster relief hub is an opportunity for us the red cross to leverage their amazon s expertise in logistics and be able to work with them to get resources just in time to places that are hard to get stuff to riggen said places that are difficult to move resources without a plane and amazon has that capability to move things quickly this includes places like puerto rico the u s virgin islands latin america the caribbean and even rural and remote regions of the united states the amazon hub located in atlanta will stock over half a million amazon donated relief supplies there will be enough supplies stocked up to immediately fill an amazon air 767 airplane to quickly deliver critical goods to community partners when a disaster strikes the program started because of a letter to the former ceo of amazon jeff bezos actually received a letter from somebody in louisiana in 2016 when floods hit and said amazon is the best at getting stuff into the most remote areas of the united states how can you help us get supplies here said bettina stix director of disaster relief at amazon that was really the vision i had we can reach even the most rural communities we have transportation methods to get there after a natural disaster emergency teams assess what supplies they have procure items they need and then consolidate pack and ship supplies into disaster zones this process can take several days to shorten the procedure amazon studied its disaster support data across four years and formed a strategy location is everythingthe organizations chose the atlanta location due to its close proximity to the areas most often hit by hurricanes atlanta for example is just 300 miles from the gulf coast around 700 miles from the bahamas and within 1 500 miles of puerto rico and other caribbean islands in the u s rural locations can pose problems when roads get washed away southwest louisiana was hit multiple times last year by different tropical systems during hurricane sally last year the pensacola bay bridge was heavily damaged limiting not only people trying to evacuate out but aid from getting in in the caribbean many islands can be difficult to reach right after a disaster hits making planes the only accessible way to get in since 2017 we ve had hurricane maria irma dorian they all hit islands and as we know the crucial way to get in there is by airplane that s the fastest way stix said not only did all of those hurricanes hit islands but all reached category 5 strength the highest level possible for a tropical cyclone hurricane dorian was uniquely devastating not only was it one of the strongest on record in the atlantic basin but it was stationary or nearly stationary over the bahamas for more than 24 hours as a category 4 5 storm said taylor ward a cnn meteorologist this made for one of the worst natural disasters in the country s history the extreme strength devastated the area and the slow movement delayed humanitarian relief from arriving the hope is that if a similar disaster occurs precious time won t be lost from locating sorting and packing the relief items forecast calls for another active hurricane seasonthis year could see the sixth consecutive above average hurricane season according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration this year also marked the seventh year in a row that at least one named tropical system has formed in the atlantic prior to the official start of the season we do prepare every year as if it is going to be a very busy disaster season but when we see these forecasts with almost a guarantee that there is going to be an above average amount of activity that tells us that we re going to be busy all summer and into the fall riggen said a lot of pre planning goes into a busy season like this to make sure regardless of the level of activity that we ve got enough resources and we re able to move those just in time he said since its inception in 2017 amazon s disaster relief and response efforts have provided over 13 million items and tens of millions of dollars to support community partners worldwide during 59 separate natural disasters according to amazon how to prepare for the unknownthere s three phases that the red cross goes through during an operation the what where and when people don t always need the cleanup supplies minute one they need the relief supplies they need to make sure they can keep their family safe that they have food and water right after the storm that s the what riggen said then there s the where where are the people you have to take into account that some people move to a shelter stay with family members or in some cases an entire community is evacuated to a neighboring community so those supplies need to go to where people are after the disaster not before there s also another factor to consider connectivity people want wifi connections and the ability to use their cell phones not just the people who live in those communities affected by the storms but also the first responders and aid workers the ability to communicate with your loved ones to tell them that you are ok after disaster strikes or the ability of responders to communicate with the communities and with each other is critical the amazon web services disaster response program which tracks global disasters will also partner with organizations like help ngo and information technology disaster resource center by helping people access critical data locally the aws and itdrc will show up to a disaster scene with generators satellite dishes wi fi repeaters and miles of cable these volunteers work to establish temporary connectivity when the power is out and there are zero bars of cell phone service at the same time telecommunications and utility companies can focus on repairing the permanent infrastructure food water and shelter are essential for disaster recovery but the ability to distribute those essentials relies heavily on good communication about 30 of all atlantic hurricanes make u s landfall however you don t need to have all of the forecast storms make landfall in the u s for it to be a destructive season it doesn t matter if there s 30 storms or one if it impacts you it s a busy season said ken graham director of the national hurricane center if that one strikes this partnership may help lessen the inevitable disruption an unwelcome system from the tropics brings

the cfpb formally delayed the compliance date of the general qualified mortgage final rule the cfpb formally delayed the general qualified mortgage final rule s mandatory compliance date from july 1 2021 to october 1 2022 under the truth in lending act tila qualified mortgage qm loans are presumed to be made based on the lender s reasonable determination of the homeowner s ability to repay the loan delaying the mandatory compliance date allows lenders more time to offer qm loans based on the homeowners debt to income dti ratio and not solely based on certain pricing thresholds delaying the final rule s compliance date also gives lenders more time to use the government sponsored enterprise gse patch which provides qm status to loans that are eligible for sale to fannie mae or freddie mac the availability of the gse patch after july 1 2021 may be limited by recent revisions to the preferred stock purchase agreements entered into by the department of the treasury and the federal housing finance agency bite 6 the cfpb took action against a reverse mortgage lender the cfpb entered a consent order against a reverse mortgage lender for allegedly sending deceptive loan advertisements to hundreds of thousands of older borrowers in violation of the mortgage acts and practices advertising rule map rule tila and the consumer financial protection act cfpa the cfpb alleges that the

a compliance plan and stop sending deceptive advertisements bite 5 the cfpb issued a consumer complaint bulletin the cfpb issued a consumer complaint bulletin analyzing consumer complaints nationwide in 2019 and 2020 the cfpb claims it received more complaints on a per capita basis from consumers living in predominantly minority counties than from consumers in predominantly white non hispanic counties among other key findings in this bulletin from 2019 to 2020 consumer complaints increased across all demographic groups complaints increased at a greater rate in predominantly minority counties compared to predominantly white non hispanic counties consumers living in predominantly minority counties submitted more complaints on a per capita basis in nearly every one of the 11 product categories about which the cfpb accepts complaints credit or consumer reporting appears to cause significantly more issues for consumers in predominantly minority counties the cfpb will soon expand demographic collection to include household size and income bite 4 the cfpb and ftc address pandemic tenant protections the cfpb s acting director and federal trade commission s acting chairwoman sent notification letters to the nation s largest apartment landlords which collectively own more than 2 million units reminding these landlords of federal protections in place to keep tenants in their

an interim final rule establishing new notice requirements under the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa the letters ask landlords to examine their practices to ensure they comply with the cdc moratorium and the ftc act and remediate any harm to consumers stemming from any such law violations it also encourages landlords to notify fdcpa covered debt collectors working on their behalf which may include attorneys of the cdc moratorium applicable state or local moratoria and those parties obligations under the ftc act and fdcpa including the cfpb s interim final rule the notices follow the march 2021 joint statement from the interim leaders of the agencies regarding preventing illegal evictions bite 3 the cfpb issued reports on continuing challenges for mortgage lenders during the pandemic and on small dollar lending the cfpb released two reports on continuing challenges facing mortgage borrowers related to the covid 19 pandemic the first report characteristics of mortgage borrowers during the covid 19 pandemic documents that black and hispanic mortgage borrowers are much more likely to be delinquent or in a forbearance program than white borrowers for example 33 of borrowers in forbearance and 27 of delinquent borrowers are black or hispanic while only 18 of the total population of mortgage borrowers are black or hispanic the second report a special consumer complaint bulletin shows that overall mortgage complaints have risen to their highest level in three years the bulletin highlights complaints about servicer communications and delays denials of loan modifications the cfpb is seeking comments on a proposal intended to help prevent avoidable foreclosures for borrowers affected by the covid 19 emergency the cfpb also released a report as part of its making ends meet series addressing payday auto title or pawn loans the report indicated that consumers of such services can be found across a diverse spectrum of characteristics in the population and are not limited to certain consumer groups the report indicated that for such consumers speed discretion and the lack of a credit check were important for deciding on their credit source the report also indicated that a significant portion of consumers using these services had 300 or more in available credit card credit at about the same time they owed money on one of these loans the report further indicated that 48 percent of consumers who had taken out a payday loan in the previous six months had rolled over at least one payday loan in the previous six months for comparison the report indicated that consumers roll over other types of loans frequently as well 51 percent of consumers with a credit card did not pay the full bill in the previous month in june 2019 in the survey 79 percent of consumers had a credit card among other interesting findings the report also indicated that when such consumers experience difficulty paying a bill or expense they tend to also use other available credit suggesting that for some consumers these loans might be part of a broader and more complicated debt portfolio to deal with difficulties bite 2 the cfpb settled with a debt settlement company the cfpb settled with a debt settlement company over alleged violations of the telemarketing sales rule tsr and the cfpa specifically the cfpb alleged that the company charged fees before some consumers had made at least one payment to a creditor under a settlement agreement and charged some consumers fees even though it did not negotiate a settlement collected fees that were calculated on the consumer s debt amount after their time of enrollment in one of the company s debt settlement programs failed to disclose the amount that a consumer must save before making a settlement offer and the time by which it would make a settlement offer and deceived consumers about settlement fees including by charging settlement fees greater than what was disclosed in the enrollment agreement if the settlement is entered by the court the company must provide 5 4 million in consumer redress and pay a 1 civil penalty by requiring the company to pay a penalty of 1 the order may make consumers eligible for additional relief from the cfpb civil penalty fund in the future although that determination has not yet been made bite 1 the cfpb issued a consent order against an auto finance company the cfpb issued a consent order against an auto finance company for allegedly charging interest for late payment on its loss damage waiver ldw product without its customers knowledge the company required its customers to agree that if they had insufficient insurance coverage for their automobiles they would add loss damage waiver coverage to their accounts ldw is a product that for a monthly fee covers cancellation of the customer s debt in the event of a total vehicle loss or the cost of a repair if the vehicle was not a total loss when a customer s ldw payment was late the company would allegedly charge interest on the late payment without disclosing this interest to the customer the order requires the company to provide over 565 000 in consumer relief to over 5 700 consumers in addition to a 50 000 civil money penalty still hungry tune in next month for a special 10 year anniversary bite with guest panelist lucy morris one of the cfpb s earliest founders as we discuss the

apache parquet and delta lake formats in real time without copying delta sharing extends the applicability of the data lakehouse architecture because it enables an open simple collaborative approach to data and ai both within and between organizations according to the company the top challenge for data providers today is making their data easily and broadly consumable managing dozens of different data delivery solutions to reach all user platforms is untenable an open interoperable standard for real time data sharing will dramatically improve the experience for both data providers and data users said matei zaharia chief technologist and databricks co founder in a statement delta sharing will standardize how data is securely exchanged between enterprises regardless of which storage or computing platform they use and we are thrilled to make this innovation open source zaharia said delta sharing has a lot of value for anyone working in the data space minnick said and he expects databricks partners to use the open source protocols to better serve customers with initiatives that involve data both inside their organization and data from other businesses and organizations delta sharing is the latest of a number of popular open source projects databricks has created that span data processing data engineering data science and machine learning those include the spark data processing engine created by databricks founders delta lake ml flow and koalas all like delta sharing donated to the linux foundation databricks which held its data ai summit last week also debuted the latest generation of its machine learning software databricks machine learning built on the databricks lakehouse platform the software according to the company provides engineers with everything they need to build train deploy manage and maintain ml models the ml software includes databricks automl to automate the manual data science steps within the machine learning process the databricks feature store improves the discoverability reuse and governance of ml model features within an enterprise s data engineering platform minnick called the new tool real world ml having that ml platform built on top of the data platform is really powerful this is for people who need to get models into production databricks also debuted delta live tables and unity catalog new features within the company s lakehouse platform that the company said enhance the platform s data management capabilities about 80 percent of databricks customers are running the company s software across multiple cloud systems minnick said unity catalog s unified data catalog technology underpinned by the new delta sharing standard makes it easier to discover and govern an organization s data assets in data lakes spread across multiple clouds delta live tables simplifies the development and management of reliable data pipelines on delta lake big data workloads often require huge data elt extract load and transform pipelines that are difficult to build and maintain minnick said live tables is removing a massive amount of the heavy lifting data engineers need to do to keep data pipelines flowing he

the financial standing of black and white americans is anything but equal when it comes to wealth and income major disparities persist despite the years of economic prosperity that preceded the coronavirus pandemic this long standing racial divide has garnered renewed attention in the biden administration which has committed to improving equity as it guides the nation out of the virus fueled economic downturn also bringing the unequal fortunes of blacks and whites into the spotlight the centennial of the race massacre that destroyed of the greenwood section of tulsa oklahoma which was known as black wall street the numbers are staggering the typical non hispanic white family had nearly eight times the net worth of the typical non hispanic black family in 2019 according to the most recent federal reserve bank data that gap stems in part from lower rates of home ownership and smaller inheritances among blacks wealth is all the more important these days since it serves as a safety net during economic downturns and black americans are not benefiting from the run up in stock prices and home values as much as white americans are since they are less likely to own these assets the median income of black americans in 2019 tied prior highs according to the most recent us census bureau data but non hispanic white americans saw their median income hit a record thanks to the booming economy so the racial divide remained black workers face significant wage gaps in the labor market and these differentials have grown since 2000 according to the economic policy institute the disparity is another reason why it s more difficult for black families to save and build wealth than it is for white households one area that has improved over time is the gap in unemployment rates for decades the jobless rate for black americans was typically more than twice that for white americans but it had narrowed to the smallest pre pandemic differential on record in 2019 amid the economic prosperity black americans however were hit very hard by the coronavirus fueled downturn suffering a record number of job losses in the early months of the outbreak last year according to the economic policy institute they are also seeing a slower recovery as the economy improves the unemployment rate for black americans was 9 7 in april compared to 6 in february 2020 before the pandemic began according to the us labor department but for white americans the rate is 5 3 compared to 3 in february 2020 the poverty rate for black americans in 2019 was the lowest on record according to the census bureau but at 18 8 it remains far more than double that of non hispanic white americans who had a poverty rate of 7 3 the gap is even more striking among children more than a quarter of black children fell below the poverty line in 2019 compared to 8 3 of white children

owner of a small vineyard in napa valley who aims to give the second generation family business to his niece and nephew not just the offspring of the wealthiest 1 of americans an estimated 1 4 million households with an annual income of at least 539 000 and a much higher net worth according to one measure stand to suffer from president joe biden s proposal to tighten up the tax loophole known as step up in basis so do millions of other well off but decidedly less rich individuals most clients are you ve gotta be kidding me says edward renn a partner in the private clients and tax group at law firm withers in new haven connecticut biden wants to end the basis step up for individuals who inherit assets with untaxed gains of more than 1 million 2 5 million for couples data show and advisors say that the change would put a buzz saw to the future money tree of tens of millions of americans millions of americans stand to owe steep taxes under biden s proposal to tighten up a tax loophole governing inherited wealth bloomberg news compounding the pain is biden s companion proposal to tax the long term capital gains on investment and other profits of more than 1 million at a new top individual rate of 39 6 43 4 including the obamacare surcharge the hike a near doubling from the current capital gains rate of 23 8 unusually the new rate would take effect this april retroactively the higher top individual rate up from the current 37 would also hit labor income over 400 000 according to proposals laid out on april 28 inheritors are going to get killed says cfp kenneth van leeuwen the managing director of van leeuwen an ria in princeton new jersey under the current law individuals who inherit assets don t owe tax on their gains that materialized from the time the original owner acquired them the value of the assets is stepped up from its original lower cost basis to its current higher price this long standing loophole has allowed family fortunes large and small to be passed down to the next generation for individual heirs of estates below 11 7 million 23 4 million for couples the levels at which estate taxes kick in the benefit has been an engine of tax free wealth transfer to future generations for decades exceptions would apply under the proposed rules for businesses or farms that remain in the family or for property given to charity in exchange for a deduction while the retroactive date at which the capital gains hike would go into effect would be april 28 the step up in basis limit would change for heirs who inherit property from family members who die after december 31 2021 according to the treasury department the one two punch of the tax hikes would hit millions of boomer offspring expected to inherit an estimated 69 trillion over the next three decades what labor economist robert reich calls the largest inter generational transfer of wealth in history as aging boomers born between 1946 and 1964 retire as aging boomers head toward retirement trillions of dollars will pass to their heirs in coming decades financial planning biden s focus on taxing billionaires and the rich takes a redistributive approach that might seem to be aimed only at heirs to the dynastic fortunes of walmart pritzker and dupont or the forbes 1000 but beneath those sky high fortunes held by few lie cushions amassed by the so called mass affluent defined by goldman sachs as those with income or investable assets between 100 000 and under 1 million nearly 1 2 million households have an income between 500 000 and 1 million according to the most recent irs data more than 503 000 have income between 1 million and 5 million in terms of net worth not income at least 20 million u s adults now have a net worth of over 1 million according to credit suisse s global wealth report 2020 that s more than 8 of the u s adult population in 2019 families in the top 10 of u s households by wealth had a median net worth of nearly 1 6 million federal reserve data show the issue is that houses have exploded in value since they were bought decades ago and stock portfolios like real estate will likely grow even larger before being given to heirs putting them past the new tax limits if they aren t already there now experts at the urban brookings tax policy center estimate that the basis step up proposal would hit 2 of decedents who make less than 400 000 a group for which biden has pledged not to raise taxes the tax foundation a conservative think tank estimates that the step repeal higher capital gains rate and 40 estate tax would result in a 61 rate for those at the top end of the scale the highest in almost a century van leeuwen cites the example of a middle class family in fairfield county along connecticut s affluent gold coast a home they bought two decades ago has likely at least doubled in value over the past two decades in wealthy greenwich the median house price in 2020 was more than 2 million more than twice 2001 s 995 000 according to local property records the tax hikes will have a huge impact on homeowners he says wealthy investors who own trusts would also be hit but on that front they get a heads up which advisors say could create tax planning opportunities the administration wants to levy capital gains tax on unrealized appreciation of property held in trusts partnerships and other non corporate entities if the property hasn t been taxed within the previous 90 years since 1940 individuals would thus owe tax under this provision starting on december 31 2030 grandma put the cape cod compound into a trust 90 years ago and now the trust is going to get taxed on it says renn the proposals have to pass congress where a slim democratic majority with some democrats in wealthy states threatens to create a whopper of a tax fight and many advisors view the draft rules as an opening poker bid while retroactive tax hikes are unusual the last one was in 1993 under the clinton administration and was for individual rates there has never been one for capital gains tax renn says the basis step up loophole has origins dating back to 1921 when the long term capital gains tax levied on assets held for a period of time now one year or longer was introduced biden s proposals already face stiff opposition which makes it more unlikely congress would take the step of making them retroactive says bob oros the chairman and ceo of hightower advisors an ria in chicago he theorizes that one could argue that president biden could have simply announced the increase that day if he intended to put it into place if they ultimately become the law some investors may have to absorb tax hits that could have been avoided the clients may not have sold assets particularly low basis holdings had they been aware of the retroactive rate change says laura godine a vice president and the director of wealth planning at eaton vance wateroak advisors now they may already be stuck with a potential high tax hit

the white upper class position of power over the disgruntled working class according to a deep dive by the atlantic in 2014 a year before the first parade both white and black railroad workers joined forces against the city s elite and pulled off a major strike before police and federal troops shut them down the founders of the veiled prophet not only wanted to assert their dominance over the working class but to pull off an envy inducing event in the face of chicago its industrial rival the hope was that a grand parade would continually bring visitors into town via railways thus strengthening the city s economy while lining the pockets of the rich advertisement the pompous displays of grandeur were presided over by the secretive veiled prophet who was chosen yearly by the organization s members which consisted of wealthy white men only in recent years has the veiled prophet s identity been revealed one veiled prophet s identity was unmasked in 1972 by an activist but the first was publicly announced by the organizers bestowing the title to john g priest who served as the city s police commissioner and played a large role in shutting down the railroad workers strike a clear sign that the rich controlled the law the veiled prophet ball was also viewed as a rite of passage for young debutantes whose fathers were often members of the organization the belle of the ball which was later renamed to queen of vp was selected by the veiled prophet and given expensive gifts apart from the founder s ties to the confederacy parades held at night blacks barred from participating and the secrecy of members the veiled prophet ball s link to the kkk is rather tenuous and comes from a depiction of the first veiled prophet in which a man is seen holding a gun and wearing a tall white hood it s notably similar to the pointed hoods klansman wear a staple of the hate group since 1868 the event was finally desegregated in 1979 and due to the lingering negative historical connotations organizers renamed it to the more democratic sounding fair saint louis in the 1990s in the years since it s further rebranded as more of a july 4th celebration calling itself america s birthday parade advertisement on its website it notes that many things have changed since 1878 but the veiled prophet organization will always continue its largest gift to the community a spectacular parade that has become one of st louis most enduring family traditions but there have long been protests over the event particularly during the civil rights movement of the 1960s starting in 1965 the local group action committee to improve opportunities for negroes action began protesting all of its events ceos of these firms were showing how racist they were because they were associating themselves with a racist organization socially their mental and moral fiber is tied to this percy green one of the main organizers of action said the activists strategically targeted the veiled prophet parade and ball because all of the ceos of these industries were also members according to thomas morris spencer in his book the st louis veiled prophet celebration power on parade ceos of these firms were showing how racist they were because they were associating themselves with a racist organization socially green is quoted their mental and moral fiber is tied to this in 1972 action member gena scott infamously crashed the ball to unmask the veiled prophet as tom k smith the executive vp of agrochemical and agricultural biotechnology firm monsanto after the death of unarmed black teenager michael brown in 2014 many activists in ferguson also targeted the event with one member telling rolling stone that racism is embedded in the infrastructures of st louis and amplified by groups such as the veiled prophet advertisement when kemper s involvement with the organization was brought to public attention over the weekend on twitter many st louis locals claimed it was widely known as having a white supremacist history one described the organizers as our local kkk and another said mayor vince schoemehl who served from 1981 to 1993 closed the bridge from east st louis to prevent the predominantly black residents there from coming to the vp fair celebrations a third said he could remember black people in st louis talking about the vp being racist since i was in elementary school remember white progressives talking about the issue since i was a teenager black people in st louis grow up screaming to the top of our lungs about the veil prophet society another added ever so often someone from out of town writes about it ellie kemper ain t nothing new every white elite family in the state of missouri participates in this organization

article president joe biden proposed his 6 trillion budget on friday outlining his plan to rebuild america s infrastructure it focuses on funding affordable housing education and health care while

your personal finances make sure your decisions are well informed by utilizing an online financial marketplace like credible here s what you should keep your eye on from college debt to mortgage forbearance taxes will go up for the wealthiest americans biden s proposed budget aims to eliminate tax loopholes that reward wealth over work such as the lower capital gains tax financial planners say that if this version of the budget passes americans making more than 400 000 per year will see higher taxes on income assets and investments households earning more than 1 million would pay a 43 4 tax on capital gains devin pope a certified financial planner cfp in salt lake city utah said that this could hurt the entrepreneurial spirit our country has embraced for decades the capital gains tax would be retroactive taking effect in late april it doesn t allow for people to plan ahead or prepare for what is coming said monica dwyer a cfp and wealth advisor based out of west chester ohio had we known this was coming clients and i would have done some trades to take advantage of the lower tax last year said rose swanger a cfp in knoxville tenn it may be a moot point now but generally speaking clients and i will be very careful of how we invest in their taxable account during the next few years the future of investing for high income earners may shift toward tax friendly retirement accounts over other investment accounts how a biden administration could affect your mortgage more affordable housing will be added to the market in an effort to address the affordable housing crisis

have access to two years of tuition free community college the rising cost of getting a college education has led to many graduates looking into alternatives to a four year university such as community colleges and trade schools biden s proposed budget would make community college tuition free for two years funding free community college would cost 55 7 billion between 2022 and 2026 and 108 5 billion by 2031 what qualifies you for free college fha borrowers may see extended covid 19 pandemic relief the federal housing agency fha will continue to provide urgent relief to homeowners suffering financially due to the covid 19 pandemic the budget states however the document doesn t state specifics for this plan and the deadline for homeowners to request covid 19 forbearance from their mortgage servicer is still june 30 2021 covid 19 mortgage forbearance can be a lifeline for mortgagors who can t afford to make any monthly mortgage payment but it may be a better long term

missing from biden s budget proposal student loan forgiveness the president has supported canceling up to 10 000 worth of student loan debt for every borrower he says he believes it s important for congress to enact this legislation rather than rely on an executive order however biden s budget proposal to congress which allocates federal spending for the next 10 years doesn t include canceling college debt this may leave some borrowers wondering what to do with their student loan balances federal student loan borrowers can continue taking advantage of the zero interest forbearance period which expires on sept 30 2021 borrowers can still make payments during this time to decrease the principal balance of the loan since interest doesn t accrue during this time though borrowers might consider using the extra cash to pay down high interest debt or save for future student loan payments private student loan borrowers aren t likely to be affected by college debt forgiveness and they re not protected by the federal forbearance moratorium these borrowers should continue making payments and consider refinancing their student loans while rates are historically low student loan refinancing may help you save thousands of dollars on your college debt borrowers saved 17 344 on average when they refinanced to a shorter term loan on credible a student loan refinancing calculator

the world s largest meat producer has been forced to shut down multiple slaughterhouses following a cyber attack over the weekend jbs usa said the attack targeted servers supporting its north american and australian it systems five plants in the united states were closed along with all of the company s plants in australia and one in canada according to bloomberg the closures have wiped about 1 5 of the world s meat supply the five plants in the u s handle roughly 22 500 cattle every day jbs said there was no evidence that any customer supplier or employee data was taken in the attack principal deputy press secretary karine jean pierre told reporters that the ransomware attack came from a criminal organization based in russia she said that u s officials are in contact with the russian government about the cyber attack she added that president joe biden directed his administration to work to mitigate any impact the attack may have on the nation s meat supply the attack comes just a few weeks after a ransomware attack on the colonial pipeline company forced it to halt operations of its 5 500 mile network of pipes the shutdown caused people to stock up on gasoline causing stations across the southeast to run out of fuel photo getty images
if you think about since 2017 you think about 18 19 and 20 it s just been busy all all above average years so as a result the pattern looks the same so we re really looking at some sort of hurricane season in 2021 that probably will be above average again yeah six years in a row we ve actually had um systems developed before the hurricane season in the atlantic so it s it s one of these things that were warmer the oceans have been prime everything has really come together before the season most of those storms aren t very strong but they still can bring heavy rainfall that can still bring those gusty winds and some of that storm surge so six years in a row we ve seen that happen but we re still looking at the strongest storms in that august september october time frame advertisement amazon opens disaster relief hub to help with quick delivery of supplies during hurricane season share copy link copy the 2021 atlantic hurricane season officially begins tuesday and it is forecast to be yet another busy one with an active season in mind amazon and the red cross are hoping a brand new disaster relief hub and partnership will allow for a faster response to locations hit by hurricanes and other natural disasters our disaster relief and response team is partnering with global humanitarian relief organizations to leverage amazon s scale to help improve response time to large scale natural disasters around the world alicia boler davis vice president of global customer fulfillment at amazon said in a news release to cnn amazon is announcing the opening of its disaster relief hub in georgia to quickly help respond to natural disasters and its partnership with six global humanitarian aid organizations including the red cross trevor riggen senior vice president for disaster services with the american red cross says that this new venture blends its own disaster response background with amazon s delivery know how this most recent effort in the disaster relief hub is an opportunity for us the red cross to leverage their amazon s expertise in logistics and be able to work with them to get resources just in time to places that are hard to get stuff to riggen said places that are difficult to move resources without a plane and amazon has that capability to move things quickly this includes places like puerto rico the u s virgin islands latin america the caribbean and even rural and remote regions of the united states the amazon hub located in atlanta will stock over half a million amazon donated relief supplies there will be enough supplies stocked up to immediately fill an amazon air 767 airplane to quickly deliver critical goods to community partners when a disaster strikes the program started because of a letter to the former ceo of amazon jeff bezos actually received a letter from somebody in louisiana in 2016 when floods hit and said amazon is the best at getting stuff into the most remote areas of the united states how can you help us get supplies here said bettina stix director of disaster relief at amazon that was really the vision i had we can reach even the most rural communities we have transportation methods to get there after a natural disaster emergency teams assess what supplies they have procure items they need and then consolidate pack and ship supplies into disaster zones this process can take several days to shorten the procedure amazon studied its disaster support data across four years and formed a strategy location is everythingthe organizations chose the atlanta location due to its close proximity to the areas most often hit by hurricanes atlanta for example is just 300 miles from the gulf coast around 700 miles from the bahamas and within 1 500 miles of puerto rico and other caribbean islands in the u s rural locations can pose problems when roads get washed away southwest louisiana was hit multiple times last year by different tropical systems during hurricane sally last year the pensacola bay bridge was heavily damaged limiting not only people trying to evacuate out but aid from getting in in the caribbean many islands can be difficult to reach right after a disaster hits making planes the only accessible way to get in since 2017 we ve had hurricane maria irma dorian they all hit islands and as we know the crucial way to get in there is by airplane that s the fastest way stix said not only did all of those hurricanes hit islands but all reached category 5 strength the highest level possible for a tropical cyclone hurricane dorian was uniquely devastating not only was it one of the strongest on record in the atlantic basin but it was stationary or nearly stationary over the bahamas for more than 24 hours as a category 4 5 storm said taylor ward a cnn meteorologist this made for one of the worst natural disasters in the country s history the extreme strength devastated the area and the slow movement delayed humanitarian relief from arriving the hope is that if a similar disaster occurs precious time won t be lost from locating sorting and packing the relief items forecast calls for another active hurricane seasonthis year could see the sixth consecutive above average hurricane season according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration this year also marked the seventh year in a row that at least one named tropical system has formed in the atlantic prior to the official start of the season we do prepare every year as if it is going to be a very busy disaster season but when we see these forecasts with almost a guarantee that there is going to be an above average amount of activity that tells us that we re going to be busy all summer and into the fall riggen said a lot of pre planning goes into a busy season like this to make sure regardless of the level of activity that we ve got enough resources and we re able to move those just in time he said since its inception in 2017 amazon s disaster relief and response efforts have provided over 13 million items and tens of millions of dollars to support community partners worldwide during 59 separate natural disasters according to amazon how to prepare for the unknownthere s three phases that the red cross goes through during an operation the what where and when people don t always need the cleanup supplies minute one they need the relief supplies they need to make sure they can keep their family safe that they have food and water right after the storm that s the what riggen said then there s the where where are the people you have to take into account that some people move to a shelter stay with family members or in some cases an entire community is evacuated to a neighboring community so those supplies need to go to where people are after the disaster not before there s also another factor to consider connectivity people want wifi connections and the ability to use their cell phones not just the people who live in those communities affected by the storms but also the first responders and aid workers the ability to communicate with your loved ones to tell them that you are ok after disaster strikes or the ability of responders to communicate with the communities and with each other is critical the amazon web services disaster response program which tracks global disasters will also partner with organizations like help ngo and information technology disaster resource center by helping people access critical data locally the aws and itdrc will show up to a disaster scene with generators satellite dishes wi fi repeaters and miles of cable these volunteers work to establish temporary connectivity when the power is out and there are zero bars of cell phone service at the same time telecommunications and utility companies can focus on repairing the permanent infrastructure food water and shelter are essential for disaster recovery but the ability to distribute those essentials relies heavily on good communication about 30 of all atlantic hurricanes make u s landfall however you don t need to have all of the forecast storms make landfall in the u s for it to be a destructive season it doesn t matter if there s 30 storms or one if it impacts you it s a busy season said ken graham director of the national hurricane center if that one strikes this partnership may help lessen the inevitable disruption an unwelcome system from the tropics brings

j j shares were down about 1 2 at 167 23 file the us supreme court on tuesday declined to hear johnson johnson s bid to overturn a 2 12 billion damages award to women who blamed their ovarian cancer on asbestos in the company s baby powder and other talc products the justices turned away a j j appeal and left in place a missouri state court ruling in litigation brought by 22 women whose claims were heard together in one trial the missouri court of appeals an intermediate state appellate court last year ruled against j j s bid to throw out the compensatory and punitive damages awarded to the plaintiffs but reduced the total to 2 12 billion from the 4 69 billion originally decided by a jury j j which will make a payment of 2 5 billion this month including accrued interest said in a statement that there are unresolved legal issues that will continue to be litigated it previously has said it faces more than 19 000 similar claims the matters that were before the court are related to legal procedure and not safety decades of independent scientific evaluations confirm johnson s baby powder is safe does not contain asbestos and does not cause cancer the company said j j shares were down about 1 2 at 167 23 j j has argued that a decision by a missouri circuit court judge to consolidate disparate baby powder related claims from the plaintiffs including 17 women from outside the state for a trial before a single jury violated the new brunswick new jersey based company s due process rights under the u s constitution j j also has argued that the size of the jury s damages award violated its due process rights the missouri supreme court the state s highest court in november declined to hear j j s appeal of the missouri court of appeals ruling prompting the company to appeal to the u s supreme court this was a victory not just for the amazing women and their families who we were privileged to represent but a victory for justice said mark lanier a lawyer for the plaintiffs dispute over jurisdiction the plaintiffs nine of whom have died and are now represented by their estates have argued that missouri courts have jurisdiction over out of state claims like those brought in this litigation one of the products that the out of state plaintiffs said they had used was manufactured in missouri lawyers for the plaintiffs also have argued that the large punitive damages awarded by the jury in this case were justified by j j s conduct lawyers for the plaintiffs said in court papers it is common practice for courts to consolidate cases at trial when the facts in each claim are essentially the same the missouri court of appeals concluded that it was reasonable to infer from the evidence that j j disregarded the safety of consumers in its drive for profit despite knowing its talc products caused ovarian cancer it also found significant reprehensibility in j j s conduct in addition to reducing the damages the missouri court of appeals dismissed two of the 17 out of state plaintiffs in court papers j j said the case followed a winning formula devised by plaintiffs lawyers of bringing claims in jurisdictions where they can get dozens of out of state plaintiffs to testify in a single trial prejudicing the jury and resulting in outsized damages awards in the missouri trial the company said the jury awarded each plaintiff an identical punitive damages award of 25 million regardless of the facts specific to each plaintiff or whether they were alive or dead the company also said the jury awarded punitive damages much larger than the already staggering compensatory damages which j j has called a further violation of its due process rights justice samuel alito did not participate in the supreme court s decision not to hear the appeal likely because he owns j j stock justice brett kavanaugh whose father now retired was a longtime lobbyist for the toiletries industry also did not take part the justices do not explain why they step aside in certain cases a 2018 reuters investigation found that j j knew for decades that asbestos a carcinogen was present in its talc products internal company records trial testimony and other evidence showed that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s j j s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos the company said in may 2020 it would stop selling its baby powder talc in the united states and canada citing changes in consumer habits and what it called misinformation about the product s safety amid numerous legal challenges except for the headline this story has not been edited by ndtv staff and is published from a syndicated feed

nbtxr3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti pd 1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent metastatic hnscc and lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti pd 1 therapy given the company s focus areas and balanced against the scalable potential of nbtxr3 nanobiotix has engaged in a strategic collaboration strategy to
