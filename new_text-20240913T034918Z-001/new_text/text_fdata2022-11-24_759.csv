4 12pm fed minutes offer hope for smaller rate increases us markets ended the day in positive territory as investors digested the fomc meeting minutes which showed federal reserve officials earlier this month agreed that smaller interest rate increases should happen soon as they evaluate the impact policy is having on the economy at the close the dow jones industrial average advanced 96 points to 34 194 the s p 500 jumped 22 points or 0 56 to 4 026 and the nasdaq composite rose 111 points or 0 99 to 11 285 32 reflecting statements that multiple officials have made over the past several weeks the meeting summary pointed to smaller rate hikes in the future markets widely expect the rate setting federal open market committee to step down to a 50 basis point increase in december following four straight 75 basis point hikes though hinting that smaller moves were ahead officials said they still see little signs of inflation abating however some committee members expressed concern about risks to the financial system should the fed continue to press forward at the same aggressive pace a substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of increase would likely soon be appropriate the minutes stated the uncertain lags and magnitudes associated with the effects of monetary policy actions on economic activity and inflation were among the reasons cited regarding why such an assessment was important ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics suggested the minutes showed that the hawk dove battle lines for the next few meetings are becoming clear he noted some dovish policymakers argued that there had been an increase in the risk that the cumulative policy restraint would exceed what was required to bring inflation back to 2 he said he expects this idea will be much more in focus at the next few meetings especially in light of the emerging upward trend in jobless claims potentially signaling a real shift in the labor market we continue to expect the fed to hike by 50bp in december but then by only 25bp in january with no further hikes he said 12 05pm pmi data shows november decline the major us indices stayed steady at noon despite the latest set of purchasing managers index pmi numbers showing a decline in american manufacturing and services in november at midday the s p 500 was up by 0 1 at 4 008 the nasdaq composite was up by 0 4 at 11 214 while the dow jones slid into the red down by 0 06 to 34 076 points fawad razaqzada market analyst at stonex said inflation is everywhere and still very hot recent us data as well as things like falling shipping costs energy prices and easing supply constraints all suggest the worst may be over razaqzada wrote in a report that does not mean everything will cost less of course but the rate of price increases will slow down but worryingly we are getting more and more recessionary signals and this is what s going to drive financial markets going forward he noted that the us dollar fell sharply again today as concerns intensified that the economy is heading for a recession after a poor set of pmi numbers came out from the services and manufacturing sectors the manufacturing pmi fell into contraction at 47 6 compared to 50 4 last month while the services pmi slipped to 46 1 vs 48 0 expected and 47 8 in october an economic slowdown is expected to weigh on inflation reducing the need for the fed to maintain an aggressive tightening stance razaqzada wrote for now stock markets have remained supported as optimism over a less hawkish fed is outweighing growth concerns the major movers at noon included tesla and deere both up by 5 while warner brothers distribution rose by 3 7 and target was up by 2 8 on the downside autocad maker autodesk nasdaq adsk fell by 6 2 despite meeting analyst expectations on 3q earnings and revenues while schlumberger slid by 3 7 and moderna dropped by 2 6 9 35am caution prevails ahead of fed minutes us stocks opened largely unchanged on wednesday the last full trading day this week ahead of the thanksgiving long weekend just after the market opened the dow jones industrial average had added 26 points at 34 124 points the s p 500 was flat at 4 004 points and the nasdaq composite was up 7 points at 11 182 points forex com market analyst joshua warner noted that stocks were trading cautiously higher this morning as markets were awaiting the release of the minutes from the federal reserve s last meeting to gauge how the central bank might act at its next meeting in december the minutes will reveal how individual members feel about interest rates and the pace they want to see them rise going forward he said markets are currently pricing in a 75 chance that the fed will slow its next rate rise to 50bps with a 25 chance for another 75bps hike according to the cme fedwatch tool meanwhile initial jobless claims for the week ending november 19 came in at 240 000 claims the highest reading since mid august and ahead of the consensus analyst expectation of 225 000 6 30am fed in focus ahead of thanksgiving us stocks are expected to open flat to higher on wednesday ahead of the release of minutes from the federal reserve s rate setting deliberations earlier this month when it lifted interest rates by another 75 basis points with more interest on the pending thanksgiving holiday futures for the dow jones industrial average were up 0 1 in pre market trading while those for the s p 500 were also 0 1 higher while contracts for the nasdaq 100 were flat james hughes chief market analyst at scopemarkets com said the minutes could yet prove pivotal if there is clear messaging within them as to just how much further rates will go up us rate setters have delivered four consecutive interest rate increases of 75 basis points this year as they try to rein in runaway inflation investors will be hoping that with key indicators of inflation starting to ease rate setters may be starting to consider scaling back on future interest rate increases the minutes are due for release at 2 00pm et the focus will also fall on us new home sales figures for october due at 10 00am et today again any suggestion that this is running hot despite rising interest rates will again suggest there s more that needs to be done in terms of limiting inflationary pressures earnings news is also looking depressed ahead of the long weekend noted hughes elsewhere a surge in the number of covid 19 infections in china and the threat of lockdowns in the world s most populous country are keeping investors wary about slowing global economic activity although us stocks rose sharply on tuesday in spite of this once again it was optimism that the fed s monetary policy tightening exercise may be coming to a close that drove wall street higher during tuesday s session although renewed concerns over winter covid lockdowns in china arguably tempered gains said hughes with wall street closed on thursday and only open for a truncated session on friday given the overriding air of uncertainty there may be a temptation to de risk during the day he concluded contact the

the sustainability of the hong kong dollar s peg to the greenback adding that his firm pershing square has a significant short position on the currency we have a large notional short position against the hong kong dollar through the ownership of put options the pershing square holdings ceo said in a series of tweets if china is indeed a strong independent sovereign why does it need to peg its currency and that of hong kong s to the us dollar bill ackman billackman november 24 2022 the peg no longer makes sense for hong kong and it is only a matter of time before it breaks ackman wrote however currency strategist at bank of singapore sim moh siong said the peg will remain resilient as negative sentiment regarding china has recently calmed down with recent adjustments including china s quarantine period for international travelers the peg is likely to hold given that the fundamentals have continued to support the fed he said i think things might calmed down somewhat on the china

broadly supports singapore s latest announcement to expand job protection and benefits for gig workers from 2024 the decision includes guaranteeing injury compensation and pension payments as part of

implementation needs to be gradual citing current headwinds for the global economy such as recession concerns we will be guided by these considerations to ensure minimum impact on our partners earnings and consumer prices said grab the company called for the measures to be also applied to all gig platforms citing fairness concerns gojek said that the measures requiring companies to align the central provident fund pension contribution rates with that of employers will mean less take home earnings for the gig workers and that the company already has similar policies these recommendations will build on the existing safeguards we have in place for our driver partners offered through our driver benefits program gojek told cnbc jp ong sheila chiang new zealand s central

maine cdc director dr nirav shah said on tuesday that hospitals are severely strained by all three viruses example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video portland maine maine cdc director dr nirav shah offered tips on tuesday for people to stay healthy ahead of gathering for thanksgiving shah urged people to treat gatherings in three phases before during and after before you gather get your updated bivalent covid booster and stock up on tests for guests to take the day of the gathering you can get tests for free from accesscovidtests org the shots are also free during the gathering shah said the most important action people can take is to stay home if they feel sick meaning people should not travel to or attend the gathering after the gathering he urges people to monitor themselves for symptoms he said it is possible we could see a rise in flu covid or rsv if people do not take enough precautions there is a definite possibility that after the holiday gatherings we will see increases in covid rsv and the flu shah said it need not be that way because each one of us can take steps to reduce that likelihood but it s a risk covid lessening shah said hospitalizations and wastewater levels show less prevalence of covid he is urging people to get their bivalent booster to prevent a new surge as of wednesday more than 21 percent of maine people have gotten that shot according to the u s cdc ranking maine second in the country that s really great but i d love to see that 21 number a lot higher shah said the virus we re dealing with a year or two years from now is probably going to look a lot different from the one we ve got today but we ve got a vaccine that is really effective for the virus circulating today flu cases rising emergency room visits for flu like illnesses are up on average they make up more than 5 percent of all er visits that figure has doubled since the first of the month unfortunately given the trends we re seeing right now the flu situation is likely to get worse all the more reason to go out and get your flu shot shah said he said this year s flu shot is a better match for this version of the virus shah said it could help lessen the current burden on maine hospitals as of wednesday there are just three open pediatric critical care beds across the state while hospitals can flex standard medical beds into critical care beds by adding equipment and ventilation protocols the true difficulty is having the proper staff to care for the patients rsv straining hospitals shah said healthy habits are critical to slow the spread of rsv another respiratory virus hitting infants and toddlers particularly hard he urges people to stay home if they feel sick mask up in indoor crowded places and keep up good hand hygiene shah said he and his fellow public health leaders have discussed if there is a need to bring back mask mandates but said there is no final decision he said ultimately school district superintendents can make that call independent of the maine cdc right now we re really focused on asking families to do their part at home to help keep their kids safe shah said shah added there is one prevailing theory among medical experts about why the u s is seeing a surge in rsv cases he said staying home during the pandemic could be one factor many kids who were or normally would have been exposed to rsv in their first two years of life either lost some immunity or were not exposed at all when you combine the fact that there are more kids who are susceptible and fewer beds than we really ought to have it s unfortunate that we re seeing what we re seeing shah said

thaweesak saengngoen one of the biggest problems facing americans today is the high inflation rate currently plaguing the country this has gotten to the point of forcing many people to take on second jobs or go into debt simply to obtain the resources that they need to feed their families fortunately as investors we have other methods that we can use to obtain the extra money that we need to support ourselves one of the best of these methods is by investing in a closed end fund that specializes in the generation of income that s because these assets provide easy access to a diversified portfolio that can in many cases provide a higher yield than any of the underlying assets in this article we will discuss the first trust aberdeen global opportunity income fund fam which is one fund in this category that investors can use as of the time of writing the fund yields a very attractive 9 41 and trades at a very reasonable valuation i have discussed this fund before but more than a year has passed since that time so a great many things have changed this article will therefore focus specifically on these changes as well as provide an updated analysis of the fundâ s finances therefore let us investigate and determine if this fund could be a worthy addition to your portfolio today about the fund according to the fundâ s webpage the first trust aberdeen global opportunity income fund has the stated objective of providing a high level of current income although the fundâ s name is not clear about this the fund is a fixed income fund so this objective seems fairly obvious after all virtually all fixed income funds focus on the generation of income for their investors this makes sense since capital gains tend to be very hard to come by in the fixed income space this fund is somewhat unique though in that it invests its assets in the world bond markets this is an asset class that can be a bit difficult for american investors to gain exposure to so it s quite nice to have the opportunity the diversification that we can gain by adding this asset class to our portfolios is particularly appealing considering the financial problems currently affecting the us economy this fund does an excellent job at diversifying globally too which we should somewhat expect from an aberdeen fund as we can see only 18 79 of the fundâ s portfolio is invested in american bonds first trust this represents a significant increase over the 9 28 american exposure that we saw when we last reviewed the fund but it s still much better than peers this is evident in the fact that most global funds have a 60 to 70 weighting to the united states the lower percentage here is nice because it allows an investor to actually add this fund to a portfolio containing american bonds and reduce exposure to this country thus it reduces our concentration risk somewhat one thing that we do notice by looking at this portfolio is that the fund has completely dumped russian and most other european bonds from its portfolio over the past year in fact the only european bonds that are still in the portfolio are those of the netherlands this is not particularly surprising especially given the current political situation with respect to russia in the eurozone the finances of many governments have gotten considerably worse since the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic but they did make some headway in bringing down their national deficits in 2021 eurostat we can still see though that many of the nations in the eurozone still have debt to gdp ratios well above the 60 threshold dictated by the european union and even those countries that are below the threshold are still fairly close to it with that said though the united states has a debt to gdp ratio of 124 9 so it s higher than all but three countries in the eurozone greece italy and portugal the reason that this is important is that a high debt to gdp ratio has been associated with poor economic performance in 2013 a study from the world bank found that a nationâ s economic growth slows down once the debt to gdp ratio exceeds 77 for every percentage point above that gross domestic product growth slows by 0 017 this is one reason why gross domestic product growth in the united states has been very meager for the past two decades it s also a reason why we want to be including bonds from less indebted countries in our portfolios this fund is certainly doing that by including countries like australia saudi arabia and the netherlands that do have very low ratios after all the faster a countryâ s economy grows the more easily it can afford to make its debt payments as any experienced investor can likely tell you the major rating agencies issue letter grade ratings alongside bonds these ratings theoretically tell an investor how likely the issuer is to default on its bonds thus we want to have a look at the ratings of the assets in the fundâ s portfolio as part of our risk analysis here s the basic summary first trust mostly we see high quality bonds here in particular anything above a bbb rating is considered to have minimal default risk and we can see that this is the majority of the portfolio we also see that another sizable contingent is rated b or bb according to the official bond rating scale issuers whose bonds possess this rating are pretty unlikely to default outside of a severe economic shock thus the overall default risk across the fundâ s portfolio should be pretty low here risk averse and other conservative investors do not really have much to worry about one thing that we have been seeing is that bond prices have been declining over the past several months this has been caused by rising interest rates around the world in response to inflation most american investors are going to be most familiar with the federal reserve which started to raise interest rates back in march but in fact most central banks around the world have been hiking rates due to the high inflation that we are all seeing the first trust aberdeen global opportunity income fund has certainly been affected by this in the market as its price is down 39 45 year to date seeking alpha the reason why bond prices fall when interest rates rise is that investors want to earn a yield that s in line with interest rates thus when rates increase older bonds with lower rates fall in price until they have the same yield to maturity as a newly issued bond as the fund is invested in bonds its price will naturally decline to reflect the fact that the value of the assets in its portfolio is declining however one of the characteristics of bonds is that barring a default they still pay out their face value at maturity no matter what the current price is thus unless the fund is actually selling its bonds after they decline in price it s not really suffering a loss with that said the fund does actually sometimes sell bonds after they decline in price we can see that with the fundâ s disposition of its russian federation bonds as well as some of the european bonds that were previously in the fund in fact the fund has a 44 00 annual turnover which is on the high side for a fixed income fund as i have explained in various previous articles a high turnover creates a drag on the fundâ s performance this is because trading stocks or other assets costs money which is then billed to the fundâ s investors the fundâ s management must then generate sufficient returns to both cover these added expenses and deliver a return that is acceptable to investors with the money that s left over this is a difficult task and it s why very few funds consistently beat their benchmark indices admittedly this fund does not officially have a benchmark index but it has underperformed the vanguard total world bond etf bndw year to date that index fund is only down 12 94 over the period the vanguard fund is not a perfect comparison though since the first trust aberdeen fund invests primarily in sovereign bonds and the vanguard etf includes both corporate and sovereign securities we still see though that the performance of the closed end fund has been disappointing as interest rates are likely to keep rising in the short to medium term it seems likely that this fund will continue to decline in price for a while leverage as mentioned in the introduction closed end funds like the first trust aberdeen global opportunity income fund have the ability to deliver yields that are well in excess of those possessed by the underlying assets one of the strategies that are used to accomplish that is the use of leverage basically the fund borrows money and uses that borrowed money to purchase other bonds as long as the interest rate that it pays on the borrowed funds is less than the interest rate that it receives from the purchased assets this strategy works pretty well to boost the yield of the portfolio as the fund is able to borrow money at institutional rates this will usually be the case unfortunately the use of debt is a double edged sword as leverage boosts both gains and losses as such we want to ensure that the fund is not using too much debt since that would expose us to an unacceptable level of risk i do not typically like to see a fundâ s leverage above a third as a percentage of assets for this reason the fund currently has a leverage ratio of 32 40 of its assets so it fulfills this requirement the fund thus appears to be maintaining a reasonable balance between risk and reward distribution analysis as mentioned earlier in this article the first trust aberdeen global opportunity income fund has the stated objective of providing its investors with a high level of current income in addition the fund invests in bonds using leverage to boost its effective yield as such we might assume that the fund will pay a very high distribution yield this is indeed the case as the fund currently pays out a monthly distribution of 0 0450 per share 0 54 per share annually which gives it a 9 41 yield at the current price unfortunately the fund has not been particularly consistent with this distribution and it has fluctuated quite a bit over the years cef connect the fact that the fund has cut its distribution four times in the past 12 months is likely to be quite concerning to many investors this is especially true because the rising rate environment has allowed several other fixed income funds to boost their payouts what s probably happening here is that the rising rates are pinching the fundâ s spread between the rate that it gets from its assets and the rate that it pays on its debt but that is by no means certain either way it s concerning and it s certain to be a bit of a turn off to those investors that are looking for a stable and secure source of income to help cover their rising costs of living these same investors may be concerned with the fact that a significant proportion of the fundâ s distributions are classified as return of capital which is quite rare for a bond fund fidelity investments the reason that this can be concerning is that a return of capital distribution can be a sign that the fund is returning the investorsâ own money back to them this is obviously not sustainable over any sort of extended period there are of course other things that can cause a distribution to be considered a return of capital distribution however most of these include things such as the distribution of unrealized capital gains or income from options strategies and are generally not relevant here which is why we do not often see much return of capital from bond funds as such we should investigate to determine exactly how the fund is financing these distributions so that we can figure out how sustainable they are likely to be fortunately we do have a relatively recent report to consult for that purpose the fundâ s most recent financial report corresponds to the six month period ending june 30 2022 as such it should give us a pretty good idea of how well the fund performed during the initial stages of the central banksâ tightening regime during that six month period the first trust aberdeen global opportunity income fund brought in 2 841 546 in interest from the assets from its portfolio when combined with a small amount of income from other sources the fund had a total income of 2 846 223 during the period the fund paid its expenses out of this amount leaving it with 1 831 898 available for investors this was not nearly enough to cover the 3 905 021 that the fund actually paid out in distributions which is certainly concerning at first glance the fund does have other means to obtain the money that it needs to cover its distribution however chief among these are capital gains which are still possible for fixed income funds even though bonds are not going to deliver the same sort of gains that we can get from the stock market as might be expected from the rising rate regime though the fund failed miserably in this task in the first half of 2022 the fund had net realized losses of 7 338 131 which was amplified by net unrealized losses of 20 184 520 overall the fund saw its assets under management decline by 29 579 809 after accounting for all inflows and outflows this is obviously not the kind of thing that we like to see and it certainly explains the distribution cuts the fund will need to work to turn this around and it may not be easy until rates begin to decline once again valuation it s always critical that we do not overpay for any asset in our portfolios this is because overpaying for any asset is a surefire way to generate a suboptimal return on that asset in the case of a closed end fund like the first trust aberdeen global opportunity fund the usual way to value it is by looking at the fundâ s net asset value the net asset value of a fund is the total current market value of all the fundâ s assets minus any outstanding debt it s therefore the amount that the investors would receive if the fund were immediately shut down and liquidated ideally we want to purchase shares of a fund when we can acquire them at a price that is less than the net asset value that s because such a scenario implies that we are acquiring the fundâ s assets for less than they are actually worth that s fortunately the case with this fund as of nov 22 2022 the most recent date for which data is currently available the first trust aberdeen global opportunity income fund had a net asset value of 6 54 per share but the shares actually trade for 5 74 per share this gives the fundâ s shares a 12 23 discount to net asset value at the current price this is a very reasonable price that is only slightly worse than the 12 84 discount that the shares have traded at on average over the past 30 days conclusion in conclusion the first trust aberdeen global opportunity income fund has a lot to like and a lot not to like the fund offers one of the most internationally diverse portfolios that can be found anywhere a high distribution yield and a very attractive price however it also seems likely that it will continue to decline in price until the various central banks around the world begin slashing interest rates again the fund also will quite likely cut its distributions further overall i want to like this fund but i cannot recommend buying it today even with the large discount

britain s huge aid spending in afghanistan has been implicated in criminality and human rights abuses a damning report finds today some 252 million of taxpayers money was given to corrupt afghan police even though they were acting as a paramilitary force and engaged in extortion torture and extra judicial killings it said senior civil servants repeatedly tried to end the handouts but were overruled at the highest levels of the uk government according to the independent commission for aid impact icai watchdog icai commissioner sir hugh bayley said last night it s clear that the remarkable efforts by those working on the uk aid programme made a significant difference to many people in afghanistan some 252 million of taxpayers money was given to corrupt afghan police even though they were acting as a paramilitary force and engaged in extortion torture and extra judicial killings according to the independent commission for aid impact icai watchdog stock image of the view of kabul from surrounding mountains however the way the uk pursued its primary objective of building a viable afghan state contained key flaws that contributed to its ultimate failure and there are questions around the appropriateness of using uk aid to fund afghan counter insurgency operations the study reveals that almost 3 5 billion in uk aid was given to afghanistan in the past two decades as part of an ambitious international attempt to turn it into a stable and functional state however there were major flaws in this approach as the mission was led by the united states which wanted to defeat the taliban and exclude them from the political process the foreign office said uk aid improved health increased school enrolment provided humanitarian support to the most vulnerable and led the way in clearing landmines and other unexploded munitions over six years the uk spent 252million on the salaries of local police and prison officers in an attempt to improve security but the icai report notes that the afghan national police acted primarily as a paramilitary force operating armed checkpoints across the country in an attempt to control the taliban insurgency heavy casualties led to low morale desertions theft of arms and ghost officers on the payroll there were numerous reports from human rights organisations of police corruption and brutality including extortion arbitrary detention torture and extrajudicial killings the watchdog states although uk support help protect residents from the taliban and reduced demands for bribes the police force did not develop a substantial civilian policing role making it a questionable use of the aid budget we found evidence of a number of attempts at senior levels to terminate the support which were overruled at the highest levels of the uk government the study says
vintage television 1946 rca 621ts television restoration by dr hugo holden the 621ts is a remarkable television set it is rca s first post ww2 set using pre war television technology but introducing several new ideas these include line output efficiency damping fm sound complex line output transformer core metallurgy and improvements in crt design t he 1946 rca 621ts set has a 7 inch 18cm screen with a 7dp4 crt the 7dp4 has an 8kv maximum eht voltage typically 6kv uses an ion trap magnet and provides a very bright high contrast picture the cabinet was designed by the respected industrial designer john vassos in 1941 ww2 meant a six year delay to get it to market the model was quickly replaced by a 10 inch 25cm set the rca 630ts with a 10bp4 crt the chassis of the set i acquired was in very poor and rusted condition typical for its age see photo 1 it required a complete rebuild using similar techniques to those used in the hmv904 restoration described in the november 2018 issue see siliconchip com au article 11314 in the post war period it became standard practice to enclose the line output transformer and eht rectifier in a separate cage in this case on the 94 silicon chip lower right of the chassis the power transformer at lower left was mounted on the chassis under surface to keep it as far as possible from the crt to avoid magnetic interference with the beam tv overview ww2 somewhat delayed the 621ts s development one of its an example image of the set taken from an advertisement australia s electronics magazine important new design elements was a 7 inch electromagnetically deflected crt with a high final anode voltage of 7 5kv this gave a bright high contrast image that could easily be viewed in good room lighting most pre ww2 tvs ran lower eht voltages and could not produce such a high contrast image the 621ts was designed to receive the standard american vhf range of tv station frequencies for channel 1 45 25mhz video carrier 49 75mhz sound to 13 211 25mhz video 215 75mhz sound the set s oscillator runs above the received channel frequencies taking channel 1 as an example the kallitron oscillator runs at 71mhz the sound intermediate frequency if emerging from the tuner is at 21 25mhz while the picture video if is 25 75mhz the picture video carrier is amplitude modulated am while the sound is frequency modulated fm siliconchip com au compared to pre ww2 tv sets which had am sound the sound carrier wave was transmitted 4 5mhz higher than the vision carrier they had not yet moved to inter carrier sound in this system the two carriers beat together at the video detector output to produce a 4 5mhz carrier wave passing on to a 4 5mhz sound if amplifier however in the 621ts the 21 25mhz sound if carrier is taken directly from the converter coil into the sound if only a few years later most american tvs had moved to inter carrier sound the advantage was that the sound did not drift out of tune with variations in local oscillator frequency at the tail end of this amplifier is the fm detector in this case a discriminator type where the driving stage is designed to amplitude limit the 4 5mhz carrier later many manufacturers moved to a ratio detector design which has the advantage of inherent amplitude limiting you can find the service manual with circuit diagrams etc at the early television foundation website siliconchip au link abge tuner the tuner is a separate assembly very similar to the type of tuned box seen in practically all tv sets after 1946 however it does not use a rotating drum instead it has an array of rotary switches the tuner is very elegant and is based on three 6j6 twin triodes based on one 6j6 dual triode v1 the input stage is a para phase differential amplifier that is neutralised by two small 1 5pf capacitors from the plate of one triode to the grid of the other this design became very popular later in wideband oscilloscope circuits in this case though the anode loads are broadly tuned in the region of the received station frequency the received frequencies are then passed to the converter mixer stage v2 using inductive link coupling the converter also receives the signal from the local oscillator again by inductive link coupling and the signals are mixed in the plate circuits of both the triodes of the v2 which are connected together in the converter stage to feed the converter coil the converter stage has an astonishingly large converter coil with a siliconchip com au photo 1 the chassis of the 621ts was acquired with a heaping of dust and rust large tuning slug the coil assembly is close to 25mm in diameter and about 75mm tall oscillator the 6j6 twin triode local oscillator circuit around v3 shown in fig 1 is pleasingly symmetrical on its face it could be regarded as an over neutralised unstable para phase amplifier which with high feedback from each plate to the grid of the other triode via the 4 7pf capacitors resembles a classic multi vibrator circuit however the load for each plate is a split resonant circuit which generates a negative resistance if a negative resistance is applied across a resonant or tank circuit it will oscillate the arrangement is a kallitron oscillator sometimes spelled with one l but it has two ls in terman s radio engineers handbook adjustment creates the bandpass characteristic of the video if in this set the bandpass characteristic is very well described in the service manual fig 2 the bandpass characteristic is only in the order of 3mhz for the video which is enough to support a fairly detailed picture on the relatively small screen later as the crts got bigger the bandwidth had to increase to have good high frequency picture detail in rca s next tv the 630ts they moved to a 10 inch crt and the video bandwidth was a little closer to 4mhz video audio if stages the video if stage consists of a string of four stagger tuned circuits based on 6ag5 pentodes v101 v102 v103 v104 like the 6j6 these revolutionary small 7 pin types would ultimately lead to the demise of their larger octal base counterparts a few years later the 6ag5 turned out to be an excellent performer in the vhf turret tuner units of many brands of tv sets the stagger tuning with correct australia s electronics magazine fig 1 the oscillator section of the circuit based on a 6j6 dual triode v3 december 2022 95 fig 2 with the receiver rf oscillator operating at a higher frequency than the received carrier the intermediate frequency relation of picture to sound carrier is reversed as shown below picture signals the fm sound detector has the typical s shape required for fm sound demodulation the audio stages consist of 6at6 triode driver v117 and 6k6 audio output stage v118 the maximum power output from a 6k6 is generally around 4w similar to the more common 6v6 beam power valve so there is plenty of audio power vertical scan the curve shown is typical of the picture if amplifier response the output from the video detector an octal 6h6 v104a passes to video preamplifier triode v105 half of a 6sn7 the other half is used for video output to the crt one interesting feature is that the video dc restoration is done at the grid of this video output valve the positive sync tips cause grid current with the grid cathode acting as a diode this clamps the sync tip and the black level to a stable point the anode of this valve is directly coupled into the grid of the 7dp4 crt the plate load of the 6sn7b has both shunt and series peaking with inductors to maintain the frequency response required for the video signal this became industry standard for the video output stage the video background is unstable depending on the image contrast without direct coupling from the video detector and amplifier to the crt or dc restoration the sound carrier frequency of 21 25mhz is filtered out by t101 to avoid any sound interfering with the this is handled by another 6sn7 v107 one triode is used as a combined blocking oscillator and discharge valve with a small transformer running at 60hz the other triode in the 6sn7 is used for the vertical output discharge in this case refers to rapidly discharging a sawtooth capacitor c130 which is then charged via a high resistance source this generates the sawtooth wave required for the scan however a trapezoidal wave is needed to develop a sawtooth current in an inductor with resistance such as the vertical yoke coils this is created by placing a small resistor typically less than 5kw here r149 3 3kw in series with the sawtooth capacitor the vertical output transformer matches the output stage to the vertical yoke coils in the usual manner horizontal scan and eht generation the horizontal oscillator running at 15 75khz is also half of another 6sn7 v108 the oscillator is synchronised on a line by line basis from the sync pulses by the late 1940s this idea was abandoned in favour of an automatic frequency control circuit afc with better noise immunity operating on the same principles as a phase locked loop pll the other triode in the same 6sn7 is used as a separate discharge valve the drive then passes to a substantial power output valve 6bg6 v109 with a 0 9a heater it is specifically designed to be a sweep valve for horizontal output stages withstanding very high peak anode voltages in the order of 6 6kv peaks of a few kv appear on the anode during flyback in this set the flyback circuit uses energy recovery damping with 5v4 damper diode v111 see the following panel on the evolution of the damper diode for details this was a revolution in tv design providing highly efficient horizontal scanning using the stored magnetic energy from the right half of the scan to scan the left side at the same time it created the high voltage flyback pulse that could be stepped up to many kilovolts and be rectified in this case with a 1b3 rectifier v110 to run the crt s final anode before this idea of using the energy recovery diode the scanning was less efficient and the required damping wasted energy in resistors and sometimes diodes as heat generally because pre ww2 sets had no high voltage spike in the horizontal scan output stages from which to derive eht they simply used a line transformer large filter capacitors were needed to remove the ripple and the supplies were a lot more dangerous photos 2 3 the line output transformer shown disassembled at left and whole at right has an advanced moulded iron core made of three parts this was around the time most manufacturers were switching to ferrite cored transformers 96 silicon chip australia s electronics magazine siliconchip com au photo 4 the unrestored chassis without the crt the photo above shows a close up of one of the valves with a lead shield as they could source higher currents and store more energy it is safer to have a flyback supply with a relatively high internal resistance to generate the few milliamps needed a supply that can deliver more than 30ma at several kv is hazardous contrary to what some believe the charge stored on the bulb of a crt after turn off is low and generally cannot harm a person as a one off discharge this is why even with the set running very few if any tv technicians have received a fatal shock from a flyback eht supply for a crt as they can mostly only source relatively low currents line output transformer the line output transformer in this set is very interesting it has an advanced moulded iron core made of three parts it s visible disassembled in photo 2 and assembled in photo 3 the core is intermediate in appearance between a ferrite dust core and an iron core laminated iron cores struggled to work well at the 15 75khz horizontal scan frequency however some uk made tv sets still used iron cored line output transformers even in the post war period within a decade after the 621ts was released most american tv manufacturers had moved to ferrite cored horizontal output transformers this basic design set the standard for practically all line output transformers to follow complete with the two turn winding for the eht rectifier a dirty and rusty chassis photo 4 shows the unrestored chassis with the crt removed with a close up after i had removed the superficial dust and dirt removed one valve has a lead shield with a spring clip holding it in place as is standard practice i hollowed out the original wax paper capacitors and fitted new polyester types with double the original voltage ratings inside i then poured polyester into each end to seal them up on alternate days after that i had the chassis finebead blasted to remove all the rust re plated with 20 micron electro less nickel and lacquer coated this helps to avoid corrosion and finger marks i rebuilt the tuner first the tuner in this set is space age sophisticated for 1946 its features include a differential input rf amplifier with neutralisation based on a 6j6 another 6j6 kallitron oscillator and the spectacular large mixer coil driven by the combined anode signals from another 6j6 the use of a combination of both ferromagnetic materials and brass slugs to tune the coils is also advanced the idea behind the large mixer coil seen on the top of photos 5 6 is to create a very high q loosely coupled selective sound take off the large sound if coil is spaced away from the former to avoid it being tuned by distributed capacitance instead it is tuned mainly by the high q 62pf dog bone ceramic capacitor across it the mixer anode coil for the video is broadly tuned and loaded by a 10kw resistor and the plate impedance of the 6j6 mixer valve while restoring the tuner i replaced most of the bypass coupling capacitors with silver mica types except the local oscillator feedback capacitors i replaced those with 500v 4 7pf mil spec dog bone ceramic capacitors with the same temperature coefficient as the originals the same goes for the continued on page 100

cleaned up 1 5pf neutralisation capacitors in the 6j6 based rf amplifier i mainly used metal film resistors throughout that helps to keep the noise down a little the valve sockets are nos new old stock including the original push on shield type for the local oscillator valve i replaced the push on shield identical to the rusted original i also replaced the rivets and original screws with 4 40 and 6 32 stainless steel screws to avoid future rusting although i used stainless locking washers applying varnish to the threads never hurts so i did restoration well underway photos 7 9 show the chassis progress throughout the restoration by photo 9 the underside of the chassis was re wired and fitted with all new resistors wiring and valve sockets the resistors are now all 2w metal film types yet the same size as the original 1 4w or 1 2w types after replacing the innards i cleaned the wax off the cardboard shells of the wax paper capacitors and varnished them with marine grade varnish this way they look excellent but the surface is not tacky to touch and won t pick up as much dust as wax does i replaced the octal sockets with american mil spec brown phenolic sockets with wrap around pins and stainless steel saddles similarly i replaced the 7 pin sockets with american phenolic sockets from antique electronic supply aes aes usa supplied all the new capacitors including the micas electros and polyesters several nos valves for the set the 300bx power transformer and new tag strips they always send me excellent valves and parts at competitive prices the adjustable if coils had very rusty spring mounting clips so i replaced them with new ones as they are a common part of many nos coils the originals were soldered to the chassis on the top presumably to prevent capacitive effects from affecting the if tuning i simply soldered them to the nearest earth lugs under the chassis with a short link wire to avoid soldering to the top surface of the chassis the new wiring is medical grade silicone rubber covered hook up wire which looks just like old fashioned 100 silicon chip australia s electronics magazine siliconchip com au photo 10 the top of the chassis once nearly finished being restored rubber covered wire but is extremely heat resistant and this insulation never melts back near the solder joints even if the iron is set to 480 c the wire is pleasant to handle and flexible but stays where it is put on the whole it is about 2 5mm outside diameter and has 16 strands once you have used superior wire like this it is tough to go back to pvc covered wire or anything else silicone covered wire is available from jaycar altronics and rs components i stuck to the colour scheme on the wiring diagram where possible fabric c overed wire is available although i suspect it would meet the same fate as the original wire over the next 60 years the silicone rubber wire will outlast it i m sure ideally i want the restoration to look about the same in 50 years photo 10 shows the top of the chassis close to the end of the restoration process photo 11 i designed this support to allow the crt to be mounted when the chassis is out of the cabinet the support sits on top of the speaker brackets and is shown in greater detail in fig 3 below mounting the crt for testing the 621ts chassis design only allows the crt to be mounted properly when the chassis is in the cabinet this is very inconvenient when the chassis is out of the cabinet so i designed the support shown in fig 3 it is attached by lengthening the two upper speaker screws and adding two spacers and it sits on the speaker brackets see photo 11 the screw holes are best marked out after the bracket is in place the crt sits on it and you can strap the crt to the bracket with a large industrial sized nylon cable tie with the chassis out of the cabinet the added timber bracket can stay put when the chassis is re fitted to the cabinet and the crt is mounted in the usual way the radius of curvature of the cutout in the timber is 93 5mm this is reduced to 90 5mm when the rubber cushion is added to hug the crt curvature the bracket geometry ensures the crt neck is very close to level with the chassis surface no extra holes need to be drilled to fit it photo 12 shows the crt fitted to the chassis with the assistance of the bracket for testing and adjustment power transformer photo 13 includes the original power transformer i took the copper flux band and covers off it and blasted siliconchip com au fig 3 the support bracket helps the neck of the crt reach close to level with the chassis surface it s designed so that no extra holes need to be drilled into the chassis to fit it it is attached by lengthening two screws from the speaker brackets and adding two spacers the screw holes can be marked out by hand after the bracket is in place australia s electronics magazine december 2022 101 photos 12 13 the crt shown fitted to the chassis left and the original new power transformers right the original brackets free of rust then had them powder coated black the finish looks very similar to the original and is corrosion and scratch resistant i then added the restored brackets to a new hammond 300bx transformer discarding the hammond covers as they are pretty different the two transformers have very close to the same geometry stack just with the holes placed a little differently the two wires for the 120v configured primary windings have to exit via an additional hole in the top bracket the reason for doing all this is that the original power transformer is not safe to run again especially in australia with our 50hz supply frequency the transformer has very aged and cracked insulation and draws an excessive magnetisation current at 50hz for example with no load the rms current at 115 120v 50hz is 1 5a compared to 47ma for the hammond 300bx transformer configured for 120v which is designed for 50 60hz operation in general old american 60hz transformers run very hot on 50hz there are also significant stray magnetic fields generated switching to the hammond transformer solved the problem the windings on the hammond are close to an exact match for the original i connected two 5v 1 2a windings in parallel to run the 5v4g damper diode used one 5v 3a winding for the 5u4g one 6v 6a winding for the main heaters and one 800v centre tapped winding for the ht supply there is only one winding missing a small 6 3v one for the crt heater so i added a small auxiliary transformer 102 silicon chip for that there is a convenient place to locate it and only one hole needs to be drilled to mount it i made this by winding a small 1 1 17 ratio isolating transformer which gives a separate 6 3v output at 0 6a to provide the crt heater supply from the power transformer s 6 3v winding note that the data sheet on hammond s website says the 300bx has only one 5v 1 2a winding when in fact it has two at switch on from cold the heavy loading of all of the tv s low resistance cold heaters results in a slow rise in the initial heater currents due to the limited current handling ability of the power transformer so in a sense the larger valves protect the smaller ones at switch on but in series heater chains resistors or thermistors brimistors are needed as the internal resistance of the mains power supply is very low and the initial surge current in the cold heater chain is very high the smaller valves warm up first due to lower thermal inertia and more voltage is developed across their heaters without current limiting it is interesting to note that the same problem described above will occur within any indirectly heated valve if you connect the heater pins across a power supply of very low internal resistance the part of the heater close to its internal connections warms up first as there is less thermal inertia there than the part in contact with the cathode or the weld to the pin connection so you will get an initial bright flash from that area of the heater at turn on in fact you can get this effect if you unplug nearly all of the large valves in a tv except for a small one at switch on you ll also get a bright flash as the large power transformer is under these circumstances able to maintain 6 3v across the single small valve s pins without the voltage collapsing under load i had to replace the two turn heater winding for the 1b3 rectifier as the original had degraded insulation i found some identical geometry wire photo 14 the original cabinet had been enlarged around the crt photo 15 i cut a piece of oak to reproduce the original crt window valve heater inrush currents australia s electronics magazine siliconchip com au photo 16 the restored cabinet with the newly made crt cutout inside the red sheath of some modern 25kv anode wire also all of the large allen bradley resistors in the focus chain were open circuit i replaced them with 10kv rated philips focus grade resistors i also replaced the doorknob capacitor with a 1000pf 15kv type the same physical size as the original 500pf capacitor allowing for crts without external aquadag i m not 100 sure if the original doorknob capacitor is ok it only reads 375pf and i ve read reports of them failing in the 621ts electrical alignment i aligned the set according to the manufacturer s instructions but also with the aid of a sweep generator scope 1 shows the overall response from the antenna to the video detector screen 1 is an un retouched image taken via a camcorder on still frame with an rf modulator the broad grey vertical band at the top is an artefact of the camera s exposure time versus the scanning frame rate of the picture cabinet restoration one big problem i had with the set was that the cabinet section over the crt face had been cut away to enlarge the viewable area of the crt perhaps one previous owner wanted a bigger picture so some timber was missing as shown in photo 14 i cut out a square area and glued in some tasmanian oak to repair this i then varnished it and shaped it to match the original design and fit the curved crt face applying varnish initially helps with getting the geometry right as one files the timber away by hand finally i lacquered it to match the original part and got the result shown in photo 15 photo 16 shows the restored cabinet while the lead photo is the final result summary the 621ts is an extraordinary television set marking a major milestone in commercial tv manufacturing the entire design is futuristic and the performance is outstanding for a set put on sale in 1946 fm sound became the gold standard scope 1 the overall response from the antenna siliconchip com au for television audio after ww2 and the line deflection energy recovery system did too any similarly sized monochrome television set made decades later would not have outperformed it the design of the 621ts except for the absence of the inter carrier sound system and a horizontal afc system both of which would come in later tv designs set the modern standard of what a monochrome tv would be right up until the mid 1970s finally from the perspective of industrial design mr vassos created yet another art deco masterpiece see panel overleaf screen 1 an image of the 621ts screen from a camcorder australia s electronics magazine december 2022 103 the evolution of the damper diode in tv line output stages very basic coupling of the yoke to the line output valve via a transformer is shown in fig a at flyback the valve is cut off and the magnetic field in the transformer and yoke collapses resonating due to the self inductance and distributed capacitance of these structures the oscillatory voltages and currents are due to relatively undamped oscillations these oscillations visible in the scanning raster decay away and become damped out when the line output valve is again driven into conduction by the drive voltage these oscillations must be eliminated for satisfactory raster scanning fig b shows the same circuit but with resistive damping damping occurs over the entire duration of the sawtooth current scanning waveform on both the positive and negative excursions ie it is bidirectional damping this is wasteful of energy lengthens the flyback period and reduces the opportunity to utilise the positive going high voltage spikes generated at the line output valve s anode or via an overwind coil to generate eht fig c shows an improvement to resistive damping using a snubber network this technique is used in the 1939 hmv marconi 904 the rc network is frequency selective applying the most damping to the parts of the waveform with the highest rates of change this reduces the oscillations shown in red however because the flyback period contains high frequency fourier components it is also damped again this wastes energy and lengthens the flyback period fig d shows what might appear to be the introduction of an efficiency diode as in the rca trk9 and trk 12 but it is not this circuit has the damper conducting only during flyback and is actually a spike suppressor a true efficiency diode conducts during the active scan time on the left hand side of the scanning raster and recovers energy from the yoke and line output transformer magnetic fields the circuit of fig d damps the flyback voltage oscillations and absorbs energy when the output valve is cut off this arrangement can t be used in a system to generate eht from the flyback voltage spike in 1938 the baird bush tv and radio company in the united kingdom used the circuit shown in fig e on the left side this is probably one of the first examples of energy recovery scanning when the magnetic field in the line output transformer collapses the diode conducts on the first negative half cycle of voltage on the diode s cathode to produce a more linear rate of change in current this damps the oscillations and also returns energy to the power supply this was the precursor of the typical transistorised line output stage in early transistor televisions in the early 1960s depicted on the right of fig e although the circuit in fig f looks a little similar to that in fig e it is actually quite different with the diode on the transformer secondary side observe the transformer polarity the current from damping the oscillations charges capacitor cb and provides energy to load r cb charges up and lifts the cathode potential of the damper diode fig a fig b fig e 104 fig f silicon chip australia s electronics magazine siliconchip com au so the plate potential has to rise to a higher value to establish conduction this helps ensure that the diode is not conducting until the start of active scan time so there is negligible damping during the flyback period this system is recovering energy from the magnetic field of the yoke and transformer which was stored at the end of active horizontal scan time and delivering it to a load this is the basic circuit used in the rca 621ts except the voltage generated across the capacitor is in series with the b voltage to create what we now know as b boost voltage when the line output valve is cut off at flyback the first voltage oscillation half cycle takes the damper anode negative cutting it off during flyback the damper anode has the opposite polarity to the anode of the line output valve then when the oscillation brings the voltage positive the damper conducts this damps the oscillations and results in a near linear scanning current at the left side of the raster as the magnetic field in the yoke and transformer now collapse in a controlled damped linear way toward zero however before the current reaches zero the line output valve is driven into conduction and the process repeats the yoke and transformer circuit is equivalent to an inductor with series resistance tuned by parallel distributed capacitance or a tuning capacitor if fitted the voltage you see across the transformer or yoke s terminals represents the voltage across the capacitive component which lags behind the circuit current by 90 when the output valve is cut off the circuit current during the flyback period is associated with a negative peak voltage on the damper anode and a positive peak on the line output valve s anode these peaks occur around the middle of the 10 16μs flyback interval for the american system at the time of this peak the yoke s current is zero but has its greatest rate of change and the rate of change of voltage on the diode s anode although at its peak is zero after that the secondary voltage returns to zero after flyback and the current is at a negative maximum with the beam on the left of the raster as the voltage at the damper anode attempts to oscillate in a positive direction the damper diode conducts damping the oscillations and giving a more linear current at the beginning of active scan time on the left side of the raster the load resistor can now be replaced with the primary circuit as shown in fig g rca used this basic circuit in the 621ts and this or a modified version of it became the modern standard for line output stage deflection using valves ever since cb s negative end can either be returned to ground or b as shown which is at ground from an ac perspective now the recovered potential energy generated by the magnetic field of the yoke and transformer which was provided by the primary circuit at the end of the scan right side of the raster is used to generate a boost voltage to help supply the primary circuit this gives a higher primary supply potential the b boost voltage which helps attain the required picture width from a lower voltage b supply fig c fig d fig g siliconchip com au fig h australia s electronics magazine december 2022 105 as is always the case no additional energy is created that was not already supplied by the power supply in the first place the circuit is simply more efficient because overall the damped current is not wasted as heat which it is in all cases of resistive damping moving on the fig h we can see what happens if we redraw fig g circuit with cb connected to ground this circuit as deployed in the 621ts with slight modifications is the basis for modern valve line scanning at switch on a direct current flows via the secondary winding and the damper diode to charge cb to b potential and to initially supply the b to the primary circuit during operation the voltage across cb charges to b boost therefore cb needs to be rated to handle this higher voltage this circuit is inconvenient because the transformer cannot be configured as an auto transformer but it is a minor modification to introduce b directly at the anode of the damper diode then the circuit comprising the secondary damper diode and cb can be rotated to create the circuit of fig i this circuit has the advantage that the cb only needs to be rated to handle the boost component of the b boost voltage rather than the total amount also the primary and secondary can be one tapped winding with the yoke coupled across any part of it in an efficient autotransformer configuration admiral used this basic configuration in the early 1950s for example in their series 23 chassis by the time that efficient energy recovery line output stages arrived it had become the custom as it is in the 621ts to derive the eht from an over wind linked to the plate circuit of the line output valve shown in red in fig i the heater supply for this eht diode was derived from a small number of well insulated turns on the output transformer other variations of damper diode circuits from the post war period include a triode pair used as a controlled damper diode which gives additional control over the linsc earity of the sawtooth scanning current fig i

criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

the delaware court of chancery in in re carvana co no 2020 0415 ksjm del ch june 30 2022 applied the recently adopted zuckerberg test for demand futility and denied the defendants motion to dismiss the court found that the stockholders in this derivative action pled demand futility by alleging facts showing that two of the six directors had deep personal and professional ties to a third director defendant ernest garcia iii who received a material personal financial benefit in the transaction at issue such that they could not objectively consider a demand to pursue litigation against garcia iii the court then found that the plaintiffs stated a viable breach of fiduciary duty claim and that the transaction at issue a us 600 million stock offering to garcia his father and a few other select investors during a march 2020 pandemic related dip in stock prices would be subject to entire fairness review because it was not approved by a majority of disinterested directors carvana co carvana is an e commerce platform for buying and selling used cars founded by defendant ernest garcia ii garcia ii and his son ernest garcia iii garcia iii who is the ceo president and chairman of carvana together the garcias control 92 percent of the voting power in carvana according to the complaint after the stock market declined in february 2020 due to the onset of the covid 19 pandemic carvana and its management reviewed the business to assess whether it needed an influx of capital the plaintiffs alleged that garcia iii and his team determined that carvana did not need more capital to survive the pandemic because it could cut costs and streamline operations and had reached a significant new financing agreement with a major lender nevertheless while carvana s stock was trading down from us 110 on february 21 to less than us 30 on march 20 the plaintiffs allege that garcia iii began to orchestrate a capital raise through a non public direct offering according to the complaint garcia iii handpicked investors to participate in the offering and led a rushed negotiation and board approval process though he abstained from the final board vote the direct offering closed on march 30 at us 45 per share with each of the garcias purchasing us 25 million worth of carvana stock the plaintiffs allege that as soon as the short swing trading period expired carvana s stock price had soared and garcia ii sold carvana shares for a total of us 478 4 million section 220 demands and stockholder suits followed with the court consolidating the cases in january 2021 the defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint for failure to allege demand futility and failure to state a claim focusing on the third prong of the demand futility test recently adopted by the delaware supreme court in zuckerberg the court considered whether the allegedly conflicted directors lacked independence from a defendant who received a material personal financial benefit from the alleged misconduct that would be the subject of the litigation the court concluded that two of carvana s directors lacked independence from the garcias who had received material financial benefits in the direct offering at issue the court found that the first potentially conflicted director gregory sullivan lacked independence from garcia ii because garcia ii gave sullivan a job at drivetime another used car business owned by the garcia family after sullivan was censured by the new york stock exchange for actions he took on behalf of garcia ii sullivan rose through the ranks at that job to eventually become the ceo and then when sullivan left drivetime to invest his savings into a new business garcia ii made a significant investment into that venture the court concluded that it was reasonably conceivable that sullivan could not objectively consider a demand to bring litigation against garcia ii the man who allegedly saved career helped generate personal wealth and financially shores current livelihood with regard to the second director ira platt the court found that the plaintiffs adequately pled facts showing that platt was conflicted because he gave garcia iii his first job after college garcia iii later gave platt s son an internship at carvana garcia ii appointed platt to numerous lucrative director positions and the garcias caused carvana to gift platt nearly us 30 million worth of carvana equity when no other directors received similar grants given that carvana had a six member board and that there was no dispute that the garcias had received personal financial benefits in the direct offering these allegations were sufficient to show demand futility the court wrapped up its decision by rejecting garcia iii s arguments that a he could not be liable for breaching his fiduciary duties in approving the transaction because he abstained from the final board vote and b that the transaction should be subject to the business judgment rule on the first argument the court noted that abstaining from a final vote is a fact intensive argument that does not provide a get out of jail free card at the motion to dismiss stage particularly where the plaintiffs alleged facts showing that garcia iii played a significant role in negotiating structuring and approving the direct offering on the second argument the court determined that the plaintiffs had already established at least at the pleading stage that half of the board was conflicted in approving the direct offering and therefore that the entire fairness test applied and not the business judgment rule

a furious elon mask has rubbished a journalist s claims that the scandal hit crypto king sam bankman fried owns shares in twitter the tesla founder was accused by the disgraced former new york times reporter ben smith of calling on the ftx wunderkind to help fund his mammoth twitter deal online news outlet semafor alleged that musk texted bankman fried on may 5 and invited him to keep his 100million stake in the social media company when it is transferred to private ownership semafor is a startup set up last month by smith who published the now debunked steele dossier when he was editor in chief at buzzfeed news responding to the allegations in a story by liz hoffman musk hit out at smith whose startup received a huge cash injection from bankman fried he said all public holders of twitter were allowed to roll their stock into twitter as a private company but he did not do so your reporting made it falsely sound like he did when in fact he owns 0 for the last time how much of you does sbf own stop dodging the question to be direct the very real concern here is that you have been pushing a completely false sbf ownership of twitter narrative while effectively being his paid shill in another tweet musk said their claims were flat wrong and there is no gray area on whether bankman fried owns a part of his company self proclaimed chief twit elon musk slammed an ex new york times media reporter who accused him of allowing failed ftx chairman sam bankman fried to invest in twitter while sbf had invested in the media venture himself semafor editor and former media writer for the new york times ben smith accused musk of involving bankman fried in the deal musk has repeatedly distanced himself and mocked bankman fried since ftx filed for bankruptcy on november 11 the same day that sbf stepped down as ceo billionaire musk repeatedly distanced himself and mocked bankman fried since ftx filed for bankruptcy on november 11 but semafor claimed to have seen leaked texts between musk and bankman fried from may in which the crypto boss says he would love to roll over his 100million stake in twitter musk initially replied sorry who is sending this message he then adds you re welcome to roll bankman fried was among semafor s first investors in the site s initial 25million round of fundraising which is set to last it until early 2024 the twitter ceo also made clear that bankman fried does not own shares in twitter as a private company and neither i nor twitter have taken any investment from sbf ftx smith who also used to be editor in chief at buzzfeed and made the final decision to publish the roundly discredited steele dossier which damaged the site s credibility has yet to respond to musk when reporting for the times he also suggested that the since proven hunter biden laptop story was a trump campaign attempt to sell a story to the press smith has defended at length the website s editorial choice to publish the steele dossier in an op ed for the paper smith wrote news organizations should instead consider this reality our audience inhabits a complex polluted information environment our role is to help them navigate it not to pretend it doesn t exist smith broke away from the newspaper earlier this year and is now spearheading semafor which launched on october 18 other early funders of semafor include david bradley owner of the atlantic magazine and jessica lessin founder of technology website information at launch semafor said that 75 percent of its revenue will come from advertising and 25 percent from event sponsorships despite currently being a free platform the company eventually plans to charge for subscriptions semafor is set to address the issue that the public has with trusting the press by sectioning facts and analysis in their writing the platform hopes to distinguish hard truths from opinion is a easy to read way alongside smith and smith semafor has hired a slew of top us media editors and reporters including reuters gina chua as executive editor and wall street veteran hoffman musk revealed he rejected crypto mogul sam bankman fried s offer to help finance his twitter takeover last spring saying the now disgraced ftx founder set off his bulls t meter to be honest i d never heard of him musk said of the embattled crypto mogul while speaking in a twitter spaces audio chatroom early on saturday according to coindesk but then i got a ton of people telling me he s got you know huge amounts of money that he wants to invest in the twitter deal recalled musk who secured billions in outside financing to support his 44 billion twitter buyout and i talked to him for about half an hour and i know my bulls t meter was redlining it was like this dude is bulls t that was my impression he added bankman fried resigned as the ceo of ftx on friday as the crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy and reports emerged that up to 2 billion in client funds had vanished from the company s books elon musk has revealed he rejected crypto mogul sam bankman fried s offer to help finance his twitter takeover last spring saying the ftx founder set off his bulls t meter musk also shared a crude meme that depicted bankman fried as the star of a pornographic film titled man f s 5 million people at once musk added then i was like man everyone including major investment banks everyone was talking about him like he s walking on water and has a zillion dollars and that not my impression that dude is just there s something wrong and he does not have capital and he will not come through that was my prediction musk added tweeting late into the night musk also shared a crude meme that depicted bankman fried as the star of a pornographic film titled man f s 5 million people at once musk s text messages which were previously revealed in court filings back up his recollection they show that on april 25 when musk first revealed his agreement to buy twitter his personal banker michael grimes shared bankman fried s offer to fund the venture musk appears skeptical in the text messages dismissing bankman fried s plans to use blockchain technology for twitter and questioning whether he had the funds to back up his financing offer meanwhile collapsed crypto exchange ftx said on saturday it had seen unauthorized transactions with analysts saying millions of dollars worth of assets had

cryptoassets were moved out of ftx wallets in suspicious circumstances early this morning but that it could not confirm that the tokens had been stolen ftx u s general counsel ryne miller said in a

london it s the best of times it s the worst of times at least when it comes to mining coal after years of decline demand for the polluting fossil fuel has surged this year as europe scrambles to replace russian gas and coal miners are making money hand over fist advertisement with coal prices hitting record highs companies would normally expand their operations but projects are being left on the table as most western banks stand by climate pledges to restrict lending to the sector according to a dozen mining company executives and investors if you are a business with a bank right now it s easier if you want to build a new mine forget it that has become impossible said gerhard ziems chief financial officer at australian coal miner coronado global resources inc demand for the fossil fuel is so strong some miners say they are selling coking coal used by steelmakers to electricity companies instead the lower value thermal coal used in power plants traded above coking coal for the first time ever in june it s a crazy situation said coronado s ziems likening it to silver trading at a higher price than gold benchmark australian newcastle thermal coal was languishing at about 50 a ton at the start of 2020 before climbing to above 150 ton at the start of 2022 it then surged to a record high above 400 a ton in september as countries desperately sought alternatives to russian gas but with western banks under pressure from shareholders to show action on climate change coal executives say they are having to scout for alternative funding to take advantage of the favorable backdrop via public markets pre sale finance trading houses private equity firms and investment funds closed doors for some it s even just a question of finding a lender for basic financial services advertisement shortly after north american miner bens creek group listed on london s aim in october last year lloyds banking group withdrew its banking services from the company due to a change in policies regarding coal lloyds said in february it would stop financing miners that generate more than 5 percent of their revenue from thermal coal by the end of this year and would no longer provide general purpose banking to new coking coal customers it took the managers of bens creek months and dozens of rejections before they managed to open a bank account at the state bank of india s branch in britain chief executive adam wilson told reuters nobody had these issues five years ago he said lloyds declined to comment on individual client relationships it s a similar story for minergy limited a startup listed in botswana looking to fund its expansion plans we are exploring all the options at this stage but commercial banking is not necessarily available said minergy chief executive morne du plessis the company is now looking to reduce its debt and fund its project to double annual mining capacity to about 3 million tonnes by selling additional shares as well as listing on the london stock exchange next year du plessis said minergy had struggled to secure simple banking services such as overdrafts or loans to purchase vehicles because we are in coal because we are a startup business they wouldn t even consider that he said china exception despite the pressure on western lenders global investments in coal supply are expected to rise by about 10 percent this year to 116 billion with china leading the way the international energy agency said mainly thanks to china coal investment this year is expected to be in line with 2015 the year governments signed the paris climate accord which aims to keep global warming well below 2 degrees celsius compared with pre industrial levels analysts say however that china consumes most of the coal it mines so increased production in the country is unlikely to have much of an impact on the amount of coal traded on the global market or its current high price with funding hard to come by from western banks coal miners outside china have turned more to equity markets this year as of nov 11 they had raised 2 2 billion via public markets up from 1 3 billion in same period of of 2021 and the highest for the period since 2017 refinitiv data showed but analysts said the fund raisings have not been enough to offset the billions of dollars of western bank lending that has disappeared over the last couple of years environmental lobby group reclaim finance says 96 banks now have policies to restrict financial services to the coal sector the biggest western lender to coal miners in 2020 was deutsche bank with 538 million followed by citi on 300 million by 2021 that had dropped to 255 million for deutsche and 218 million for citi according to data compiled by reclaim finance with regard to thermal coal mining any transaction in coal mining requires an enhanced environmental risk review a deutsche spokesperson said adding that the bank was updating its coal policy now companies that depend on coal for more than 50 percent of their revenue must show credible diversification plans to get financing from deutsche firms without such plans will be phased out of the bank s portfolio by 2025 the spokesperson said citi declined to comment a number of banks including anz bank of montreal barclays bnp paribas commonwealth bank santander standard chartered rbc and unicredit financed coal miners in 2020 but did not in 2021 the reclaim finance data showed all talk minergy s du plessis said since coal prices surged there have been more conversations over potential sources of cash from equity investors to debt refinancing proposals to trade finance there is an openness to discuss this because coal is now a buzzword so the conversation is easier has anything materialised no it hasn t he said bens creek listed shares partly because of the lack of appetite from banks to support any expansion of coal mining chief executive wilson said the company is set to double production to about 1 million tonnes next year though wilson does not expect current high prices to boost coal output much globally as the development of new mines and the infrastructure they need such as railways is unlikely given the uncertain long term outlook for coal some investors snapping up shares in coal company fund raisings and listings agree that long term plans are becoming a thing of the past for miners but they say the short term returns are attractive historically coal mining ceos did not want to return cash to shareholders they used it to expand output or buy competitors said jonathan barrett chief investment officer at luminus management which owns shares in u s coal miner arch resources inc but in the last year or two they have realized that the best way for them to create value for shareholders is to return the cash as opposed to expanding because it s a much better and lower risk use of capital he said barrett and his business partner robert felice launched the iris time fund in october backed by wealthy families to focus on unfashionable sectors with attractive cash flows such as coal big dividends and share buyback programmes in the industry mean that in some instances you could make back

on may 19 mexican president felipe calderón will arrive in washington for a two day state visit during which he is likely to urge u s ratification of the inter american convention against the illicit manufacture of and trafficking in firearms commonly known by its spanish acronym cifta the convention is purportedly necessary to stem the flow of firearms legally purchased in the u s and then illegally exported to mexico this convention negotiated under the auspices of the organization of american states oas was signed by president bill clinton in 1997 but neither he nor president george w bush pressed for the senate to consider it last year during a visit to mexico president obama called on the senate to ratify the convention this week s visit by president calderón will increase pressure on the u s to act the u s should resist this pressure the convention poses a series of prudential dangers to rights protected under the first and second amendments it is also likely to impinge on u s sovereignty moreover the convention has achieved little in practice to the extent that it is not dangerous it is irrelevant to security challenges in the western hemisphere the convention mandates the creation of a domestic licensing system the core of the convention is its requirement that signatories prohibit the unlicensed manufacture or assembly of firearms ammunition explosives and other related materials these related materials in turn are defined as any component part or replacement part of a firearm or an accessory which can be attached to a firearm the convention thus mandates the creation of a licensing system in practice at the federal level that would control manufacture or assembly of any part of or accessory for a firearm this language covers a broad range of activities federal law already requires a license to manufacture firearms but it defines a firearm as the receiver of the gun under the convention attaching any accessory to a firearm even a sling for a hunting rifle would require a license as would the manufacture of items such as screws or springs that are sold to firearms manufacturers or private gun owners but have many other uses entirely unrelated to the firearms industry ultimately to comply with the convention s manufacturing and assembly clause almost all gun owners and all manufacturers of components would have to be licensed as manufacturers assemblers or both to support this licensing system the convention calls for a series of restrictions on domestic commerce and international trade the system would have serious implications for privacy and would burden domestic manufacturers it would also vastly expand the power and reach of the federal administrative state and criminalize the recreational pursuits of millions of americans that have no connection to the problem the convention purports to address the convention seeks to restrict speech moreover the convention criminalizes the counseling of any of the activities that it prohibits in other words the convention seeks to restrict freedom of speech and requires signatories to afford each other the widest measure of mutual legal assistance in enforcing these restrictions both conservatives and liberals including the obama administration have opposed other international instruments such as the u n s effort through the durban review conference to prevent the defamation of religion that sought to curb free speech for the sake of other supposedly desirable ends the convention embodies a philosophy on free speech that has been widely rejected in the u s because of the correct perception that it is contrary to american freedoms and the american desire to see those liberties flourish abroad as well as at home the convention is destructive of u s sovereignty the convention s limits on free speech are obnoxious domestically and undesirable internationally because of the aid and comfort they would give to tyrannies regardless of any reservations applied by the senate because the u s could not fulfill the convention s terms in their entirety ratifying it would immediately place the u s in the position of having to defend its declared noncompliance with freely accepted obligations a situation that is never desirable the argument that the u s should ignore these difficulties and ratify the convention simply to fall in line with the rest of the oas is fundamentally objectionable it implies that the u s should disregard concerns about the convention s effect on its liberties and act on matters within its national competence not because it has decided to do so but because other states have already acted it therefore advances the idea that self government in the u s should proceed under the guidance and suggestion of other states and ultimately of the international community this idea is destructive of national sovereignty the convention has a poor record of success the importance of the flow of firearms from the u s to mexico has been exaggerated by the convention s supporters but to the extent this flow exists it is a violation of existing u s law which requires a license for the import or export of arms the ability of criminals to smuggle arms across the border points to the importance not of the convention but of maintaining control of the border mexico s problems are fundamentally homegrown consequently u s ratification of the convention will not substantively improve the situation on the ground in mexico more broadly while u s ratification may demonstrate u s commitment to the convention it does nothing to guarantee that other member states which often have weak enforcement regimes and different political agendas will vigorously enforce its requirements this is illustrated by the convention s failure in colombia when current colombian president alvaro uribe took office in 2002 a range of armed non state actors notably narco terrorists belonging to the revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc and paramilitaries of the united self defense forces of colombia were maintaining field armies totaling more than 50 000 heavily armed combatants yet the oas failed to take a single action to sanction or punish those who provided arms to these illicit organizations the oas does not even consider the farc to be a terrorist organization arms shipments continue today with weapons arriving from military stocks throughout the americas and in particular from venezuela in spite of the fact that both colombia and venezuela have ratified the convention the senate should regard the convention with caution the u s desire to assist mexico in addressing their shared security challenges is laudable but the convention is at best a public relations gesture not a substantive policy neither the visit of president calderón nor any request he makes for u s action on the convention should lead the senate to regard it with anything other than extreme caution the right course is for the u s to continue to make and enforce its own laws on matters relevant to the convention operate its existing programs that seek to combat the illicit traffic in arms and cooperate on these

in his first state of the union address president donald trump focused on themes of economic success job creation and praise for military and law enforcement professionals who strive to keep our communities safe and prosperous he also alluded to criminal justice reforms that can contribute to those same goals of increasing safety and prosperity conservative states like texas kentucky kansas and georgia have already proven that prison reform can help reduce recidivism rates and corrections spending and while trump celebrated job creation rising wages a record smashing stock market and low unemployment he now deserves credit for seizing an opportunity to invest in a safer freer future for all americans he said the following as tax cuts create new jobs let s invest in workforce development and let s invest in job training which we need so badly let s open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential as america regains its strength opportunity must be extended to all citizens that is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance at life that was not however trump s first time considering the issue earlier this month a white house spokesperson told the hill that prison reform was addressed at a recent camp david retreat and in roundtable discussions over the last six months with state and federal officials policy experts grass roots activists and faith leaders in a white house meeting on criminal justice reform earlier this month trump told participants that his administration is committed to helping inmates become productive law abiding members of society through mentoring job training programs and drug addiction treatment the point said trump is to carefully consider opportunities to improve our prison system and promote public safety according to the hill trump noted that wo thirds of the 650 000 people released from prison each year are arrested again within three years as jon d ponder ceo of the non profit group hope for prisoners and a former inmate noted in the heritage foundation s 2017 index of culture and opportunity there are high costs associated with reoffending and reincarceration as the average cost to house an inmate is over 30 000 a year even more serious are the effects of incarceration on individual persons ponder wrote the very habits and behaviors that are nurtured and developed inside of correctional facilities are the exact opposite of what a successful lifestyle in mainstream society should mirror trump said at his january white house gathering we can help break this vicious cycle through job training mentoring and drug addiction treatment we ll be very tough on crime but we will provide a ladder of opportunity for the future outside that meeting kansas gov sam brownback told the daily signal that smart on crime policies like mentoring have helped his state improve public safety we ve matched 7 500 prisoners who came out with a mentor on the outside a lot of people are generally faith based that become involved in these programs they mentor brownback continued but they also engage the person s soul everything is voluntary we ve dropped the recidivism rate in half with mentoring and really engaging the soul last year the justice department s national institute of justice notedthat finding employment is frequently one of the most difficult tasks former offenders undertake survey results suggest that between 60 and 75 percent of ex offenders are jobless up to a year after release individuals who complete a sentence and earnestly seek a law abiding life face an uncertain number of collateral consequences that flow from a criminal conviction as well as occupational licensing requirements that place many job opportunities out of reach therefore it is important that incarceration not be as the u s supreme court described it in barker v wingo 1972 addressing a defendant s sixth amendment right to a speedy trial simply dead time time that often means loss of a job disrupts family life enforces idleness and offers little or no rehabilitative programs heritage scholars have advocated for practical incentives for eligible convicted offenders to work while incarcerated with non government organizations that provide mentoring education job training and other productive activities that are designed to reduce the likelihood that they return to prison now trump and his staff can work with congress to fine tune pending legislation in the house e g the prison reform and redemption act of 2017 and senate e g the sentencing reform and corrections act and the corrections act to do just that the need for criminal justice reform goes beyond prison walls however and into the criminal code itself for example the mens rea reform act of 2017 introduced by sen orrin hatch r utah would enact mens rea reform latin for guilty mind referring to criminal intent in a crime a heritage report on mens rea explains the need for congress to adopt a default criminal intent standard to complete the plethora of statutes and regulations that define a criminal offense but omit the second of two traditionally essential elements of a crime a bad act and a bad intent congress deserves credit for continuing its important work on criminal justice reform as mark holden general counsel of koch industries told the washington examiner the president also deserves credit for recognizing an opportunity to change expectations around prisons which are failing to equip individuals to successfully return to society and succeed together with the trump administration lawmakers can take steps to improve how prisoners re enter society as well as how criminal laws are written if the apparent success in kansas and other conservative states is any guide then the kind of reform trump alluded to in his state of the union address would be a positive step toward increasing public safety and prosperity in communities across the country

these days passive income is all the rage among tfsa investors tech stocks crashed earlier this year while dividend stocks performed relatively well so now everybody is chasing after high yield articles all across the internet are talking about how you can get many hundreds of dollars in passive income every month that s quite possible if you invest 100 000 or more but it isn t going to happen with just a few thousand bucks the problem with excessive passive income goals the problem with excessive passive income goals is that the higher the yield the higher the risk yields are a function of income and stock price the lower the stock price the higher the yield holding dividends constant if the yield is outrageously high then it s quite likely that the stock is riskier than average there s nothing wrong with high yielding dividend stocks in themselves i have a few in my own portfolio however many people on the internet these days are deliberately chasing the very highest yielding stocks they can find hoping to collect life changing amounts of money if you frequent popular stock communities like twitter s fintwit you may have heard of names like brazilian oil giant petrobras 40 yield or shipping service zim 110 yield these stocks do have high yields if the dividends continue to be paid the trouble is that the dividends are risky petrobras is at the mercy of brazil s government zim faces declining shipping fees seeing a 100 yield and instantly buying is the dividend investing equivalent of chasing unprofitable tech stocks in 2021 we saw how that party ended the current high yield obsession might produce similar results petrobras and zim may or may not actually pay out the amount in dividends that financial data platforms claim they have i m no expert on them but i am fairly familiar with a high yield canadian stock that burned quite a few canadian investors this month based on what i know about that stock i would not advise chasing after stratospheric dividend income preferring instead an approach based on dividend safety and growth the algonquin story algonquin power utilities corp tsx aqn nyse aqn is a high yield dividend stock that blew up in many canadians faces this month it has a 10 yield now yet it had a 6 5 yield a few weeks ago why did the yield suddenly increase because algonquin s stock crashed after it put out a disappointing earnings release showing a large net loss aqn stock tumbled in the markets it fell 20 the day after the release came out and it kept on falling in the days afterward the stock was at 15 29 before the release came out it only trades for 10 now what kinds of stocks are best if you want to collect passive dividend income you might want to look at stocks like fortis inc tsx fts nyse fts fortis is a dividend stock with a 4 23 yield that s not the highest yield out there but it s fairly safe the north american gas and electric utility has a 70 payout ratio meaning that it pays 70 of its earnings as dividends that isn t an outrageously high percentage in the exact same quarter when algonquin posted its large loss fortis delivered modestly positive growth so it looks like fortis dividend will continue being paid at its current level the same cannot be said for aqn

for decades kitchenaid has been regarded as the gold standard of stand mixers and understandably so staples in home kitchens and professional bakeries alike the best kitchenaid stand mixers are baking workhorses capable of whipping up delicate cake batters and tacky bread doughs with ease and efficiency after testing five top models i believe the artisan series 5 quart tilt head stand mixer is the very best overall thanks to its sheer power streamlined design and ease of use if you re a newer baker or short on kitchen space the artisan mini 3 5 quart tilt head stand mixer which is more affordable and compact is a similarly impressive machine after rigorously testing five kitchenaid models i found the artisan series 5 quart to be the best stand mixer for most home bakers illustration forbes image kitchenaid here are the best kitchenaid mixers based on a series of culinary tests though kitchenaid isn t the only trusted kitchen appliance brand making quality stand mixers today their

mixers best kitchenaid stand mixer overall an unbeatable model that s up for any task kitchenaid kitchenaid artisan series 5 quart tilt head stand mixer style tilt head attachments beater whisk dough hook pouring shield bowl capacity 5 quarts weight 26 pounds dimensions 8 7 x 14 1 x 13 9 inches power 325 watts best for home bakers who are ready to invest in a premium stand mixer people who make a wide variety of baked goods from bread to cake those who want lots of color options skip if you typically make larger batches of stiff doughs to put it simply the kitchenaid artisan offers everything you could want in a stand mixer featuring a 5 quart capacity it s plenty big for standard baking recipes but compact enough to fit inside most kitchen cabinets it s also easy to use thanks to its intuitive tilt head design the bowl attaches to the machine s body and its head hinges backward and perhaps most importantly this stand mixer truly excels at its job nothing i made in the artisan from whipped cream to pizza dough came out over or undermixed the artisan is kitchenaid s bestselling stand mixer and during testing i could easily see why it s an incredibly versatile professional grade machine that manages to be simultaneously powerful yet smooth when i made whipped cream using the whisk attachment medium stiff peaks formed in under five minutes even when alternating between medium and high speeds none of the heavy cream splattered out the mixer also made easy work of kitchen sink cookie dough thoroughly mixing and distributing all the mix ins shredded coconut oats raisins chocolate chips and walnuts what s more when mixing a batch of pizza dough using the dough hook the artisan didn t shake or bounce on my countertop even on higher speeds after the mixer kneaded the smooth ball of dough for about five minutes the dough was stretchy and springy when i pushed my fingers into its tacky surface the dough sprung back indicating that it was perfectly kneaded for most home bakers the artisan is an unbeatable model thanks to its tilt head design it s easy to stop the mixer to check on your dough or scrape down the sides of the bowl i also appreciated how simple it was to swap out attachments without removing the bowl from the mixer the pouring shield that attaches to the top of the bowl deserves a mention too during testing i was able to add dry ingredients to the running mixer without sending flour and heavy cream flying thanks to this handy accessory and last but certainly not least this mixer comes in 23 gorgeous colors including iconic empire red for more details check out my full kitchenaid artisan series stand mixer review best kitchenaid stand mixer for beginners a compact model that s more powerful than it looks kitchenaid kitchenaid artisan mini 3 5 quart tilt head stand mixer style tilt head attachments silicone edged flex beater dough hook whisk bowl capacity 3 5 quarts weight 18 pounds dimensions 7 8 x 12 3 x 12 3 inches power 250 watts best for those with small kitchens and minimal storage space newer bakers who want to learn the ropes with a professional quality mixer people who like to make smaller half batches of baked goods skip if you like to make large batches of dough at once for newer or occasional bakers who want a premium stand mixer but aren t quite ready to add a larger more expensive model to their baking arsenal the artisan mini is a fantastic option weighing 18 pounds this mixer is the smallest of all the kitchenaid models no bigger than a drip coffee maker as a tilt head mixer it s a cinch to operate and though it may be small compared to other models at least it s an absolute powerhouse during testing it mixed cookie dough pizza dough and cake batter just as expertly as bigger models you can read my in depth review of the artisan mini here before testing i expected that i d need to cut my dough recipes in half to fit in this 3 5 quart mixer i quickly realized that would be unnecessary i was able to make full batches of each and as evidenced by the final products everything was mixed folded whipped and kneaded perfectly that said the mixing bowl was at capacity though nothing spilled over the cookie dough seemed like it might overflow at times the machine also started to bump around as i added in more mix ins and the dough got thicker it bounced similarly with sticky pizza dough in the end though all my recipes came out flawlessly the cake was moist and tender the pizza dough was airy and crisp and the mix ins were dispersed evenly in the kitchen sink cookies what sets this petite mixer apart from its larger siblings is its ability to tackle smaller quantities of ingredients just enough bread dough to make a single loaf for example or a half batch of chocolate chip cookies the larger models i tested struggled to thoroughly mix smaller batches as the attachments couldn t reach far down enough into the bowl the artisan mini had no such issue the artisan mini also comes with an attachment that s especially useful all bakers but especially newer ones a silicone edged flex beater which features a flexible fin that scrapes stray pieces of butter and dough from the sides of the bowl when making cookies cakes muffins and the like it s important to occasionally stop the mixer to manually scrape down the bowl to ensure all ingredients are thoroughly combined but thanks to the flex beater i didn t have to do it so frequently a small but much appreciated perk best kitchenaid stand mixer for large batches a large bowl lift model that s ideal for experienced bakers most popular kitchenaid kitchenaid professional 600 series 6 quart bowl lift stand mixer 350 at kitchenaid style bowl lift attachments beater dough hook wire whisk pouring shield bowl capacity 6 quarts weight 29 pounds dimensions 11 25 x 16 5 x 14 5 inches power 575 watts best for home bakers who like to double or even triple batches those who primarily make bread and denser doughs more advanced bakers who are willing to invest skip if you typically cook single batches you re short on space or have trouble moving large objects whereas the kitchenaid artisan and artisan mini are tilt head models the professional 600 series 6 quart bowl lift stand mixer is a bowl lift model meaning its head is stationary and the bowl attaches to two arms that extend from the mixer s body this style of machine tends to be heavier and more powerful making it best at handling larger stiffer mixtures during testing the professional 600 proved itself more than capable on this front if you re an experienced home baker who frequently takes on ambitious baking projects the professional 600 is your model featuring a 6 quart capacity the 29 pound professional 600 is one of the largest models the brand makes for my whipped cream test i was able to mix five cups of heavy cream and with zero splatter when it came time to make pizza dough i made a double batch and the dough hook had no problem kneading together all the ingredients once the ball of smooth dough came together its sticky surface quickly picked up all the flour that was lingering on the sides and bottom of the bowl and the machine didn t bounce or budge at all even on high speeds i also found that the actual construction of the bowl lift design lended the machine stability thanks to the fixed head a cross section of the kitchen sink cookies i made using the professional 600 stand mixer laura denby the main weakness of this machine because it s so big it sometimes struggles to mix small portions when i tried to beat together egg yolks and sugar for sponge cake the beater skimmed the top of the egg yolks leaving behind a decent amount of sugar at the bottom of the bowl when i made a single batch of pizza dough i had a similar experience flour accumulated at the sides and bottom of the bowl where the mass of pizza dough that enveloped the hook couldn t reach additionally while i found it easy to raise and lower the professional 600 s bowl using the lever on the mixer s body at times i found it difficult to add ingredients and scrape down the sides of the bowl due to the attachments being in the way while newer home bakers certainly could learn the ropes of this stand mixer it s best for more experienced bakers who routinely make multiple loaves of bread at once or who triple cookie recipes not only is this kitchenaid model one of the most expensive but it also requires a significant amount of storage space the professional 600 also isn t ideal for those who struggle to lift heavy things as the unwieldy machine is difficult to move from the pantry to the countertop if you re capable of handling the mixer or plan to leave it out on your countertop though it will more than deliver and for years to come other kitchenaid stand mixers i tested kitchenaid classic series 4 5 quart tilt head stand mixer this is a solid tilt head mixer that tackled all tests with ease however it has a smaller bowl than the artisan 5 quart mixer and it doesn t come with a pouring shield which i found extremely effective at preventing ingredients from splattering out while mixing the classic also comes in only two colors black and white kitchenaid professional 5 plus series 5 quart bowl lift stand mixer this machine isn t all that unlike the artisan they have the same list price and accommodate the same amount of food the main difference is the professional 5 plus is a bowl lift model which means it s bulkier and heavier and therefore harder to store it also doesn t come with a pouring shield while i considered testing the pro line series 7 quart bowl lift stand mixer i felt that it was too similar to the professional 600 series with the main differences being price and capacity i also decided against pitting the commercial series 8 quart bowl lift stand mixer against the others as it s designed for professional kitchens how i tested the best kitchenaid mixers because kitchenaid mixers are often large and bulky not to mention expensive it s a purchase you want to get right the first time around i kept this in mind as i decided which models to test aiming to pick a variety of machines that would appeal to bakers with differing preferences and skill sets after meticulous research and consideration i landed on five top models that vary in functionality capacity wattage and price to test basic functionality i made a basic whipped cream in each kitchenaid stand mixer during which i took note of noise level and splashing laura denby to start i took stock of each machine s size weight and overall aesthetic i then ran each mixer through a series of culinary tests using the three attachments included with every model a flat beater dough hook and wire whisk assessing how efficiently and expertly they tackled four classic recipes first up was whipped cream a relatively simple task i did with the whisk attachment if there was any splashing i took note of it next i made a large batch of kitchen sink cookie dough enough to yield 48 cookies in each machine using the paddle attachment here i wanted to see if the mixers were capable of evenly incorporating a variety of mix ins shredded coconut walnuts raisins oats and chocolate chips after the top of the batter appeared incorporated i then examined the bottom of each bowl to see if any ingredients had pooled after baking the cookies i once again checked to see how consistently the mix ins were dispersed to test how the mixers handled stiff dough i then challenged them to a full batch of pizza dough enough to yield two 14 inch pizzas as each machine equipped with the dough hook kneaded together the ingredients into a sticky ball of dough i also paid close attention to whether the stand mixers bounced around my countertop or became especially noisy when the machines were operating at high speeds my last recipe was decidedly more delicate in each model i made a traditional sponge cake batter which requires gentle folding and can collapse if not mixed properly in this test i used the whisk attachment to mix egg yolks with sugar gradually adding in flour i then beat the egg whites until they formed soft peaks which i eventually folded into the rest of the batter using the paddle attachment throughout each test i noted how easy it was to use every machine more specifically whether it was difficult to alternate between speeds to remove the mixing bowl from the machine s body to change attachments and to add more ingredients it s also worth noting that all kitchenaid stand mixers carry a one year warranty save for those in the pro line which have a five year warranty how to pick a kitchenaid stand mixer when browsing kitchenaid s various stand mixer models here are the factors to keep in mind to help pick the best machine for you capacity kitchenaid stand mixers range in capacity from 3 5 quarts to 7 quarts while the brand does make larger models they re designed for commercial use when deciding which capacity is right for you consider how much you usually bake at once as the size of the mixing bowl will dictate the quantity of food you can make for most home bakers a 5 quart mixer should do the trick if you bake only occasionally and like to make smaller quantities of food think half batches of chocolate chip cookies or a cup of buttercream frosting the artisan mini might be a better choice if you want a professional grade machine that can mix up multiple batches of dough at a time consider opting for a 6 quart machine just remember bigger isn t necessarily better just because they sell a large bowl doesn t mean you need a large bowl says jürgen david director of pastry research and development at the institute of culinary education if for example you try to make a half batch of meringue in a 6 quart mixer the attached whisk likely won t have enough substance to grab onto if the bowl is too large the whisk can t effectively do its job because it can t reach the ingredients it ll just scrape the top explains david tilt head vs bowl lift kitchenaid mixers come in two styles tilt head and bowl lift in tilt head models the mixing bowl locks into the base of the machine and the head of the mixer hinges backward when you need to swap out attachments or add more ingredients you simply stop the machine from running and tilt the head backward in bowl lift mixers the head of the machine is fixed and the mixing bowl is held by two arms that attach to the machine s body to manipulate the dough or scrape down the sides of the bowl an easy to use lever moves the bowl up and down if you need to change attachments you typically need to remove the bowl from the machine in general tilt head models are lighter more streamlined and easier to use bowl lift models comparatively are more powerful machines thanks to their weight and design they also tend to be sturdier which is why they re often recommended for bread bakers the tilt head can jump loose while mixing tacky dough says david chang largely agrees bowl lift mixers are typically bigger and stronger she says that said while she says she prefers that style at work for home use i don t have a preference between the two the artisan series 5 quart tilt head stand mixer and the professional 600 series 6 quart bowl lift stand mixer side by side laura denby size and weight even the smallest kitchenaid stand mixers require a decent amount of counter and storage space so before you hit checkout on a model make sure to assess how much room you re able to dedicate to the mixer if you re short on kitchen space consider the artisan or artisan mini while the artisan mini is the smallest comparable to a coffee maker in size the artisan can also fit under most cabinets mixers like the professional 600 require a significant amount of space for example a cabinet or pantry all to itself it s also important to take weight into account kitchenaid mixers are heavy machines ranging from 18 pounds the artisan mini to 29 pounds the professional 5 plus if you live in an apartment with weak pantry shelving you might not want to place a 29 pound kitchenaid on it it s also not advisable to buy a larger model if you struggle to lift heavy objects and want a model you can easily move between your counter and cabinets attachments all kitchenaid mixers come with three attachments a flat beater a dough hook and a wire whisk beyond that the included attachments vary by model for instance some mixers come with a plastic pouring shield that attaches to the top of the mixing bowl and helps stop ingredients from splashing over the sides while the machine is running and whereas most mixers come with a standard flat beater the artisan mini includes a silicone edged flex beater instead which features a flexible silicone fin to minimize bowl scraping alongside the standard mixing tools kitchenaid sells a diverse array of accessories and attachments that substantially expand the machine s functionality a pasta press a meat grinder and an ice cream maker to name a few because the brand s stand mixers have a universal power hub all attachments are compatible with every model if you re looking to turn your mixer into even more of a kitchen workhorse here are the best kitchenaid attachments price like the best stainless steel cookware and kitchen knife sets kitchenaids don t come cheap but as most home bakers will tell you they re worth the investment made in the u s these iconic appliances are built to last while large capacity bowl lift models can cost upward of 550 the kitchenaid classic a 4 5 quart tilt head model retails for 380 if you re looking to save big consider buying a certified refurbished model sold through kitchenaid s certified refurbished program these gently used models are restored to like new condition and carry much lower price tags my expertise as a full time product reviewer who specializes in kitchen equipment i m always on the hunt for tools and appliances that help home cooks and bakers feel more comfortable and confident in the kitchen over the past five years i ve tested hundreds of cooking tools from nonstick pans to air fryers to paring knives for outlets including food network food wine and taste of home i have a degree in culinary arts from the institute of culinary education and before i started reviewing products i spent years cooking in professional kitchens for this piece i also consulted jürgen david director of pastry research and development at the institute of culinary education and joanne chang owner of boston s flour bakery cafe how long do kitchenaids last on average kitchenaid stand mixers carry a lifespan of 10 to 15 years that said their longevity largely depends on how frequently they re used and how well they re maintained a kitchenaid mixer should last you many years as long as you re not abusing it says david make sure you don t let it run too long clean it after each use let it cool off and dry it properly chang echoes david depending on the mixer and how often you use it you should be able to use it over your lifetime mine is 30 years old are kitchenaid stand mixers really worth it a kitchenaid stand mixer is an incredibly versatile machine capable of tackling all sorts of dough with efficiency you can do anything by hand but it s nice to have the luxury of a machine that does the work for you says david it s faster and more efficient than mixing anything by hand though a stand mixer makes a variety of tasks quicker and easier they re especially beneficial for kneading stiff doughs and aerating lighter ones with a mixer you don t have to use as much muscle power david adds whipping things by hand is tedious and exhausting but for cake batters and light and airy meringues kitchenaid mixers are great for incorporating air should you buy a refurbished kitchenaid stand mixer if you re not ready to invest in a brand new kitchenaid mixer consider perusing the company s robust collection of certified refurbished models through kitchenaid s certified refurbished program the company offers unused or gently used products that are thoroughly inspected and restored to like new condition not only is buying a refurbished model a great way to get a kitchenaid product at a discounted price but it s also a sustainable shopping option

originally published 22 nov 22 06 04 et cnn shortages of key medications used to treat common childhood illnesses like flu ear infections and sore throats are adding to the misery of this year s early and severe respiratory virus season right now we are having severe shortages of medications there s no tamiflu for children there s barely any tamiflu for adults and this is brand name and generic said renae kraft a relief pharmacist in oklahoma city additionally as far as antibiotics go there s not a whole lot kraft often works in rural areas of the state floating between pharmacies when extra help is needed on monday she worked in holdenville where there are two pharmacies pruett s and walmart the same wholesaler stocks both stores so if one pharmacy is out the other usually is too kraft estimates that she had 20 people come in to pruett s to fill prescriptions for tamiflu on monday but she didn t have any so she sent them to walmart which still had some on social media families say they ve hunted for hours for tamiflu and the first line antibiotics amoxicillin and augmentin inhalers of the drug albuterol which is used to open airways in the lungs are also in short supply according to the american society of health system pharmacists which maintains a list of drug shortages anyone can report a shortage for the society s list and pharmacists from the university of utah verify the information with drug manufacturers in my 25 years of being a pediatrician i ve never seen anything like this said pediatric infectious disease specialist dr stacene maroushek of hennepin healthcare in minnesota i have seen families who just aren t getting a break they have one viral illness after another and now there s the secondary effect of ear infections and pneumonia that are prompting amoxicillin shortages respiratory viruses hit hard the cause of these shortages doesn t seem to be a manufacturing problem says michael ganio senior director of pharmacy practice and quality for the american society of health system pharmacists it s just increased demand ahead of schedule and higher than usual he said according to the us centers for disease control and prevention more than half of us states have high or very high respiratory virus activity most of that is due to influenza which hit early and hard this year respiratory syncytial virus or rsv is also playing a role nationwide about 1 out of 5 tests for rsv was positive last week a rate much higher than any point over the past two years there have been about 8 flu hospitalizations for every 100 000 people this season rates typically seen in december or january the cumulative hospitalization rate hasn t been this high at this point in the season in more than a decade prescription fills for the antiviral tamiflu are at a 10 year high for this time of year according to goodrx com a company that helps people find discounts for prescription drugs people in the us are six times more likely to be taking tamiflu at this point in the flu season as during the winter of 2019 20 which the next highest year as for the antibiotics amoxicillin and augmentin a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate an agent that helps guard against antibiotic resistance it s not entirely clear why demand is so high the cdc considers these to be first line therapies for many common childhood ailments like ear and sinus and throat infections some viral illness like influenza can leave the body more vulnerable to secondary bacterial infections that may need treatment with antibiotics but these antibiotics have also been prescribed inappropriately when a child s illness is really caused by a virus antibiotics kill bacteria but they don t do anything to fight viral illnesses anytime respiratory viruses kick up people start prescribing antibiotics even inappropriately and that s created a lot of demand that wasn t anticipated by the manufacturers of amoxicillin so that s led to shortages said dr amesh adalja a senior scholar at the johns hopkins center for health security companies work to resolve shortages pharmaceutical companies that make generic drugs don t usually keep stocks of those medications on shelves instead they manufacture medicines based on orders placed earlier in the year this year s orders didn t anticipate the heavy season for respiratory illnesses some manufacturers said in response they are ramping up production but it will take some time to get more product in stock drug manufacturer teva says it anticipates that some concentrations of amoxicillin that are on back order will be back in stock starting in early december and continuing to the end of february sandoz which also manufactures generic amoxicillin said that shortage had many factors the combination in rapid succession of the pandemic impact and consequent demand swings manufacturing capacity constraints scarcity of raw materials and the current energy crisis means we currently face a uniquely difficult situation the company said in a statement hikma another amoxicillin maker said it has adequate supplies to fill orders and is managing its supply to make sure all orders are filled we understand the importance of this medication and are looking at ways to increase production a spokesperson said in a statement genetech which manufactures tamiflu says it has plenty of that antiviral medication available we have sufficient supply to meet the demand and are continuously evaluating the need to increase production tamiflu is also widely available and there are multiple generic manufacturers of oseltamivir there is sufficient supply of branded tamiflu a company spokesperson said in a statement other companies that manufacture amoxicillin and those that make generic versions of tamiflu reported to be in shortage didn t respond to cnn s request for comment the us food and drug administration has taken steps to help amid the shortage putting out guidance to pharmacists for how to make liquid amoxicillin for children from pill versions amoxicillin pills for adults are not in short supply ganio said advice for parents although news of these shortages may generate some anxiety parents should be aware but not alarmed said brigid groves a pharmacist and the senior director for practice and professional affairs at the american pharmacists association the most important thing families can do for a sick loved one is to get them tested she said most doctor s offices and some pharmacy clinics can do rapid tests to help determine whether your symptoms are coming from a viral illness or a bacterial one we don t want to treat somebody that has covid with an antibiotic because it s not going to be effective groves said and then we also run the risk of creating more resistance in our current bacterial antimicrobial agents out there a recent study by the pew charitable trusts concluded that about 30 of outpatient prescriptions of antibiotics for children were inappropriate either because the medications were given to treat viral illnesses or because the recommended agent wasn t used additionally the study found that antibiotics increase the risk of c diff a bacterial infection that can be life threatening allergic reactions and skin rashes it s important that a family or caregiver has their loved one appropriately evaluated to assure that whatever they

algonquin power tsx aqn stock continued to drop last week even after the chief executive tried to calm the storm it has tumbled more than 35 since november 11 and is currently trading at its seven year low some so called market pandits are recommending the stock to lock in a juicy dividend yield some excitement is warranted as algonquin has been one of the top wealth creators among utilities in the past however this time investors need to see the red flags and act accordingly should you buy aqn stock algonquin reported a 27 drop in profits for the third quarter of 2022 year over year such a decline is rare among utilities with large regulated operations so investors ire was evident and the stock got punished in the subsequent weeks apart from the earnings drop management s sketchy guidance also marred investor sentiment it lowered the earnings guidance to 0 66 to 0 69 per share for 2022 moreover the challenges that weighed on its earnings recently are expected to remain next year as well adamant inflation and rapid rate hikes notably increased algonquin s interest expenses and brought its earnings down a large part of its debt is exposed to variable interest rates as a result as interest rates increase further algonquin will most likely spend higher on debt servicing having an even higher impact on its bottom line more concerningly algonquin is buying kentucky power for 2 6 billion this should balloon its debt further making managing the bottom line more challenging increasing debt and a weakening outlook after the recent fall aqn stock is trading at an industry leading dividend yield of 7 however note that it s because of the stock fall and not because of the dividend increase there is in fact a meaningful risk of a dividend cut given the commentary and the guidance for 2022 algonquin will likely earn 0 68 per share per the guidance midpoint however it will pay a 0 71 per share dividend this year implying a payout ratio of 104 a payout ratio higher than 100 means that it needs to borrow money to pay dividends or dilute shareholders stakes simply the scenario is not feasible in the long term algonquin has consistently engaged in share dilution in the past too at the end of 2019 aqn had 504 7 million outstanding shares however the number swelled to 683 4 million at the end of november 9 2022 in fact the company sold nearly 4 8 million shares between september 30 and november 9 2022 considering the post earnings impact on the stock as the number of outstanding shares increases existing shareholders stakes become less valuable algonquin will likely dilute more as it seems like a cheaper option for now making the stock recovery less probable algonquin was more highly valued among investors a few years back it aggressively invested in renewables projects and showed above average growth in the last decade during 2010 2020 aqn stock returned 22 compounded annually way higher than its peers however as supply chain issues dented the renewables sector and amid interest rate increases the tables soon turned hitting its operational and financial growth bottom line while aqn could continue to trade weak investors will get more clarity on its next guidance early next year high leverage amid rapidly rising rates makes aqn stock a risky bet right now so it seems like investors would be better off with other more stable dividend paying tsx stocks for the long term

by jon forrest little by now you have heard about the ftx exchange bankruptcy but you may be justifiably desensitized desensitized because the frequency of crypto disasters is at least yearly this ftx crypto scandal is a next level scandal reading like an over the top hollywood film a bizarre crypto con story ending badly ftx frontman sam bankman fried was in his twenties when he became a billionaire last year his daily routine is highly dysfunctional and his personality is profoundly impaired this contrasts with most con men who are charming and charismatic instead sam s the opposite he s jittery awkward and unkempt his crew allegedly lived off amphetamines ate poorly and slept in bean bag chairs while living a polyamorous lifestyle with other millennials in the bahamas polyamorous means all these kids slept with each other one might say this lifestyle resembled that of a rapper in gold chains with hot chicks except not ftx meltdown is the story of a flash in the pan unlikely billionaire and his empire s rocket blast to fame was so suspicious but like any good crime mystery s conclusion now all the puzzle pieces fit together and we can see this inglorious image after connecting the dots it s pertinent to identify the folks who backed sam awkward sam was backed by a few of the world s most powerful people and in sam bankman fried these world leaders got their man and manipulated the world s best fall guy they exploited what they wanted out of him money and now they are spitting out this weirdo kid destined for prison and exile but why did he do it sam had purchased naming rights on the nba stadium for the miami heat he had conned others into building a metaverse style fantasy empire worth 16 billion sam was the darling of wall street hedge funds but his reach deep into the deep state is most alarming ftx started up within days of joe biden announcing his presidency in 2019 sam gave 10 million to get biden elected in 2020 and only george soros donated more than sam during the 2022 election cycle gifting 40 million to the democratic party for get out the vote schemes then suddenly his business files for bankruptcy just two days after the midterm elections sam s mother barbara fried is a law professor at stanford barbara fried is also the co founder of a left wing political action committee called mind the gap which itself pumped 140 million into the midterms we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us misusing depositors money to influence elections during any historical period would be front page news warranting investigations but the people they helped win can be expected to at least try to sweep this whole thing under rug sam s government contacts and donations help him to go after business with foreign governments for example one report suggests that ukraine deposited a considerable sum of its foreign aid provided by u s taxpayers into ftx this entire meltdown consisted of funds created from thin air sam s crypto token and crypto exchange had zero intrinsic value the whole thing appears to have been a gigantic ponzi but we ve seen this repeatedly with every crypto disaster in 2014 mt gox meltdown wiped out 800 000 bitcoins before the collapse mt gox treaded water only as long as its gullible customers continued to deposit funds at a rate faster than withdrawals however as with any ponzi scheme as soon as withdrawals exceeded deposits mt gox had to suspend redemptions and declare bankruptcy in 2022 alex mashinsky s celsius followed the same pattern and now dozens of other exchanges are pausing withdrawals why because a run on the exchange is like a run on the bank the bank or exchange sometimes doesn t have the money mt gox celsius luna 3 arrows ftx alameda blockfi genesis and japanese cryptocurrency exchange liquid have halted withdrawals the actors in the flawed bitcoin ecosystem may think their misdeeds will go undetected this is because they get so caught up in an uncontrollable lust for greed power and prestige here s the sad irony many early adopters bought bitcoin to protect their wealth from fractional reserve banking fractional reserve banking systems do not store customer deposits but invest them and carry deposits as their own liabilities holding bitcoin or any other crypto on an exchange is the same thing notwithstanding disclosures to the contrary an exchange that operates like ftx owed cryptos to depositors but had lent them out like a bank does and thus could not withstand concentrated withdrawals ftx fractional reserve banking and stocks all work the same way once a customer has deposited his money paper bitcoin math problem or stock paper certificate into a bank exchange or brokerage account he no longer owns that asset directly he instead has a claim on that asset which is backed by the general pool of assets of the institution holding it that s called credit risk make that severe credit risk in the ftx case by contrast physical gold and silver held in your personal possession or a trusted depository not connected to the financial system are the only assets on the planet that are not someone else s liability

in october 2022 the communist party of china successfully held its 20th national congress in beijing in the report he delivered to the congress cpc central committee general secretary xi jinping declared that the cpc and the chinese people of all ethnic groups are embarking on a new journey to build a modern socialist country in all respects and advance the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation on all fronts as china begins its new journey china latin america economic cooperation is embracing fresh development opportunities since the beginning of the 21st century trade between china and latin america has witnessed rapid growth the total trade in 2019 amounted to 317 6 billion which is 25 times the amount in 2000 although the covid 19 pandemic hit latin america particularly hard causing the regional economy to contract by 6 8 percent in 2020 trade between the two sides continued to grow and reached 320 1 billion in 2020 and 451 4 billion in 2021 currently china is the top trading partner of nine latin american countries including brazil argentina chile and venezuela it is expected that by 2035 the total trade between china and latin america will exceed 700 billion this remarkable growth pattern demonstrates the high complementarity between the chinese and latin american markets in recent years latin american countries have exhibited great enthusiasm to enhance economic cooperation with china so far china has signed free trade agreements with three latin american countries including chile 2005 peru 2009 and costa rica 2010 china also signed an agreement with chile to upgrade their fta in 2017 and it commenced fta upgrading negotiations with peru in 2019 in addition china has also launched fta negotiations with panama 2018 ecuador 2022 and nicaragua 2022 and conducted joint feasibility studies on ftas with colombia and uruguay chinese investments in latin america have also increased steadily over the past two decades the stock of chinese outward foreign direct investment in the region is around 693 7 billion in 2021 compared to 11 5 billion in 2005 in terms of both destination countries and sectors chinese ofdi in latin america is becoming more diverse the top destinations for chinese ofdi now include brazil argentina chile mexico and peru although most of chinese ofdi went into the raw materials sector in the early 2000s since 2015 the manufacturing and service sectors in latin america have been receiving more chinese ofdi chinese companies are playing an increasingly positive role in creating job opportunities in the region the report to the 20th national congress laid out a two step strategic plan for china s future development to basically realize socialist modernization from 2020 through 2035 and to build china into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous strong democratic culturally advanced harmonious and beautiful from 2035 through the middle of this century to achieve these objectives china is fostering a new development paradigm that will boost the dynamism and reliability of the domestic economy while engaging at a higher level with the global economy this new development paradigm will provide ample new opportunities to further advance china latin america economic cooperation in the years to come first the digital economy is a new frontier for china latin america economic cooperation as an integral part of building a modern industrial system developing the digital economic sector is a top priority for china latin american countries are also displaying strong determination to develop their digital economies it is therefore mutually beneficial for china and latin america to coordinate their efforts in building digital infrastructure negotiating digital economy agreements and facilitating digital trade and investment and to promote an inclusive development model for the digital economy second green industry is another growth engine for the bilateral economic cooperation china and latin american countries share the common goal of pursuing green development currently green products still account for a relatively low proportion of bilateral trade but their amount has been growing gradually as more latin american countries begin to prioritize environmental protection the opportunities for bilateral cooperation in green development will naturally open up especially in the areas of trade investment and industrial capacity cooperation finally latin american countries are important partners for internationalization of the renminbi china s pursuit of modernization involves a higher level of the internationalization of the rmb but the process has become more challenging due to obstruction from some developed countries to internationalize the rmb in an orderly way china needs to collaborate with emerging economies which have stronger incentives to diversify their foreign exchange reserves so far the internationalization of the rmb in latin america is still at an early stage but as trade and investment cooperation between the two sides deepen the rmb is expected to be more widely used in latin american countries today s international system is undergoing important structural changes and the international community is facing unprecedented challenges at this historical juncture china and latin american countries need to stand firmly together to promote world peace and common development as long as they take advantage of the growing cooperation opportunities china and latin american countries will be positive forces that can lead humanity to a brighter future the author is an assistant research fellow at the institute of latin american studies chinese academy of social sciences the views don t necessarily represent those of china daily
the illuminati is real this is what many believe the popular american rapper kanye west was trying to tell the world last week when in a random outburst to the paparazzi he called out some unknown forces whom he alleged were controlling many known celebrities however he ranted that they could not control him like they did to the others yet he revealed that his own biological mother had already been sacrificed to these secret powers west declared they can t control me you know what i m saying they can control shaq they can control charles barkley they can control lebron james they can control jay z and beyonce but they can t control me ain t no name i won t name it s up he continued my mama ain t here my mama was sacrificed michael jordan what about him his daddy bill cosby his son dr dre his son you know out in hollywood a lot of people come up missing feels like it might be a lot of that in order to control traumatise they wanna monetise and traumatise the question is should we believe west remember he never mentioned the word illuminati but there seems to be a universal understanding that he was referring to the legendary secret organisation which is largely connected to the conspiracy theory about a new world order a covertly emerging totalitarian world government orchestrated by the global elite the american rapper also known as ye never ceases to amaze some years back he had denied having ties to the illuminati when the symbolism and style in his popular song video runaway and also the song power trended as illuminati codes then he took to his twitter page to address the rumours that he was a member of the secret society and worshipped the devil i ve got question about the illuminati what is it exactly and why do people think pop stars have a membership lol he tweeted is illuminati and devil worshipping like the same thing do they have a social network that celebs can sign up for the other interesting thing is that these alleged illuminati sacrifices seem to be ordinary people dying ordinary deaths some sceptics pointed to the fact that west s mother died while undergoing cosmetic surgery which the artiste paid for in that sense his mother was sacrificed to his own vanity rather than to the infamous illuminati nevertheless my thinking is that even if there is no monolithic secret society that controls hollywood superstars there is certainly a hidden force behind the curtains manifestly manipulating our human evolution on this planet but the evidence is that they actually need us as agents to destroy ourselves with our own hands they use our greed avarice envy hubris guile to telegraph their agenda and see it enforced right here in our homestead they are patently evil because the outcomes of their guidance through the ages have doomed us as a civilisation they not only killed ye s mother they killed earth s mother west cries because of personal agony but i know of worse pains the illuminati has caused the entire human race they made or allowed us to walk like sacrificial lambs into the cauldron of global warming and climate change without any iota of doubt i believe it is the illuminati who made the world abandon green energy and embrace dirty fuel for our transportation system today because of the carbon emitted by fossil fuels over the centuries the chicken has come home to roost what many would not know is the historical fact that the electric car now adopted worldwide in order to fight climate change is not a modern venture it actually started about two centuries ago during the 1890s it became a rave the rich bought it the poor rode the businessmen bought into it for instance it was so hot that in 1906 the electric storage battery company bought the morris and salom electric car startup even before it had made a sale the media was awash with the news the electric vehicle company ordered 12 000 new cars these would include hansom cabs landaus and coupes a giant ev holding company would open branches in every state and territory in the united states there would be a worldwide network of branch evcs the evc planned a paper value of 200m the expansion plans made sense the evc business model worked according to historian david kirsch the company was likely profitable on its own sadly as the world seemed ready to go green the tide suddenly turned president teddy roosevelt elected in 1901 became known as the trust buster e p ingersoll owner of the motor journal horseless age attacked the evc as a trust in his every editorial he battered the electric battery as well the history of storage battery traction is strewn with wrecks and failures he wrote the battery electric would not work until the laws of the universe are superseded he warned against those who would force electrics on a credulous world with ingersoll s constant attacks the evc became known as the lead cab trust according to gijs mom the leading historian of the rise and fall of the electric car in this period mom concludes that ingersoll s technical complaints overshadow his real enemy monopoly ingersoll believed the evc trust would prevent the dawn of a utopian horseless age based on the internal combustion motor in an orchestrated scandal the evc stock plummeted from 30 to 75 cents a share in 1900 horseless age cancelled all evc ads and then named and shamed the floaters of watered stock companies in 1901 the evc began to collapse chicago liquidated in the early spring boston folded two months later so by the time fossil fuel cars like henry ford s model t came into the limelight electric vehicles were seen as feminine ornamental cars and that was how the battle against global warming was lost before it even began a typical passenger vehicle emits about 4 6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year this assumes the average gasoline vehicle on the road today has a fuel economy of about 22 0 miles per gallon and drives around 11 500 miles per year every gallon of gasoline burned creates about 8 887 grams of carbon dioxide in addition to carbon dioxide automobiles produce methane and nitrous oxide from the tailpipe and hydrofluorocarbon emissions from leaking air conditioners cumulatively these gases cause the earth s atmosphere to warm resulting in changes to the climate we are already seeing today it is instructive to note that greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 27 per cent of total us ghg emissions making it the largest contributor of us ghg emissions it is the same globally the global transportation sector is a major polluter and in 2020 produced approximately 7 3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions the share of co2 in the sector can be broken down into passenger cars 41 medium and heavy trucks 22 shipping 11 aviation 8 buses and minibuses 5 two three wheelers 3 and rail 3 surely a candid review of global trend will show that there are unseen forces lurking behind the shadows they are the ones who stopped nikola tesla from experimenting with his wireless electricity dream but there is a conspiracy to keep these forces hidden this is why the little to be gleaned is painted in the brush of conspiracy theory no matter who you are once you begin a journey into the disclosure lane you become one of the mad people living on the fringes of society hence west has courageously posed a challenge and i believe human society is now mature enough to approach this topic without fear or fury

article 3 months old always an independent thinker rudi has not shied away from making big out of consensus predictions that proved accurate later on when rio tinto shares surged above 120 he wrote investors should sell in mid 2008 he warned investors not to hold on to equities in oil producers in august 2008 he predicted the largest sell off in commodities stocks was about to follow in 2009 he suggested australian banks were an excellent buy between 2011 and 2015 rudi consistently maintained investors were better off avoiding exposure to commodities and to commodities stocks post gfc he dedicated his research to finding all weather performers see also all weather performers on this website as well as the special reports section rudi s view nov 24 2022 this story features united malt group limited and other companies for more info share analysis umg in this week s weekly insights preparing for bear phase ii conviction calls research to download aia investor day in sydney by rudi filapek vandyck editor preparing for bear phase ii sometimes the most important market insight is hiding underneath daily share price movements intriguingly the latest update into who s buying and selling us equities by s p global market intelligence is showing an ever widening gap between financial institutions selling and retail investors buying the data available are only up to november 2 but it seems unlikely things have dramatically reversed in the two weeks since it is s p global market intelligence s observation that selling has been happening pretty much across the spectrum suggesting institutions have been decreasing their exposure to equities generally without singling out a specific sector or part of the market this strongly suggests risk off attitude and a generally more defensive positioning away from higher risk assets for good measure october witnessed retail investors net selling during two weeks and net buying during two weeks for a slightly negative net outcome for the month but the attention grabbing observation remains one of decisively reducing exposure by institutions as has now been the case throughout the calendar year to date see graphic overview below it is likely there is not one single reason or strategy behind these numbers but it does add an important twist to the global debate that is dominating on social media and in the financial press these past few weeks have we seen the bottom in global equity markets is the 2022 bear market now behind us it would appear institutions don t think this is the case a similar observation stems from the monthly global fund manager survey by bank of america this month s outcome revealed overall sentiment remains bearish cash levels on average are still above 6 a recession for the us and possibly the global economy in 2023 is now pretty much the consensus view while no less than 92 of respondents is preparing for stagflation below trend economic growth with above trend levels of inflation around one third of respondents major concern is that inflation might stay higher for longer most investors see us headline inflation between 4 5 by year end next year too high for comfort clearly with most anticipating the federal reserve may not pause let alone lower the cash rate until inflation is below 4 the prospect for higher for longer interest rates is clearly on everyone s mind at 6 2 the average cash level sits well above the long term average of 4 9 and only a smidgen below last month s 6 3 which was the highest percentage on record post april of 2001 relative to the past 10 years investors globally are long cash defensives utilities staples healthcare and bonds and underweight equities tech eurozone equities and cyclicals against the background of general caution globally australian equities when adjusted for dividends received are only slightly in the negative since the start of the calendar year assuming a positive trend over the final six weeks it is not inconceivable total investment return might end up in the positive this year that would be truly remarkable in light of all that has happened over the past 10 5 months also with the s p500 and nasdaq indices still down 15 50 and 30 5 from twelve months ago while most commodities and bond markets have had a tough time too it s not difficult to see how the international debate carries a different flavour inside and outside australia though the challenges ahead might not be too dissimilar when it comes to making forecasts for the next twelve months there won t be much disagreement among experts and forecasters about the main trends which are economic growth will be noticeably slower on the back of this year s rising interest rates and higher bond yields inflation should have peaked or will have soon and start trending down central banks are slowing the pace of tightening next step will be a pause next they ll start loosening again to stimulate growth housing markets and consumer spending will be hardest hit from this year s interest rate shock treatment bond yields will drop as the focus shifts to economic recessions and falling inflation as well as the prospect of falling cash rates the us dollar is also peaking and will weaken in line with changing economic and market dynamics forecasts for corporate margins and profits are still too high the trend in revisions needs to be negative for longer while australia might well see economic growth stay in the positive next year i e no recession the underlying dynamics that come with much slower growth may not be that different even in the us the discussion about recession yes no remains undecided despite the bond market siding with the yes sayers for many months now in similar fashion some of the strategists at morgan stanley remain unconvinced still but in house economists recently assured them even if the recession in the us won t show up in official statistics it certainly will feel like one on the ground and in financial markets if we accept the basic premise of lagged impact from tighter financial conditions on housing consumer spending and economic growth then the outlook for equity markets in 2023 is all about the timing of events and as proven on multiple occasions throughout 2022 getting the timing right is very very difficult in a worst case scenario growth falls into the abyss but inflation is not falling fast enough and thus central banks feel they cannot yet change course meaning equities and investors are left hanging high and dry while markets get sucked in as corporate profits fall and share prices follow suit a much rosier scenario sees growth holding up for longer while inflation starts descending and central banks prepare for a pause there will still be volatility around key trend changes including through the bond markets but by the time corporate profits are approaching the cycle low markets can already start looking forward to interest rate cuts and government stimulus somewhere in between lays the actual outcome for the year ahead but we don t know yet what scenario is most likely and equally important exactly when given the impact for risk assets can be polar opposites investors will want more certainty about which way forward looks most likely it s probably a fair assumption this uncertainty is reflected in the aforementioned data from s p global market intelligence and the global survey by bank of america equally noteworthy most of the forward projections i ve read recently by wall street strategists or otherwise only imply minor net gains for equities by the end of 2023 this tells us nothing about the volatility that can occur in between and many a strategist suspects we re in for an extension of 2022 at least in the first half of next year this is when corporate profits might show true weakness and vulnerability while inflation remains too high and central bankers persist with tightening policy in australia strategists at ubs just released their outlook for the calendar year ahead if their assumptions and projections turn out correct the asx200 will print 7250 by late december next year this compares with the index closing at 7139 30 on monday ubs s target for end 2022 is 7000 the key assumptions that underpin next year s outlook are more reasonable valuations on average with a soft landing for the local economy leading corporate profits to decline throughout q1 next year and then stabilise this says ubs should improve sentiment as forecasts can again be upgraded and corporate profits for the asx200 are expected to grow to 4 by year end that growth will not so much depend on sales and revenues but on easing of today s margin pressures costs from energy transport and materials should be lower by then and supply chain bottlenecks generally will be less of a constraint while the return of immigration and a stronger aud will be beneficial too bottom line however is ubs s scenario for next year still implies a tough environment for the opening months it s not by definition different from the forecast published last week by strategists at macquarie who stated the current up trend in equities is not the start of a new bull market it s simply another bear market rally and it is nearing the end of it macquarie has a slightly different timing in mind with the cycle bottoming around mid next year but the strategists add exact timing depends on two key inputs the depth of the economic recession whether the federal reserve is still constrained by high inflation the good news is history shows equities bottom in the middle of economic recession as markets start focusing next on the recovery in past cycles those equities to benefit first coming out of recession include software companies diversified financials and construction materials moving into recession however should see defensive business models outperform and often sharply depending on how severe is the fall in profits caused by the recession these businesses are relegated to market laggards as soon as the recovery announces itself and while nothing can be considered as set in stone at this stage macquarie has a sobering message for those investors hoping central banks will come to the rescue as soon as economies show signs of faltering it may be necessary to see a major increase in volatility and possible a crisis to shock central banks into easing macquarie is also less sanguine about average valuations on the asx if you incorporate earnings cuts that follow economic recessions around the world the average pe ratio might well be as high as 21x not that attractive my own view has been that corporate profits in australia might have a major correction downwards in february during the local reporting season but it s also easy to see how this timeline can shift towards august next year current resilience is not by definition a comforting observation the trend in us profits has been deteriorating for circa two quarters and that trend is equally expected to continue on morgan stanley s freshly updated forecasts global gdp growth is slowing to 2 2 next year from a projected 3 this year and down from 6 2 in 2021 earnings forecasts in australia already are for tepid growth in fy23 fy24 and fy25 and the general trend remains to the downside still enjoying upgrades are cyclical companies that report out of normal season including united malt group umg and nufarm nuf plus aristocrat leisure all as well as the likes of netwealth group nwl and national storage reit nsr many more companies are experiencing cuts to forecasts by analysts including out of season cyclicals such as graincorp gnc incitec pivot ipl and elders eld while analysts have been lowering forecasts for companies including flight centre flt ramsay health care rhc pact group pgh and nine entertainment nec the average price earnings ratio for the asx200 is around 13 5x which looks cheap on historical comparisons but further cuts to forecasts would push up that number as stated earlier macquarie suggests if next year proves bad for profits the real pe in australia could be as high as 21x hiding behind the broad number are average valuations for banks and financials still relatively high valuations for quality industrials and seemingly low pes for resources stocks dividend yields are above historical averages because of the de rating of bond proxies and retailers combined with exceptional liquidity for segments of the resources sector on fnarena s data total ratings by the seven stockbrokers monitored daily consist of nearly 56 buy and equivalent ratings and only 36 5 neutral holds and 7 5 sells historically such strong overweight towards buy ratings has always corresponded with a bear market as the direct correlation between valuations and share prices is brutally disrupted this correlation will have to be normalised probably through a combination of reductions in forecasts which also lower valuations and thus ratings and falling and rising share prices unfortunately this proprietary indicator provides no timing of when exactly this might happen or how precisely investors might consider

the number of americans filing new claims for jobless benefits increased to a three month high last week amid rising layoffs in the technology sector but that likely does not suggest a material shift in labor market conditions which remain tight economists urged against reading too much into the rise in weekly unemployment benefit claims reported by the labor department on wednesday noting the data tend to be volatile at the start of the holiday season as companies temporarily close or slow hiring claims remain in line with pre pandemic levels it s certainly possible that layoffs are helping to boost increases in claims filings said isfar munir an economist at citigroup in new york while this could be interpreted as evidence of a softening labor market we would caution against this the holiday season introduces a great deal of volatility into this data it may be hard to disentangle the impact of seasonal patterns versus layoffs until january initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 17 000 to a seasonally adjusted 240 000 for the week ended nov 19 the highest level since mid august economists polled by reuters had forecast 225 000 claims for the latest week moody s analytics estimates the break even level for claims at around 270 000 the jobs market has remained resilient in the face of the federal reserve s most aggressive interest rate hiking cycle since the 1980s aimed at curbing high inflation by dampening demand in the economy economists say massive swings because of the covid 19 pandemic had distorted the seasonal adjustment factors the model that the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data according to brean capital senior economic advisor conrad dequadros seasonally adjusting the raw claims data with the average of the adjustment factors for 2005 and 2011 years that the calendar aligned within 2022 would have resulted in claims rising only 3 000 last week nonetheless the claims data should be closely watched in the coming weeks to see if this rise in claims is anything other than noise or poor seasonal adjustment dequadros said there has been an increase in layoffs in the technology sector with twitter amazon amzn o and meta meta o the parent of facebook announcing thousands of job cuts this month companies in interest rate sensitive sectors like housing and finance have also been sending workers home unadjusted claims shot up 47 909 to 248 185 last week they were boosted by a 5 024 jump in california likely reflecting the technology sector job cuts there were also big increases in filings in georgia illinois minnesota iowa new york ohio and michigan economists however did not expect the technology sector layoffs would be a major drag on the labor market and the overall economy they noted businesses outside the technology and housing sectors were hoarding workers after difficulties finding labor in the aftermath of the covid 19 pandemic this was acknowledged by some fed officials in minutes of the us central bank s nov 1 2 policy meeting published on wednesday the minutes showed these participants noted that this consideration had limited layoffs even as the broader economy had softened or that this behavior could limit layoffs if aggregate economic activity were to soften further with 1 9 job openings for every unemployed person in september some of the workers being laid off could find new employment quickly stocks on wall street were trading higher the dollar fell against a basket of currencies us treasury prices rose not in recession the claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 48 000 to 1 551 million in the week ending nov 12 the so called continuing claims a proxy for hiring covered the period during which the government surveyed households for november s unemployment rate continuing claims increased between the october and november survey periods economists however forecast the unemployment rate unchanged at 3 7 there were also signs of resilience in business spending on equipment one of the two pillars of support for the economy a separate report from the commerce department showed orders for non defense capital goods excluding aircraft a closely watched proxy for business spending plans rose 0 7 in october these so called core capital goods orders decreased 0 8 in september shipments of core capital goods jumped 1 3 after dipping 0 1 in september the report added to strong retail sales last month in suggesting that the economy continued to expand though risks of a recession next year are mounting as the fed s rate hikes are seen stifling demand a survey from s p global on wednesday showed its flash us composite pmi output index which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors contracting further in november with a measure of new orders dropping to its lowest level in 2 1 2 years sp global pmi the recession is not here today but we continue to believe that economic conditions will deteriorate in 2023 said oren klachkin lead us economist at oxford economics in new york the recession will be a garden variety downturn because there are no glaring household or corporate sector imbalances there was some rare goods news on the housing market which has been pummeled by soaring mortgage rates a fourth report from the commerce department showed new home sales which account for 12 5 of us home sales rebounded 7 5 to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 632 000 units in october the national association of home builders last week reported a sharp increase in builders offering incentives including price cuts to sell homes new home sales although demand has fallen when compared to a year ago many buyers are waiting in the wings for either a downward price adjustment or for mortgage rates to fall said orphe divounguy senior economist at zillow in seattle source reuters

new zealand expected to ship more live cattle this year compared to 2021 the number of live cattle exported by sea from new zealand is expected to surpass the total shipped last year despite exports being phased out rnz news reported a total of 134 722 cattle were exported last year this year 95 353 have headed to china so far new zealand s ministry for primary industries has granted animal welfare export certificates to five additional shipments allowing them to export a total of 40 440 cattle before the year is out if everything goes according to plan this year s exports of animals will total 135 793 which is a small increase over last year s total to increase the size of its own dairy herd china imports live cattle from nations such as new zealand however the government declared last year that after a review it would outlaw the practise starting in april 2023 mark willis chair of the animal genetic trade association said demand from china persisted despite new zealand s ban on live exports willis said the demand for live dairy cattle is going to continue as china like many developing countries around the world has an expanding middle class which has increased demand for first world food products willis said that because there are capacity issues when exporting stock such as a lack of quarantine space exports were not ramping up in advance of the ban willis also said there are some exporters who intend to keep selling their goods until the ban is put into effect on april 30 adding that export activity will continue in the first quarter of 2023 he predicted that china would look to move its business elsewhere once the ban is in place he said they are searching for alternative markets the price of cattle is rising in countries like australia and there is a growing connection between chinese buyers and south america where they are looking to purchase more cattle those nations will profit economically from new zealand s decision to outlaw the practise and in some cases they may not be eager to uphold the government s proposal for the gold standard in animal welfare as put forth by new zealand s industry willis said that even though exports are still taking place for the time being workers in the sector are already looking for new jobs for when the ban is implemented rnz news

than 550km is a blessing esp when on ghats and offroad tracks blessing for someone as finicky as i am on where i tank up close to 50 of all my refills across 52k km have been in just 3 fuel stations

build no rattles after 52k km of abuse i do carry a foam tape in my boot though to take care of the minor adjustments required every now and then even with the aftermarket suspension the vehicle is never sorted you will feel the continuous vertical horizontal movements make no mistake while these movements definitely reduced by 75 compared to the stock suspension with the avos you cannot change the vehicle s inherent design swb high gc ladder frame build this does not bother me or the family anymore though while i am used to this the steering feel is not remotely the best the driver will feel each minute variations of the surface under the wheels as feedback the steering is pretty vague at speeds which is not a bad thing considering how easy it will be to topple this vehicle had it gotten the nervousness of say the harrier newer thars feel better in the area maybe my 52k run tyres are cause too will know after the impending change w i d e turning radius makes it a chore to plan tight u turns or driving in narrow lanes this might sound rhetoric but anyone who s used to a monocoque kind of a ride will be put off by the ride comfort of the thar while the ride is superior to any of the previous jeeps that mahindra s made you will still have to give it time use it as your exclusive ride for a few thousand clicks it definitely is an acquired tast this jeep is may eventually have to invest in at least the transparent window parts of the ct they get scratched easy and as an offroader this vehicle does not need sherlock holmes to find how they are getting scratched batman interiors and features perfectly functional cockpit with most controls falling in your hands like expected interiors are sufficient for the purpose the vehicle is built for have not aged at all in 2 5 years of regular use esp coz mine is a ct and keeps getting aligned with our dusty environment seats and interior space is comfortable enough as a 2 seater or a 2 adult and 2 kid tourer the mid overrules you you ll have to wait for it s message indication to timeout before you can navigate to where you want this is a minor irritant say when refueling and you want to reset the trip meter and afe but will have to wait for the mid to complete it s messaging spree wheel direction gear etc before i can reset and continue my journey forcing me to move out of the filling station park and carry out what i want the better approach will be to have human input take precedence android auto disconnects randomly have had a tar raised with my dealership s team and they tried different software updates changed the usb port etc in consultation with m m s tech team but no resolution till date and i have tried like a dozen phones of different generation oe and aftermarket cables and lost sleep over it quite a lot this is a major irritant if you are navigating unknown territory and aa disconnects exactly when you are approaching crossroads and you do not know where to turn while newer thars show the def level m m has not given this as an update to the earlier loyalists esp when we tested the vehicles in real life and provided feedback that resulted in 14 service actions comfort and safety comfortable 2 adults 2 kids tourer safety tested too seat height adjustment long travel fore and aft adjustment and tilt adjustment makes is easy to find a comfortable seating position i am 5 10 have driven cbe to hyd in 12 hours 950 km without fatigue or requiring rests after reaching the destination luggage space is adequate for 2 check in sized luggage and some knick knacks the ct needs you to invest in flap reduction planning to make it livable till 70 80 kmph all hell breaks beyond that anyway the front seats are a size smaller in terms of the base s length and width could do with better under thigh support no security alarm say if a thief decides to unzip the rear window and opens the front door to figure out how to beat the immobilizer to steal the vehicle he can do so in absolute peace the first line of defense is absent even if you can t step out you can still drive through service support brilliant support service from m m i have worked with mr senthil mr vinay mr sihabudden mr ronald and mr prasanna at various times and they have always been helpful and supportive i ll swear by cai mahindra s service team any day mr dileep and team have been maintaining my vehicle from day 1 and the team takes pride in ensuring that the work is done right i also experience extensive repairs with automotive mahindra in hyderabad mr lakshman and team there did a great job

but anyone who s used to a monocoque kind of a ride will be put off by the ride comfort of the thar while the ride is superior to any of the previous jeeps that mahindra s made you will still have to give it time use it as your exclusive ride for a few thousand clicks it definitely is an acquired tast this jeep is may eventually have to invest in at least the transparent window parts of the ct they get scratched easy and as an offroader this vehicle does not need sherlock holmes to find how they are getting scratchedperfectly functional cockpit with most controls falling in your hands like expectedinteriors are sufficient for the purpose the vehicle is built for have not aged at all in 2 5 years of regular use esp coz mine is a ct and keeps getting aligned with our dusty environmentseats and interior space is comfortable enough as a 2 seater or a 2 adult and 2 kid tourerthe mid overrules you you ll have to wait for it s message indication to timeout before you can navigate to where you want this is a minor irritant say when refueling and you want to reset the trip meter and afe but will have to wait for the mid to complete it s messaging spree wheel direction gear etc before i can reset and continue my journey forcing me to move out of the filling station park and carry out what i want the better approach will be to have human input take precedence android auto disconnects randomly have had a tar raised with my dealership s team and they tried different software updates changed the usb port etc in consultation with m m s tech team but no resolution till date and i have tried like a dozen phones of different generation oe and aftermarket cables and lost sleep over it quite a lot this is a major irritant if you are navigating unknown territory and aa disconnects exactly when you are approaching crossroads and you do not know where to turn while newer thars show the def level m m has not given this as an update to the earlier loyalists esp when we tested the vehicles in real life and provided feedback that resulted in 14 service actionscomfortable 2 adults 2 kids tourer safety tested tooseat height adjustment long travel fore and aft adjustment and tilt adjustment makes is easy to find a comfortable seating position i am 5 10 have driven cbe to hyd in 12 hours 950 km without fatigue or requiring rests after reaching the destinationluggage space is adequate for 2 check in sized luggage and some knick knacksthe ct needs you to invest in flap reduction planning to make it livable till 70 80 kmph all hell breaks beyond that anywaythe front seats are a size smaller in terms of the base s length and width could do with better under thigh supportno security alarm say if a thief decides to unzip the rear window and opens the front door to figure out how to beat the immobilizer to steal the vehicle he can do so in absolute peace the first line of defense is absent brilliant support service from m m i have worked with mr senthil mr vinay mr sihabudden mr ronald and mr prasanna at various times and they have always been helpful and supportive i ll swear by cai mahindra s service team any day mr dileep and team have been maintaining my vehicle from day 1 and the team takes pride in ensuring that the work is done right i also experience extensive repairs with automotive mahindra in hyderabad mr lakshman and team there did a great job in attending to the repairsthanks i will seriously be picking up a more comfortable luxury vehicle not that am bored of the jeep will remain my solo ride but the kids are growing up and will soon needs something better suited for long drives i am of a mixed view maybe am plain lucky but between my highway drives i have had months of pure city traffic for 1 000s of km but never had an issue even then not even an indication and i never tried to please to the dpf consciously ever the p at is a monster on its own right that pick up is addictive and make the d at seem inferior if driven back

a substantial majority of policymakers at the federal reserve s meeting early this month agreed it would likely soon be appropriate to slow the pace of interest rate hikes as debate broadened over the implications of the us central bank s rapid tightening of monetary policy according to the minutes from the session the readout of the nov 1 2 meeting at which the fed raised its policy rate by three quarters of a percentage point for the fourth straight time showed officials were largely satisfied they could move rates in smaller more deliberate steps as the economy adjusted to more expensive credit and concerns about overshooting seemed to increase a slower pace would better allow the federal open market committee to assess progress toward its goals of maximum employment and price stability said the minutes which were released on wednesday the uncertain lags and magnitudes associated with the effects of monetary policy actions on economic activity and inflation were among the reasons cited more important than the size of coming rate increases the minutes noted was an emerging focus on just how high rates will need to rise to lower inflation and the need to calibrate that carefully in coming months with monetary policy approaching a sufficiently restrictive stance participants emphasized that the level to which the committee ultimately raised the target range and the evolution of the policy stance thereafter had become more important considerations than the pace the minutes stated that ultimate landing spot for the policy will hinge heavily on the path of inflation in coming months and whether recent lower than expected readings become an established trend down fed staff economists raised their inflation projections for coming quarters and noted also that a recession in the next year was almost as likely as the baseline outlook for sluggish economic growth still the implication that policymakers were stepping down from their break neck pace of rate hikes lifted us stock prices and sent treasury yields lower the benchmark s p 500 index added to its gains earlier in the day and was last up about 0 6 near its highest level in two months the yield on the 2 year treasury note the maturity most sensitive to fed rate expectations dropped to 4 49 longer dated bond yields also fell the dollar which has soared this year on the back of a pace of fed tightening that other major central banks have been unable to match slid against a basket of us trading partner currencies contracts tied to the fed s policy rate showed investors maintaining bets for a half percentage point increase at the dec 13 14 policy meeting merely the fact that they re going to be slowing the pace confirms what the majority of people have been hoping to see said michael james managing director of equity trading at wedbush securities emerging debate the minutes also showed an emerging debate within the fed over the risks that rapid policy tightening could pose to economic growth and financial stability even as policymakers acknowledged there had been little demonstrable progress on inflation and that rates still needed to rise while a few participants said slower rate hikes could reduce risks to the financial system a few other participants noted that any slowing of the fed s policy tightening pace should await more concrete signs that inflation pressures were receding significantly by the fed s preferred measure inflation continues to run at more than three times the central bank s 2 target while recent data suggest inflation has now peaked a slowdown in price pressures will be gradual the path forward for monetary policy is a battle between the various and the several said brian jacobsen senior investment strategist with allspring global investments in menomonee falls wisconsin it was only various officials that thought they should revise higher their terminal rate projections while several thought plowing ahead raised the risks of financial instability in its nov 2 policy statement the fed hinted at emerging concerns about the risks of policy tightening saying the pace of future increases would take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation and economic and financial developments many participants commented that there was significant uncertainty about the ultimate level of the federal funds rate needed to achieve the committee s goals the minutes said language suggesting fed officials were shifting focus from the size of individual rate hikes to trying to calibrate a stopping point at the meeting in december in addition to a policy statement the central bank will also release new policymaker projections for the path of interest rates inflation and unemployment

recently the economic data with high cpi released by europe and america in august has attracted the marketâ s attention in particular cpi in the euro zone has increased by 9 1 percent year on year a record high since 1991 though the u s â cpi started to fall after reaching the highest point of 9 1 percent in june it still stood at a high level of 8 3 percent in august the data have greatly defied peopleâ s expectation that high inflation would disappear in the short term and more people started to realize that prices are likely to rise reasons are obvious europe is facing a massive energy crisis due to its gas and oil crunch electricity prices in european countries have skyrocketed with a 10 fold year on year increase in some countries as winter approaches residentsâ demands for heating will push up the price of energy thus contributing to higher prices in europe the u s has sufficient energy though the high energy price also led to higher commodity prices more importantly the american covid 19 policies have resulted in labor shortages and rising wages causing a vicious circle in which high wages and high inflation compound each other facing the worst inflation since the 1980s europe and the u s are tightening monetary policies since march of this year the u s has increased the interest rate four times and by 300 percentage points the fastest increase in four decades the european central bank has also announced the biggest interest rate rise in two decades therefore the tremendous social pressure brought by high inflation is almost a dead end for europe and the u s the only way out is to control the rising inflation by increasing interest rates however most economies including those in europe and the u s have yet to fully recover from the covid 19 pandemic and increasing interest rates will steer their economic growth into negative territory the u s economy has registered negative increase for the period of two consecutive quarters meanwhile the short term interest rate of government bonds has shot up reflecting the marketâ s pessimistic attitudes towards the u s economic outlook though euro zoneâ s economy has grown in the first half of the year it faces a dark future and even has a good chance of falling into recession this year due to the huge shock wave of an energy shortage affecting industrial production fundamentally the main reason for the current high inflation is the super easy monetary policy previously adopted by western developed countries given the u s dollar euro and other international currenciesâ role many developing countries are facing even worse situations than western countries in particular since the start of the aggressive interest rate rise by the fed non u s dollar currencies have depreciated significantly the exchange rate of developed economiesâ currencies like the pound euro and yen against the u s dollar have dropped worse still currencies of emerging economies like pakistan egypt ghana and turkey have even been undersold some central banks in developing countries have to follow suit and increase interest rates to avoid greater depreciation the huge inflation in western countries has severely shocked the global economy of the main economies chinaâ s cpi has been kept within a normal range since 2022 its highest cpi stands at 2 58 percent a trivial change compared with previous years firstly this is because china has a relatively complete industrial system and can better absorb the rise in prices of raw materials like energy which allows the central bank to adopt more flexible monetary policies to support economic growth for example since the start of this year china has cut one year loan prime rate lpr and lpr longer than five years twice and three times respectively with the former down by 15 percentage points and the latter down by 35 percentage points such a move has lowered businessesâ financing costs and reduced residentsâ pressure of housing loans and consumption loans boosting the real economy according to the august data by the national bureau of statistics indicators including output of industrial companies with annual revenue of more than rmb 20 million total retail sales of consumer goods fixed asset investment and fiscal revenue have all risen compared with previous months the rising inflation across the world underlined chinaâ s economic resilience however we must attach great attention to the rising inflation in western countries a review of history tells us that every important inflation in the worldâ s major countries would wreak havoc on the global economy for example after the first world war the hyperinflation caused by the super easy monetary policy taken by countries like germany and the chaotic monetary policies in some western countries played a part in helping the right wing forces in germany take office and served as one of the crucial triggers behind the great depression as a result it is likely that high inflation and the monetary policies in major western countries can harm the global economy in this regard while stepping up domestic high tech advancement and safeguarding supply chains china should also strengthen economic cooperation with other countries in addition china should also enhance communication and coordination in macroeconomic policies with other countries to jointly promote economic globalization thus providing a favorable environment for the country to register long term and stable economic growth the author is the executive deputy editor in chief of
