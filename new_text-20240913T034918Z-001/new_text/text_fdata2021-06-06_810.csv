don thompson associated press sacramento calif a federal judge friday overturned california s three decade old ban on assault weapons ruling that it violates the constitutional right to bear arms u s district judge roger benitez of san diego ruled that the state s definition of illegal military style rifles unlawfully deprives law abiding californians of weapons commonly allowed in most other states and by the u s supreme court under no level of heightened scrutiny can the law survive benitez said he issued a permanent injunction against enforcement of the law but stayed it for 30 days to give state attorney general rob bonta time to appeal gov gavin newsom condemned the decision calling it a direct threat to public safety and the lives of innocent californians period in his 94 page ruling the judge spoke favorably of modern weapons said they were overwhelmingly used for legal reasons like the swiss army knife the popular ar 15 rifle is a perfect combination of home defense weapon and homeland defense equipment good for both home and battle the judge said in his ruling s introduction looking at david chipman biden s nominee to lead atf supports ban on ar 15 rifle that comparison completely undermines the credibility of this decision and is a slap in the face to the families who ve lost loved ones to this weapon newsom said in a statement we re not backing down from this fight and we ll continue pushing for common sense gun laws that will save lives eric segall law professor at georgia state university college of law called the language used in the ruling dogmatic and said it had little nuance he said he was shocked from the very first sentence at the comparison made between an ar 15 and swiss army knife it reads like a very smart student was trying to impress the federalist society he said it s just not very judicial segall said an increasing number of courts are developing a terrible habit of writing what he sees as unprofessional opinions justices are starting to build this bad habit of writing like they re 100 right and the dissent is 100 wrong and there s no in between or middle ground he said if you re going to have 90 pages you should have some nuance instead segall said opinions should take all arguments seriously recognize that there are two sides to most litigated questions and approaches the issues with respect bonta called the ruling flawed and said it will be appealed california first restricted assault weapons in 1989 with multiple updates to the law since then assault weapons as defined by the law are more dangerous than other firearms and are disproportionately used in crimes mass shootings and against law enforcement with more resulting casualties the state attorney general s office argued and barring them furthers the state s important public safety interests no words to describe the heartache 9th victim dies in deadly shooting rampage at san jose california rail yard further a surge in sales of more than 1 16 million other types of pistols rifles and shotguns in the last year more than a third of them to likely first time buyers show that the assault weapons ban has not prevented law abiding citizens in the state from acquiring a range of firearms for lawful purposes including self defense the state contended in a court filing in march off target series after repeated atf warnings gun dealers can count on the agency to back off more gun in odessa shooting shows risk when illegal sale chain starts with hobbyist dealers similar assault weapon restrictions have previously been upheld by six other federal district and appeals courts the state argued overturning the ban would allow not only assault rifles but things like assault shotguns and assault pistols state officials said but benitez disagreed this case is not about extraordinary weapons lying at the outer limits of second amendment protection the banned assault weapons are not bazookas howitzers or machine guns those arms are dangerous and solely useful for military purposes his ruling said our view mass shootings turn america s gun culture into a killing culture despite california s ban there currently are an estimated 185 569 assault weapons registered with the state the judge said this is an average case about average guns used in average ways for average purposes the ruling said one is to be forgiven if one is persuaded by news media and others that the nation is awash with murderous ar 15 assault rifles the facts however do not support this hyperbole and facts matter in california murder by knife occurs seven times more often than murder by rifle he added fact check ar 15 style rifles used in 11 mass shootings since 2012 in a preliminary ruling in september benitez said california s complicated legal definition of assault weapons can ensnare otherwise law abiding gun owners with criminal penalties that among other things can strip them of their second amendment right to own firearms the burden on the core second amendment right if any is minimal the state argued because the weapons can still be used just not with the modifications that turn them into assault weapons modifications like a shorter barrel or collapsible stock make them more concealable state officials said while things like a pistol grip or thumbhole grip make them more lethal by improving their accuracy as they are fired rapidly enough biden urges congress to pass gun control bills after lowering flag for latest shooting more biden looks to stem ghost guns unveils other steps to curb gun violence epidemic the lawsuit filed by the san diego county gun owners political action committee california gun rights foundation second amendment foundation and firearms policy coalition is among several by gun advocacy groups challenging california s firearms laws which are among the strictest in the nation the lawsuit filed in august 2019 followed a series of deadly mass shootings nationwide involving military style rifles it was filed on behalf of gun owners who want to use high capacity magazines in their legal rifles or pistols but said they can t because doing so would turn them into illegal assault weapons under california law unlike military weapons the semi automatic rifles fire one bullet each time the trigger is pulled and the plaintiffs say they are legal in 41 states the lawsuit said california is one of only a small handful states to ban many of the most popular semiautomatic firearms in the nation because they possess one or more common characteristics such as pistol grips and threaded barrels frequently but not exclusively along with detachable ammunition magazines the state is appealing benitez s 2017 ruling against the state s nearly two decade old ban on the sales and purchases of magazines holding more than 10 bullets that decision triggered a weeklong buying spree before the judge halted sales during the appeal it was upheld in august by a three judge appellate panel but the 9th u s circuit court of appeals said in march that an 11 member panel will rehear the case the state also is appealing benitez s decision in april 2020 blocking a 2019 california law requiring background checks for anyone buying ammunition both of those measures were championed by newsom when he was lieutenant governor and they were backed by voters in a 2016 ballot measure contributing christine fernando usa today
commentary on may 21 2021 shenzhen public security bureau made a case report on three p2p peer to peer lending platforms ideal treasure rjs investment and xitou com accusing them of fraud xitou com attracted special attention among the three platforms because its owner huang sheng is known for his pro chinese communist party ccp and anti american views netizens summarized the strategy he took to raise investments as defaming america to attract fans it is alleged that he has defrauded more than 5 000 people of more than 93 million defaming america to earn fans huang registered a number of social media accounts on platforms such as wechat and weibo to spread his anti america views his wechat account fenghuangshan had been posting articles daily sometimes twice a day until his p2p fraud was exposed by local authorities on may 21 a characteristic of huang s anti american articles was the use of clickbait terms such as stock market doomsday bloodshed and the downfall of the world judging from these headlines alone the united states market has supposedly collapsed 13 times in 17 days he attracts viewers to make anti american remarks huang s articles were highly touted by the regime s mouthpiece in 2020 when the world held the regime accountable for the virus coverup huang published an article in march headlined rightfully the world owes china a thank you it was regarded as a precious asset by state run media outlets such as xinhua news agency which extensively trumpeted and forwarded the propaganda commonly known as the novel coronavirus has caused a global catastrophe those who are rational should probe into the cause of the worldwide spread of the virus which originated from wuhan given that the ccp virus has caused a global catastrophe those who are rational should probe into the cause of the worldwide spread of the virus which originated from wuhan two chinese women walk past a painting of a red guard from china s cultural revolution period at an art exhibit in shanghai on april 17 2008 mark ralston afp getty images huang s easy target regime believers objectively speaking huang s fraud comes easily his conduct of illegally taking public deposits targeted a select group the so called patriots who feel affection for the regime why are they targeted because they are easily deceived provided that they believe in the lies of the ccp they can be easily fooled by huang s fallacies it is a matter of being rational conversely those who can see the evil nature of the ccp in particular those who denounce the ccp will not fall for the trap if people are not rational they have to suffer the consequences meaning they are duped huang claimed that before founding xitou com in 2014 he was the first person to monetize fans what does that mean it means huang attracted fans with articles such as the world owes china a thank you or the collapse of america and persuaded them to invest on xitou com which is equivalent to turning fans into cash this is how his monetization of fans works huang s gimmick relied on a loophole that those fans believed the ccp could surpass america in fact it is the ccp that impedes the chinese economy from overtaking that of the united states the development of the chinese economy lies in the fruit of chinese people s hard work endeavor and wisdom as long as the aforesaid nature of the chinese remains unchanged the chinese economy will continue to advance nevertheless the ccp s system renders the chinese hopeless and stops them from striving hard in life this indeed jeopardizes the chinese economy the most and is a grief for the chinese recently there has been a rising phenomenon of lying flat in china which indicates that people do not want to work hard the number of people who adopt the lying down movement has not been vast enough to pose a threat to the chinese economy for now but there is a possibility of harmfulness whether the united states collapses or not is an issue for americans for the chinese only when the ccp collapses will the chinese usher in brand new opportunities and hopes with the effort the chinese put in the chinese economy will prosper in due course zhao pei is a chinese news commentator from canada he also frequently shares his inside stories of china in his program micro news views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the epoch times
having just completed a full season of indoor performances something few other companies did during the coronavirus pandemic leaders of sarasota opera are looking forward to a return to something that better resembles normal next year the company produced four small scale limited cast fully staged one act operas most of them rarely seen works between february and april for its 62nd season audiences were limited to about 250 people in the 1 100 seat theater but the company video recorded the productions and offered them for home streaming to stay connected with audiences who were not ready to attend in person ticket newsletter sign up to receive the latest news on things to do restaurants and more every friday a new season of music sarasota orchestra plans return to normal for 2021 22 streaming is a euphemism for film said artistic director victor derenzi we can call it whatever we want but for me there s nothing in the world that compares with live performance still those streaming shows allowed the company to keep a connection with our patrons and our community and provided performances to them in ways that were comfortable said richard russell the company s executive director who recently signed a five year contract extension that will change his job title to general director it was not the season we planned with an audience and a full staff russell said but we re pleased with how it went and in a way i m glad we went through what was a herculean effort the season that was planned has been pushed back a year and will now make up the 2022 winter lineup it opens feb 12 with puccini s tosca followed by donizetti s the daughter of the regiment bizet s the pearl fishers and verdi s attila only the fall season will differ from what was originally announced in february 2020 to save costs and test how quickly audiences will return in large numbers the company will delay its planned revival of don giovanni and fill the fall season with giaochino rossini s the silk ladder which will run oct 29 nov 13 rossini wrote two of the four productions that were staged earlier this year the happy deception and il signor bruschino russell said he is optimistic with the new cdc guidelines that we can open to 100 percent capacity in november but he is budgeting for attendance closer to about 50 percent projections for next winter are slightly higher he said but there will be 26 performances instead of the normal 32 we re being conservative in terms of what we can sell he said derenzi said the smaller productions allowed the company to produce rarely seen works in the style that has defined sarasota opera for decades and follow the intentions of the composers next season will mark derenzi s 40th anniversary as artistic leader of the company audiences also indicated that they enjoyed having a shorter evening for a change most full scale operas run at least three hours but some of the winter season productions had running times closer to an hour like many other performing arts organizations sarasota opera survived the pandemic through the generosity of our donors and many of our patrons who donated back their tickets or didn t ask for refunds and supporters who made contributions to cover costs broadway in sarasota broadway returns to sarasota s van wezel hall in fall new theater season asolo repertory theatre sets full return to sarasota theater season there was no question about the company persevering derenzi said opera has been around since the year 1600 it s been through major catastrophes pandemics war depressions cholera and it always returns to the same thing people being with other people enjoying something live in a theater he said that s one of the appeals to me and to most of our audience that you re in a theater it s very different from watching the same thing on streaming or film that makes him more confident about people returning for more performances in the months ahead there s something about that shared community being together at a specific time for a specific event he said when television started it had that everyone was watching i love lucy at the same time now they don t watch anything at the same time because they can watch whenever they want it is nice to know there are 1 100 people in our theater watching the same event simultaneously russell said his new job title is a better reflection of the work he has actually been doing since he was first named executive director in 2012 at some cases the title general director is used for a single person who runs both the business and artistic aspects of a company there have been companies where two people share the leadership as victor and i do he said this was a request of mine you don t hear the term executive director as much any more and i think victor would agree that i have more input in the artistic side of things than in some other companies we collaborate more it is his domain but i talk more about opera than generally one would think of an executive director derenzi said that is because he received very good training here as an apprentice russell first came to sarasota opera 32 years ago in the apprentice training program and returned as as a studio and principal artist he left to pursue a career in banking and then served as the company s marketing director from 2005 2010 after two years as general director of opera new jersey he came back to the company during his tenure the company said it has increased individual giving by more than 50 percent and more than doubled its endowment he led the fundraising and construction for the steinwachs artist residences a 30 unit apartment complex used by up to 70 visiting artists and the purchase of a historic collection of opera costumes which was announced shortly before the pandemic derenzi said their collaboration works comfortably we certainly have our own aesthetics and things we like but we agree with what the company should be like richard likes more different music than i do but that applies to just about every person in the world but we both know what sarasota opera is about though the costume rental business dropped off because of the pandemic if we did not have the collection it would have been difficult to do the season we did derenzi said if we were renting as we often did we would not have been able to afford it that idea extends to other aspects of the company s operations russell said that s true of everything if we didn t have the opera house or our apartments or a stock of sets and the costumes we would not have had a season we surely were able to do more than most companies because of all those things sarasota opera 2021 22 season 61 n pineapple ave sarasota 941 328 1300 sarasotaopera org the silken

in a bigger is better world it is no longer enough for economists and investment managers to talk about trends instead they talk about megatrends massive global changes that transcend physical geopolitical and cultural boundaries in theory these huge global shifts such as an ageing population and the changing climate should provide rich pickings for investors after all if we are all eating less meat then vegan burger companies should do well and surely hip replacement businesses should form the bedrock of your portfolio if we are all getting older looking to the future we do not have a crystal ball and seismic events like a global pandemic can put predictions out of kilter so where are the next investment opportunities but thematic investing as fund managers tend to refer to the strategy of picking businesses that might ride this wave of global change is harder than it looks we do not have a crystal ball and seismic events like a global pandemic can put predictions out of kilter as a result special thematic funds aimed at catching megatrends can be a risky buy it is an exciting area but investors need to make sure they have their main bases covered first says laith khalaf financial analyst at wealth manager aj bell thematic funds are specialist and high risk so should only be used by experienced investors looking to broaden out already well diversified portfolios if we are investing for the long term though it is good to choose our investment funds and stocks with an eye to how the world is changing whether we invest in specific thematic funds or not as we emerge from lockdown into a post pandemic future wealth asked investment experts which thematic trends have been affected by covid 19 and where the next investment opportunities might lie increase your profits as robots cut costs it is hard to ignore the huge advances in technology use that have been made since the beginning of the pandemic walter price who manages investment trust allianz technology says that although the use of technology was increasing across all aspects of business prior to covid 19 the slope of the curve has increased dramatically since while shares in companies such as facebook and amazon have soared in value thanks to our increased reliance on them experts believe that there is value to be found in other areas of the technology sector jason hollands a director of wealth manager tilney is excited by robotics and automation developments that have been accelerated by the pandemic robot chores following global supply chain disruption during the pandemic some predict production will move closer to home and be aided by robotics and advanced machinery he says that problems with global supply chains during lockdowns mean we will manufacture more at home using robots rather than manpower he explains the pandemic has revealed the risks of relying heavily on global supply chains whether that is over securing personal protective equipment supplies spats over vaccines and other bottlenecks when combined with a desire to reduce travel to cut carbon emissions you can expect to see a lot more production that had previously been offshored to low cost producers like china moving closer to home where robotics and advanced machinery can be used to cut the costs of production aj bell s khalaf agrees he says automation is a key trend in technology suggesting that investors who want exposure to this should look at exchange traded fund ishares automation and robotics among its top holdings is us company teradyne which makes robots bhanu bhaweja the chief strategist at investment bank ubs is excited by a shift from bricks and mortar to software ecommerce the cloud and intellectual economy james carthew analyst at investment trust research company quoteddata says that the boom in cloud computing is allowing smaller software companies to attract customers more cheaply he suggests that smaller companies trust herald run by veteran fund manager katie potts is a good way for investors to benefit from this trend cash in on the race to net zero carbon another obvious megatrend is the move towards net zero carbon which is already affecting the investment landscape this megatrend was brewing before covid says darius mcdermott managing director of investment fund expert chelsea financial services people had finally woken up to the fact that we can t keep on abusing our planet we knew that 2 4trillion of annual spend would be required to meet global temperature goals green and sustainable technologies are another trend to consider for your portfolio but the solutions have been accelerated by covid as governments worldwide have committed to rebuilding their economies better and greener mcdermott says that one reason to invest sustainably now is that these solutions are being enthusiastically backed globally we ve got a rare moment when regulation is backing an investment trend he adds carlos hardenberg is co manager of emerging markets investment trust mobius he says there is an unprecedented push towards alternative energy sources from hydrogen fuel cells to wind and solar based solutions with a gradual end to fossil fuel based energy supply he adds this will have a wide ranging impact on the industrial landscape with new technologies supporting this transformation one way to gain access to this climate driven megatrend is through thematic fund ninety one global environment mcdermott says it invests only in companies helping to de carbonise the world economy top fund holdings include american environmental services company waste management and american electric utility company nextera energy aj bell s khalaf suggests fund liontrust sustainable future global growth run by peter michaelis as a good pick for those wanting to get exposure to the sustainability theme the fund has stakes in alphabet and visa as well as spanish mobile phone infrastructure specialist cellnex khalaf adds there are more specific sustainable themes that investors can target if they wish but these come with higher investment risk because they tend to be focused on only one part of the overall environmental theme for instance greencoat uk wind is an investment trust that invests in wind farms across the uk investors picking such specialist investments should make sure they represent only a small part of an otherwise diversified portfolio the rewards of an ageing population even as the pandemic recedes health anxiety will undoubtedly linger as well as the need for investment in national health systems of course the rapidly ageing global population requires more healthcare and since older people hold a large part of the world s wealth they will be willing to pay for solutions polar capital s james douglas says healthcare providers across the globe will invest in analytics and technologies to drive cost efficiencies healthcare was already an area in need of investment pre pandemic and the spotlight shone on it last year has made it even more so says chelsea s mcdermott in developed economies ageing populations mean governments need to be able to treat more people for less money james douglas fund manager of investment trust polar capital global healthcare believes there will be substantial growth in areas such as telemedicine and healthcare technology for use in the home for example monitoring systems he says the healthcare industry is looking to shift patient volumes to lower cost and more convenient settings such as the home in a post covid 19 world there is an expectation that healthcare systems globally will invest in analytics and technologies to drive cost efficiencies that should allow for the greater provision of healthcare services without compromising the quality of care and outcomes fund picks to take advantage of this thematic trend range from ishares ageing population a fund that invests in a basket of stocks that benefit from an ageing demographic to worldwide healthcare trust dzmitry lipski head of fund research at wealth manager interactive investor is a fan of worldwide healthcare which is managed by healthcare investment specialist orbimed capital he says it has generated a return of 108 per cent over the past five years and has outperformed its peer group try multi funds for megatrends some investment funds invest in a portfolio of stocks that embrace these megatrends they include montanaro better world which invests in companies involved in themes such as healthcare the green economy and innovative technology

i earned 2 500 writing an ad for shampoo yet i ve been bald for years toby young tells me my money about his hair raising experience social commentator toby young says one of the first things he d do if he were chancellor of the exchequer is scrap the bbc licence fee no one who owns a television set he believes should be forced to hand over 159 a year to one particular broadcaster he likens it to hovis demanding a fee for those who use a toaster young 57 recently founded the free speech union a non profit campaign organisation he spoke to donna ferguson what did your parents teach you about money to have a taste for luxury and overindulging my parents were both frugal and my father michael young was a workaholic he ran a left of centre think tank called the institute of community studies which came up with ideas for organisations and then helped to set them up the open university was his idea he had close links with the labour party he wrote the 1945 labour manifesto later he became a life peer lord young of dartington when i was growing up he would leave for the office at 8 and return home at 8 and work at the evenings and weekends too so he was a hard worker and he had modest tastes for almost all his life he would have a can of heinz tomato soup for lunch often supper would be cheese on toast and another can of soup my mother sasha moorsom was a novelist and a journalist and she also worked for my father as a project manager she was careful with money she didn t like luxury or extravagance partly in reaction to all that i have expensive tastes for example i m willing to spend 50 on a really good bottle of wine whereas my parents thought that if you spent more than 5 on a bottle of wine you were throwing money away was money tight when you were growing up no i d say i had a solidly middle class upbringing i didn t go to a private school but we lived in quite a nice house in highgate north london my parents also had a farmhouse in the south of france which we used to go to in the summer we weren t rich but i d say we led a comfortable middle class existence have you ever struggled to make ends meet yes in 1997 after i got fired from the magazine vanity fair i d gone to new york to take up that job and after i was sacked i had to scratch a living as a freelance writer i had quite a nice apartment in the west village as well as mortgage payments to make on my london flat at one point my friend who was renting my flat got behind with the rent that was a bit of a struggle but the worst period of my life financially was when i was 17 i went to israel and egypt with a friend and ended up in egypt by myself without any cash having to sleep on the floor of a corridor in a downmarket hotel at one point i had to steal food by pretending i was staying at a hotel which had an all you can eat buffet then i got impetigo a nasty skin infection and dysentery for a while i thought i might die a homeless person on the streets of cairo big apple young once rented an apartment in new york s west village but after losing his job at vanity fair magazine he struggled to make ends meet i didn t have enough money for a plane ticket home so i went to the british embassy and asked if they could deport me they said they could but advised against it because it would show in my passport and make it difficult for me to travel to other places eventually this very nice christian took pity on me and gave me the money to buy an airline ticket and fly home have you ever been paid silly money for a job procter gamble once paid me 2 500 to write some advertising copy for its shampoo head shoulders i think that was the most i ve ever earned for half an hour s work ironic considering i ve been bald for 35 years what was the best financial year of your life it was 2006 when channel 4 bought the movie rights to my book how to lose friends and alienate people i earned a decent six figure sum enough to move from a three bedroom to a five bedroom house a year later the most expensive thing you have bought for fun it was a skoda octavia rs i think it cost about 17 000 i can t say it was just for fun but it was certainly fun to drive when we had a second child i traded it in for a vauxhall zafira that was a lot less fun to drive fun to drive toby young once splashed out 17 000 on a skoda octavia rs but he had to trade it in when his second child came along what was your best money decision my father gave me 20 000 in 1991 which meant i was able to get a mortgage and buy a flat in shepherd s bush west london for 81 000 ten years later i sold it for 240 000 do you save in a pension or invest in shares yes i didn t have a pension until 2014 when i became the chief executive of an educational trust and my employer started paying into the local government pension scheme i m now self employed and pay into my pension regularly i also have a small amount of money invested in the stock market here and in the us i tend to go for medium to high risk stocks do you own any property my wife and i own a semidetached victorian house in acton west london we bought it in 2007 i d rather not say how much it s worth but i m sure it s risen in value since then it s got five bedrooms and we ve got four kids so it s large enough for each of them to have their own room which is just as well because they re all teenagers i ve built an office at the end of the garden which is where i work if you were chancellor what would you do i d kick boris out of the flat above no 11 downing street and move in myself although i d have to redecorate carrie has made it look like the inside of donatella versace s knicker drawer then i d scrap the bbc licence fee i don t think that anyone who owns a television set should be forced to hand over 159 a year to one particular broadcaster i think it should be my choice whether i pay to watch that provider in my mind it s like having to pay hovis 159 a year if you own a toaster do you donate to charity yes i do i co founded four free schools between 2011 and 2016 and they sit within a charity that i helped set up i also assisted in establishing a separate charity that supports extra curricular activities for the schools and i fund raise for that charity and donate to it regularly what s your number one financial priority i ve spent the best part of my career working as a freelance journalist and i haven t saved much money what i d like to do is make enough before i retire to get my kids on the property ladder and for my wife and i to live comfortably until the end of our days

a federal judge has overturned california s three decade old ban on assault weapons calling it a failed experiment that violates people s constitutional right to bear arms u s district judge roger benitez of san diego ruled on friday that the state s definition of illegal military style rifles unlawfully deprives law abiding californians of weapons commonly allowed in most other states and by the u s supreme court under no level of heightened scrutiny can the law survive benitez said he issued a permanent injunction against enforcement of the law but stayed it for 30 days to give state attorney general rob bonta time to appeal gov gavin newsom condemned the decision calling it a direct threat to public safety and the lives of innocent californians period in his 94 page ruling the judge spoke favorably of modern weapons and said they were overwhelmingly used for legal reasons a federal judge has overturned california s three decade old ban on assault weapons ruling that it violates the constitutional right to bear arms like the swiss army knife the popular ar 15 rifle is a perfect combination of home defense weapon and homeland defense equipment good for both home and battle the judge said in his ruling s introduction that comparison completely undermines the credibility of this decision and is a slap in the face to the families who ve lost loved ones to this weapon newsom said in a statement we re not backing down from this fight and we ll continue pushing for common sense gun laws that will save lives bonta called the ruling flawed and said it will be appealed california first restricted assault weapons in 1989 with multiple updates to the law since then assault weapons as defined by the law are more dangerous than other firearms and are disproportionately used in crimes mass shootings and against law enforcement with more resulting casualties the state attorney general s office argued and barring them furthers the state s important public safety interests a surge in sales of more than 1 16 million other types of pistols rifles and shotguns in the last year more than a third of them to likely first time buyers show that the assault weapons ban has not prevented law abiding citizens in the state from acquiring a range of firearms for lawful purposes including self defense the state contended in a court filing in march similar assault weapon restrictions have previously been upheld by six other federal district and appeals courts the state argued overturning the ban would allow not only assault rifles but things like assault shotguns and assault pistols state officials said but benitez disagreed this case is not about extraordinary weapons lying at the outer limits of second amendment protection the banned assault weapons are not bazookas howitzers or machine guns those arms are dangerous and solely useful for military purposes his ruling said instead the firearms deemed assault weapons are fairly ordinary popular modern the judge said despite california s ban there currently are an estimated 185 569 assault weapons registered with the state they were grandfathered in before california s evolving definition of an assault weapon this is an average case about average guns used in average ways for average purposes the ruling said one is to be forgiven if one is persuaded by news media and others that the nation is awash with murderous ar 15 assault rifles the facts however do not support this hyperbole and facts matter in california murder by knife occurs seven times more often than murder by rifle he added he also called the ban a continuing failed experiment which does not achieve its objectives of preventing mass shootings or attacks on law enforcement officers in a preliminary ruling in september benitez said california s complicated legal definition of assault weapons can ensnare otherwise law abiding gun owners with criminal penalties that among other things can strip them of their second amendment right to own firearms the burden on the core second amendment right if any is minimal the state argued because the weapons can still be used just not with the modifications that turn them into assault weapons modifications like a shorter barrel or collapsible stock make them more concealable state officials said while things like a pistol grip or thumbhole grip make them more lethal by improving their accuracy as they are fired rapidly the lawsuit filed by the san diego county gun owners political action committee california gun rights foundation second amendment foundation and firearms policy coalition is among several by gun advocacy groups challenging california s firearms laws which are among the strictest in the nation it was filed on behalf of gun owners who want to use high capacity magazines in their legal rifles or pistols but said they can t because doing so would turn them into illegal assault weapons under california law unlike military weapons the semi automatic rifles fire one bullet each time the trigger is pulled and the plaintiffs say they are legal in 41 states the lawsuit said california is one of only a small handful states to ban many of the most popular semiautomatic firearms in the nation because they possess one or more common characteristics such as pistol grips and threaded barrels frequently but not exclusively along with detachable ammunition magazines brandon combs the president of the firearms policy coalition said in a statement that the ruling held what millions of americans already know to be true bans on so called assault weapons are unconstitutional and cannot stand a gun control advocacy group called the judge s ruling alarming and especially insulting because it was handed down on national gun violence awareness day too many families across the nation have lost loved ones in shootings carried out with assault weapons they can attest to the reality that these weapons are not like swiss army knives nor are mass shootings only a very small problem said robyn thomas executive director of the giffords law center to prevent gun violence a group led by gabrielle giffords the former congresswoman from arizona who was shot and wounded in a mass shooting 10 years ago the state is appealing benitez s 2017 ruling against the state s nearly two decade old ban on the sales and purchases of magazines holding more than 10 bullets that decision triggered a weeklong buying spree before the judge halted sales during the appeal it was upheld in august by a three judge appellate panel but the 9th u s circuit court of appeals said in march that an 11 member panel will rehear the case the state also is appealing benitez s decision in april 2020 blocking a 2019 california law requiring background checks for anyone buying ammunition both of those measures were championed by newsom when he was lieutenant governor and they were backed by voters in a 2016 ballot measure
i originally planned to be a historian immersed in local history and passionate about america my love of shooting and old firearms grew simultaneously students of history even those who don t shoot competitively or at all still see incredible value in arms a pair of pistols carried by alexander hamilton during the revolutionary war just sold for 1 15 million these artifacts helped break a world record part of a 30 million dollar auction through rock island auction company that became the largest firearms auction ever the pistols didn t sell by themselves they came well documented along with the epaulettes hamilton wore as colonel serving under george washington and letters of authenticity from hamilton s descendants inscribed with the initials ah general philip schuyler hamilton s father in law gifted the pair to the founding father after the battle of saratoga both flintlock pistols were 58 caliber with a 9 round barrel and walnut stock very few firearms owned and used by the founding fathers during the american revolutionary war exist today george washington and alexander hamilton were the only two founding fathers to serve in the continental army with distinction what is perhaps even more amazing is hamilton s arms stayed in his family until the 1940s over 150 years until hamilton s great great grandson schuyler hamilton iii sold them these are the only pistols known to exist with an unbroken line of ownership and family documentation preserved in notarized affidavits though not proven it is likely major general philip schuyler the original owner carried them as an officer nearing the end of the french and indian war in addition to his service in the american revolution hamilton played many roles in america s founding from serving on the battlefield and in state though hamilton s list of accomplishments and contributions are too extensive to list here among them include signing the constitution shaping america s financial economic system as the first secretary of the treasury and penning most of the federalist papers read more at

lanka the burning pearl view s a raging inferno at sea and disaster clusters on land has all hell simultaneously broken loose in paradise it seems as though this once thrice blessed nation has been rendered bereft of its four guardian deities and left naked and bare to the mercy of incessant calamities to strike at will with wanton impudence such has become the accursed fate of this condemned state of lanka that even a disaster waiting to happen at sea is held suspended until it arrives on these island shores to break out with catastrophic consequences while a natural pestilence rages throughout the length and breadth of the island mass and has made the people prisoners in their own homes with graves increasingly opening up to receive its new possessors as a result while the rain forests and ecosystem wrought by nature to maintain the earthâ s equilibrium stand endangered with manâ s foul hand felling centuries old trees and indiscriminately clearing the countryâ s forest cover while the fires ofâ racial hate isâ rekindled again and again to tom tom beat hollow sinhala supremacy with no effort taken to douse the flames for good while the economy is in shambles with a beggared government forced to seek succour from former beggars now made good while life on the land is under siegeâ on all fronts with the islandâ s surrounding territorial waters the last frontier now condemned with chemical contamination and its pristine beaches tarred it seems all hell has simultaneously broken loose in lanka take the ill fated odyssey of x press pearl the container vessel that freighted doom to lankaâ s sea and shore chinese built and singaporean flagged the 186 meter long container ship was handed to x press feeders on february 10 this year it had a maximum carrying capacity of 2743 twenty foot container units deployed to ply the straits to middle east route from malaysia to dubai the port of call for this brand new ship on its return voyage were port hazira in gujarati india and colombo sri lanka before reaching its final eastern destination earlier it had made two voyages docking in colombo on march 17 and april 18 this was her third and as it turned out final voyage in her short life on the â third time unluckyâ voyage home the ship carryingâ 1 486 containers which included 25 tons of nitric acid other chemicals cosmetics even penis enlarging cream and low density polyethylenepellets somewhere in the arabian sea the shipâ s crew detected that the container carrying nitric acid was leaking according to reports the shipâ s captain informed the port at qatar of the leakage and requested permission to offload the offending cargo but was refused it then proceeded to its next scheduled port of call port hazira in india again permission was denied on the ground that â there were no specialist facilities or expertise immediately available to deal with the leaking acid it then set course to its next scheduled port of call in colombo it reached sri lankan territorial waters on the night of may 19 and dropped anchor 9 nautical miles from coast northwest of the colombo port the question has been raised â who allowed the ship in to lankan watersâ but it must be noted that under article 17 of the un convention on the law of the sea all ships have the inherent right to innocent passage through the territorial sea which is 12 nautical miles from the coastline over which coastal states enjoy sovereign rights clause 2 of article 18 states that â passage shall be continuous and expeditious however it can also be rendered necessary by force majeure act of god or when the ship is in distress article 19 states that â passage is innocent so long as it is not prejudicial to the peace good order or security of the coastal stateâ it further states that passage will cease to be innocent if any act among others of willful and serious pollution is committed the x press pearl not only possessed legal cover to unilaterally traverse lankaâ s sovereign waters under the right of innocent passage and did not violate the immunity granted by not willfully discharging pollutants but also had for her presence in the outer harbour the added protection of entering the territorial waters by prior notice and approval since her arrival was a scheduled visit neither is she so far accused of willfully discharging pollutants it is what transpired after her authorised entry that is at issue many questions have been raised as to whether the captain informed and the port was aware of the leakage whether the port despite being a maritime hub was equipped with the necessary tools to handle a disaster of this magnitude but these questions and a host of others will have to await answer till the shipâ s black box is found and investigations yield more evidence to make those liable pay for this cardinal sin against nature but as environment minister amaraweera said â even if rs 100 billion is paid to the government as compensation the damage caused to the environment cannot be restoredâ true except as punitive damages to deter repeats or as a bonanza from the sea to bolster lankaâ s depleted foreign exchange reserves or to pay for the present task of doing what is possible to clean up the beaches repairing the colossal damage done to marine life and the coral reef will be a job for nature and time which will once more be called to restore what man has destroyed but even as the three month old pearl which hit a sand bed while being towed on presidential orders further out to sea sinks to its watery early grave the alarm was raisedâ over the possible leakage of 300 tons of oil stored in its hold if the unthinkable should happen and the feared oil spillage should occur then the damage to the coastal environment would be unimaginable a plague ridden desolate landscape laid to waste a bleak tarred condemned coastal belt wrapped around by a greasy sea what more is needed to make the picture of doom as ordained by hubris replete on friday night another disaster loomed frighteningly over the capitalâ s waterworks â â furnace oil from tanks at the sapugaskanda oil refinery had overflowed following heavy rain and was reportedly threatening the kelani river if the oil reached the river it was said it would affect water distribution from the ambathale and biyagama water treatment plants the sources of the greater colombo and gampaha residentsâ water supply if not averted this would affect millions with water water everywhere with the rains in full force and not a drop to drink cook or wash is there really no end to the nationâ s nightmare of disasters no end to this curse on the landscape forsaken by the gods thanks joe for the astrazeneca us rids second thoughts and gives lankans the vaccine the american government on tuesday dismissed its second thoughts over sharing her excess stock of covid vaccines including the astrazeneca and decided to include the lankan people to her list of beneficiaries in a message issued by the white house it was made clear the us was not extending her vaccine largess to governments in return for concessions but to help the people us president joe biden said â we are sharing these doses not to secure favours or extract concessions we are sharing these vaccines to save lives and to lead the world in bringing an end to the pandemic with the power of our example and with our values on may 22 two days after parliament had enacted the controversial port city bill which gave legal life to the chinese built port city with the chinese in occupation as a legal tenant for 99 years us embassy spokesperson nancy vanhorn told the media that the us government was in two minds whether to include lanka to the beneficiariesâ list for a share of the vaccines but last sunday the sunday punch under the headline memo to the us â donâ t do the dirty on the lankan peopleâ urged the american government to transcend international power politics at this pandemic hour and help the people of lanka direct by giving the vaccines especially the astrazeneca to the 600 000 people who after having taken it as their first dose had been left stranded without the second in a fervent appeal to us president joe biden the sunday punch urged â his catholic heart that this is the time to forgive the time to transcend american distaste toward foreign governments which publicly embrace american foes and in the name of humanity to grant the grace of life saving 600 000 astrazeneca doses from his nationâ s stockpile to the lankan people â thanks mr president and take a bow youâ ve done the american people proud â cheers and make ours not a cocktail but an astrazeneca neat

the front of the new york stock exchange is shown on monday may 24 2021 what happens in utah if inflation monster rears its ugly head some economists are forecasting the nation will suffer from high inflation in the near future this may be caused by massive federal stimulus funding tariffs on commodities post pandemic economic resurgence etc your columnists are old guys who remember the horrors of prices escalating on a frequent basis we provide our geriatric recollections and the possible impact on politics for almost 40 years high inflation of prices and interest rates has not been a serious problem if it returns over the next several months what could be the economic and political impact pignanelli inflation is as violent as a mugger as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hit man ronald reagan i remember the 1970s fondly for bell bottoms discotheques and groundbreaking television but it was a time of oil embargoes and seemingly never ending price increases inflation diminishes wages for middle and lower income families while devastating their savings and assets this corrosive effect generates emotions with voters and the impact on politics is illustrated through three presidents most attribute the resignation of richard nixon from the watergate scandal but his public standing in 1974 was extremely low in the polls because inflation was raging at 11 he could not survive both while his pardon of nixon was controversial gerald ford faced the more daunting challenge of 10 inflation in 1975 this led to his 1976 loss with jimmy carter claiming a misery index of high inflation and unemployment four years later carter was dispatched by ronald reagan as the inflation rate in 1980 was almost 14 depending when inflationary pressures decay americans wages and investments history suggests reverberation in the midterm and possibly the general elections the early 2020s may be remembered more than just for post pandemic celebrations webb it sounds old fashioned and boring to be worried about inflation but high inflation in an overheated economy can be devastating it s a hidden tax it reduces the value of savings and retirement nest eggs the federal reserve response to high inflation usually means higher interest rates which could tank the housing market and drive up federal debt payments to catastrophic levels the biden administration is taking a monumental risk by flooding the country with free money while the economy is already booming after the pandemic the resulting inflation and potentially higher interest rates could severely dampen economic expansion and needed job growth some experts argue there s nothing to worry about they say today s economy is different that high inflation is temporary and that price surges will decline once supply and demand are better balanced as manufacturing picks up and supply chains return to normal whether that is true or not remains to be seen but clearly whether inflation becomes a crisis or not the historic blowout of borrowing printing and spending money at the federal level is unwise it not only is fiscally dangerous it teaches incorrect principles that there really is a free lunch and debt is no big deal once people don t fear or care about debt or deficits and expect cradle to grave government services that they don t pay for we re at that tipping point in a democracy where citizens have discovered they can vote themselves unlimited services without consequence but there always are consequences whether inflation soars right away or not we simply cannot defy economic gravity forever we re headed toward a really dangerous place most utahns do not have a memory of an inflationary economy so if one reappears what are the local ramifications pignanelli utah was especially hit hard during by the 1970s inflation because of reliance on a few industries today our state is much more diverse economically which will help absorb the impact utah s largest economic sector financial services is focused on innovation which may be of real benefit to not only survive but perhaps flourish during this time the frustration with federal macroeconomic policies will trickle to down ballot races because government largess is the likely target of blame candidates who can distance themselves from overspending practices and offer alternatives will succeed many of the battles currently raging inside each party will be forgotten amid this turmoil webb with worst case raging inflation we could see a major stock market setback and the dreaded stagflation a 1970s economic term that means persistent high inflation combined with high unemployment and stagnant consumer demand that s what destroyed jimmy carter s presidency those in power get blamed so the misery also trickles down to state and local politics could inflation provide any opportunities for politicians or new ideologies pignanelli because of policies and beliefs lefty progressives and devoted trumpistas could be burdened by politicos with blame for inflation this dynamic creates a ripe opening for visionary think tanks and party leaders to offer various economic and governance solutions that are practical and effective a new age of rational thought is possible webb president joe biden will get plenty of blame if serious inflation occurs on his watch but beware besides providing opportunity for innovative solutions economic distress also provides fertile ground for rabble rousers and extremists

gerrity s offers sign on bonuses as tight labor market felt in nepa it s no secret that around the nation many businesses are struggling to find staff and while the reasons are multifaceted a quick look at the comments you ll likely see under this article on our website will show some believe it s because nobody wants to work anymore while others will argue it s being caused by a reevaluation of american labor the problem remains many positions are going unfilled joe fasula co owner of the scranton based gerrity s supermarket chain said it s a problem all of his stores are experiencing the only comfort is knowing that we re not alone he said during a phone interview this week as an associated press report pointed out employers last month added 559 000 jobs on top of 278 000 in april those would ordinarily be seen as quite healthy numbers the ap added yet against the backdrop of record high job openings and free spending consumers some economists had envisioned the recovery from the pandemic recession driving monthly job growth of 800 000 900 000 even 1 million or more and that comes as businesses of all kinds are working to meet a burst of customer demand from americans who are no longer cooped up at home and who in many cases still have stimulus cash to spend gerrity s sign on bonuses fasula believes that as of right now at least the staffing issues won t be noticeable to customers but he s concerned that they could be soon especially as we approach the time of year where people take vacations fasula said that his company is looking largely for skilled positions such as butchers bakers cake decorators and other more specific workers with less of a focus on more generalized positions a grocery store has we could probably hire about 100 people today he said thankfully it s not affecting what the customer sees in terms of service everyone is working very hard we just want to stay ahead of it at this point in the conversation fasula took a moment away from the phone call to help a customer find an item on the store shelves the solution then is a sign on bonus it s a technique that a lot of businesses both here locally and nationwide have begun to employ hoping to attract workers by offering a bit of a bonus for joining the team at gerrity s anyone who signs on between may 31 and sept 12 will be eligible for up to 600 in bonuses anyone hired in that time will receive 500 as a bonus after the completion of their first 90 days on the job and they ll be eligible for an extra 100 bonus should they have perfect attendance at the end of those 90 days fasula said that these bonuses are available at all of his stores especially considering there s need at all of them every single store has needs in every department he said but he did acknowledge that the west pittston store is especially hurting for help wages rising gerrity s is not alone in offering incentives to potential employees average hourly wages rose solidly over the past two months the ap noted 0 5 in may on top of a 0 7 increase in april last month s wage growth was especially impressive considering that 52 of the added jobs came from the traditionally low wage leisure and hospitality sector the ap added noting that large chains including amazon walmart costco and chipotle have begun raising pay so too have local and regional employers consider gina schaefer who owns 13 ace hardware stores in maryland virginia and washington d c and who has been rapidly staffing up for the spring and summer when her sales typically hit highs schaefer has hired nearly 120 people since march both seasonal workers and long delayed replacements for people who left last year when covid ravaged the economy the ap pointed out her company pays a minimum of 15 50 an hour to compete with larger chains that now pay 15 and provides health insurance paid vacation sick leave and a 401 k plan after employees have been on the job for about six months we firmly believe that better workplaces do not have a problem finding employees schaefer told the ap rising wages have been seen in several sectors for nonsupervisory workers in leisure and hospitality including restaurants and hotel employees hourly wages rose 1 2 last month from april and 8 8 from a year ago construction workers benefiting from a housing boom enjoyed a 4 4 wage increase in may compared with a year earlier amid a surge in online shopping and deliveries transportation and warehouse workers received an average 3 5 hourly wage increase over the previous 12 months supply chain issues labor shortages affect businesses at almost every level of operation things exploded it was like a light switch said kirby mallon president of elmer schultz services a family owned philadelphia firm that repairs and maintains kitchen equipment for restaurants and other clients the labor market is just out of control we literally cannot hire technicians we ramped up so quickly the supply chain wasn t ready for it mallon told the associated press here in northeastern pennsylvania fasula feels the pinch of the labor shortage when the store is making orders there are a lot of items that are consistently out of stock he said on any given week 10 to 20 of our orders are out of stock fasula said that these difficulties in the stores getting goods are also caused by the consistent struggles to find workers there are simply holes in the supply chain he explained as of right now he said that the shortages are far away from being a crisis if your preferred brand or variety of a certain item is out of stock there is almost always something you can swap it out with but it is still a problem unemployment benefits an issue during the phone conversation this week fasula echoed a frequently cited concern that the cause of the labor shortage is being caused by the increased unemployment benefits that have been offered since the beginning of the pandemic benefits that are largely coming to an end nationwide it does appear to be more complicated than that though with recent reporting from the new york times going so far as to call the labor shortage largely a myth when a company is struggling to find enough labor it can solve the problem by offering to pay a higher price for the labor also known as higher wages writes times reporter david leonhardt more workers will then enter the labor market suddenly the labor shortage will be no more in fact wages are historically low nationwide the new york times says with worker compensation for their labor being lower than at any other point in the second half of the 20th century meanwhile company profits nationwide continue to skyrocket that so many are complaining about the situation is not a sign that something is wrong with the american economy the times piece ends it is a sign that corporate executive have grown so accustomed to a low wage economy that many believe anything else is unnatural regardless of the root cause of the labor shortage two distinct facts remain many companies need workers and many people don t have a job experts also advise patience however as supply and demand catch up with each other in a growing economy all these employers put up help wanted signs at the same time noted mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics it s taking a few weeks for workers to take the jobs in may the number of americans on temporary layoff dropped by an additional 291 000 to 1 8 million down 90 from a staggering 18 million in april 2020 the ap explained even people who lost their old jobs permanently made progress last month the number of such people dropped by 295 000 in may to 3 2 million but that is still up 59 from 2 million in april 2020 nearly 3 8 million americans about 41 of the jobless have been out of work for six months or more the ap added careerlink s role the times leader spoke with christine m jensen administrator of the wilkes barre office of pa careerlink about what could be done regardless of which of those two broad groups you might fall into jensen believes that careerlink can be a great help whether you need employees or employment i think employers need to be using all of their resources to recruit and quite frankly this was true before the pandemic she said according to her careerlink can help employers out with on the job training for their prospective employees along with even reimbursement of training in some of those positions additionally careerlink can help people seeking jobs identify where they might be the best fit we can work with them to help them find where those high priority jobs are she said explaining that careerlink can also provide assistance for tuition for job seekers who need training and jensen acknowledged that right now it might be a good time for employers to craft their salaries to be a bit more competitive we do have labor market information available to employers if they want to see what the average rate is for the job she said if an employer is concerned am i competitive am i paying a competitive rate they could ask us you wanna be competitive she said you need to know what the average wage is so you can be competitive jensen said that she thinks a lot of people aren t aware of just how much pa careerlink can help so she suggested that both job seekers and those seeking job seekers contact their local office the associated press contributed to this report
a weekend cyberattack on the world s largest meat processor won t have an immediate effect on u s prices analysts said on the heels of an announcement that the company plans to restart production on wednesday but if the suspension across jbs usa s five plants continues for more than a week then consumers could expect to pay a little more for a t bone steak jbs closed slaughter plants in the u s canada and australia on sunday after learning it was the target of a cybersecurity attack on its servers according to the company the sudden move rocked the industry after the three day holiday weekend and sparked a flurry of speculation of a possible beef and pork shortage that might send prices skyrocketing in the coming weeks but by tuesday evening the brazil based company said that many of its systems were already coming back online given the progress our it professionals and plant teams have made in the last 24 hours the vast majority of our beef pork poultry and prepared foods plants will be operational tomorrow said andre nogueira jbs usa ceo we are not sparing any resources to fight this threat we have cybersecurity plans in place to address these types of issues and we are successfully executing those plans nogueira said he added that the massive disruption did not succeed in crippling the company s shipping operations saying the company was able to ship product from nearly all of its facilities to supply customers even without cyberattacks the meat market is a volatile industry the u s is already in the midst of near record high meat prices due to soaring demand that has been compounded by the pandemic said alton kalo chief economist at steiner consulting group last year many of the nation s slaughterhouses and meat processing plants halted operations as factory workers became sick with the coronavirus the unpredictability introduced a new kind of volatility in prices that hadn t really been seen before kalo said added to that he said there was a huge spike in demand for meat as more and more people cooked at home as a result he noted even small changes will have repercussions the two day jbs closure wiped out nearly a fifth of the nation s beef pork and poultry production he explained additionally the usda on tuesday reported a 22 decline in beef and roughly 19 5 decline in pork which kalo said pretty much coincided with the jbs sized production hole in the market so you can see there is an impact but in terms of long term it ll depend on whether the jbs issue is a one day or two day problem kalo said it is going to be very different if it goes on for a week or more typically he said when there is a brief shortage in supply retailers are not inclined to make dramatic price changes because that could have unintended consequences on consumer behavior that s when they may just absorb the hit or smooth it out over time wholesalers are also reeling after the ransomware attack john fried general manager of canyon wholesale provisions in los angeles said it would be a huge relief if jbs resolves the issue quickly but he seemed a bit skeptical on monday afternoon he noted the chaos that ensued after the recent ransomware attack on the colonial pipeline just a few weeks ago that took a while to figure out and look what happened fried said gas stations in the southeastern u s were hit by motorists panic buying gasolinein anticipation of shortages i mean if this goes on for any length of time it s going to be horrible he said adding that the family owned business always has orders in the pipeline to jbs any interruption in deliveries he said could be detrimental to the shops and restaurants that rely on him they re just opening back up after more than a year of mandated covid 19 closures a spot of good news he remarked is that his company relies on several meat processors which might provide a short term solution for alternative sources from which to stock the warehouse but he concluded they will likely feel the full impact of a shortage in a matter of days too fried also wondered about the long term financial impact on his company should jbs decide to give in to the attackers demands and pay the ransom as colonial reportedlydid who pays for that in the end fried asked copyright 2021 npr to see more visit
a federal judge friday overturned california s three decade old ban on assault weapons ruling that it violates the constitutional right to bear arms u s district judge roger benitez of san diego ruled that the state s definition of illegal military style rifles unlawfully deprives law abiding californians of weapons commonly allowed in most other states and by the u s supreme court under no level of heightened scrutiny can the law survive benitez said he issued a permanent injunction against enforcement of the law but stayed it for 30 days to give state attorney general rob bonta time to appeal gov gavin newsom condemned the decision calling it a direct threat to public safety and the lives of innocent californians period in his 94 page ruling the judge spoke favorably of modern weapons said they were overwhelmingly used for legal reasons like the swiss army knife the popular ar 15 rifle is a perfect combination of home defense weapon and homeland defense equipment good for both home and battle the judge said in his ruling s introduction that comparison completely undermines the credibility of this decision and is a slap in the face to the families who ve lost loved ones to this weapon newsom said in a statement we re not backing down from this fight and we ll continue pushing for common sense gun laws that will save lives bonta called the ruling flawed and said it will be appealed california first restricted assault weapons in 1989 with multiple updates to the law since then assault weapons as defined by the law are more dangerous than other firearms and are disproportionately used in crimes mass shootings and against law enforcement with more resulting casualties the state attorney general s office argued and barring them furthers the state s important public safety interests further a surge in sales of more than 1 16 million other types of pistols rifles and shotguns in the last year more than a third of them to likely first time buyers show that the assault weapons ban has not prevented law abiding citizens in the state from acquiring a range of firearms for lawful purposes including self defense the state contended in a court filing in march similar assault weapon restrictions have previously been upheld by six other federal district and appeals courts the state argued overturning the ban would allow not only assault rifles but things like assault shotguns and assault pistols state officials said but benitez disagreed this case is not about extraordinary weapons lying at the outer limits of second amendment protection the banned assault weapons are not bazookas howitzers or machine guns those arms are dangerous and solely useful for military purposes his ruling said despite california s ban there currently are an estimated 185 569 assault weapons registered with the state the judge said this is an average case about average guns used in average ways for average purposes the ruling said one is to be forgiven if one is persuaded by news media and others that the nation is awash with murderous ar 15 assault rifles the facts however do not support this hyperbole and facts matter in california murder by knife occurs seven times more often than murder by rifle he added in a preliminary ruling in september benitez said california s complicated legal definition of assault weapons can ensnare otherwise law abiding gun owners with criminal penalties that among other things can strip them of their second amendment right to own firearms get your top stories delivered daily sign up for fox 11 s fast 5 newsletter and get breaking news alerts in the fox 11 news app download for ios or android the burden on the core second amendment right if any is minimal the state argued because the weapons can still be used just not with the modifications that turn them into assault weapons modifications like a shorter barrel or collapsible stock make them more concealable state officials said while things like a pistol grip or thumbhole grip make them more lethal by improving their accuracy as they are fired rapidly the lawsuit filed by the san diego county gun owners political action committee california gun rights foundation second amendment foundation and firearms policy coalition is among several by gun advocacy groups challenging california s firearms laws which are among the strictest in the nation the lawsuit filed in august 2019 followed a series of deadly mass shootings nationwide involving military style rifles it was filed on behalf of gun owners who want to use high capacity magazines in their legal rifles or pistols but said they can t because doing so would turn them into illegal assault weapons under california law unlike military weapons the semi automatic rifles fire one bullet each time the trigger is pulled and the plaintiffs say they are legal in 41 states the lawsuit said california is one of only a small handful states to ban many of the most popular semiautomatic firearms in the nation because they possess one or more common characteristics such as pistol grips and threaded barrels frequently but not exclusively along with detachable ammunition magazines the state is appealing benitez s 2017 ruling against the state s nearly two decade old ban on the sales and purchases of magazines holding more than 10 bullets that decision triggered a weeklong buying spree

the u s economy is sparking confusion and whiplash almost as fast as it s adding jobs barely more than a year after the coronavirus caused the steepest economic fall and job losses on record the speed of the rebound has been so unexpectedly swift that many companies can t fill jobs or acquire enough supplies to meet a pent up burst of customer demand things exploded it was like a light switch said kirby mallon president of elmer schultz services a family owned philadelphia firm that repairs and maintains kitchen equipment for restaurants and other clients the labor market is just out of control we literally cannot hire technicians we ramped up so quickly the supply chain wasn t ready for it related us unemployment claims drop to 385 000 another pandemic low economic forecasters with little historical precedent to guide them through the aftermath of a global pandemic are pondering questions they can t answer with any confidence does robust consumer spending reflect economic strength and resiliency or has it been temporarily propped up by federal stimulus checks was an april run up in consumer prices a temporary blip or an ominous sign of accelerating inflation are two months of middling job growth the result of too much of a good thing employers want to hire more than they can or a hint that the labor market isn t as strong as economists think in many ways the news has been cause to cheer the economy grew from january through march at a red hot 6 4 annual pace and in the current quarter that pace is thought to be accelerating to nearly double digits yet the full portrait of the u s economy is a rather more nuanced one here is a closer look at five vital signs ___ jobs employers last month added 559 000 jobs on top of 278 000 in april those would ordinarily be seen as quite healthy numbers yet against the backdrop of record high job openings and free spending consumers forecasters had expected much more hiring some economists had envisioned the recovery from the pandemic recession driving monthly job growth of 800 000 900 000 even 1 million or more what explains the shortfall related may jobs report us adds modest 559 000 jobs amid hiring struggles economists point mainly to what they call a short term mismatch companies are posting job openings faster than applicants can respond after all many americans are contending with considerable tumult at home health issues related to covid 19 child care problems with schools slow to reopen career uncertainty after many jobs permanently vanished over the past 15 months and some people earning more from federal and state jobless aid than they did when they worked are taking their time before pursuing another job some say the labor shortage is nothing that can t be solved the old fashioned way by raising pay and offering more generous benefits and working conditions in fact that process appears to have begun average hourly wages rose solidly in april and may consider gina schaefer who owns 13

chief u s economist at high frequency economics sees cautionary signs confidence and spending though still healthy have trended lower and retail sales were flat in april after having surged in march suggesting that the positive effect of the stimulus checks might have faded similar trends occurred late last year after the effects of earlier federal stimulus money began to wear off in addition a monthly survey of consumer confidence by the conference board found that expectations for the next six months actually fell in may i m not sure how this is going to pan out farooqi says ___ inflation financial markets endured an unwelcome jolt last month when the labor department reported that consumer prices had jumped 0 8 from march to april and 4 2 from 12 months earlier the largest year over year increase since 2008 some leading critics including former treasury secretary larry summers have been warning that president joe biden s trillions of dollars in federal stimulus money risk igniting inflation and forcing the federal reserve to resort to interest rate hikes which could derail the economic recovery but fed chair jerome powell and many economists say they think the inflation surge will prove short lived they say it reflects mainly temporary supply chain bottlenecks that have forced up prices but that should ease over time for now though shortages of lumber computer chips and other materials have contributed to inflation pressures mallon at elmer schultz services in philadelphia said supply shortages are so severe in his industry that members of the the commercial food service equipment association trade group are sharing inventory i can go to a friend if he has a part in stock he said in my 30 years in the business no i ve never seen anything like it ___ housing the housing market has served as a source of economic strength and resilience during the pandemic supported by ultra low mortgage rates and the desire of many locked down families to move to more spacious digs to accommodate work from home needs but with prices having risen beyond the reach of many and with the supply of homes for sale severely limited the housing boom has lately shown signs of fatigue home construction tumbled 9 5 in april a drop that economists attributed at least in part to builders postponing projects because of accelerating costs for lumber and other supplies that have contributed to swelling home prices related sales of new us homes fell 5 9 in april in wake of soaring house prices in march in april sales of new homes dropped nearly 6 and purchases of existing homes fell 2 7 many would be buyers will remain on the outside looking in as long as a shortage of available homes keeps sale prices elevated ___ manufacturing u s factories are

new york june 6 they are technology enthusiasts on the hunt for opportunities in the wild west market surrounding nfts the popular certified digital objects that have spawned a new generation of collectors convinced of their huge potential advertisement brandon kang a 25 year old videographer from california started buying nfts in december and already owns more than 500 in february he spent us 50 000 rm206 400 for reflection a digital work by electronic music artist feed me his collection includes digital images of simian heads bored ape a beverage can and a cube as well as an animation of a car driving down a road all of them created by artists little known by the general public he displays them on screens in his house and with few exceptions has no plans to sell them advertisement kang has made believers of some of his friends and family members one thing that they thought was cool is the way to verify ownership of these digital nfts it is truly a unique experience he said nfts non fungible tokens are digital objects such as drawings animations pieces of music photos or videos whose authenticity is confirmed by blockchain technology preventing forgeries or manipulation nfts have generated nearly us 2 5 billion in sales over the first five months of 2021 based on numbers from the specialized nonfungible website the big auction houses now regularly sell them as sotheby s is doing through june 10 with its natively digital sale advertisement the ability to prove the authenticity of nfts was decisive for kang long an investor in cryptocurrencies which rely on the same blockchain technology before he said there was no way to prove and show ownership of digital assets cryptographically not easy to digest it was that same guarantee of authenticity that drove devan mitchem a singapore based cloud engineer to begin collecting digital objects after at first being sceptical because of the inconsistent formats marketplaces and storage options but the emergence of websites like opensea and nifty gateway allowed artists to sell their works directly while enabling collectors to buy store and resell them making the nft world almost as accessible as the stock market mitchem a blockchain specialist with google cloud now owns more than 200 nfts like kang he has no plans to sell them it s risky but i feel works created from 2017 through the lockdowns of 2021 will be remembered as the defining moment of this new category he said this era will hold a special place in future portfolios pankaj patil a computer engineer last year sold some of the 150 digital objects he had acquired fearing for the future of the nft market today this new jersey resident said i definitely regret selling some of them even as he acknowledges that this space is not easy to digest for everyone devan mitchem said he can see why some people might have doubts i can absolutely understand any scepticism he said there are several things to unpack about how nfts work for anyone interested in exploring this new market mitchem offers this advice read up on the philosophies behind blockchains like bitcoin that should make it clear he added that these are global computers not owned by a single entity it s still very much the wild west he said but also a land of opportunity love of art or money kang too urged anyone intrigued by nfts to do their homework before plunging in those who flood in the market without doing their research and not even making an effort to understand nfts he said will be the ones who will most likely be burned he adds that a recent market correction that saw a drop in both average prices and the number of transactions does not in any way threaten the future of nfts we are seeing the space mature and i strongly believe it is good in the long term to remove the people who are purely trying to make profits and are not motivated by love of art he said mitchem like many others insists he is drawn by the artistic value of many young digital creators even if the public image of the nft is largely that of a fad if not an outright fraud he speaks passionately about picasso s bull a cubist depiction of a bull by visual artist trevor jones and which he purchased for us 23 000 he calls it a seminal piece nft collectors many of them computer programmers and most of them men say they are also drawn by the constant innovation in the market they foresee a world in which nfts can move between platforms sites and virtual universes unbound by the constraints of the physical world they also insist that the field is reducing its currently catastrophic carbon footprint due to the huge energy demands of underlying cryptocurrencies as it adopts new protocols for nft creation and as less energy intensive cryptocurrencies are developed mitchem is such a firm believer in nfts that he believes the term itself will disappear as the technology becomes commonplace it simply becomes digital media and digital assets he said afp
what a job the toughest job at the daily times is probably dealing with the never ending stream of idiotic sound offs that keep coming in what a chore it must be like susan from glen riddle complaining about joe biden enjoying a bike ride with his wife on her 70th birthday and how he enjoyed an ice cream cone the previous weekend calling him a disgrace to the presidency and there is r p c broomall complaining of all the damage he thinks biden is doing and we should have trump and his team back in the white house asap and last but not least there is the other fool saying biden is afraid of putin and afraid to follow a great president can t you clowns just give biden a chance and how is the country in shambles susan from glen riddle the economic recovery is well underway the virus situation has drastically improved and the stock market is doing great you guys are idiots i m tired of reading your moronic viewpoints can t you see that you got conned trump was a horrible president how d you get hypnotized by this guy wake up and look forward not towards the past yo margo pennsylvania s legislature is controlled by republicans both house and senate two republican senators chris dush and doug mastriano just got back from arizona why did they visit arizona to gather intel on how to conduct another audit on our 2020 presidential election from arizona s gop legislature point is the fight is not over just because we got trump out of office next concern should be gerrymandering rep margo davidson is the democratic chair of the house state government committee she has a bill on her desk house bill 22 that would prevent gerrymandering and she is doing nothing it s rep davidson s job to get house bill off her desk out of her committee and to the house floor for a vote google her name sign up for her newsletter that will enable you to contact her office via email or phone call delco dem get a grip to time to tee off from your hypocrisy surely has me teed off donald trump spent 307 days almost a full year golfing during his presidency the total is likely to be the most golf outings of any president in history trump visited a trump organization property on 428 days of his presidency or about two days of every week of his presidency everyone needs time to relax but the audacity of criticizing biden for something that trump was guilty of in spades is beyond appalling anyone who kept up with any news would know about trump s part time application to the presidency nancy who likes to work for facts always a trumpster facebook can suspend trump but that doesn t stop people from supporting him he was a great president not like the one now some people always want to attack trump but never say anything about some of the words and actions of democrats so enjoy your comments about trump you only talk about him because you re not allowed to say anything about dumb joe the only thing the news can report about joey how may i scream fantasy we are all laughing because the news really thinks they can turn us against trump but you re wrong remember glen riddle susan is bothered by president biden s trip to rehobeth for the weekend never saw trump take off to visit the resort town trying to recover and you never did never would never will who cause it doesn t have a golf course delcoseer recent history how fast we forget time to tee off talks about biden spending time in rehoboth with his wife how many times did trump go golfing during the pandemic not caring that thousands of people were dying that was ok also forcing the secret service to stay at his hotels so he can charge high fees to line his pocket with taxpayers money but that s ok when people state that biden is friends with putin they forget that when our intelligence people said the russians interfered with the elections trump believed putin instead of his own people not to mention the ransom for american soldiers but that s ok how quick we forget
focus adetilewa adebajo amidst the counter accusations of money printing by the two godwins denial by the national economic council and statement by the nigerian national petroleum corporation nnpc that it will be unable to remit funds into the federation account for several months several issues started to manifest in my mind concerning the state of the nation what is the true state of our economic decline debt levels and descent into a state of anarchy several social media posts documenting the facts that in the past week alone over 150 nigerians killed was particularly depressing these killings across the nation were related to kidnapping insurgency and internal strife the humble fulani herdsman has been weaponized and converted to a tool of insurgency this week the government of the united states of america also upgraded its travel advisory to nigeria to level three advising its citizens to reconsider travelling to nigeria and if they must travel they should put in place kidnapping protocols and prepare their evacuation arrangements without assistance from american authorities we are one step off the highest level level four which advises americans not to travel to nigeria while the dire security situation in nigeria has not been adequately addressed the local narrative and official explanation varies depending on who you talk to the american travel advisory without any ambiguity defines how the world now views nigeria as a fallout the money printing saga i decided to extend my q1 2021 nigerian economic report and conduct a more comprehensive review focusing on the rising debt profile which dates back to 2014 when the economy grew by 6 5 with a gdp of usd569bn a historic high flashback to an article published by fitch in january 2021 which warns that nigeria s deficit monetization may raise macro stability risks the report stated that the central bank of nigeria cbn had financed the budget deficit directly with ngn10trn approximately usd25bn fitch also warned that repeated central bank financing of government budgets could raise risks to macro stability in the context of weak institutional safeguards that preserve the credibility of policymaking and the ability of the central bank to control inflation the cbn s guidelines limit the amount available to the government under its ways and means financing wmf to 5 of the previous year s fiscal revenues however the fgn s new borrowing from the cbn has repeatedly exceeded that limit in recent years and reached around 80 of the fgn s 2019 revenues in 2020 the report stated further that the cbn s guidelines requires borrowing under the wmf to be repaid in the year in which it was granted the government has stated its intention to securitise balances borrowed under the facility but published statistics indicate that the amounts borrowed have been rolled over repeatedly in recent years in effect the cbn was out of step with its own guidelines and has also not publicly released its audited accounts in a while in february 2021 the debt management office dmo under the ministry of finance confirmed the level of wmf at ngn10tn approximately usd25bn they admitted that they had engaged with the cbn in wmf since 2015 to plug the budget deficit the dmo also announced establishment of a 10 year to 30 year bond issuance program to refinance the wmf in compliance with the cbn guidelines the question that remains unanswered is how the cbn out of step with guidelines funded ngn10tn approximately usd25bn to finance the budget deficit the cbn intervention programs and financing in the local and international capital markets are well documented and require legislative approval in the absence of published audited accounts is it not logical to presume that the cbn must have printed to support wmf over the past five years while the doctrine of necessity allows leeway for central banks in time of economic downturn and crisis to resort to printing money or wmf the nigerian situation started in 2015 with the covid 19 pandemic and ensuing recession exacerbating the situation from all accounts the usd25bn wmf has not been accounted for in nigeria domestic and total debt profile according to dmo data in 2014 nigeria s total debt was usd67 7bn with domestic debt accounting for usd57 9bn and foreign debt usd9 7bn by 2020 nigeria s total debt increased by 27 5 to usd86 3bn with domestic debt accounting for usd53 0billion a declined by usd 4 9bn or 8 5 from 2014 total domestic debt and foreign debt accounting for usd33 3billion an increase by usd23 6bn or 243 3 from 2014 total foreign debt at this level of total debt 80 90 of government revenue for the q1 2021 was going towards debt service a different picture emerges when you include the unaccounted usd25bn wmf in the cbn books in reality the total debt stock increased from usd67 7bn in 2014 to a record high of usd111 3bn in 2021 a 64 4 increase this directly impacts domestic debt as it rises from usd57 9billion to usd78bn an increase by usd20 1bn or 34 7 from 2014 total domestic debt the dmo march 2021 report when released should clarify the current position of our total debt profile and how much of the usd25billion wmf has actually been refinanced recently the national assembly approved a foreign loan of usd2 5bn taking into account the wmf this will take the total debt stock to us 113 8bn from the analysis above it is clear that with nigeria s current debt profile servicing its debt with over 80 to 90 of its revenue is no longer sustainable as a result of this debt profile and declining revenue situation red flagged by the nnpc pronouncements nigeria can now be classified technically insolvent a review of the key economic indicators for the nigerian economy between 2014 to q1 2021 the period under review suggests sub optimal performance in 2014 the nigerian economy was growing steadily at about 6 5 until policy inconsistencies forced the economy into a self inflicted recession in 2016 the government responded with an economic recovery growth plan ergp the plan promised but was unable to stem the economic decline to deliver 7 growth by 2020 since the 2016 downturn the nigerian economy has not grown beyond 2 5 considering its population growth rate of 3 5 between 2016 and 2020 nigeria lost usd218bn approximately 40 of its gdp this is equivalent to portugal s gdp three times ghana s gdp and six times cameroon s gdp inflation also hit a 10 year high of 18 7 in january 2017 and the monetary authorities were able to reduce it to 11 9 by december 2019 unfortunately as a result of cost push factors by march 2021 inflation was up by 18 2 food inflation at just over 22 is the key driver of inflation despite a ngn1 5tn intervention by the cbn in the agriculture sector the recent hike in utility rates and fuel subsidy removal has done nothing but sustain the upward trajectory of inflation rates the naira suffered over 300 devaluation as it moved from ngn160 usd1 to ngn 480 1 under the review period the static exchange rate mechanism and multiple exchange rate windows have been a sore point they remain in place despite calls for a single window and a market driven rate mechanism the biggest challenges during this review period were fiscal indiscipline and the perpetual budget deficit the government struggled to finance the government admitted in its 2021 budget presentation that it is now in violation of the fiscal responsibility act which stipulates a value of 3 5 of gdp as the budget deficit ceiling unemployment rate more than tripled from 12 in 2016 to 45 by q1 2021 factoring underemployment and youth employment reveal higher numbers as a result of sub optimal economic growth and declining gdp over 100 million nigerians entered into poverty and nigeria became the global poverty capital increasingly our population instead of being an asset with a viable consumer market and aggregate demand of 180 million people is fast becoming unproductive with meagre disposable income and a liability from the data available it can be established that self inflicted policies caused the first recession in 2016 however the shocks to the economy as a result of the pandemic lockdown and the sharp drop in oil prices caused a downturn in an already fragile economy and tipped it into another recession in 2020 in q2 and q3 2020 the nigerian gdp contracted by 6 10 and 3 62 respectively however by q4 2020 nigeria exited recession with 0 1 growth the irony as with the last recession is that our economic and financial managers did not have sufficient buffers in place to help withstand the shocks at the onset of the pandemic the nsia stabilisation fund had only usd350mn and excess crude account eca a paltry usd72mn a sum of usd150mn approximately ngn57bn was withdrawn from the nsia in april 2020 to support a ngn5tn budget deficit in contrast during the 2009 global financial crisis the eca had usd22bn which saw nigeria through the crisis as a response to addressing the impact of the shocks to the nigerian economy during the period under review the fgn began to step up its social intervention programs and engage in consultative meetings with stakeholders across all sectors of the economy while these programs are laudable and pilots have been successful it is clear that the government cannot fund the program the best way out this quagmire is to grow the economy by over 6 5 to 10 0 on a sustainable basis lifting the masses out of poverty in the process the cbn also increased its intervention program with additional funding to cover the healthcare and sme sectors ensuring liquidity and credit to the economy an ambitious infrastructure fund with over usd20bn is being developed and request for proposals rfps have gone out for fund managers rate cuts were also announced on intervention funds and mpr base rates giving banks the confidence to continue lending and providing the much needed stimulus on the 24th of june 2020 the fgn approved the nigeria economic sustainability plan nesp this is in an effort to cushion the adverse effects of the pandemic on nigerians and define a policy framework and implementation roadmap to economic recovery on the 28th april 2021 barely a year after the approval of the nesp the federal executive council approved the national poverty reduction with growth strategy prepared by the president s economic advisory council we are not sure if this supersedes or compliments the nesp the cbn mpc meeting held early 2021 maintained the rates as the economy came out of recession earlier than expected the results of the nesp are yet to bear fruit as the government is struggling with the 2021 budget implementation and deficit financing we are now faced with stagflation a situation more protracted than a recession it is clear that monetary policy has reached its limits and supply side structural reforms and fiscal discipline are now required to get the nigerian economy out of the current stagflation quagmire the most urgent structural reform is immediate removal of subsidies across the economy in particular the fuel subsidy nnpc recently announced that it will be unable to remit revenues to the federation account for several months as a result of the subsidy payments the short fall will put addition pressure on the cbn and the wmf in the period under review we now face the stark reality of stagflation a declining economy that lost usd210bn of its gdp with 0 1 growth runaway inflation at 18 usd113 8bn debt stock with 90 of revenues going to debt service unsustainable budget deficit 300 currency devaluation the nigerian naira trading at ngn500 based on parallel market rates 100 million nigerians in poverty and over 50 youth

nigerian economy despite these challenges remain strong the nigerian economy remains the largest in africa even with the loss of gdp three times that of ghana in recent years it is however time to

a weekend cyberattack on the world s largest meat processor won t have an immediate effect on u s prices analysts said on the heels of an announcement that the company plans to restart production on wednesday but if the suspension across jbs usa s five plants continues for more than a week then consumers could expect to pay a little more for a t bone steak jbs closed slaughter plants in the u s canada and australia on sunday after learning it was the target of a cybersecurity attack on its servers according to the company the sudden move rocked the industry after the three day holiday weekend and sparked a flurry of speculation of a possible beef and pork shortage that might send prices skyrocketing in the coming weeks but by tuesday evening the brazil based company said that many of its systems were already coming back online given the progress our it professionals and plant teams have made in the last 24 hours the vast majority of our beef pork poultry and prepared foods plants will be operational tomorrow said andre nogueira jbs usa ceo we are not sparing any resources to fight this threat we have cybersecurity plans in place to address these types of issues and we are successfully executing those plans nogueira said he added that the massive disruption did not succeed in crippling the company s shipping operations saying the company was able to ship product from nearly all of its facilities to supply customers even without cyberattacks the meat market is a volatile industry the u s is already in the midst of near record high meat prices due to soaring demand that has been compounded by the pandemic said alton kalo chief economist at steiner consulting group last year many of the nation s slaughterhouses and meat processing plants halted operations as factory workers became sick with the coronavirus the unpredictability introduced a new kind of volatility in prices that hadn t really been seen before kalo said added to that he said there was a huge spike in demand for meat as more and more people cooked at home as a result he noted even small changes will have repercussions the two day jbs closure wiped out nearly a fifth of the nation s beef pork and poultry production he explained additionally the usda on tuesday reported a 22 decline in beef and roughly 19 5 decline in pork which kalo said pretty much coincided with the jbs sized production hole in the market so you can see there is an impact but in terms of long term it ll depend on whether the jbs issue is a one day or two day problem kalo said it is going to be very different if it goes on for a week or more typically he said when there is a brief shortage in supply retailers are not inclined to make dramatic price changes because that could have unintended consequences on consumer behavior that s when they may just absorb the hit or smooth it out over time wholesalers are also reeling after the ransomware attack john fried general manager of canyon wholesale provisions in los angeles said it would be a huge relief if jbs resolves the issue quickly but he seemed a bit skeptical on monday afternoon he noted the chaos that ensued after the recent ransomware attack on the colonial pipeline just a few weeks ago that took a while to figure out and look what happened fried said gas stations in the southeastern u s were hit by motorists panic buying gasolinein anticipation of shortages i mean if this goes on for any length of time it s going to be horrible he said adding that the family owned business always has orders in the pipeline to jbs any interruption in deliveries he said could be detrimental to the shops and restaurants that rely on him they re just opening back up after more than a year of mandated covid 19 closures a spot of good news he remarked is that his company relies on several meat processors which might provide a short term solution for alternative sources from which to stock the warehouse but he concluded they will likely feel the full impact of a shortage in a matter of days too fried also wondered about the long term financial impact on his company should jbs decide to give in to the attackers demands and pay the ransom as colonial reportedlydid who pays for that in the end fried asked copyright 2021 npr to see more visit
the u s economy is sparking confusion and whiplash almost as fast as it s adding jobs barely more than a year after the coronavirus caused the steepest economic fall and job losses on record the speed of the rebound has been so unexpectedly swift that many companies can t fill jobs or acquire enough supplies to meet a pent up burst of customer demand things exploded it was like a light switch said kirby mallon president of elmer schultz services a family owned philadelphia firm that repairs and maintains kitchen equipment for restaurants and other clients the labor market is just out of control we literally cannot hire technicians we ramped up so quickly the supply chain wasn t ready for it economic forecasters with little historical precedent to guide them through the aftermath of a global pandemic are pondering questions they can t answer with any confidence feeling out of the loop we ll catch you up on the chicago news you need to know sign up for the weekly chicago catch up newsletter here does robust consumer spending reflect economic strength and resiliency or has it been temporarily propped up by federal stimulus checks was an april run up in consumer prices a temporary blip or an ominous sign of accelerating inflation are two months of middling job growth the result of too much of a good thing employers want to hire more than they can or a hint that the labor market isn t as strong as economists think in many ways the news has been cause to cheer the economy grew from january through march at a red hot 6 4 annual pace and in the current quarter that pace is thought to be accelerating to nearly double digits yet the full portrait of the u s economy is a rather more nuanced one here is a closer look at five vital signs ___ jobs employers last month added 559 000 jobs on top of 278 000 in april those would ordinarily be seen as quite healthy numbers yet against the backdrop of record high job openings and free spending consumers forecasters had expected much more hiring some economists had envisioned the recovery from the pandemic recession driving monthly job growth of 800 000 900 000 even 1 million or more what explains the shortfall economists point mainly to what they call a short term mismatch companies are posting job openings faster than applicants can respond after all many americans are contending with considerable tumult at home health issues related to covid 19 child care problems with schools slow to reopen career uncertainty after many jobs permanently vanished over the past 15 months and some people earning more from federal and state jobless aid than they did when they worked are taking their time before pursuing another job some say the labor shortage is nothing that can t be solved the old fashioned way by raising pay and offering more generous benefits and working conditions in fact that process appears to have begun average hourly wages rose solidly in april and may consider gina schaefer who owns 13 ace hardware stores in maryland virginia and washington d c and who has been rapidly staffing up for the spring and summer when her sales typically hit highs schaefer has hired nearly 120 people since march both seasonal workers and long delayed replacements for people who left last year when covid ravaged the economy her company pays a minimum of 15 50 an hour to compete with larger chains that now pay 15 and provides health insurance paid vacation sick leave and a 401 k plan after employees have been on the job for about six months we firmly believe that better workplaces do not have a problem finding employees she said ___ consumers after months cooped up at home millions of consumers have rushed back out again in buoyant spirits and eager to spend their finances bolstered by 1 400 federal stimulus payments earlier this year among the affluent sharp gains in home and stock market equity have further emboldened their impulse to spend consumer confidence is high and americans stepped up their spending again in april after a powerful gain in march fueled by 1 400 stimulus checks to most individuals that said rubeela farooqi chief u s economist at high frequency economics sees cautionary signs confidence and spending though still healthy have trended lower and retail sales were flat in april after having surged in march suggesting that the positive effect of the stimulus checks might have faded similar trends occurred late last year after the effects of earlier federal stimulus money began to wear off in addition a monthly survey of consumer confidence by the conference board found that expectations for the next six months actually fell in may i m not sure how this is going to pan out farooqi says ___ inflation financial markets endured an unwelcome jolt last month when the labor department reported that consumer prices had jumped 0 8 from march to april and 4 2 from 12 months earlier the largest year over year increase since 2008 some leading critics including former treasury secretary larry summers have been warning that president joe biden s trillions of dollars in federal stimulus money risk igniting inflation and forcing the federal reserve to resort to interest rate hikes which could derail the economic recovery but fed chair jerome powell and many economists say they think the inflation surge will prove short lived they say it reflects mainly temporary supply chain bottlenecks that have forced up prices but that should ease over time for now though shortages of lumber computer chips and other materials have contributed to inflation pressures mallon at elmer schultz services in philadelphia said supply shortages are so severe in his industry that members of the the commercial food equipment service association trade group are sharing inventory i can go to a friend if he has a part in stock he said in my 30 years in the business no i ve never seen anything like it ___ housing the housing market has served as a source of economic strength and resilience during the pandemic supported by ultra low mortgage rates and the desire of many locked down families to move to more spacious digs to accommodate work from home needs but with prices having risen beyond the reach of many and with the supply of homes for sale severely limited the housing boom has lately shown signs of fatigue home construction tumbled 9 5 in april a drop that economists attributed at least in part to builders postponing projects because of accelerating costs for lumber and other supplies that have contributed to swelling home prices in april sales of new homes dropped nearly 6 and purchases of existing homes fell 2 7 many would be buyers will remain on the outside looking in as long as a shortage of available homes keeps sale prices elevated ___ manufacturing u s factories are thriving despite the clogged supply chains and the shortage of workers the institute for supply management s manufacturing index rose to 61 2 last month any reading above 50 signals growth and manufacturers have been on a 12 month winning streak half the purchasing managers surveyed by the trade association said they had had trouble finding workers given the supply problems it s unclear whether factories can sustain their steady output the ism found that deliveries from suppliers were coming in at their slowest rate since 1974 sixteen of 18 industries reported slower deliveries ___ ap business writers christopher rugaber in washington and joyce m rosenberg in new york contributed to this report ___ this story was first published on june 5 2021 it was updated on june 7 2020 to correct the name of a trade association it is the commercial food equipment service association not the commercial food service equipment association

collectors of digital nfts see a wild west market worth the risk cryptopunk 7523 a rare nft from larva labs is one of several of the certified digital objects being sold by auction house sotheby s through june 10 2021 new york they are technology enthusiasts on the hunt for opportunities in the wild west market surrounding nfts the popular certified digital objects that have spawned a new generation of collectors convinced of their huge potential brandon kang a 25 year old videographer from california started buying nfts in december and already owns more than 500 in february he spent 50 000 for reflection a digital work by electronic music artist feed me his collection includes digital images of simian heads bored ape a beverage can and a cube as well as an animation of a car driving down a road all of them created by artists little known by the general public he displays them on screens in his house and with few exceptions has no plans to sell them kang has made believers of some of his friends and family members one thing that they thought was cool is the way to verify ownership of these digital nfts it is truly a unique experience he said nfts non fungible tokens are digital objects such as drawings animations pieces of music photos or videos whose authenticity is confirmed by blockchain technology preventing forgeries or manipulation nfts have generated nearly 2 5 billion in sales over the first five months of 2021 based on numbers from the specialized nonfungible website the big auction houses now regularly sell them as sotheby s is doing through june 10 with its natively digital sale the ability to prove the authenticity of nfts was decisive for kang long an investor in cryptocurrencies which rely on the same blockchain technology before he said there was no way to prove and show ownership of digital assets cryptographically not easy to digest it was that same guarantee of authenticity that drove devan mitchem a singapore based cloud engineer to begin collecting digital objects after at first being skeptical because of the inconsistent formats marketplaces and storage options but the emergence of websites like opensea and nifty gateway allowed artists to sell their works directly while enabling collectors to buy store and resell them making the nft world almost as accessible as the stock market mitchem a blockchain specialist with google cloud now owns more than 200 nfts like kang he has no plans to sell them it s risky but i feel works created from 2017 through the lockdowns of 2021 will be remembered as the defining moment of this new category he said this era will hold a special place in future portfolios pankaj patil a computer engineer last year sold some of the 150 digital objects he had acquired fearing for the future of the nft market today this new jersey resident said i definitely regret selling some of them even as he acknowledges that this space is not easy to digest for everyone devan mitchem said he can see why some people might have doubts i can absolutely understand any skepticism he said there are several things to unpack about how nfts work for anyone interested in exploring this new market mitchem offers this advice read up on the philosophies behind blockchains like bitcoin that should make it clear he added that these are global computers not owned by a single entity it s still very much the wild west he said but also a land of opportunity love of art or money kang too urged anyone intrigued by nfts to do their homework before plunging in those who flood in the market without doing their research and not even making an effort to understand nfts he said will be the ones who will most likely be burned he adds that a recent market correction that saw a drop in both average prices and the number of transactions does not in any way threaten the future of nfts we are seeing the space mature and i strongly believe it is good in the long term to remove the people who are purely trying to make profits and are not motivated by love of art he said mitchem like many others insists he is drawn by the artistic value of many young digital creators even if the public image of the nft is largely that of a fad if not an outright fraud he speaks passionately about picasso s bull a cubist depiction of a bull by visual artist trevor jones and which he purchased for 23 000 he calls it a seminal piece nft collectors many of them computer programmers and most of them men say they are also drawn by the constant innovation in the market they foresee a world in which nfts can move between platforms sites and virtual universes unbound by the constraints of the physical world they also insist that the field is reducing its currently catastrophic carbon footprint due to the huge energy demands of underlying cryptocurrencies as it adopts new protocols for nft creation and as less energy intensive cryptocurrencies are developed mitchem is such a firm believer in nfts that he believes the term itself will disappear as the technology becomes commonplace it simply becomes digital media and digital assets he said

dominated the thoughts of the people in the country as the lockdown or travel restrictions was extended till june 14 and the vaccination programme continued in many parts of the country the people who had received the first dose of the astrazeneca vaccine in february march and early april were fraught with worry over how to get their second dose while the state minister of production supply and regulation of pharmaceuticals dr channa jayasumana in a public broadcast this week said that 2 million doses of sinopharm vaccines were due in the country today june 6 and wednesday june 9 another 14 million sputnik v vaccine doses had been secured he said but did not say when they were due adding that 300 000 400 000 pfizer doses were scheduled to arrive in july there was no indication when the 600 000 doses of astrazeneca needed urgently for the second dose would be secured when asked whether sri lanka has seen benefits from the lockdown a high level health official told the sunday times that they would not be visible yet urging every person to take collective responsibility to control the pandemic the health ministryâ s head of the disaster preparedness and response division dr hemantha herath said the results of the travel restrictions have not been seen yet this is because even after implementing restrictions at maximum level it will take an incubation period the number of days between infection and appearance of symptoms of at least 14 days to see the results he however pointed out that compared to the initial few days more and more people and more and more vehicles are being seen outside their homes it is the duty of the public as well as all stakeholders including the business community to ensure that this movement restriction is adhered to dr herath said everyone should act with responsibility and not leave their homes unless absolutely necessary either for essential work or to seek medical treatment â nithiyeng ringala giya kiyala there would be no benefit to the country or to yourself in the long term we will all suffer â he said â â â usually a lockdown needs to be in place for more than one incubation period at least the longer the better but we know that restrictions enforced for long periods have other adverse effects what is required is a â balanceâ between â benefitsâ and â adverse effectsâ unexpected repercussions would be certain if planned â mitigationâ activities are not happening â he said when imposing travel restrictions the most important thing is to ensure that good home delivery services for essentials such as food and medicines are in place stressed this public health expert initially the restriction process was carried out in a relaxed manner with planned relaxation days now the delivery system has picked up reasonably well and those relaxation days have been cancelled this is needed to break the chain of transmission of the virus with the country being in lockdown for a scientifically acceptable period â if we are going beyond this we need to arrange several other mitigation activities as well like the distribution of drugs this is because generally people have medication for two weeks or a month even though the government is trying to mitigate this issue in different ways drug distribution is not happening in a reasonably good way because the postal department involvement is not established yet â he said focusing on â alternative measuresâ dr herath said that people needing treatment for tuberculosis tb are sent drugs to their doorstep once a month in health vehicles but there are only a limited number of tb patients and it may not be feasible to deploy such a system for all patients suffering from non communicable diseases ncds other aspects that need to be looked at closely are the livelihood of daily wage earners and how they are coping need for social distancing he had a strong message for all even after restrictions are eased continue to adhere to preventive measures at the maximum level social distancing is shown to be a good deterrent in the spread of covid 19 â covid 19 spreads only if we get droplets into our body or we touch certain surfaces which have got contaminated by the droplets left behind by a positive person the carrier or vehicle is the human body so we need to stop the movement of the virus through human bodies â he added getting down to testing dr herath said currently it is being maintained at around 20 000 tests â comfortablyâ it can be increased but there are challenges such as machine breakdowns and staff exhaustion â random testing finds only about 25 in colombo city daily vigorous vaccination also onâ around 85 110 positive cases are detected per day the vast majority being first line contacts while random testing detects around 20 25 cases said colombo municipal councilâ s chief medical officer dr ruwan wijayamuni on friday he assured that unlike in the second wave colombo city is not seeing â a rampant wildfireâ sort of spread yet and attributed it partly to the very vigorous vaccination campaign vaccination campaign so far about 190 000 people in colombo city which has about 600 000 people have been vaccinated with either the astrazeneca or sinopharm vaccines therefore 1 3rd of the cityâ s population has got the jab said dr wijayamuni he said that around 98 823 people are awaiting the second dose of the astrazeneca vaccine when these stocks will arrive is the million dollar question the government is trying very hard to get stocks vaccines are available in the international black market but their quality is questionable this is why the government is seeking an assurance from the manufacturer about the maintenance of the cold chain and the authenticity of the product with america hoping to donate vaccines he was hopeful that sri lanka could get some stocks to give the second jab dr wijayamuni and his team are planning to vaccinate everyone who is over 18 years of age by the end of august if they get adequate stocks these could be different types of vaccines â currently we are vaccinating those over 30 years of age but we should ideally be vaccinating those over 18 because they are active and could take the disease home those 60 and above are at high risk of dying but they are basically at home so we have to focus on the economically and physically active age groups â he said

inflation are two months of middling job growth the result of too much of a good thing employers want to hire more than they can or a hint that the labor market isn t as strong as economists think in many ways the news has been cause to cheer the economy grew from january through march at a red hot 6 4 annual pace and in the current quarter that pace is thought to be accelerating to nearly double digits yet the full portrait of the u s economy is a rather more nuanced one here is a closer look at five vital signs ___ jobs employers last month added 559 000 jobs on top of 278 000 in april those would ordinarily be seen as quite healthy numbers yet against the backdrop of record high job openings and free spending consumers forecasters had expected much more hiring some economists had envisioned the recovery from the pandemic recession driving monthly job growth of 800 000 900 000 even 1 million or more what explains the shortfall economists point mainly to what they call a short term mismatch companies are posting job openings faster than applicants can respond after all many americans are contending with considerable tumult at home health issues related to covid 19 child care problems with schools slow to reopen career uncertainty after many jobs permanently vanished over the past 15 months and some people earning more from federal and state jobless aid than they did

occurred late last year after the effects of earlier federal stimulus money began to wear off in addition a monthly survey of consumer confidence by the conference board found that expectations for the next six months actually fell in may i m not sure how this is going to pan out farooqi says ___ inflation financial markets endured an unwelcome jolt last month when the labor department reported that consumer prices had jumped 0 8 from march to april and 4 2 from 12 months earlier the largest year over year increase since 2008 some leading critics including former treasury secretary larry summers have been warning that president joe biden s trillions of dollars in federal stimulus money risk igniting inflation and forcing the federal reserve to resort to interest rate hikes which could derail the economic recovery but fed chair jerome powell and many economists say they think the inflation surge will prove short lived they say it reflects mainly temporary supply chain bottlenecks

reach of many and with the supply of homes for sale severely limited the housing boom has lately shown signs of fatigue home construction tumbled 9 5 in april a drop that economists attributed at

this file photo shows some of the weapons that include handguns rifles shotguns and assault weapons collected in a gun buyback event for the third time in a little more than two years san diego federal judge roger benitez issued a lengthy stinging ruling striking down california gun regulations this time the state s three decade old ban on ownership of assault weapons in a 94 page ruling benitez concluded a suite of state regulations that ban residents from owning assault style rifles was unconstitutional because it violated the second amendment right to bear arms advertisement the order was similar in reasoning and style to two previous rulings benitez has made on challenges to state gun regulations since march 2019 a collective 300 pages chock full of rhetorical flourishes and sprinkled with allusions to comedians cars sales and political thinkers taken together the trio of rulings have demolished large swaths of the state s far reaching gun regulation laws the judge has presided over the cases largely via a quirk in the local rules of san diego s federal court which assigns cases that deal with similar or related legal issues to any judge who has previously handled such a case while many courts have such a rule san diego s rule does not explicitly allow the other side to object to a new case being assigned to a judge with a prior related case after benitez was assigned a fourth gun case under this rule last year state lawyers objected the effort successfully blocked another challenge from gun rights advocates this one to the state regulating what kinds of handguns can be legally sold and owned here from heading to benitez advertisement benitez took senior status at the end of 2018 allowing him to still serve on the bench in a part time capacity greg moran on san diego news fix advertisement his rulings have endeared him to gun rights advocates a thread for second amendment supporters on the message board reddit refers to him as saint benitez and earned the enmity of gun control groups each will find more fodder in the most recent ruling the second amendment protects any law abiding citizen s right to choose to be armed to defend himself his family and his home benitez wrote at the same time the second amendment protects a citizen s right to keep and bear arms to use should the militia be needed to fight against invaders terrorists and tyrants the second amendment is about america s freedom the freedom to protect oneself family home and homeland california s assault weapon ban disrespects that freedom advertisement reaction was swift gov gavin newsom condemned the ruling state attorney general rob bonta vowed an appeal criticizing benitez for issuing the ruling on gun violence awareness day and for likening assault weapons to swiss army knives a perfect combination of home defense weapon and homeland defense equipment the judge wrote in the opening sentence we need to take action to end gun violence now bonta said in a statement we will fight this ruling and continue to advocate for and defend common sense gun laws that will save lives benitez stayed his order for 30 days to allow time for bonta to file an appeal advertisement gun ownership groups hailed benitez s ruling brandon combs head of the firearms policy coalition one of the numerous individuals and groups that filed the suit in 2019 said benitez s ruling was hugely significant in his order judge benitez held what millions of americans already know to be true bans on so called assault weapons are unconstitutional and cannot stand he said in a statement this historic victory for individual liberty is just the beginning and fpc will continue to aggressively challenge these laws throughout the united states state law defined assault weapons as any semiautomatic rifle or pistol that uses a detachable magazine of ammunition guns that have magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition often referred to as high capacity magazines are also included as are weapons with some special features like a folding stock advertisement the state has argued such weapons are more dangerous than other weapons and disproportionately used in mass shootings attacks on law enforcement and other crimes because of that the state said it had a strong public interest in strictly regulating the weapons a key argument needed when a government wishes to restrict a constitutional right benitez s ruling issued late friday was similar to his other rulings in 2019 that wiped out the state s ban on high capacity ammunition clips and another in april 2020 that swept aside a state law requiring background checks for ammunition purchases like the ammunition ruling which summarized in cinematic fashion home invasions where women tried to fight off intruders but ran out of bullets the assault weapons rulings listed a half dozen instances where people defended against intruders with an ar 15 assault style weapon advertisement in the ruling banning background checks benitez supported his arguments with references to science fiction writer ray bradbury essayist george orwell and the comedian rodney dangerfield s signature line that he gets no respect noting the second amendment gets even less respect than he does in friday s ruling benitez again drew unusual comparisons outside of the usual case law reference though there were many of those too in addition to comparing assault style weapons to the swiss army knife he also drew a comparison to the sales of the ford f 150 pickup trucks to buttress his point that the assault rifles are widely popular and not weapons used by a relative handful in 2018 909 330 ford f 150s were sold benitez wrote twice as many modern rifles were sold the same year imagine every time one passes a new ford pickup truck it is a reminder that two new modern rifles have been purchased that is a lot of modern rifles owned by americans advertisement the decisions taken together have a strong through line a vigorous assertion of second amendment rights and lacerating critiques of what benitez has ruled is the state s over reaching to curtail those rights at the expense of law abiding individual gun owners he also has noted that violence is not contained only to gun users rooting his assertion in fbi crime data in friday s ruling he pointed out fbi statistics that show murders by knife in the state occur seven times more often than murder by rifle and a state resident is three times more likely to be murdered by an attacker s bare hands fists or feet than by his rifle that is of little import to gun control groups who were shocked at the most recent benitez ruling said san diego gun violence prevention advocate wendy wheatcroft advertisement i know families whose children were murdered with an ar 15 by his logic very few ar 15s are ever used said wheatcroft a local co lead for moms demand action a national gun violence prevention grassroots organization but when they are used the results are way more deadlier than any type of shooting with a handgun or any type of military weapon it s just incredibly insulting to victims and survivors of gun violence who lost their loved ones to a weapon of this type and it should never be compared to a swiss army knife a swiss army knife in the hands of civilians does not kill dozens of people in one fell swoop but a local plaintiff in the case who is the chief executive of the san diego county gun owners group welcomed the ruling i am happy that the judge agreed that these firearms are not exotic or unusual and that my right to self defense is being violated by this ban said wendy chou hauffen these commonly owned rifles function just like any other firearm advertisement benitez was appointed to the bench in 2003 by then president george w bush but his nomination was controversial the american bar association or aba gave benitez who had served as a state superior court judge and later a federal magistrate judge in el centro before the nomination a rating of not qualified the aba said that it interviewed 67 lawyers and judges who roundly criticized benitez s judicial temperament and courtroom demeanor but his nomination was backed by all the sitting judges in the district at the time and then chief judge marilyn huff went to washington to testify on his behalf he was confirmed with only a single no vote advertisement the appeal bonta vowed on this ruling will join appeals the state has filed on both the high capacity magazine ruling and the background checks with the u s 9th circuit court of appeals in august a three judge panel of the court upheld benitez s ruling in the magazine case the state has asked for a larger panel of judges to rehear the case and a hearing is set for june 22 a panel of 9th circuit judges heard arguments in the background check case in november but has held off taking any action until the magazine case is resolved because some issues in both cases overlap staff

extraordinary story behind the discovery of the world s biggest ever nugget on the australian gold fields and how it changed a man s life before he lost it all bernhardt otto holtermann arrived in australia from his native germany in 1859 holtermann and partner began prospecting for gold at hill end in nsw in 1861 after years of struggle their mine yielded a record 93kg gold specimen in 1872

negatives was found in 1951 it is an iconic image of the australian goldfields seemingly offering proof that hard work and good luck could bring vast wealth for anyone willing to have a go this famous picture of industrious german immigrant bernard holtermann posing with the largest gold nugget ever found is also an elaborate fake while the holtermann gold all 93kg of it was real its part owner was

holtermann s nugget was not really a nugget at all it was a mass of gold quartz and slate broken from a quartz reef correctly called a specimen or matrix it was discovered about 2am on october 19 1872 in the star of hope mine on hawkins hill at hill end about an hour s drive north of bathurst in the central tablelands of new south wales star of hope partners holtermann and louis beyers had struck rich seams of the precious metal the previous year now they had found a wall of gold which brought them almost instant fame and a considerable fortune the 285kg specimen pulled from the mine measured 144 8cm by 66cm by 10 2cm and contained 93kg 3 000 troy ounces of gold which today would be worth more than aud 7million holtermann wanted to buy the specimen outright but his shareholders had already booked time at the local stamper battery for the next week and after being photographed it was crushed and melted down holtermann had a 45cm diameter stained glass window featuring a representation of him with the nugget installed in his sydney home which is now part of church of england grammar school the window is pictured the australian museum holds a replica of the holtermann nugget which was restored in 2017 the museum s collection manager for mineralogy ross pogson is pictured in holtermann s pose his share of the proceeds allowed holtermann to build a mansion at st leonards on sydney s lower north shore with a distinctive square tower overlooking the harbour from the tower holtermann indulged his passion for photography helping take enormous panoramic pictures of sydney which were exhibited around the world he also commissioned a comprehensive photographic record of nsw and victorian goldfields which was uncovered 80 years later when thousands of glass negatives were found in a garden shed holtermann was elected to the nsw parliament and his mansion known as the towers would eventually be subsumed into sydney church of england grammar school better known as shore upon his death the bulletin noted the public knew the bright cheery resolute little german chiefly as a successful goldminer but they were aware of few of the circumstances of his chequered career ere fortune smiled upon him in earnest holtermann s nugget was not really a nugget at all it was a mass of gold quartz and slate broken from a quartz reef correctly called a specimen or matrix holtermann is

holtermann indulged his passion for photography from a distinctive square tower overlooking the harbour holtermann was elected to the nsw parliament and his mansion known as the towers would eventually be subsumed into sydney church of england grammar school better known as shore the tower was encased in brick in 1934 it is pictured in 1940 bernhardt otto holtermann was born in hamburg on april 29 1838 and sailed from his homeland to avoid military service in 1858 arriving in melbourne early the following year after working for several months as a waiter at the hamburg hotel in the city he met polish miner ludwig hugo beyers the pair went prospecting on the hill end tambaroora fields where gold had been discovered in 1851 holtermann and beyers began mining their star of hope claim in 1861 but had little early success their company was listed on the stock exchange and ownership of the mine would expand to eight shareholders forced to try other business ventures holtermann was licensee of the all nations hotel at hill end by 1868 the same year he and beyers married sisters in bathurst rich veins of gold found in star of hope in 1871 were soon exhausted and new partner mark hammond sank a fresh shaft the following year without his partners authority within weeks that shaft hit another gold bearing seam but hammond sold his stake in the mine shortly before the other shareholders struck their real bonanza bernhardt otto holtermann was born in hamburg on april 29 1838 and sailed from his homeland to avoid military service in 1858 arriving in melbourne early the following year before the specimen was crushed holtermann the mine s manager chipped off the tip as a souvenir that chip is now held by history hill museum at hill end near bathurst pictured the largest single mass of gold ever recorded on earth was brought to the surface and holtermann commissioned itinerant photographer beaufoy merlin to capture him next to the find before the specimen was crushed holtermann the mine s manager chipped off the tip as a souvenir five months after holtermann s nugget was found an even larger specimen estimated to contain 155kg 5 000 troy ounces was recorded in the star of hope s day book the miners broke it up underground rather than manhandling another huge rock to the surface where it would be crushed and smelted anyway the second broken mammoth specimen was described in one newspaper report of february 1873 as having been displayed for a week before being crushed holtermann wanted others to share in his wealth and enlisted merlin and his partner charles bayliss to photograph the nsw and victorian goldfields so he could promote australia to the world holtermann and louis beyers began mining their star of hope claim in 1861 but had little early success their company was listed on the stock exchange and ownership of the mine would expand to eight shareholders holtermann left and beyers are pictured a replica of the holtermann specimen left was displayed in the australian museum up until the early 1970s the resin and fibreglass replica was restored in 2017 with gold white and blue grey paint he built a studio for the pair s american australasian photographic company at hill end and set them the task of producing images for what he would bill as holtermann s international travelling exposition the photographic process of the time required coating glass plates with a wet emulsion before use and development immediately afterwards using a portable darkroom merlin and bayliss documented the hill end and gulgong goldfields but merlin died of pneumonia in september 1873 leaving bayliss to finish photographing victoria s gold towns holtermann was now one of the richest men in the colony and gave up prospecting to moved to

attention throughout the colony and was described in the singleton argus as an architectural ornament to the locality in which it is situated and a residence fit for a nobleman the tower was the perfect vantage point from which to realise holtermann s next ambition to photograph the entire magnificence of sydney for an international audience with bayliss he made enormous glass plate negatives which measured 152cm by 91cm and began photographing the harbour and surrounding suburbs perched in the tower holtermann and bayliss completed a 9 78m panorama comprised of 23 images which holterman claimed formed the largest photograph in the world it was awarded a bronze medal at the 1876 centennial exhibition in philadelphia where holtermann sold copies and presented lectures on the

sacramento calif ap a federal judge has overturned california s three decade old ban on assault weapons calling it a failed experiment that violates people s constitutional right to bear arms u s district judge roger benitez of san diego ruled on friday that the state s definition of illegal military style rifles unlawfully deprives law abiding californians of weapons commonly allowed in most other states and by the u s supreme court under no level of heightened scrutiny can the law survive benitez said he issued a permanent injunction against enforcement of the law but stayed it for 30 days to give state attorney general rob bonta time to appeal gov gavin newsom condemned the decision calling it a direct threat to public safety and the lives of innocent californians period in his 94 page ruling the judge spoke favorably of modern weapons and said they were overwhelmingly used for legal reasons like the swiss army knife the popular ar 15 rifle is a perfect combination of home defense weapon and homeland defense equipment good for both home and battle the judge said in his ruling s introduction that comparison completely undermines the credibility of this decision and is a slap in the face to the families who ve lost loved ones to this weapon newsom said in a statement we re not backing down from this fight and we ll continue pushing for common sense gun laws that will save lives bonta called the ruling flawed and said it will be appealed california first restricted assault weapons in 1989 with multiple updates to the law since then assault weapons as defined by the law are more dangerous than other firearms and are disproportionately used in crimes mass shootings and against law enforcement with more resulting casualties the state attorney general s office argued and barring them furthers the state s important public safety interests a surge in sales of more than 1 16 million other types of pistols rifles and shotguns in the last year more than a third of them to likely first time buyers show that the assault weapons ban has not prevented law abiding citizens in the state from acquiring a range of firearms for lawful purposes including self defense the state contended in a court filing in march similar assault weapon restrictions have previously been upheld by six other federal district and appeals courts the state agued overturning the ban would allow not only assault rifles but things like assault shotguns and assault pistols state officials said but benitez disagreed this case is not about extraordinary weapons lying at the outer limits of second amendment protection the banned assault weapons are not bazookas howitzers or machine guns those arms are dangerous and solely useful for military purposes his ruling said instead the firearms deemed assault weapons are fairly ordinary popular modern the judge said despite california s ban there currently are an estimated 185 569 assault weapons registered with the state they were grandfathered in before california s evolving definition of an assault weapon this is an average case about average guns used in average ways for average purposes the ruling said one is to be forgiven if one is persuaded by news media and others that the nation is awash with murderous ar 15 assault rifles the facts however do not support this hyperbole and facts matter in california murder by knife occurs seven times more often than murder by rifle he added he also called the ban a continuing failed experiment which does not achieve its objectives of preventing mass shootings or attacks on law enforcement officers in a preliminary ruling in september benitez said california s complicated legal definition of assault weapons can ensnare otherwise law abiding gun owners with criminal penalties that among other things can strip them of their second amendment right to own firearms the burden on the core second amendment right if any is minimal the state argued because the weapons can still be used just not with the modifications that turn them into assault weapons modifications like a shorter barrel or collapsible stock make them more concealable state officials said while things like a pistol grip or thumbhole grip make them more lethal by improving their accuracy as they are fired rapidly the lawsuit filed by the san diego county gun owners political action committee california gun rights foundation second amendment foundation and firearms policy coalition is among several by gun advocacy groups challenging california s firearms laws which are among the strictest in the nation it was filed on behalf of gun owners who want to use high capacity magazines in their legal rifles or pistols but said they can t because doing so would turn them into illegal assault weapons under california law unlike military weapons the semi automatic rifles fire one bullet each time the trigger is pulled and the plaintiffs say they are legal in 41 states the lawsuit said california is one of only a small handful states to ban many of the most popular semiautomatic firearms in the nation because they possess one or more common characteristics such as pistol grips and threaded barrels frequently but not exclusively along with detachable ammunition magazines brandon combs the president of the firearms policy coalition said in a statement that the ruling held what millions of americans already know to be true bans on so called assault weapons are unconstitutional and cannot stand a gun control advocacy group called the judge s ruling alarming and especially insulting because it was handed down on national gun violence awareness day too many families across the nation have lost loved ones in shootings carried out with assault weapons they can attest to the reality that these weapons are not like swiss army knives nor are mass shootings only a very small problem said robyn thomas executive director of the giffords law center to prevent gun violence a group led by gabrielle giffords the former congresswoman from arizona who was shot and wounded in a mass shooting 10 years ago the state is appealing benitez s 2017 ruling against the state s nearly two decade old ban on the sales and purchases of magazines holding more than 10 bullets that decision triggered a weeklong buying spree before the judge halted sales during the appeal it was upheld in august by a three judge appellate panel but the 9th u s circuit court of appeals said in march that an 11 member panel will rehear the case the state also is appealing benitez s decision in april 2020 blocking a 2019 california law requiring background checks for anyone buying ammunition both of those measures were championed by newsom when he was lieutenant governor and they were backed by voters in a 2016 ballot measure

gerrity s offers sign on bonuses as tight labor market felt in nepa it s no secret that around the nation many businesses are struggling to find staff and while the reasons are multifaceted a quick look at the comments you ll likely see under this article on our website will show some believe it s because nobody wants to work anymore while others will argue it s being caused by a reevaluation of american labor the problem remains many positions are going unfilled joe fasula co owner of the scranton based gerrity s supermarket chain said it s a problem all of his stores are experiencing the only comfort is knowing that we re not alone he said during a phone interview this week related video as an associated press report pointed out employers last month added 559 000 jobs on top of 278 000 in april those would ordinarily be seen as quite healthy numbers the ap added yet against the backdrop of record high job openings and free spending consumers some economists had envisioned the recovery from the pandemic recession driving monthly job growth of 800 000 900 000 even 1 million or more and that comes as businesses of all kinds are working to meet a burst of customer demand from americans who are no longer cooped up at home and who in many cases still have stimulus cash to spend gerrity s sign on bonuses fasula believes that as of right now at least the staffing issues won t be noticeable to customers but he s concerned that they could be soon especially as we approach the time of year where people take vacations fasula said that his company is looking largely for skilled positions such as butchers bakers cake decorators and other more specific workers with less of a focus on more generalized positions a grocery store has we could probably hire about 100 people today he said thankfully it s not affecting what the customer sees in terms of service everyone is working very hard we just want to stay ahead of it at this point in the conversation fasula took a moment away from the phone call to help a customer find an item on the store shelves the solution then is a sign on bonus it s a technique that a lot of businesses both here locally and nationwide have begun to employ hoping to attract workers by offering a bit of a bonus for joining the team at gerrity s anyone who signs on between may 31 and sept 12 will be eligible for up to 600 in bonuses anyone hired in that time will receive 500 as a bonus after the completion of their first 90 days on the job and they ll be eligible for an extra 100 bonus should they have perfect attendance at the end of those 90 days fasula said that these bonuses are available at all of his stores especially considering there s need at all of them every single store has needs in every department he said but he did acknowledge that the west pittston store is especially hurting for help wages rising gerrity s is not alone in offering incentives to potential employees average hourly wages rose solidly over the past two months the ap noted 0 5 in may on top of a 0 7 increase in april last month s wage growth was especially impressive considering that 52 of the added jobs came from the traditionally low wage leisure and hospitality sector the ap added noting that large chains including amazon walmart costco and chipotle have begun raising pay so too have local and regional employers consider gina schaefer who owns 13 ace hardware stores in maryland virginia and washington d c and who has been rapidly staffing up for the spring and summer when her sales typically hit highs schaefer has hired nearly 120 people since march both seasonal workers and long delayed replacements for people who left last year when covid ravaged the economy the ap pointed out her company pays a minimum of 15 50 an hour to compete with larger chains that now pay 15 and provides health insurance paid vacation sick leave and a 401 k plan after employees have been on the job for about six months we firmly believe that better workplaces do not have a problem finding employees schaefer told the ap rising wages have been seen in several sectors for nonsupervisory workers in leisure and hospitality including restaurants and hotel employees hourly wages rose 1 2 last month from april and 8 8 from a year ago construction workers benefiting from a housing boom enjoyed a 4 4 wage increase in may compared with a year earlier amid a surge in online shopping and deliveries transportation and warehouse workers received an average 3 5 hourly wage increase over the previous 12 months supply chain issues labor shortages affect businesses at almost every level of operation things exploded it was like a light switch said kirby mallon president of elmer schultz services a family owned philadelphia firm that repairs and maintains kitchen equipment for restaurants and other clients the labor market is just out of control we literally cannot hire technicians we ramped up so quickly the supply chain wasn t ready for it mallon told the associated press here in northeastern pennsylvania fasula feels the pinch of the labor shortage when the store is making orders there are a lot of items that are consistently out of stock he said on any given week 10 to 20 of our orders are out of stock fasula said that these difficulties in the stores getting goods are also caused by the consistent struggles to find workers there are simply holes in the supply chain he explained as of right now he said that the shortages are far away from being a crisis if your preferred brand or variety of a certain item is out of stock there is almost always something you can swap it out with but it is still a problem unemployment benefits an issue during the phone conversation this week fasula echoed a frequently cited concern that the cause of the labor shortage is being caused by the increased unemployment benefits that have been offered since the beginning of the pandemic benefits that are largely coming to an end nationwide it does appear to be more complicated than that though with recent reporting from the new york times going so far as to call the labor shortage largely a myth when a company is struggling to find enough labor it can solve the problem by offering to pay a higher price for the labor also known as higher wages writes times reporter david leonhardt more workers will then enter the labor market suddenly the labor shortage will be no more in fact wages are historically low nationwide the new york times says with worker compensation for their labor being lower than at any other point in the second half of the 20th century meanwhile company profits nationwide continue to skyrocket that so many are complaining about the situation is not a sign that something is wrong with the american economy the times piece ends it is a sign that corporate executive have grown so accustomed to a low wage economy that many believe anything else is unnatural regardless of the root cause of the labor shortage two distinct facts remain many companies need workers and many people don t have a job experts also advise patience however as supply and demand catch up with each other in a growing economy all these employers put up help wanted signs at the same time noted mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics it s taking a few weeks for workers to take the jobs in may the number of americans on temporary layoff dropped by an additional 291 000 to 1 8 million down 90 from a staggering 18 million in april 2020 the ap explained even people who lost their old jobs permanently made progress last month the number of such people dropped by 295 000 in may to 3 2 million but that is still up 59 from 2 million in april 2020 nearly 3 8 million americans about 41 of the jobless have been out of work for six months or more the ap added careerlink s role the times leader spoke with christine m jensen administrator of the wilkes barre office of pa careerlink about what could be done regardless of which of those two broad groups you might fall into jensen believes that careerlink can be a great help whether you need employees or employment i think employers need to be using all of their resources to recruit and quite frankly this was true before the pandemic she said according to her careerlink can help employers out with on the job training for their prospective employees along with even reimbursement of training in some of those positions additionally careerlink can help people seeking jobs identify where they might be the best fit we can work with them to help them find where those high priority jobs are she said explaining that careerlink can also provide assistance for tuition for job seekers who need training and jensen acknowledged that right now it might be a good time for employers to craft their salaries to be a bit more competitive we do have labor market information available to employers if they want to see what the average rate is for the job she said if an employer is concerned am i competitive am i paying a competitive rate they could ask us you wanna be competitive she said you need to know what the average wage is so you can be competitive jensen said that she thinks a lot of people aren t aware of just how much pa careerlink can help so she suggested that both job seekers and those seeking job seekers contact their local office the associated press contributed to this report

sacramento a federal judge on friday overturned california s three decade old ban on assault weapons ruling that it violates the constitutional right to bear arms us district judge roger benitez of san diego ruled that the state s definition of illegal military style rifles unlawfully deprives law abiding californians of weapons commonly allowed in most other states and by the us supreme court under no level of heightened scrutiny can the law survive benitez said he issued a permanent injunction against enforcement of the law but stayed it for 30 days to give state attorney general rob bonta time to appeal gov gavin newsom condemned the decision calling it a direct threat to public safety and the lives of innocent californians period in his 94 page ruling the judge spoke favorably of modern weapons said they were overwhelmingly used for legal reasons like the swiss army knife the popular ar 15 rifle is a perfect combination of home defense weapon and homeland defense equipment good for both home and battle the judge said in his ruling s introduction that comparison completely undermines the credibility of this decision and is a slap in the face to the families who ve lost loved ones to this weapon newsom said in a statement were not backing down from this fight and well continue pushing for common sense gun laws that will save lives bonta called the ruling flawed and said it will be appealed california first restricted assault weapons in 1989 with multiple updates to the law since then assault weapons as defined by the law are more dangerous than other firearms and are disproportionately used in crimes mass shootings and against law enforcement with more resulting casualties the state attorney generals office argued and barring them furthers the states important public safety interests further a surge in sales of more than 1 16 million other types of pistols rifles and shotguns in the last year more than a third of them to likely first time buyers show that the assault weapons ban has not prevented law abiding citizens in the state from acquiring a range of firearms for lawful purposes including self defence the state contended in a court filing in march similar assault weapon restrictions have previously been upheld by six other federal district and appeals courts the state argued overturning the ban would allow not only assault rifles but things like assault shotguns and assault pistols state officials said but benitez disagreed this case is not about extraordinary weapons lying at the outer limits of second amendment protection the banned assault weapons are not bazookas howitzers or machine guns those arms are dangerous and solely useful for military purposes his ruling said despite california s ban there currently are an estimated 185 569 assault weapons registered with the state the judge said this is an average case about average guns used in average ways for average purposes the ruling said one is to be forgiven if one is persuaded by news media and others that the nation is awash with murderous ar 15 assault rifles the facts however do not support this hyperbole and facts matter in california murder by knife occurs seven times more often than murder by rifle he added in a preliminary ruling in september benitez said california s complicated legal definition of assault weapons can ensnare otherwise law abiding gun owners with criminal penalties that among other things can strip them of their second amendment right to own firearms the burden on the core second amendment right if any is minimal the state argued because the weapons can still be used just not with the modifications that turn them into assault weapons modifications like a shorter barrel or collapsible stock make them more concealable state officials said while things like a pistol grip or thumbhole grip make them more lethal by improving their accuracy as they are fired rapidly the lawsuit filed by the san diego county gun owners political action committee california gun rights foundation second amendment foundation and firearms policy coalition is among several by gun advocacy groups challenging california s firearms laws which are among the strictest in the nation the lawsuit filed in august 2019 followed a series of deadly mass shootings nationwide involving military style rifles published in dawn june 6th 2021

violates the constitutional right to bear arms u s district judge roger benitez of san diego ruled friday june 4 2021 that the state s definition of illegal military style rifles unlawfully deprives law abiding californians of weapons commonly allowed in most other states ap photo damian dovarganes file sacramento calif ap a federal judge has overturned california s three decade old ban on assault weapons calling it a failed experiment that violates people s constitutional right to bear arms u s district judge roger benitez of san diego ruled on friday that the state s definition of illegal military style rifles unlawfully deprives law abiding californians of weapons commonly allowed in most other states and by the u s supreme court under no level of heightened scrutiny can the law survive benitez said he issued a permanent injunction against enforcement of the law but stayed it for 30 days to give state attorney general rob bonta time to appeal gov gavin newsom condemned the decision calling it a direct threat to public safety and the lives of innocent californians period in his 94 page ruling the judge spoke favorably of modern weapons and said they were overwhelmingly used for legal reasons like the swiss army knife the popular ar 15 rifle is a perfect combination of home defense weapon and homeland defense equipment good for both home and battle the judge said in his ruling s introduction that comparison completely undermines the credibility of this decision and is a slap in the face to the families who ve lost loved ones to this weapon newsom said in a statement we re not backing down from this fight and we ll continue pushing for common sense gun laws that will save lives bonta called the ruling flawed and said it will be appealed california first restricted assault weapons in 1989 with multiple updates to the law since then assault weapons as defined by the law are more dangerous than other firearms and are disproportionately used in crimes mass shootings and against law enforcement with more resulting casualties the state attorney general s office argued and barring them furthers the state s important public safety interests a surge in sales of more than 1 16 million other types of pistols rifles and shotguns in the last year more than a third of them to likely first time buyers show that the assault weapons ban has not prevented law abiding citizens in the state from acquiring a range of firearms for lawful purposes including self defense the state contended in a court filing in march similar assault weapon restrictions have previously been upheld by six other federal district and appeals courts the state argued overturning the ban would allow not only assault rifles but things like assault shotguns and assault pistols state officials said but benitez disagreed this case is not about extraordinary weapons lying at the outer limits of second amendment protection the banned assault weapons are not bazookas howitzers or machine guns those arms are dangerous and solely useful for military purposes his ruling said instead the firearms deemed assault weapons are fairly ordinary popular modern the judge said despite california s ban there currently are an estimated 185 569 assault weapons registered with the state they were grandfathered in before california s evolving definition of an assault weapon this is an average case about average guns used in average ways for average purposes the ruling said one is to be forgiven if one is persuaded by news media and others that the nation is awash with murderous ar 15 assault rifles the facts however do not support this hyperbole and facts matter in california murder by knife occurs seven times more often than murder by rifle he added he also called the ban a continuing failed experiment which does not achieve its objectives of preventing mass shootings or attacks on law enforcement officers in a preliminary ruling in september benitez said california s complicated legal definition of assault weapons can ensnare otherwise law abiding gun owners with criminal penalties that among other things can strip them of their second amendment right to own firearms the burden on the core second amendment right if any is minimal the state argued because the weapons can still be used just not with the modifications that turn them into assault weapons modifications like a shorter barrel or collapsible stock make them more concealable state officials said while things like a pistol grip or thumbhole grip make them more lethal by improving their accuracy as they are fired rapidly the lawsuit filed by the san diego county gun owners political action committee california gun rights foundation second amendment foundation and firearms policy coalition is among several by gun advocacy groups challenging california s firearms laws which are among the strictest in the nation it was filed on behalf of gun owners who want to use high capacity magazines in their legal rifles or pistols but said they can t because doing so would turn them into illegal assault weapons under california law unlike military weapons the semi automatic rifles fire one bullet each time the trigger is pulled and the plaintiffs say they are legal in 41 states the lawsuit said california is one of only a small handful states to ban many of the most popular semiautomatic firearms in the nation because they possess one or more common characteristics such as pistol grips and threaded barrels frequently but not exclusively along with detachable ammunition magazines brandon combs the president of the firearms policy coalition said in a statement that the ruling held what millions of americans already know to be true bans on so called assault weapons are unconstitutional and cannot stand a gun control advocacy group called the judge s ruling alarming and especially insulting because it was handed down on national gun violence awareness day too many families across the nation have lost loved ones in shootings carried out with assault weapons they can attest to the reality that these weapons are not like swiss army knives nor are mass shootings only a very small problem said robyn thomas executive director of the giffords law center to prevent gun violence a group led by gabrielle giffords the former congresswoman from arizona who was shot and wounded in a mass shooting 10 years ago the state is appealing benitez s 2017 ruling against the state s nearly two decade old ban on the sales and purchases of magazines holding more than 10 bullets that decision triggered a weeklong buying spree before the judge halted sales during the appeal it was upheld in august by a three judge appellate panel but the 9th u s circuit court of appeals said in march that an 11 member panel will rehear the case the state also is appealing benitez s decision in april 2020 blocking a 2019 california law requiring background checks for anyone buying ammunition both of those measures were championed by newsom when he was lieutenant governor and they were backed by voters in a 2016 ballot measure

charms which come in hundreds of styles and pop into the clog s ventilation holes record profits followed driving crocs shares up 300 since last year the company expects another sales spurt this year from 40 to 50 to as much as 2 1 billion with this revival they ve strengthened their board completely rotated the executive management team and simplified what they stand for which is the classic clog

antimicrobial and easy to clean and they were comfortable all 200 prototypes sold out word spread quickly sales tripled between 2006 and 2007 as the company underwent a rapid multimillion dollar expansion buying up four companies in three years its success was far reaching and bipartisan president george w bush wore crocs as did former first lady michelle obama then came the great recession

all its stores it got attention for giving away more than 910 000 pairs of crocs to front line health care workers the way shoppers buy and wear the shoe has changed too online sales have exploded and crocs have become even more of a vessel for personal expression sales of its jibbitz line which includes plastic charms shaped like cheese boards rainbows and winnie the pooh for about 5 a pop more than doubled in the most recent quarter crocs has simplified the shoe so it s a blank canvas said murphy of piper sandler and now they re layering on elements color print and collaborations that make

psychographic change comfort is cool and the pandemic has helped this you don t need to your foot into a teeny tiny heel anymore rees acknowledges the skeptics but he says their ridicule has been critically important to the success of crocs when fashion designer victoria beckham received a pair of crocs from bieber in april she took to instagram to say she d rather die than wear them to us that s not a failure rees said that s a win it creates conversation it creates media it creates attention and that s really good for the brand midas mitchell used to think crocs looked like ugly nurse shoes but the pandemic had him itching for a change and a new way to express himself the 34 year old recently bought his first pair of gray clogs and outfitted them with nearly a dozen charms with phrases such as no justice no peace and i am black history with everyone wearing masks it s harder to make a first impression said mitchell a small business owner in richmond va now when i walk into a room with my crocs it s a conversation starter if there s anything the brand has demonstrated it s staying power and now with today s teenagers and 20 somethings within its grip analysts say crocs has set itself up for an extended reign when you strike a chord with gen z that s very powerful murphy said crocs she added are the eighth most popular brand among u s teenagers up from 38 in 2017 according to a piper sandler survey there are other opportunities for growth too including the company s burgeoning sandal business and international markets including china which last year accounted for less than 5 of overall sales and europe where british vogue recently declared crocs the season s it shoe the brand s popularity has spawned copycat clogs including a 35 version by u s a dawgs which has been involved in litigation with crocs since 2012 more recently kanye west s adidas yeezy foam runner which sells for about 80 has been dubbed the yeezy croc because of its resemblance to the slip on clog kelley the 27 year old in chicago got her first pair of crocs during the pandemic and decorated them with avocado mushroom strawberry and pride pins she can t quite describe their appeal other than that they re comfortable easy to slip on and off and well reliable kind of like subaru she said i don t want to say it s a cult but subaru people love subarus there s this base of loyal customers who say wow we re really into this this is our thing and that s what crocs has become the pandemic analysts say has accelerated the shift toward comfort and nostalgia reviving not just crocs but many other styles including mom jeans tie dyed t shirts and teva sandals that had previously been deemed frumpy and dated i resisted for a long time but during the pandemic i realized there s no reason to keep my feet squished up said traci franssen 39 of richmond va who wore gold crocs to her october wedding reception my toes can finally breathe karli christ 17 wore hers to prom last

gerrity s offers sign on bonuses as tight labor market felt in nepa it s no secret that around the nation many businesses are struggling to find staff and while the reasons are multifaceted a quick look at the comments you ll likely see under this article on our website will show some believe it s because nobody wants to work anymore while others will argue it s being caused by a reevaluation of american labor the problem remains many positions are going unfilled joe fasula co owner of the scranton based gerrity s supermarket chain said it s a problem all of his stores are experiencing the only comfort is knowing that we re not alone he said during a phone interview this week as an associated press report pointed out employers last month added 559 000 jobs on top of 278 000 in april those would ordinarily be seen as quite healthy numbers the ap added yet against the backdrop of record high job openings and free spending consumers some economists had envisioned the recovery from the pandemic recession driving monthly job growth of 800 000 900 000 even 1 million or more and that comes as businesses of all kinds are working to meet a burst of customer demand from americans who are no longer cooped up at home and who in many cases still have stimulus cash to spend gerrity s sign on bonuses fasula believes that as of right now at least the staffing issues won t be noticeable to customers but he s concerned that they could be soon especially as we approach the time of year where people take vacations fasula said that his company is looking largely for skilled positions such as butchers bakers cake decorators and other more specific workers with less of a focus on more generalized positions a grocery store has we could probably hire about 100 people today he said thankfully it s not affecting what the customer sees in terms of service everyone is working very hard we just want to stay ahead of it at this point in the conversation fasula took a moment away from the phone call to help a customer find an item on the store shelves the solution then is a sign on bonus it s a technique that a lot of businesses both here locally and nationwide have begun to employ hoping to attract workers by offering a bit of a bonus for joining the team at gerrity s anyone who signs on between may 31 and sept 12 will be eligible for up to 600 in bonuses anyone hired in that time will receive 500 as a bonus after the completion of their first 90 days on the job and they ll be eligible for an extra 100 bonus should they have perfect attendance at the end of those 90 days fasula said that these bonuses are available at all of his stores especially considering there s need at all of them every single store has needs in every department he said but he did acknowledge that the west pittston store is especially hurting for help wages rising gerrity s is not alone in offering incentives to potential employees average hourly wages rose solidly over the past two months the ap noted 0 5 in may on top of a 0 7 increase in april last month s wage growth was especially impressive considering that 52 of the added jobs came from the traditionally low wage leisure and hospitality sector the ap added noting that large chains including amazon walmart costco and chipotle have begun raising pay so too have local and regional employers consider gina schaefer who owns 13 ace hardware stores in maryland virginia and washington d c and who has been rapidly staffing up for the spring and summer when her sales typically hit highs schaefer has hired nearly 120 people since march both seasonal workers and long delayed replacements for people who left last year when covid ravaged the economy the ap pointed out her company pays a minimum of 15 50 an hour to compete with larger chains that now pay 15 and provides health insurance paid vacation sick leave and a 401 k plan after employees have been on the job for about six months we firmly believe that better workplaces do not have a problem finding employees schaefer told the ap rising wages have been seen in several sectors for nonsupervisory workers in leisure and hospitality including restaurants and hotel employees hourly wages rose 1 2 last month from april and 8 8 from a year ago construction workers benefiting from a housing boom enjoyed a 4 4 wage increase in may compared with a year earlier amid a surge in online shopping and deliveries transportation and warehouse workers received an average 3 5 hourly wage increase over the previous 12 months supply chain issues labor shortages affect businesses at almost every level of operation things exploded it was like a light switch said kirby mallon president of elmer schultz services a family owned philadelphia firm that repairs and maintains kitchen equipment for restaurants and other clients the labor market is just out of control we literally cannot hire technicians we ramped up so quickly the supply chain wasn t ready for it mallon told the associated press here in northeastern pennsylvania fasula feels the pinch of the labor shortage when the store is making orders there are a lot of items that are consistently out of stock he said on any given week 10 to 20 of our orders are out of stock fasula said that these difficulties in the stores getting goods are also caused by the consistent struggles to find workers there are simply holes in the supply chain he explained as of right now he said that the shortages are far away from being a crisis if your preferred brand or variety of a certain item is out of stock there is almost always something you can swap it out with but it is still a problem unemployment benefits an issue during the phone conversation this week fasula echoed a frequently cited concern that the cause of the labor shortage is being caused by the increased unemployment benefits that have been offered since the beginning of the pandemic benefits that are largely coming to an end nationwide it does appear to be more complicated than that though with recent reporting from the new york times going so far as to call the labor shortage largely a myth when a company is struggling to find enough labor it can solve the problem by offering to pay a higher price for the labor also known as higher wages writes times reporter david leonhardt more workers will then enter the labor market suddenly the labor shortage will be no more in fact wages are historically low nationwide the new york times says with worker compensation for their labor being lower than at any other point in the second half of the 20th century meanwhile company profits nationwide continue to skyrocket that so many are complaining about the situation is not a sign that something is wrong with the american economy the times piece ends it is a sign that corporate executive have grown so accustomed to a low wage economy that many believe anything else is unnatural regardless of the root cause of the labor shortage two distinct facts remain many companies need workers and many people don t have a job experts also advise patience however as supply and demand catch up with each other in a growing economy all these employers put up help wanted signs at the same time noted mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics it s taking a few weeks for workers to take the jobs in may the number of americans on temporary layoff dropped by an additional 291 000 to 1 8 million down 90 from a staggering 18 million in april 2020 the ap explained even people who lost their old jobs permanently made progress last month the number of such people dropped by 295 000 in may to 3 2 million but that is still up 59 from 2 million in april 2020 nearly 3 8 million americans about 41 of the jobless have been out of work for six months or more the ap added careerlink s role the times leader spoke with christine m jensen administrator of the wilkes barre office of pa careerlink about what could be done regardless of which of those two broad groups you might fall into jensen believes that careerlink can be a great help whether you need employees or employment i think employers need to be using all of their resources to recruit and quite frankly this was true before the pandemic she said according to her careerlink can help employers out with on the job training for their prospective employees along with even reimbursement of training in some of those positions additionally careerlink can help people seeking jobs identify where they might be the best fit we can work with them to help them find where those high priority jobs are she said explaining that careerlink can also provide assistance for tuition for job seekers who need training and jensen acknowledged that right now it might be a good time for employers to craft their salaries to be a bit more competitive we do have labor market information available to employers if they want to see what the average rate is for the job she said if an employer is concerned am i competitive am i paying a competitive rate they could ask us you wanna be competitive she said you need to know what the average wage is so you can be competitive jensen said that she thinks a lot of people aren t aware of just how much pa careerlink can help so she suggested that both job seekers and those seeking job seekers contact their local office the associated press contributed to this report

turned its polarizing crayon colored shoes into a hip even glamorous statement sales have skyrocketed during the pandemic up more than 60 the past quarter as the brand expands its reach to toddlers trendy teens and their grandparents the resurgence analysts say stems from a new management team and scrappy reinvention that includes collaborations with celebrities designers even fast food chains generating buzz on instagram and tiktok crocs overhauled its business to focus on its classic clog which now makes up nearly three quarters of sales and doubled down on its highly profitable jibbitz charms which come in hundreds of styles and pop into the clog s ventilation holes record profits followed driving crocs shares up 300 since last year the company expects another sales spurt this year from 40 to 50 to as much as 2 1 billion with this revival they ve strengthened their board completely rotated the executive management team and simplified what they stand for which is the classic clog said erinn murphy an analyst at piper sandler some people love them some hate them but it s what they re known for and they ve really leaned into it a recent collaboration with singer justin bieber 70 lavender crocs adorned with chipmunk and teddy bear charms quickly sold out crocs also partnered with balenciaga on an 850 platform clog kfc on a 60 fried chicken print shoe with drumstick charms and disney pixar for a 50 homage to the cars films that lights up next a hidden valley ranch themed shoe studded with french fries veggie sticks and pizza it sold out in presales even celebrities without

pink crocs their playbook isn t terribly different from what a lot of other brands are doing using key influencers to post on social media but crocs has done it extraordinary well said jay sole an analyst for ubs they ve made the brand cool again now crocs are turning up at weddings in boardrooms on the runway even the academy awards where questlove sported a gold pair in april i became a believer in quarantine last year the 50 year old roots drummer and tonight show bandleader said in an instagram post saying he s tired of suffering while stunting comfort first at this stage in my life moony hernandez 25 started wearing crocs black with metal spikes and chains to be ironic she said much like she sometimes dons anime streetwear or bunny ears but now she rotates through five pairs including a fuzzy lime green set and the five inch platforms with sparkles and spikes on the job in austin texas where she works in tech support she s known as the croc girl there s nowhere i wouldn t wear my crocs she said i would wear them to the met gala crocs debuted nearly 20 years ago at a florida boat show the clunky shoes which sold for about 30 a pair were quick drying antimicrobial and easy to clean and they were comfortable all 200 prototypes sold out word spread quickly sales tripled between 2006 and 2007 as the company underwent a rapid multimillion dollar expansion buying up four companies in three years its success was far reaching and bipartisan president george w bush wore crocs as did former first lady michelle obama then came the great recession demand fell sharply and sales cratered leading to 185 million in losses in 2008 alone the brand teetered near bankruptcy while its stock once valued at 75 a share fell to less than 1 it is now trading closer to 100 in 2013 blackstone group invested 200 million in the broomfield colo company and kicked off a massive turnaround effort it closed 75 of u s stores and scrapped golf shoes high heels and other products it deemed a distraction it also closed the last of its manufacturing plants in 2018 outsourcing production in hopes of increasing profits the company had lost track of its customer said chief executive andrew rees who took the helm in 2017 we had to focus on being democratic we know our consumer could be 70 they could be 15 and we need to communicate with all of them in the places that they go to the company dropped television commercials and print ads shifting its entire marketing budget online and doubled down on social media when the pandemic forced the company to shutter all its stores it got attention for giving away more than 910 000 pairs of crocs to front line health care workers the way shoppers buy and wear the shoe has changed too online sales have exploded and crocs have become even more of a vessel for personal expression sales of its jibbitz line which includes plastic charms shaped like cheese boards rainbows and winnie the pooh for about 5 a pop more than doubled in the most recent quarter crocs has simplified the shoe so it s a blank canvas said murphy of piper sandler and now they re layering on elements color print and collaborations that make the brand sizzle murphy who lives in houston says she s been surprised by how often she sees people wearing crocs it s a diverse crowd and more than i ve ever seen she said there s been a psychographic change comfort is cool and the pandemic has helped this you don t need to your foot into a teeny tiny heel anymore rees acknowledges the skeptics but he says their ridicule has been critically important to the success of crocs when fashion designer victoria beckham received a pair of crocs from bieber in april she took to instagram to say she d rather die than wear them to us that s not a failure rees said that s a win it creates conversation it creates media it creates attention and that s really good for the brand midas mitchell used to think crocs looked like ugly nurse shoes but the pandemic had him itching for a change and a new way to express himself the 34 year old recently bought his first pair of gray clogs and outfitted them with nearly a dozen charms with phrases such as no justice no peace and i am black history with everyone wearing masks it s harder to make a first impression said mitchell a small business owner in richmond va now when i walk into a room with my crocs it s a conversation starter if there s anything the brand has demonstrated it s staying power and now with today s teenagers and 20 somethings within its grip analysts say crocs has set itself up for an extended reign when you strike a chord with gen z that s very powerful murphy said crocs she added are the eighth most popular brand among u s teenagers up from 38 in 2017 according to a piper sandler survey there are other opportunities for growth too including the company s burgeoning sandal business and international markets including china which last year accounted for less than 5 of overall sales and europe where british vogue recently declared crocs the season s it shoe the brand s popularity has spawned copycat clogs including a 35 version by u s a dawgs which has been involved in litigation with crocs since 2012 more recently kanye west s adidas yeezy foam runner which sells for about 80 has been dubbed the yeezy croc because of its resemblance to the slip on clog kelley the 27 year old in chicago got her first pair of crocs during the pandemic and decorated them with avocado mushroom strawberry and pride pins she can t quite describe their appeal other than that they re comfortable easy to slip on and off and well reliable kind of like subaru she said i don t want to say it s a cult but subaru people love subarus there s this base of loyal customers who say wow we re really into this this is our thing and that s what crocs has become the pandemic analysts say has accelerated the shift toward comfort and nostalgia reviving not just crocs but many other styles including mom jeans tie dyed t shirts and teva sandals that had previously been deemed frumpy and dated i resisted for a long time but during the pandemic i realized there s no reason to keep my feet squished up said traci franssen 39 of richmond va who wore gold crocs to her october wedding reception my toes can finally breathe karli christ 17 wore hers to prom last month with a sparkly red ball gown her date though declined his parents told him crocs were stupid for prom she said the recent high school graduate has been reaching for the brand s signature clog

in tallmadge ohio but i ve always been one to pick comfort over fashion moony hernandez 25 sports a pair of her crocs in austin texas mary kang for the washington post
the media has played up the upcoming with all the sturm und drang that can be mustered however investors and other market participants seem considerably less anxious and for a good reason at the end of the day it does not really matter that much since the ecb stepped up its bond purchases the euro yields and premiums over germany have risen but of course there are other drivers of the capital markets and that is the point even though the is often quoted to the hundredth a cent the 6 6 trillion a day average turnover is not so exacting that what turns out to be a few billion euros of bond buying a week makes much of a difference the same general argument applies to the bond market as well the more important issue that has yet to be fully recognized is that the ecb s pandemic emergency

british drama but it also reflected a broader development of economic nationalism on the one hand and the hardening of the eu s external walls on the other switzerland formally withdrew from talks to codify its 120 more or less bilateral agreements into one single framework in bern it was a victory for the right wing populist party svp yet it is the tip of the proverbial iceberg two years ago swiss equity markets lost the right to service eu investors since the middle of last month swiss companies have been stockpiling some goods such as medical equipment and industrial machinery due to

absorbed in h2 22 which opens the door to a move since the last meeting the has led the major currencies higher with a gain of about 3 4 the market has discounted almost 60 bp in tightening by the end of next year this seems too aggressive canada s disappointed for the second month in a row ahead of the weekend canada announced it shed some 68k jobs in may which was more than twice as many as the median forecast in bloomberg s survey anticipated it lost 207k positions in april canada has lost nearly 145k full time jobs in april may overall this year canada has grown less than 75k jobs while not backtracking on its april assessment the bank of canada can emphasize the uncertainty and variability of the re opening of the economy and that patience is needed which could help extend the consolidation correction phase a few emerging market central banks meet and aside from russia they are wrestling with the same vexing issue price pressures are rising and are well above the policy rates but the economies still need support peru s presidential run off is on june 6 since the end of april the peru has fallen by about 1 8 making it the weakest of the emerging market currencies after the turkish s 4 3 decline incidentally chile holds elections in november the chilean has performed only slightly better than the sol since the end of april and is the third weakest of the

peso limited the reaction in the foreign exchange market poland s is rising like and the 4 8 year over year twice the rate seen as recently as february while the policy rate is a lowly 10 bp a move at

11 it has hiked rates by a total of over 75 bp at the past two meetings to bring its key rate to 5 00 is rising it stood at 5 5 in april and is expected to have moved closer to 6 in may a 25 bp hike is expected and the risk of a 50 bp move is greater than the risk of its standing pat despite prices rising more than a third this year the has risen a modest 2 25 against the dollar the correlation rolling 60 day of the change in the ruble and the change in price peaked a year ago near 0 66 it has been near 0 20 for the past 60 days last but not least in the week ahead both the us and china report may cpi figures us cpi is still accelerating but the good news is the base effect peaked last month in may 2020 the headline and core measures of us cpi fell by 0 1 they are expected to be replaced in the 12 month measures by a 0 4 increase in both this will lift the year over year rate to around and for the headline and core rate in 2020 the headline cpi rose by 0 5 in both june and july as these drop the year over year pace will likely stabilize and maybe even slip a bit the core rate rose by 0 2 last june and 0 5 last july we quickly add two caveats first the fed does not target cpi but the pce deflator although officials talk about the rate the target applies to the rate second fed officials recognize that temporary and technical factors are behind the price pressures and will look past the near term rise words like temporary and even the fed s use of average as in target of the average inflation rate are very slippery and have not been defined while this allows the fed maximum flexibility it is not entirely satisfactory to investors and businesses china s consumer inflation bottomed at the end of the last year but deflationary pressures were still evident in january and february when cpi was still below zero year over year even though on a month over month basis china s cpi fell by 0 5 and 0 3 in march and april respectively the year over year pace accelerated from 0 2 in february to 0 9 in april prices are expected to have accelerated to a year over year pace in may that would be the highest since last september one eye catching development is that food price inflation has calmed last august food prices had risen by 11 2 on a year over year basis non food prices rose by 0 1 fast forward to april and food prices were off 0 7 year over year while non food prices had risen by 1 3 the inflationary threat does not come from china s consumer prices but its producer prices with the single exception of january 2020 chinese producer prices fell on a year over year basis from mid 2019 through the end of 2020 on the other hand us producer prices rose by 1 0 2 0 year over year in h2 19 the deflation in producer prices was experienced in april through august last year still the driver was not so much in china per se as the economic consequence of the disruption and shutdowns related to covid some observers are concerned that the rise in china s will fuel higher us cpi it is possible but doubtful first americans like others from high income countries spend more on services than goods services typically are not commodity intensive second the biggest components of cpi are health medical related and shelter which also do not appear to be driven by the commodities third even many of the goods consumers purchase tend not to be raw material intensive surely this is true of most electronic products e g computers cell phones what about an auto you ask the direct raw material costs are estimated at around 3k indeed peter drucker identified the decoupling of the commodity economy from the industrial economy as a key feature of the modern economy back in foreign affairs in 1987 he would not be surprised nor should we that while chinese producer prices were falling from mid 2019 us consumer prices were rising at a 1 7 2 5 year over year rate until the pandemic struck the yawning gap in china between consumer and producer prices may say something about the profit margins of some chinese companies or the risk of stronger consumer inflation still it does not appear to say very much about consumer prices in the us
a weekend cyberattack on the world s largest meat processor won t have an immediate effect on u s prices analysts said on the heels of an announcement that the company plans to restart production on wednesday but if the suspension across jbs usa s five plants continues for more than a week then consumers could expect to pay a little more for a t bone steak jbs closed slaughter plants in the u s canada and australia on sunday after learning it was the target of a cybersecurity attack on its servers according to the company the sudden move rocked the industry after the three day holiday weekend and sparked a flurry of speculation of a possible beef and pork shortage that might send prices skyrocketing in the coming weeks but by tuesday evening the brazil based company said that many of its systems were already coming back online given the progress our it professionals and plant teams have made in the last 24 hours the vast majority of our beef pork poultry and prepared foods plants will be operational tomorrow said andre nogueira jbs usa ceo we are not sparing any resources to fight this threat we have cybersecurity plans in place to address these types of issues and we are successfully executing those plans nogueira said he added that the massive disruption did not succeed in crippling the company s shipping operations saying the company was able to ship product from nearly all of its facilities to supply customers even without cyberattacks the meat market is a volatile industry the u s is already in the midst of near record high meat prices due to soaring demand that has been compounded by the pandemic said alton kalo chief economist at steiner consulting group last year many of the nation s slaughterhouses and meat processing plants halted operations as factory workers became sick with the coronavirus the unpredictability introduced a new kind of volatility in prices that hadn t really been seen before kalo said added to that he said there was a huge spike in demand for meat as more and more people cooked at home as a result he noted even small changes will have repercussions the two day jbs closure wiped out nearly a fifth of the nation s beef pork and poultry production he explained additionally the usda on tuesday reported a 22 decline in beef and roughly 19 5 decline in pork which kalo said pretty much coincided with the jbs sized production hole in the market so you can see there is an impact but in terms of long term it ll depend on whether the jbs issue is a one day or two day problem kalo said it is going to be very different if it goes on for a week or more typically he said when there is a brief shortage in supply retailers are not inclined to make dramatic price changes because that could have unintended consequences on consumer behavior that s when they may just absorb the hit or smooth it out over time wholesalers are also reeling after the ransomware attack john fried general manager of canyon wholesale provisions in los angeles said it would be a huge relief if jbs resolves the issue quickly but he seemed a bit skeptical on monday afternoon he noted the chaos that ensued after the recent ransomware attack on the colonial pipeline just a few weeks ago that took a while to figure out and look what happened fried said gas stations in the southeastern u s were hit by motorists panic buying gasolinein anticipation of shortages i mean if this goes on for any length of time it s going to be horrible he said adding that the family owned business always has orders in the pipeline to jbs any interruption in deliveries he said could be detrimental to the shops and restaurants that rely on him they re just opening back up after more than a year of mandated covid 19 closures a spot of good news he remarked is that his company relies on several meat processors which might provide a short term solution for alternative sources from which to stock the warehouse but he concluded they will likely feel the full impact of a shortage in a matter of days too fried also wondered about the long term financial impact on his company should jbs decide to give in to the attackers demands and pay the ransom as colonial reportedlydid who pays for that in the end fried asked copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

collectors of digital nfts see a wild west market worth the risk technology collectors of digital nfts see a wild west market worth the risk nfts non fungible tokens are digital objects whose authenticity is confirmed by blockchain tech 06 june 2021 08 12 am new york afp they are technology enthusiasts on the hunt for opportunities in the wild west market surrounding nfts the popular certified digital objects that have spawned a new generation of collectors convinced of their huge potential brandon kang a 25 year old videographer from california started buying nfts in december and already owns more than 500 in february he spent 50 000 for reflection a digital work by electronic music artist feed me his collection includes digital images of simian heads bored ape a beverage can and a cube as well as an animation of a car driving down a road all of them created by artists little known by the general public he displays them on screens in his house and with few exceptions has no plans to sell them kang has made believers of some of his friends and family members one thing that they thought was cool is the way to verify ownership of these digital nfts it is truly a unique experience he said nfts non fungible tokens are digital objects such as drawings animations pieces of music photos or videos whose authenticity is confirmed by blockchain technology preventing forgeries or manipulation nfts have generated nearly 2 5 billion in sales over the first five months of 2021 based on numbers from the specialized nonfungible website the big auction houses now regularly sell them as sotheby s is doing through june 10 with its natively digital sale the ability to prove the authenticity of nfts was decisive for kang long an investor in cryptocurrencies which rely on the same blockchain technology before he said there was no way to prove and show ownership of digital assets cryptographically not easy to digest it was that same guarantee of authenticity that drove devan mitchem a singapore based cloud engineer to begin collecting digital objects after at first being skeptical because of the inconsistent formats marketplaces and storage options but the emergence of websites like opensea and nifty gateway allowed artists to sell their works directly while enabling collectors to buy store and resell them making the nft world almost as accessible as the stock market mitchem a blockchain specialist with google cloud now owns more than 200 nfts like kang he has no plans to sell them it s risky but i feel works created from 2017 through the lockdowns of 2021 will be remembered as the defining moment of this new category he said this era will hold a special place in future portfolios pankaj patil a computer engineer last year sold some of the 150 digital objects he had acquired fearing for the future of the nft market today this new jersey resident said i definitely regret selling some of them even as he acknowledges that this space is not easy to digest for everyone devan mitchem said he can see why some people might have doubts i can absolutely understand any skepticism he said there are several things to unpack about how nfts work for anyone interested in exploring this new market mitchem offers this advice read up on the philosophies behind blockchains like bitcoin that should make it clear he added that these are global computers not owned by a single entity it s still very much the wild west he said but also a land of opportunity love of art or money kang too urged anyone intrigued by nfts to do their homework before plunging in those who flood in the market without doing their research and not even making an effort to understand nfts he said will be the ones who will most likely be burned he adds that a recent market correction that saw a drop in both average prices and the number of transactions does not in any way threaten the future of nfts we are seeing the space mature and i strongly believe it is good in the long term to remove the people who are purely trying to make profits and are not motivated by love of art he said mitchem like many others insists he is drawn by the artistic value of many young digital creators even if the public image of the nft is largely that of a fad if not an outright fraud he speaks passionately about picasso s bull a cubist depiction of a bull by visual artist trevor jones and which he purchased for 23 000 he calls it a seminal piece nft collectors many of them computer programmers and most of them men say they are also drawn by the constant innovation in the market they foresee a world in which nfts can move between platforms sites and virtual universes unbound by the constraints of the physical world they also insist that the field is reducing its currently catastrophic carbon footprint due to the huge energy demands of underlying cryptocurrencies as it adopts new protocols for nft creation and as less energy intensive cryptocurrencies are developed mitchem is such a firm believer in nfts that he believes the term itself will disappear as the technology becomes commonplace it simply becomes digital media and digital assets he said
the thirsty mule isn t chickening out making wings dine in only at the oakland restaurant and bar is strictly a business decision one of the number of approaches taken by local businesses in reaction to a perceived nationwide scarcity and sky high prices for chicken wings that means wings can no longer be ordered for take out due to a lack of profitability my rationale is if you re going to get wings which i m not going to make a ton of money on you re going to wash it down with something that i pour thirsty mule owner matt borman said another local bar and restaurant has canceled its wing night while other places can t even order wings and are feeling the heat from customers complaining as menu prices increase as wholesale food costs continue to increase across the board chicken wings are one of the most curious cases for central maine restaurants according to the united states department of agriculture s economic research service wholesale poultry prices were predicted to have increased between 13 16 last month due to high feed cost increased demand and changes in the supply chain in general wholesale prices are typically far more volatile than consumer prices in reaction to market supply and demand poultry price increases outpaced those of beef 1 5 4 5 cattle 5 8 and pork 8 15 11 5 tom super spokesperson for the nonprofit washington d c based national chicken council cautioned using the term shortage to describe the current situation as a bit of a stretch after production of broiler chickens those raised for meat was down approximately 4 during the first quarter production picked up in april with year over year weekly production increases since april 10 advertisement as for wings specifically super said southern chicken producers endured setbacks during an unusual and powerful february winter storm the storm happened right after the super bowl an annual time of high demand further chicken wings were a 287 more popular order in 2020 than 2019 according to grubhub s annual year in food study it will take time and effort to eventually replace the impacted hatchery supply flocks in that region but supply should catch back up to demand soon super said so as high as demand is for wings right now even small gaps in the supply of wings can cause big fluctuations in price bottom line wing demand has been and remains high he continued each chicken only has two wings and producers don t raise chickens just for the wings they have to sell all of the other parts as well university of kentucky meat scientist gregg rentfrow believes there is a wing shortage due to an infertility issue at chicken farms across the country rentfrow expects prices of chickens to normalize by summer s end the chicken industry is so vertically integrated and they had an issue with infertility and i believe tyson was the one rentfrow said the other thing is we re getting vaccinated and restaurants are opening up so that makes for a big issue with the chicken population and chicken processing for local bars and restaurants like the thirsty mule chicken wing demand follows with national trends increasing in february around the time of the super bowl with that prices go up advertisement this year was no different with a 40 pound case costing a not great 88 around super bowl time borman said instead of a normal regression in the following weeks prices skyrocketed the cost for a case of wings from sysco now hovers around 160 and just one case was available for ordering this week some more drastic wing inspired measures were taken including at you know whose pub on waterville s main street the business outright canceled its 75 cent wing wednesdays according to a staff member stavros kosmidis owner of waterville house of pizza can t even order chicken wings from his main distributor u s foods it s crazy kosmidis said so for now waterville house of pizza is using portland based micucci wholesale foods for its wings instead of paying approximately 130 for 20 pounds of chicken kosmidis now pays over 200 buffalo wings are hard to find as are mozzarella sticks and jalapeño poppers rita lacroix owns rita s house of pizza in winslow and is the co owner of unity house of pizza both restaurants sell wings but pizza is the focus nonetheless lacroix orders from three vendors to keep a stock of chicken wings paying nearly double the prices for wings and chicken tenders prices have been raised on those items a bit to cover the cost of the food not for more profit advertisement related read all of our coverage on how coronavirus is affecting maine the distributors told me it was coming down the line about a month ago because the processing plants do not have the staffing they need to process the chicken lacroix said anything that s processed breaded cut they re having issues with lacroix said a customer recently gave a staff member a hard time for the prices being raised from what is advertised on the menu it s either raise the prices or cut the item she said the latter is not feasible because of their popularity pizza is the winslow business s specialty but they do sell approximately 100 pounds of wings per week we re in a pandemic folks lacroix said we can t give it away we have to at least make back what we re paying at the two cent pub in winslow wings are purchased locally at emery s meat and produce in gardiner fresh wings purchased at the consumer rate are grilled instead of friend because they have no hood system or fryolator the last time the two cent pub owner stacy barnes purchased wings she paid 4 a pound the pub normally does a wing special wednesdays during slower nights and are not always a part of the menu we ll continue to have them because they re an item we run on special barnes said i m sure we ll bring them back but i m not sure what night of the week it ll be back at the thirsty mule wing preparation is a labor intensive process each wing is grilled between 30 45 minutes and cooked twice not dumped in a fryolator they also make sides of blue cheese and ranch dressing from scratch wings prices at the restaurant are up to almost 2 per wing and instead of an annual price increase they ve gone up multiple times over the last few months to make it a worthwhile menu item while seemingly everything is going up in price are wings the most drastic example at the thirsty mule probably borman said yeah send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

the u s economy is sparking confusion and whiplash almost as fast as it s adding jobs barely more than a year after the coronavirus caused the steepest economic fall and job losses on record the speed of the rebound has been so unexpectedly swift that many companies can t fill jobs or acquire enough supplies to meet a pent up burst of customer demand things exploded it was like a light switch said kirby mallon president of elmer schultz services a family owned philadelphia firm that repairs and maintains kitchen equipment for restaurants and other clients the labor market is just out of control we literally cannot hire technicians we ramped up so quickly the supply chain wasn t ready for it economic forecasters with little historical precedent to guide them through the aftermath of a global

consumer spending reflect economic strength and resiliency or has it been temporarily propped up by federal stimulus checks was an april run up in consumer prices a temporary blip or an ominous sign of accelerating inflation are two months of middling job growth the result of too much of a good thing employers want to hire more than they can or a hint that the labor market isn t as strong as economists think in many ways the news has been cause to cheer the economy grew from january through march at a red hot 6 4 annual pace and in the current quarter that pace is thought to be accelerating to nearly double digits yet the full portrait of the u s economy is a rather more nuanced one here is a closer look at five vital signs ___ jobs employers last month added 559 000 jobs on top of 278 000 in april those would ordinarily be seen as quite healthy numbers yet against the backdrop of record high job openings and free spending consumers forecasters had expected much more hiring some economists had envisioned the recovery from the pandemic recession driving monthly job growth of 800 000 900 000 even 1 million or more what explains the shortfall economists point mainly to what they call a short term mismatch companies are posting job openings faster than applicants can respond after all many americans are contending with considerable tumult at home health issues related to covid 19 child care problems with schools slow to reopen career uncertainty after many jobs permanently vanished over the past 15 months and some people earning more from federal and state jobless aid than they did when they worked are taking their time before pursuing another job some say the labor shortage is nothing that can t be solved the old fashioned way by raising pay and offering more generous benefits and working conditions in fact that process appears to have begun average hourly wages rose solidly in april and may consider gina schaefer who owns 13 ace hardware

employees she said ___ consumers after months cooped up at home millions of consumers have rushed back out again in buoyant spirits and eager to spend their finances bolstered by 1 400 federal stimulus payments earlier this year among the affluent sharp gains in home and stock market equity have further emboldened their impulse to spend consumer confidence is high and americans stepped up their spending again in april after a powerful gain in march fueled by 1 400 stimulus checks to most individuals that said rubeela farooqi chief u s economist at high frequency economics sees cautionary signs confidence and spending though still healthy have trended lower and retail sales were flat in april after having surged in march suggesting that the positive effect of the stimulus checks might have faded similar trends occurred late last year after the effects of earlier federal stimulus money began to wear off in addition a monthly survey of consumer confidence by the conference board found that expectations for the next six months actually fell in may i m not sure how this is going to pan out farooqi says ___ inflation financial markets endured an unwelcome jolt last month when the labor department reported that consumer prices had jumped 0 8 from march to april and 4 2 from 12 months earlier the largest year over year increase since 2008 some leading critics including former treasury secretary larry summers have been warning that president joe biden s trillions of dollars in federal stimulus money risk igniting inflation and forcing the federal reserve to resort to interest rate hikes which could derail the economic recovery but fed chair jerome powell and many economists say they think the inflation surge will prove short lived they say it reflects mainly temporary supply chain bottlenecks that have forced up prices but that should ease over time for now though shortages of lumber computer chips and other materials have contributed to inflation

economic strength and resilience during the pandemic supported by ultra low mortgage rates and the desire of many locked down families to move to more spacious digs to accommodate work from home needs but with prices having risen beyond the reach of many and with the supply of homes for sale severely limited the housing boom has lately shown signs of fatigue home construction tumbled 9 5 in april a drop that economists attributed at least in part to builders postponing projects because of accelerating costs for lumber and other supplies that have contributed to swelling home prices in april

brad stone a senior editor at bloomberg news is now the author of a second book length portrait of what may be the most successful business of the 21st century when stone s first book the everything store was published in 2013 amazon founder jeff bezos was worth a piddling 27bn that number has risen to 190bn 70 more than he had at the beginning of the pandemic in a decade amazon has exploded into an exaggerated version of engulf devour the hydra headed conglomerate invented by mel brooks once upon a time only barnes noble was threatened by amazon in the realm of online bookselling now amazon has disrupted everything from department stores and supermarkets to hollywood movie production and even space travel bezos best act of citizenship was undoubtedly his rescue and resuscitation of the washington post one of america s great newspapers and from which unlike every other business to which he is connected he has remained admirably detached his business triumphs include the invention of the alexa virtual assistant and his company s hugely profitable computer cloud so successful that he tried for years to hide its earnings to stop google and others realizing what a rich business it was but amazon has also fought unions in every country where it owns a warehouse sought billions in tax breaks and reduced stock opportunities for hourly workers even as bezos trumpeted their raise to a minimum of 15 an hour stone acknowledges that bezos gigantic wealth raises unsettling questions about the asymmetric distribution of money and power with a market capitalization exceeding 1 5tn amazon embodies everything that is great and terrible about the modern world it has become a referendum on the responsibilities that large companies have toward their employees and the sanctity of our fragile plane bezos is either propelling the world into an exciting future or helping to blot out free enterprise itself most of this very readable book is devoted to bezos s triumphs it is undeniable that he has taken synergy and brand building in directions no one else ever thought of for example many colleagues were skeptical when amazon began to invest billions of dollars a year in prime video but bezos realized it not only helped retain prime customers a vital source of revenue but also enhanced his other brands when we win a golden globe we sell more shoes he explained on the other hand the only things that seemed to prod him to improve the conditions of his blue collar workers were periodic media exposés when one of his executives proposed a modest investment to air condition his warehouses bezos dismissed the idea as too costly but then the morning call of allentown pennsylvania reported that workers were passing out in the lehigh valley warehouse then being transported to the hospital by ambulances the company kept waiting outside only then did bezos approve 52m for air conditioning establishing a pattern of making changes only after he read criticism in the media as stone puts it amazon is dominating so many different businesses it has finally inspired a renewed interest in antitrust law in america and europe a student lina khan played a key role when she published a 93 page article in the yale law journal khan pointed out that unlike previous monopolies whose market share created unnecessarily high prices for consumers the main damage amazon has done has come from the relentless lowering of prices in order to bleed out competitors and amass market share view image in fullscreen lina khan nominee for commissioner of the federal trade commission arrives for a confirmation hearing on capitol hill photograph saul loeb afp getty images khan was hired by house subcommittee on antitrust which ultimately forced bezos to testify before congress his appearance featured this memorable question from lucy mcbath a democrat from georgia if amazon didn t have monopoly power over these sellers do you think they would stay in a relationship that is characterized by bullying fear and panic bezos rejected the premise of the question but it inspired stone to interview several third party sellers who originally praised amazon s contributions to small businesses many had changed their minds paul saunders a seller of high quality housewares and a former amazon booster now reported that rising fees increasingly expensive advertizing and direct competition from amazon basic had gutted his profits the congressional committee uncovered the same practices and made a persuasive case that the big tech platforms arbitrarily and self interestedly controlled our political discourse our financial lives and the health of countless smaller companies there is a clear and compelling need for a antitrust enforcement to take action that restores competition the committee concluded and in hopeful sign that joe biden is listening he nominated khan to be a commissioner on the federal trade commission amazon is now so unpopular democrats and republicans on the senate commerce committee joined to approve her nomination
superman is probably the most famous fictional character in the world from australia to algeria to alaska from toddlers to seniors most people know who superman is what most people don t know however is that he s a jewish character created in the 1930s by two jewish high schoolers in cleveland jerry siegel and joe shuster the man of steel or champion of the oppressed as he was first known was a reaction formation to the rise of nazism in europe and antisemitism at home jerry siegel and joe shuster 1942 as original as the first superhero was siegel and shuster drew inspiration from a variety of sources in their cultural orbit including jewish faith and folklore they gave him the origin story of moses a baby saved in a small vessel sent adrift to the unknown raised by people not his own becoming in adulthood a mighty miracle working savior they gave him the strength and drive for truth and justice of samson the mighty judge they made him an indestructible defender of the innocent like the golem of prague and they sent him to fight nazis in comics and in real life in his comic books superman served as a grassroots propaganda figure for jewish interests promoting british rearmament intervention in the war refugee asylum and the new deal but mostly he cathartically punched nazis in the face while the character s boosterism has been noted often little has been made of just how effective he was in raising the nazis ire and how personal the feud became in the february 27 1940 issue of the popular magazine look superman openly declared war on hitler and stalin who were still allies then almost two years before pearl harbor and america s involvement in the war in the specially commissioned two page story how superman would end the war he breaks through the siegfried line twisting nazi cannons into knots tearing open concrete barricades and swatting the luftwaffe and in short order reaches hitler s retreat lifting the führer by the throat he declares i d like to land a strictly non arian sock on your jaw but there s no time for that he then flies to russia to grab stalin and drags the dictators by the scruff of their necks to geneva to stand trial for war crimes superman s choice of words is noteworthy he proclaims he s strictly non arian even though he s the ideal of arian physiognomy broad frame square jaw cleft chin sharp small nose and deep blue eyes and yet it was important to siegel and shuster to make clear that their avatar was something else not one of them but one of us the story was printed in shades of red white and gray making superman appear barelegged it only added to hitler s ignominy being slapped around by a man in briefs it was great wish fulfillment but ultimately superman was just a kid s comic book character he didn t matter except that he did to the nazis on april 25 das schwarze korps the black corps the official newspaper of the ss published a full page tirade accusing superman of being a conspiracy to brainwash american children with false jewish values like compassion for the weak and defense of the innocent jerry siegel an intellectually and physically circumcised chap who has his headquarters in new york advertised widely superman s sense of justice well suited for imitation by the american youth who must live in such a poisoned atmosphere and don t even notice the poison they swallow daily several accounts attribute the article directly to josef goebbels and a popular story in the press at the time also claimed goebbels had a conniption about superman in the middle of a reichstag meeting either way the article was widely reported on in the states the german american bund also sent joe shuster hate mail and picketed dc comics offices siegel and shuster didn t publically respond to either instead they did what they did best strike in fiction in superman 25 super spoof geezer a popular comic book superhero with the same powers as the real superman dressed in an orange barelegged costume a reference to his discoloration in look manages to infuriate the nazis the comic s artist henry jones is an exaggerated shuster lookalike short scrawny sharp nosed bespectacled and nebbishy also fitting the jewish stereotype in general infuriated that geezer comics have made hitler the laughing stock of the world the nazis try to kill jones with different ploys which superman keeps thwarting but when jones is kidnapped by nazi agents it s not superman who comes to the rescue instead he swoops in to save the day dressed like geezer getting justice vindication and a final insult at the same time it s a delightful layering of mimesis superman embodied his creators wishful selves taking the place here of his own in comic pastiche to protect shuster s stand in in a story that s a response to the ss article which was a reaction to the look story art imitating life imitating art and back again the two jewish youths personal war with the vaunted master race didn t end there superman continued to fight and humiliate nazis in his comics while in the real world his popularity became so great that the u s government used him to promote enlistment blood donations paper and metal drives and war stamps and bonds sales to great success and once the u s joined the war with 8 million servicemen reading comics regularly superman essentially became regulation equipment tanks jeeps boats and planes were named after him and decorated with his image an entire air force bomb squadron made him its official insignia with american forces carrying his comics in their pocket and his image on their vehicles superman and through him siegel and shuster were right there on the frontlines fighting nazis
the u s economy is sparking confusion and whiplash almost as fast as it s adding jobs barely more than a year after the coronavirus caused the steepest economic fall and job losses on record the speed of the rebound has been so unexpectedly swift that many companies can t fill jobs or acquire enough supplies to meet a pent up burst of customer demand things exploded it was like a light switch said kirby mallon president of elmer schultz services a family owned philadelphia firm that repairs and maintains kitchen equipment for restaurants and other clients the labor market is just out of control we literally cannot hire technicians we ramped up so quickly the supply chain wasn t ready for it economic forecasters with little historical precedent to guide them through the aftermath of a global pandemic are pondering questions they can t answer with any confidence get south florida local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc south florida newsletters does robust consumer spending reflect economic strength and resiliency or has it been temporarily propped up by federal stimulus checks was an april run up in consumer prices a temporary blip or an ominous sign of accelerating inflation are two months of middling job growth the result of too much of a good thing employers want to hire more than they can or a hint that the labor market isn t as strong as economists think in many ways the news has been cause to cheer the economy grew from january through march at a red hot 6 4 annual pace and in the current quarter that pace is thought to be accelerating to nearly double digits yet the full portrait of the u s economy is a rather more nuanced one here is a closer look at five vital signs ___ jobs employers last month added 559 000 jobs on top of 278 000 in april those would ordinarily be seen as quite healthy numbers yet against the backdrop of record high job openings and free spending consumers forecasters had expected much more hiring some economists had envisioned the recovery from the pandemic recession driving monthly job growth of 800 000 900 000 even 1 million or more what explains the shortfall economists point mainly to what they call a short term mismatch companies are posting job openings faster than applicants can respond after all many americans are contending with considerable tumult at home health issues related to covid 19 child care problems with schools slow to reopen career uncertainty after many jobs permanently vanished over the past 15 months and some people earning more from federal and state jobless aid than they did when they worked are taking their time before pursuing another job some say the labor shortage is nothing that can t be solved the old fashioned way by raising pay and offering more generous benefits and working conditions in fact that process appears to have begun average hourly wages rose solidly in april and may consider gina schaefer who owns 13 ace hardware stores in maryland virginia and washington d c and who has been rapidly staffing up for the spring and summer when her sales typically hit highs schaefer has hired nearly 120 people since march both seasonal workers and long delayed replacements for people who left last year when covid ravaged the economy her company pays a minimum of 15 50 an hour to compete with larger chains that now pay 15 and provides health insurance paid vacation sick leave and a 401 k plan after employees have been on the job for about six months we firmly believe that better workplaces do not have a problem finding employees she said ___ consumers after months cooped up at home millions of consumers have rushed back out again in buoyant spirits and eager to spend their finances bolstered by 1 400 federal stimulus payments earlier this year among the affluent sharp gains in home and stock market equity have further emboldened their impulse to spend consumer confidence is high and americans stepped up their spending again in april after a powerful gain in march fueled by 1 400 stimulus checks to most individuals that said rubeela farooqi chief u s economist at high frequency economics sees cautionary signs confidence and spending though still healthy have trended lower and retail sales were flat in april after having surged in march suggesting that the positive effect of the stimulus checks might have faded similar trends occurred late last year after the effects of earlier federal stimulus money began to wear off in addition a monthly survey of consumer confidence by the conference board found that expectations for the next six months actually fell in may i m not sure how this is going to pan out farooqi says ___ inflation financial markets endured an unwelcome jolt last month when the labor department reported that consumer prices had jumped 0 8 from march to april and 4 2 from 12 months earlier the largest year over year increase since 2008 some leading critics including former treasury secretary larry summers have been warning that president joe biden s trillions of dollars in federal stimulus money risk igniting inflation and forcing the federal reserve to resort to interest rate hikes which could derail the economic recovery but fed chair jerome powell and many economists say they think the inflation surge will prove short lived they say it reflects mainly temporary supply chain bottlenecks that have forced up prices but that should ease over time for now though shortages of lumber computer chips and other materials have contributed to inflation pressures mallon at elmer schultz services in philadelphia said supply shortages are so severe in his industry that members of the the commercial food equipment service association trade group are sharing inventory i can go to a friend if he has a part in stock he said in my 30 years in the business no i ve never seen anything like it ___ housing the housing market has served as a source of economic strength and resilience during the pandemic supported by ultra low mortgage rates and the desire of many locked down families to move to more spacious digs to accommodate work from home needs but with prices having risen beyond the reach of many and with the supply of homes for sale severely limited the housing boom has lately shown signs of fatigue home construction tumbled 9 5 in april a drop that economists attributed at least in part to builders postponing projects because of accelerating costs for lumber and other supplies that have contributed to swelling home prices in april sales of new homes dropped nearly 6 and purchases of existing homes fell 2 7 many would be buyers will remain on the outside looking in as long as a shortage of available homes keeps sale prices elevated ___ manufacturing u s factories are thriving despite the clogged supply chains and the shortage of workers the institute for supply management s manufacturing index rose to 61 2 last month any reading above 50 signals growth and manufacturers have been on a 12 month winning streak half the purchasing managers surveyed by the trade association said they had had trouble finding workers given the supply problems it s unclear whether factories can sustain their steady output the ism found that deliveries from suppliers were coming in at their slowest rate since 1974 sixteen of 18 industries reported slower deliveries ___ ap business writers christopher rugaber in washington and joyce m rosenberg in new york contributed to this report ___ this story was first published on june

the us medicines regulator has postponed its announcement on whether sa can release its johnson johnson vaccine doses from aspen s gqeberha plant the announcement has been postponed from friday 4 june to the week of 7 june south africa may receive an additional 480 000 johnson johnson doses but only if the us regulator finds it to be uncontaminated the 480 000 doses will expire on 28 june and will be used to vaccinate staff at schools instead of healthcare workers and people over 60 education staff will not receive johnson johnson j j covid 19 vaccinations in the week of 7 june even if 480 000 doses which j j offered south africa as a replacement for some of the country s potentially contaminated jabs arrive in the country next week whether and when the shipment arrives depends on the outcome of an investigation by the united states medicines regulator the food and drug administration fda the fda needs to determine whether this batch too was contaminated with ingredients of astrazeneca s covid 19 shot says nicholas crisp the deputy director general in the health department who is managing the distribution of covid 19 vaccines some of j j and astrazeneca s key ingredients are manufactured in the same factory belonging to a company that the fda is investigating for substandard pharmaceutical practices and potential cross contamination of ingredients if the consignment of nearly half a million j j doses is cleared by the fda it will only arrive in south africa by mid to late next week with an expiry date of 28 june because it was the only stock available the shots would therefore have to be used within a couple of weeks at this stage covid 19 vaccines have an average lifespan of about six months why have south africa s j j doses not been released south africa has procured 31 million doses of the j j vaccine of which at least the first two batches of 1 1 million and 900 000 cannot be released before the fda has concluded its investigation why not the vaccine vials in these batches were filled in south africa at the drug company aspen s gqeberha plant but with key ingredients also known as active pharmaceutical ingredients apis manufactured at the baltimore factory of emergent biosolutions a company that j j has contracted to produce the api for its vaccine in march the fda inspected emergent biosolutions production facility and found the conditions to be unsanitary and pharmaceutical practices to be of an unsatisfactory standard the regulator established that a batch of 15 million doses of apis for j j s vaccine had been contaminated with some of the ingredients of astrazeneca s vaccine that was manufactured at the same factory and therefore ruled that emergent biosolutions had to discard the doses as a precautionary measure the fda stopped all j j production at emergent biosolutions pending the outcome of its investigation and an evaluation of measures taken by the company to improve its pharmaceutical practices the fda also decided to analyse all batches of the j j apis which were manufactured during the same period as the march batch that emergent biosolutions had to do away with crisp says the regulator is examining four batches south africa s j j vaccine at aspen were made with apis from all of these batches the fda was expected to make an announcement on friday about whether it found any of the four batches of apis to have been contaminated and whether doses made with them could therefore be released or not the regulator however sent a memo to the affected countries on thursday that it would now only make an announcement in the week of 7 june the delay is due to a final inspection of emergent biosolutions that was supposed to have been conducted on wednesday but was then postponed to friday the affected countries include south africa canada and several countries in europe none of them can currently release any vaccines manufactured with apis from the batches being investigated why are there now an additional 480 000 jabs and why will teachers instead of people of 60 and older get them the additional 480 000 j j doses which were scheduled to arrive in south africa over the weekend if the apis it was manufactured with had been cleared by the fda in time was a bridging consignment says crisp in case some of the already manufactured doses at aspen couldn t be released because the fda found them to be contaminated we wanted to ensure that we look at all possible scenarios and plan around them so that we have a plan for each potential scenario he says if our vaccines at aspen had been cleared we would still have had the consignment shipped to us and paid for the vaccines as an add on to our current 31 million doses crisp says because this consignment of the vaccine will soon expire and because when they started making plans for the shipment the health department didn t yet know the fda s decision about whether our doses at aspen could be released or not they had to consider a route other than community distribution vaccinations at national rollout sites a route that addressed scale and turnaround time currently only healthcare workers and people 60 years and older qualify to be vaccinated as part of south africa s national rollout other groups will only qualify once most of the current group has received jabs if we set up j j vaccination sites as part of our normal rollout and then didn t have more jabs after the 480 000 had been consumed we would have to stop and start and that could potentially lead to a lack of trust in our ability to provide a constant supply of vaccines crisp says the department would also have had 500 000 doses that it would have to use within less than three weeks the education department provided us with numbers of staff around 500 000 that needed to be vaccinated so the numbers matched up with the supply but most importantly they came up with a fast moving mass vaccination plan for staff at schools that involved them driving employees to central points in districts crisp explains he says the health department has also taken into consideration that the education department has gazetted that pupils in public primary schools have to return to school daily as opposed to grades attending school in shifts on 26 july he said that would put teachers and other school staff at an increased risk of infection in the midst of a third covid 19 wave that the country would have reached by then vaccinations would protect staff and make the daily return of learners considerably safer crisp says the doses haven t yet been cleared by the fda so what now on thursday a memo of the kwazulu natal health department which said the national health department had confirmed that j j jabs would arrive in time to vaccinate teachers from 9 june started to circulate on social media the memo was signed by the head of the department sandile tshabalala on friday the sunday times reported that the professional teachers union peu confirmed that teachers unions were told on friday that 500 000 j j shots would be made available to teachers and support staff but crisp says if the fda makes its announcement early in the week of 7 june and if they rule that the additional consignment of 480 000 j j doses had not been contaminated the doses will only arrive later in the week of 7 june as a chartered flight would first need to be secured once the vaccine doses arrive they would have to be sent for quality testing at the national control lab at the university of the free state in bloemfontein which means the vaccines will only be ready for distribution in the week of 14 june that would leave the country with exactly 14 days to use the shots before they expire crisp says it s by no means a done deal that the 480 000 jabs will be cleared by the fda but if they are they ll be used for all schools not just public schools the vaccines will go to staff paid for by the education department those funded by school governing boards and also to staff at private primary and high schools he says the rest of the country s current vaccine supply in other words the pfizer consignments that we ll receive each sunday night in june as well as our j j jabs at aspen if the fda says we can release them will continue to be used at national rollout vaccination sites and be prioritised for healthcare workers and people 60 and older until the bulk of that group has been vaccinated crisp explains once we ve vaccinated enough people in the current groups we will move onto our next priority group people of 40 and older this story was produced by the bhekisisa centre for health journalism sign up for the newsletter

sign of accelerating inflation are two months of middling job growth the result of too much of a good thing employers want to hire more than they can or a hint that the labor market isn t as strong as economists think in many ways the news has been cause to cheer the economy grew from january through march at a red hot 6 4 annual pace and in the current quarter that pace is thought to be accelerating to nearly double digits yet the full portrait of the u s economy is a rather more nuanced one here is a closer look at five vital signs ___ jobs employers last month added 559 000 jobs on top of 278 000 in april those would ordinarily be seen as quite healthy numbers yet against the backdrop of record high job openings and free spending consumers forecasters had expected much more hiring some economists had envisioned the recovery from the pandemic recession driving monthly job growth of 800 000 900 000 even 1 million or more what explains the shortfall economists point mainly to what they call a short term mismatch companies are posting job openings faster than applicants can respond after all many americans are contending with considerable tumult at home health issues related to covid 19 child care problems with schools slow to reopen career uncertainty after many jobs permanently vanished over the past 15 months and some people earning more from federal and state jobless aid than they did when they worked are taking their time before pursuing another job some say the labor shortage is nothing that can t be solved the old fashioned way by raising pay and offering more generous benefits and working conditions in fact that process appears to have begun average hourly wages rose solidly in april and may consider gina schaefer who owns 13 ace hardware stores in maryland virginia and washington d c and who has been rapidly staffing up for the spring and summer when her sales typically hit highs schaefer has hired nearly 120 people since march both seasonal workers and long delayed replacements for people who left last year when covid ravaged the economy her company pays a minimum of 15 50 an hour to compete with larger chains that now pay 15 and provides health insurance paid vacation sick leave and a 401 k plan after employees have been on the job for about six months we firmly believe that better workplaces do not have a problem finding employees she said ___ consumers after months cooped up at home millions of consumers have rushed back out again in buoyant spirits and eager to spend their finances bolstered by 1 400 federal stimulus payments earlier this year among the affluent sharp gains in home and stock market equity have further emboldened their impulse to spend consumer confidence is high and americans stepped up their spending again in april after a powerful gain in march fueled by 1 400 stimulus checks to most individuals that said rubeela farooqi chief u s economist at high frequency economics sees cautionary signs confidence and spending though still healthy have trended lower and retail sales were flat in april after having surged in march suggesting that the positive effect of the stimulus checks might have faded similar trends occurred late last year after the effects of earlier federal stimulus money began to wear off in addition a monthly survey of consumer confidence by the conference board found that expectations for the next six months actually fell in may i m not sure how this is going to pan out farooqi says ___ inflation financial markets endured an unwelcome jolt last month when the labor department reported that consumer prices had jumped 0 8 from march to april and 4 2 from 12 months earlier the largest year over year increase since 2008 some leading critics including former treasury secretary larry summers have been warning that president joe biden s trillions of dollars in federal stimulus money risk igniting inflation and forcing the federal reserve to resort to interest rate hikes which could derail the economic recovery but fed chair jerome powell and many economists say they think the inflation surge will prove short lived they say it reflects mainly temporary supply chain bottlenecks that have forced up prices but that should ease over time for now though shortages of lumber computer chips and other materials have contributed to inflation pressures mallon at elmer schultz services in philadelphia said supply shortages are so severe in his industry that members of the the commercial food equipment service association trade group are sharing inventory i can go to a friend if he has a part in stock he said in my 30 years in the business no i ve never seen anything like it ___ housing the housing market has served as a source of economic strength and resilience during the pandemic supported by ultra low mortgage rates and the desire of many locked down families to move to more spacious digs to accommodate work from home needs but with prices having risen beyond the reach of many and with the supply of homes for sale severely limited the housing boom has lately shown signs of fatigue home construction tumbled 9 5 in april a drop that economists attributed at least in part to builders postponing projects because of accelerating costs for lumber and other supplies that have contributed to swelling home prices in april sales of new homes dropped nearly 6 and purchases of existing homes fell 2 7 many would be buyers will remain on the outside looking in as long as a shortage of available homes keeps sale prices elevated ___ manufacturing u s factories are thriving despite the clogged supply chains and the shortage of workers the institute for supply management s manufacturing index rose to 61 2 last month any reading above 50 signals growth and manufacturers have been on a 12 month winning streak half the purchasing managers surveyed by the trade association said they had had trouble finding workers given the supply problems it s unclear whether factories can sustain their steady output the ism found that deliveries from suppliers were coming in at their slowest rate since 1974 sixteen of 18 industries reported slower deliveries ___ ap business writers christopher rugaber in washington and joyce m rosenberg in new york contributed to this report ___ this story was first published on june

or replaying the story in its archived form does not constitute a republication of the story farmington a new policy announced by the davis county sheriff s office this week demonstrates the complicated relationship between local state and federal enforcement agencies outlined in constitutional law the policy prevents deputies and other department employees from enforcing federal laws or presidential executive orders that they determine may infringe on the u s constitution s second amendment right to bear arms the policy was enacted on june 1 the davis county commission and davis county attorney troy rawlings expressed their unanimous support for the decision in a joint press release with the sheriff s office the same day the davis county sheriff s office says it will enforce clearly established laws that don t infringe on individual rights and are meant to protect the general public by reducing violence and preserving peace and order the new policy prevents law enforcement officials from taking action or using county resources to enforce an executive order by the president of the united states or any federal state or local political entity or enforcement agency not affirmed by congress or the utah state legislature which appears to exceed the power of the political entity violate the constitution or inappropriately infringe on a law abiding citizen s right to keep and bear arms university of utah law professor ronnell andersen jones says the policy may be largely symbolic but there are nuances the sheriff s department officials likely already took an oath to support and defend the constitution andersen jones said they already must respect the individual liberties protections of the constitution so saying that they will do so is symbolic but it doesn t change the dynamic in any way enforcement decisions but andersen jones said the key in this case is that the contours of constitutional rights are complicated not every regulation or limitation can be regarded as a violation of a constitutional right the supreme court has made some decisions regarding the constitutionality of certain regulations and limitations regarding the second amendment but recent executive actions on firearm regulations have not yet been assessed by the court when a sheriff s department or a city or a county enact a policy prohibiting the use of any county resources in enforcing presidential executive orders or other federal decrees that are unconstitutional it really begs the question of who is going to make the determination of what is constitutional and what isn t andersen jones said the constitutionality question is a big one and a complicated one and it doesn t really look like davis county is tussling with that all that carefully they re just making a more sweeping determination that they will use their enforcement andersen jones said that if the county wanted to be more specific it could list specific executive orders federal statutes or regulatory decisions it refuses to enforce and list its own expansive views of gun rights constitutionally the sheriff s department is free to use its enforcement resources however it chooses including the choice not to enforce various federal provisions but that doesn t make davis county citizens immune to enforcement federally in addition to davis county residents being subject to federal enforcement the county itself is subject to conditions with federal funding according to anderson jones the federal government can impose reasonable conditions on the receipt of federal funds by states and municipalities like counties and cities as long as the federal government makes clear what the federal funding is tied to it is free to condition the spending on states or localities engaging in various behaviors the caveat being the federal government can t condition its funding on an obligation for a city or a county to violate the constitution the contradiction may lead to a source of litigation in the future but there are several cases in which courts have upheld the connection between federal funding and some condition placed on the city or state that they must enforce a law or must assist with the enforcement of federal law in some way in order to qualify for that funding that might be an area where we see the federal government flex its powers andersen jones said it can t tell the county what to do the constitution prohibits that but the constitution does allow the federal government to spend its own money and then to condition the receipt of those funds on the observation of certain conditions the law professor pointed to sanctuary city or sanctuary county declarations regarding the second amendment which opt out of firearm regulations altogether anderson jones says this is a clearer way for a city or county to state its intentions but davis county s particular policy presents a tricker space discussions of second amendment state sanctuaries have grown in popularity with the change in presidential administration utah is no exception with several counties within utah declaring themselves as second amendment sanctuaries on a state level utah lawmakers recently approved two resolutions in a special session to declare support for second amendment rights and to explore the possibility of announcing utah as a second amendment sanctuary the avoidance of sanctuary language in davis county s policy was intentional rawlings who expressed his unequivocal support for the policy said the term sanctuary wasn t present because the policy is not a carte blanche declaration of defiance symbolic or functional davis county sheriff kelly sparks echoed rawling s sentiment saying that some of the language in sanctuary resolutions could hamper our ability to use some of the laws that we already have on the books that have gone through the proper process to become law have had the proper judicial notice so been upheld by the court we use those laws all the time to help us combat violence in our community sparks also added he felt that sanctuary resolutions were largely symbolic and this policy within a law enforcement area would be actionable and show a resolve to defend constitutional rights the constitutionality of laws applied is up to officer discretion discretion administered by the sheriff s office and consultation by the county attorney sparks acknowledged that the application of the policy could be somewhat subjective determinations on recent or upcoming executive orders have not been announced by the davis county sheriff s office these most recent regulations include some set forth by the biden administration regarding ghost guns and the move to tighten regulations on stabilizing braces executive orders regarding gun regulation to date include the trump administration s order banning bump stocks after the deadly las vegas shooting in 2017 sparks said that former president donald trump s executive order regarding bump stocks would not be precluded necessarily by this policy preventing gun violence the growing epidemic of gun violence across the united states was considered when drafting the policy sparks said one of the reasons that we wanted to do this as a policy is so that we would maintain be sure and maintain the ability to use the laws that we have on the books now to help reduce that violence and respond to that violence the sheriff said these incidences of violence i firmly believe that we need to do all we can to stop them they re tragic and they re sad and that loss of life it s just a tragedy at an epic scale but i really believe that the right way to handle that is by focusing on the perpetrator and not on the weapon of choice that sentiment was echoed in the davis county commission meeting there s been some concerns because of what we ve seen with these mass shootings i do not believe these mass shootings are being caused because someone owns a gun i believe it s because people need to seek treatment guns do not shoot themselves commission chair bob stevenson said and we will never resolve that problem until we resolve the mental illness issue in this country due to the phenomenon of sanctuary cities being new in regard to the second amendment and gun regulations data relating to gun violence rates in those areas is not available there are raging debates amongst social scientists legal scholars and others about the correlation between gun control and safety with arguments being made in both directions the sanctuary city setting might be a dynamic in which we could test some of those premises but we haven t gotten to a place yet where we can gather that data or see what the effect is anderson jones said
global investment in energy is set to rebound by nearly 10 in 2021 to 1 9 trillion reversing most of last year s drop caused the covid 19 pandemic according to a new report from the international energy agency iea however spending on clean energy transitions needs to accelerate much more rapidly to meet climate goals the report said with energy investment returning to pre crisis levels its composition is continuing to shift towards electricity 2021 is on course to be the sixth year in a row that investment in the power sector exceeds that in traditional oil and gas supply according to the world energy investment 2021 report global power sector investment is set to increase by around 5 in 2021 to more than 820 billion its highest ever level after staying flat in 2020 renewables are dominating investment in new power generation capacity and are expected to account for 70 of the total this year and that money now goes further than ever in financing clean electricity with a dollar spent on solar pv deployment today resulting in four times more electricity than ten years ago thanks to greatly improved technology and falling costs the rebound in energy investment is a welcome sign and i m encouraged to see more of it flowing towards renewables said dr fatih birol the iea s executive director but much greater resources have to be mobilised and directed to clean energy technologies to put the world on track to reach net zero emissions by 2050 based on our new net zero roadmap clean energy investment will need to triple by 2030 while renewables dominate new power investment and approvals for coal fired plants are some 80 below where they were five years ago coal is not out of the picture there was even a slight increase in go aheads for coal fired plants in 2020 driven by china and some other asian economies upstream oil and gas investment is expected to rise by about 10 in 2021 as companies recover financially from the shock of 2020 but their spending remains well below pre crisis levels the new report highlights the diverging strategies among different oil and gas companies the majors are holding oil and gas spending flat on aggregate in 2021 despite recovering prices meanwhile some national oil companies are stepping up investment raising the possibility of increased market share if demand continues to grow qatar s decision to move ahead with the world s largest liquefied natural gas lng expansion and to include carbon capture technologies in this investment is a strong signal of its intent to maintain a leadership position in lng there are signs in the latest data that spending by some global oil and gas companies is starting to diversify iea analysis last year highlighted that only around 1 of capital spending by the industry was going to clean energy investments but project tracking to date in 2021 suggests that this could rise to 4 this year for the industry as a whole and well above 10 for some of the leading european companies the influence of recovery packages and new climate policy measures comes through in expectations of rising expenditure in 2021 on renewable power electricity grids energy efficiency notably in the buildings sector in europe and emerging technologies such as carbon capture utilisation and storage and low carbon hydrogen the united states may provide further momentum if the infrastructure plan proposed by the administration of president joe biden is enacted financial markets are also providing encouraging signs for clean energy investment sustainable debt issuance reached a record level in 2020 and renewable power companies have outperformed fossil fuel companies on international equity markets but even though spending on clean energy is set to rise in 2021 by around 7 the report notes that growth in these capital expenditures has lagged changes in financial markets in part due to a shortage of high quality clean energy investment opportunities and appropriate channels for allocating capital into projects the anticipated 750 billion to be spent on clean energy technologies and efficiency in 2021 is encouraging but remains far below what s required to put the energy system on a sustainable path clean energy investment would need to triple in the 2020s to put the world on track to reach net zero emissions by 2050 thereby keeping the door open for a 1 5c stabilisation of the rise in global temperatures as set out in detail in our recent roadmap to net zero by 2050 governments need to go beyond making pledges to cut emissions and take concrete steps to accelerate investments in market ready clean energy solutions and promote innovation in early stage technologies said dr birol clear policy signals from governments would reduce the uncertainties associated with clean energy investments and provide investors with the long term visibility they need our roadmap shows there are huge opportunities for companies investors workers and entire economies on the path to net zero governments have the power to unlock these broad based benefits
market review and update over the last few week s we discussed the ongoing buy signals suggesting the market could retest all time highs that occurred this week however the good news is that we did indeed get the rally we were expecting the not so good news is that the rally already consumed a majority of the buy signal such does not mean the market is about to correct it does suggest that upside remains limited near term as shown in the bottom panel the ria pro money flow signal is now into overbought territory while the markets could undoubtedly break out to new highs this week the upside remains limited such is due to the weekly signal which is very close to triggering our more significant concern remains the weekly sell signal historically these weekly signals typically denote periods of more significant volatility swings or corrections the biggest correction risk comes when the daily and weekly signals align i will lay out the case for a summer sell off momentarily but let me recap what these signals do and don t mean technical analysis in a mania on friday i received an email asking an essential question i enjoyed your piece this week on i am starting to believe the fed has achieved a permanently high plateau for asset prices because there seems to be nothing to derail the endless risk appetite for any asset however in the futile exercise of trying to stay disciplined i don t want to abandon valuations and technicals the biggest problem is that technical indicators do not distinguish between a consolidation a correction or an outright bear market as such if you ignore the signals as they occur by the time you realize it s a deep correction it is too late to do much about it therefore we must treat each signal with the same respect and adjust risk accordingly the opportunity costs of doing so are minimal if we reduce risk and the market continues to rise we can quickly increase our exposures yes we sacrifice some short term performance however if we reduce risk and the market declines sharply we not only protect our capital during the decline but have the cash to deploy at lower price levels such is the biggest problem with buy and hold strategies yes you will perform in line with the market but given that you didn t sell high there is no cash available with which to buy low in the future while i agree you can not time the markets risk of a summer selloff over the last three weeks we have discussed that while we had added exposure to portfolios in anticipation of a short term rally we still expect a more significant correction this summer there are several reasons for this the first is that a 5 correction is likely one or more times in any given year given the last correction was in the summer of 2020 such makes the current stretch of a low volatility advance one of the longer ones on record secondly as noted by variant perception recently the market has been tracking the post correction bear market rally analog such also suggests a pause given the strength of the rally from the previous lows lastly money flows into stocks may have peaked after a massive surge in inflows over the last 9 months as shown by bespoke all of these signposts suggest a risk of a correction in the near term however as stated above technical analysis does not differentiate between a 5 pullback a 10 correction and a 20 decline you will only find that out once it begins risk management is much like driving a car if there is a blind spot ahead and you don t tap on the brakes to control your speed you are unlikely to avoid the hazard ahead yes tapping on the brakes to provide more control over the car will slow your arrival time to your destination however being late is a much better option than not getting there at all risk is evident a recent note from doug kass summed up the current market environment well stocks and bonds are richly priced it makes no sense to say as many do that equities are inexpensive against an overpriced asset class fixed income most traditional metrics indicate that stocks are at least in the 95th percentile a non trivial amount of indicators of valuation are in the 99th percentile even using always overly estimated forward earnings valuations remain extremely rich suggesting lower returns in the future of course such does not mean the market is about to crash and you should hide in cash however the elevation in valuations combined with the chase in meme stocks like amc entertainment holdings inc nyse and cryptocurrencies are just the latest manifestations of risk taking by investors a look at small capitalization companies which are the riskiest of stocks and their deviation from long term means also is representative of speculation the 200 week moving average has been consistent support for small caps since 2008 the current deviation is unprecedented even with the expected surge in earnings the index is still trading at more the 28x earnings based on estimates 2 years into the future such means that expected returns over the next 24 months for small cap stocks are now close to zero then there is the problem with value stocks the lack of value in value over the years value has been the cornerstone of investing the reason is that during bear markets the speculative excesses get wrung out and investors search for value as a store of safety the problem is that since there hasn t been an actual there is relatively little value in value stocks the popular and cool guys value stocks are now extended that arguably includes banks industrials and opening stocks doug kass an excellent example is the ishares msci usa momentum factor etf nyse that switched from growth stocks to value stocks the same is occurring in other factor based etfs for instance the two top holdings of ishares russell 2000 value etf nyse are gamestop nyse and amc entertainment which are about as far from value as one can imagine the problem will be whether the economic expansion will allow earnings growth to justify current valuations however three massive rounds of stimulus pulled forward several years of sales which will become problematic as economic growth slows as noted there is little value in the value trade as discussed in book value analysis and buying companies with low price to book ratios have historically been profitable ventures companies with machinery inventory and equipment and financial assets tend to have large book values significantly these types of investments are easily valued and liquidated in the event of financial stress or bankruptcy however today such is no longer the case items such as patents licenses human capital etc now make up a significant portion of a company s value these types of assets are hard to value and more difficult to liquidate so how many non financial companies in the currently have a price to book ratio below 1 5x how about 18 see the problem portfolio update with our weekly sell signal now triggered on the s p 500 and the daily signals back to very overbought levels we liquidated the rest of our invesco qqq trust nasdaq index trading position the sell locked in the recent gains and raised our cash levels to buffer our overall portfolio allocations the rest of the portfolio remains balanced between the inflation and deflation trade to lower overall volatility the barbell approach to the reopening trade has worked well given the rapid rotations between the two schools over the last few months we certainly don t profess to have all the answers but there is no argument we will see robust short term growth and rising inflationary pressures such suggests the value trade may persist for a while longer those sectors remain and for now however we also continue to add to deflationary holdings opportunistically as economic growth will return to its 2 ish long term trend and remain increasingly recession proof due to the changing workforce demographic trends and living standards we are firm believers in value investing however after years of artificial interventions accounting gimmicks share buybacks and massive balance sheet leveraging there is little real value in the markets currently given that the markets have not reset speculators are now simply chasing whatever is moving higher for now we have to continue to navigate markets for what they are rather than what we hope they could be we suspect that this year could wind up disappointing both economists and investors alike
