heavy diet is the biggest contributor to their carbon pawprints which requires an abundance of energy land and water to produce and the production of pet food emits huge amounts of planet warming

a report published by hong kong watch and professor laura t murphy of the university of sheffield hallam on monday found that dozens of american british and canadian state pension funds are passively invested in chinese companies that face credible accusations of enslaving uyghur muslims the report entitled passively funding crimes against humanity how your savings may be financing internment camps and forced labor in china identified 13 chinese companies listed on three vital morgan stanley capital international msci indexes that use forced uyghur labor provided by chinese state sponsored programs or have been involved in the construction of concentration camps for the uyghurs china is currently engaging in genocide against the uyghur people and other non han communities in east turkistan a western region under chinese communist occupation the regime refers to as xinjiang one of the companies spotlighted by the report is foxconn technology the taiwan based company whose enormous plant in zhengzhou china is the world s largest facility for assembling apple iphones the authors cited documentation that shows hundreds of uyghur workers have been transferred to foxconn factories including the one in zhengzhou where they have reportedly been required to work at least 100 hours of overtime every month foxconn participates in the xinjiang aid scheme and uyghur workers are under constant surveillance subject to patriotic re education and expected to express gratitude to the communist party the authors noted the foxconn plant in zhengzhou is currently in the headlines because many of its workers fled a brutal coronavirus lockdown and those who remain are rioting against poor living conditions and abusive labor practices apple is warning customers worldwide that iphone supplies could be significantly delayed due to the unrest at the zhengzhou plant xinjiang aid is the chinese communist party s official euphemism for its abusive uyghur policies china claims the massive concentration camps dotting xinjiang province are merely vocational training schools that just happen to be surrounded by barbed wire fences for no particular reason the concentration camps hosted as many as 3 million people at their peak but have since shipped thousands out to work in factories across the country as slaves the communist party openly sells uyghur slaves to companies online xinjiang aid presents china s slavery programs as the benevolent communist state offering free transportation to exciting job opportunities in other provinces for the graduates of these grim vocational schools where they work for minimal to no pay and have no control over the terms of their employment the report lists investment funds that hold equities in the offending chinese companies a list that unfortunately includes some of the largest private pension fund managers and important local public pension funds in the u k canada and usa given msci s popularity as a global benchmark for emerging markets this list does not include all funds that are invested in these indexes other funds may be equally exposed the authors noted topping the list were funds managed by blackrock hsbc ubs invesco and deutsche bank all of which were invested in six chinese companies documented to employ forced labor plus six companies involved in the construction of repressive infrastructure in the chinese province of xinjiang where the uyghurs live the full list included 18 major international asset managers 11 u s state pension funds 4 canadian pension funds and 8 u k pension funds plus two pension funds in new zealand and japan the u s pension funds included the immense california public employees retirement system calpers the new york state teachers fund and investment or retirement funds in florida minnesota nevada new jersey oklahoma and pennsylvania the report noted that only three of the chinese companies it highlighted for abuses are currently covered by the uyghur forced labor prevention act uflpa a u s law that took effect in june the uflpa requires importers to prove that products harvested or manufactured in xinjiang are not tainted with forced labor a much higher standard than previous import controls this is a noticeable blind spot given the publicly available data that can be accessed about every firm listed the u s government should expand the lists to ensure that companies known to be complicit in forced labor are excluded from importing goods under the uflpa the report advised the authors also advised the u s government to harmonize the uflpa with the list of entities covered by executive order 14032 a june 2021 order that banned investment in chinese entities associated with human rights abuses and the rising security threat of the military industrial complex of the people s republic of china the authors noted that uflpa does not ban investments so until it is harmonized with executive order 14032 it is possible for americans to invest in firms whose imports are banned because they engage in slavery the report made similar recommendations to the european union and canada advising the creation of carefully vetted entities that are known to be involved in state imposed forced labor in the uyghur region and using this master list to apply harmonized bans on public procurement pension government investment and imports lawmakers and government officials must urgently consider how it could be morally defensible for federal employees pensions to be passively invested in companies complicit in gross human rights violations in the uyghur region the report said 13 companies on msci s emerging markets index are either known to have directly used forced labor through china s forcible transfer of uyghurs or been involved in the construction of camps said hong kong watch co founder johnny patterson given this index is the most widely tracked emerging markets index in the world it raises serious questions about how seriously international financial institutions take their international human rights obligations or the s in esg he contended esg stands for environment social and governance investing the concept was introduced precisely to avoid the kind of passive investing in support of human rights abuses documented by murphy and hong kong watch one of the report s recommendations for western corporations was to universally blacklist firms complicit in genocide crimes against humanity or moder day slavery from global indexes used by public pension funds and private investors patterson said firms known to use modern slavery or known to be complicit in crimes against humanity should be classified as untouchable sin stocks like tobacco governments have a duty to signal which firms are unacceptable but international financial institutions must also be doing their full due diligence it is unacceptable that enormous amounts of the money of ordinary pensioners and retail investors is being passively channeled into firms that are known to use forced labor he said murphy a professor of human rights and contemporary slavery at the helena kennedy center for international justice at sheffield hallam university said investing in the chinese companies identified by her research is both a serious ethical risk and a financial risk because these companies have been targeted by government sanctions and international advocacy campaigns so many people s pensions retirement funds and savings are invested passively because as average consumers we don t have time to investigate each and every investment she observed no one should be passively invested in the oppression of the uyghurs the brands called out in this report stand as a cautionary tale for what can happen when companies do business in opaque or high risk geographies without appropriate and continuous human rights due diligence said anita dorett director of the investor alliance for human rights millions of uyghur and other turkic muslim majority peoples are subject to egregious human rights abuses and the financial and human rights performance of companies and their investors are put at risk when it comes to respecting human rights there can be no such thing as a passive investor dorett said this report should be a wake up call to every asset manager and pension fund investors should require companies they are invested in to fully trace their supply chains and urgently divest from any links to the uyghur region or to forced labor transfers from the region declared rushan abbas executive director of the campaign for uyghurs abbas urged investment indexes like msci to delist companies linked to slavery so that average citizens do not need to worry that they are funding crimes against humanity the toronto star reported on monday that canada pension plan one of the funds described as passively investing in the uyghur genocide rejected the report s conclusions and insisted it has vigorous safeguards against investing in foreign companies that abuse human rights we might use different programs to track an index but we do that through a synthetic process of derivatives and that means we re not actually invested in the companies that make up the index said michel leduc senior managing director of public affairs for the canada pension plan investment board cppib hong kong watch policy and advocacy director sam goodman countered that his report s data on the canada pension plan is accurate and does show the plan making over 13 billion in passive investments in chinese firms linked to forced labor he invited the investment board to furnish any updated information that might dispute the report s conclusions if the situation has changed and cppib has divested from any exposure to msci china and msci emerging markets we would welcome clarification of their position and the publication of the full listing of new holdings on its website goodman said other analysts and canadian lawmakers told the toronto star that the canadian government should create lists of banned entities like the united states does to make it easier for fund managers to avoid passively investing in forced labor and make it easier for individuals to know when their pension funds are making such investments it s almost impossible for someone sitting here in this part of the world to look at a company and understand its level of support for the chinese military or the abuses in xinjiang if you don t have good chinese and research skills institutions have internal process but most are skewed toward compliance not toward ethical good governance explained control risks senior partner dane chamorro in china technology companies are selling surveillance technology to not only the chinese government but also globally in areas that some business investors would find uncomfortable is this defensible to stakeholders what s acceptable two years ago may not be acceptable today so it s a moving piece chamorro said another canadian fund listed in passively funding crimes against humanity the civil service superannuation board cssb of manitoba declined comment when contacted by the toronto star as did morgan stanley and the office of canadian finance minister chrystia freeland

with the market down there aren t too many stocks reaching into the trillions as we head into the last month of the year the s p 500 is down 16 that s firmly stock market correction territory although it dipped lower than that at certain parts of the year the potential bear market has not been borne out in 2022 2023 may bring a resurgence of a bull market or the market could slip further if the market takes an upward swing one thing that s likely to happen in 2023 is that amazon amzn 0 16 will become a trillion dollar company again it has been there before with amazon it s a case of when not if it has been there before with its market cap reaching a high of nearly 1 9 trillion a year ago back in the heyday of 2021 its stock is now down 48 since that time with a market cap of 950 billion the market being what it is today there are only three companies valued at more than 1 trillion apple microsoft and alphabet amazon will join them again soon and many other companies will get there over the next few years the state of amazon in the third quarter sales growth for the e commerce giant was still impressive revenue increased 15 over last year to 127 billion with particular strength in the north american market which grew 20 but operating income decreased by about half from 4 9 billion last year to 2 5 billion management typically measures its progress in terms of operating income in place of net income since it sees it as a more reliable measure of its overall health net income or loss takes into account factors such as its investments in rivian automotive which has skewed its net income both positively and negatively over the past few quarters net income decreased to 2 9 billion in q3 which was higher than operating income due to a pre tax advantage from rivian cash flow has been heading downward as well and it has fallen into negative territory for the first time in over a decade pulling its growth levers amazon is facing a few setbacks right now between rising costs increased wages supply issues and inflation affecting retail spending the economic downturn is even starting to affect amazon web services aws which was still strong in the third quarter but whose sales growth decelerated slightly management isn t worried amazon has been here before and it s rolling with the punches and setting the stage for continued growth like many tech companies it s doing a round of layoffs after a hiring spree to meet rising demand it s looking for many ways to cut costs now that demand is dying down it s also redirecting its resources to generate higher revenue it scrapped its previous healthcare venture amazon care and it s launching a new version called amazon clinic with the resources from its acquisition of one medical in april with prime subscriptions topping 200 million there s plenty of cash still coming in and a strong moat around its core retail business there s also big potential in amazon s just walk out technology which it s licensing to other retailers there s no shortage of ways for amazon to expand its business but the main focus in this atmosphere is reducing expenses before it goes back into growth mode it s going to go back amazon stock has lost a lot of its value plenty of times in the past for example amazon stock declined by more than 50 from 2007 to 2008 but it has increased more than 4 000 since then even at the current depressed price there are never any guarantees but winners tend to keep winning it seems to be just a matter of time until amazon stock begins to gain again and it becomes a trillion dollar stock surpassing that level and rewarding shareholders

netflix set to shut down a service that has shipped more than 5 billion discs across the u s netflix s trailblazing dvd by mail rental service has been relegated as a relic in the age of video streaming but there is still a steady albeit shrinking audience of diehards like amanda konkle who are happily paying to receive those discs in the iconic red and white envelopes when you open your mailbox it s still something you actually want instead of just bills said konkle a resident of savannah georgia who has been subscribing to netflix s dvd by mail service since 2005 it s a small pleasure that konkle and other still dedicated dvd subscribers enjoy but it s not clear for how much longer netflix declined to comment for this story but during a 2018 media event co founder and co ceo of netflix reed hastings suggested the dvd by mail service might close around 2023 when not if it happens netflix will shut down a service that has shipped more than 5 billion discs across the u s since its inception nearly a quarter century ago and it will echo the downfall of the thousands of blockbuster video rental stores that closed because they couldn t counter the threat posed by netflix s dvd by mail alternative the eventual demise of its dvd by mail service has been inevitable since hastings decided to spin it off from a then nascent video streaming service in 2011 back then hastings floated the idea of renaming the service as qwikster a bungled idea that was so widely ridiculed that it was satirized on saturday night live it finally settled on its current more prosaic handle dvd com the operation is now based in non descript office in fremont california located about 20 miles from netflix s sleek campus in los gatos california shortly before breakup from video streaming the dvd by mail service boasted more than 16 million subscribers a number that has now dwindled to an estimated 1 5 million subscribers all in the u s based on calculations drawn from netflix s limited disclosures of the service in its quarterly reports netflix s video streaming service now boasts 223 million worldwide subscribers including 74 million in the u s and canada the dvd by mail business has bequeathed the netflix that everyone now knows and watches today marc randolph netflix s original ceo said during an interview at a coffee shop located across the street from the post office in santa cruz california the 110 year old post office has become a landmark in silicon valley history because it s where randolph mailed a patsy cline cd to hastings in 1997 to test whether a disc could be delivered through the u s postal service without being damaged the disc arrived at hastings home unblemished prompting the duo in 1998 to launch a dvd by mail rental website that they always knew would be supplanted by even more convenient technology it was planned obsolescence but our bet was that it would take longer for it to happen than most people thought at the time randolph said with netflix s successful streaming service it might be easy to assume that anyone still paying to receive dvds through the mail is a technophobe or someone living in a remote part of the u s without reliable internet access but subscribers say they stick with the service so they can rent movies that are otherwise difficult to find on streaming services for michael fusco 35 that

your organization to feel less of an economic brunt plus you may see some indirect benefits to being innovative like improved employee loyalty and more positive customer sentiment so the sooner you start the sooner you ll see results this may go without saying but companies incur plenty of hidden expenses that erode their profit margins case in point all those subscriptions that you ve forgotten about many products and services require you to pay for them on a regular basis such as quarterly or annually however it can be easy to set and forget the subscriptions you ve signed up for conduct an audit of your corporate spending look through all your business credit cards you may spot items here and there that just aren t providing any value if one of them is a subscription make sure it s for something your employees use otherwise you re just wasting money stock up on supplies though some experts are hopeful that supply chain worries are nearing an end one of the largest shipping companies isn t so sure dhl announced in early 2022 its prediction that supply chains would remain disrupted through 2023 sure that s not something you want to hear as an ecommerce store nevertheless it s something that you need to keep in mind in terms of procurement let s say you know you re likely to get a seasonal bump in sales on some of the merchandise you sell it may be wise to purchase as many of those items as you can immediately or you may want to source them from a variety of vendors rather than sticking with one the last thing you want is to run out of a bestseller at the peak of your sales season stocking up sooner in the year can help offset supply chain snags outsource wherever feasible outsourcing remains one of the most reliable ways to spend less without sacrificing the quality of your services when you outsource you remove a lot of the overhead that can bog you down take paying for warehousing and shipping costs for example tradefull which is a complete ecommerce solution has the infrastructure to handle the logistics like storage dropshipping picking and packing and more on behalf of its ecommerce partners as a result its partners don t have to pay for their own warehousing needs they outsource to tradefull where could outsourcing work for you in addition to your ecommerce solutions needs consider outsourcing anything from your payroll management to customer service you could be able to slash everything from the cost to rent space to the cost to hire full time workers improve cash flow making improvements to your cash flow means you ll be able to make payroll buy products and pay bills a proven way to increase your cash is to shorten the time it takes to get paid for instance reconsider the types of payment options you offer customers some might help you get paid a little faster as explained by rotessa an application for small businesses credit card processing tends to get money into your account faster than through ach payments the trade off is a percentage of the purchase price alternatively you might want to add more bulk buying incentives to the table such as discounts for purchasing multiple items allowing a customer to shave dollars off an order when buying two three or more items is a win win solution you get more cash from the sale than you would have and your buyer has gotten a deal if you have excess inventory creating low priced bundled merchandise may be a similar way to get more cash concentrate on marketing your bestsellers you may or may not know what your best selling products are it s worth finding out for sure and then promoting them ahead of other items don t worry if your bestsellers aren t the highest priced items in your estore you want to find products with strong profit margins such as those with significant markups and those won t necessarily be the ones with the highest price tags once you ve named your top products make sure you re showcasing them in your advertising feel free to shift some of your budget or change your copy and imaging though other merchandise you sell will get less upfront promotion your top sellers will bring leads in the door once shoppers are on your ecommerce site they can be introduced to other products maintain a buzzworthy customer experience every time a customer has a gold medal experience your company wins customer experience has become an

going to do and they re looking at a 10 price hike at minimum however the key is to raise prices reasonably for example doubling the price of an item probably isn t wise unless you can justify the price hike on the other hand a slight pricing jump might make shoppers grumble but most of your fans will stay how do you know the sweet spot for a price increase one tried and true method is to check the market see what it s bearing now by conducting competitor research you aren t required to have the lowest prices but beware of being the highest price unless you re in a luxury goods niche seek new customer pools if you re able to bring more customers into your ecommerce store you ll be statistically likely to increase your sales tapping into new audience personas can be one way to entice more customers for example you might not realize that you ve been overlooking a significant population of potential buyers until you conduct internal marketing research a fast way to uncover possible new customer buckets is to look at your current buyers see which buyers have the highest single and lifetime sales do they represent audiences you haven t been marketing to even one untapped pool of leads could give your sales the bump up you need to stay afloat despite inflation attract and retain talent in addition to other economic concerns the labor market is having struggles of its own yes job openings declined in q2 2022 nonetheless the new york times explains that employers are still having trouble filling seats so holding onto the team members already invested in your ecommerce company makes a lot of sense creating a healthy toxic free culture is a surefire way to keep your employees happier encourage embrace and model smart management practices like open communication empathy and adaptability when one of your best workers resigns try to renegotiate if you can sometimes employees may be willing to stay if you offer the right incentive even if you have to pay everyone a little more it may be far less than you ll pay to recruit and train replacements drop unproductive marketing tactics but keep marketing you might be tempted to slash your marketing budget don t just rework it for instance use data from google analytics to determine which marketing methods are working like a charm and which are duds temporarily put a hold on the duds and spend more on the marketing you can count on certainly you can still try some innovative marketing efforts be willing to shelve them if necessary test something you haven t tried run a few experiments and see what happens but make sure you re holding onto the marketing that you know always drives business you can t stop inflation that s a fact nevertheless you can stop it from ruining your ecommerce business

netflix set to shut down a service that has shipped more than 5 billion discs across the u s netflix s trailblazing dvd by mail rental service has been relegated as a relic in the age of video streaming but there is still a steady albeit shrinking audience of diehards like amanda konkle who are happily paying to receive those discs in the iconic red and white envelopes when you open your mailbox it s still something you actually want instead of just bills said konkle a resident of savannah georgia who has been subscribing to netflix s dvd by mail service since 2005 it s a small pleasure that konkle and other still dedicated dvd subscribers enjoy but it s not clear for how much longer netflix declined to comment for this story but during a 2018 media event co founder and co ceo of netflix reed hastings suggested the dvd by mail service might close around 2023 when not if it happens netflix will shut down a service that has shipped more than 5 billion discs across the u s since its inception nearly a quarter century ago and it will echo the downfall of the thousands of blockbuster video rental stores that closed because they couldn t counter the threat posed by netflix s dvd by mail alternative the eventual demise of its dvd by mail service has been inevitable since hastings decided to spin it off from a then nascent video streaming service in 2011 back then hastings floated the idea of renaming the service as qwikster a bungled idea that was so widely ridiculed that it was satirized on saturday night live it finally settled on its current more prosaic handle dvd com the operation is now based in non descript office in fremont california located about 20 miles from netflix s sleek campus in los gatos california shortly before breakup from video streaming the dvd by mail service boasted more than 16 million subscribers a number that has now dwindled to an estimated 1 5 million subscribers all in the u s based on calculations drawn from netflix s limited disclosures of the service in its quarterly reports netflix s video streaming service now boasts 223 million worldwide subscribers including 74 million in the u s and canada the dvd by mail business has bequeathed the netflix that everyone now knows and watches today marc randolph netflix s original ceo said during an interview at a coffee shop located across the street from the post office in santa cruz california the 110 year old post office has become a landmark in silicon valley history because it s where randolph mailed a patsy cline cd to hastings in 1997 to test whether a disc could be delivered through the u s postal service without being damaged the disc arrived at hastings home unblemished prompting the duo in 1998 to launch a dvd by mail rental website that they always knew would be supplanted by even more convenient technology it was planned obsolescence but our bet was that it would take longer for it to happen than most people thought at the time randolph said with netflix s successful streaming service it might be easy to assume that anyone still paying to receive dvds through the mail is a technophobe or someone living in a remote part of the u s without reliable internet access but subscribers say they stick with the service so they can rent movies that are otherwise difficult to find on streaming services for michael fusco 35 that includes the 1986 film power starring a then youthful richard gere and denzel washington and 1980 s the big red one starring lee marvin that s among the main reasons he has been subscribing to the dvd by service since 2006 when he was just a freshman in college and he has no plans to cancel it now i have been getting it for almost half my life and it has been a big part fusco said when i was young it helped me discover voices i probably wouldn t have heard i still have memories of getting movies and having them blow my mind tabetha neumann is among the subscribers who rediscovered the dvd service during the throes of the pandemic lockdowns in 2020 after running out of things to watch on her video streaming service so she and her husband signed up again for the first time since canceling in 2011 now they like it so much that they get the a plan that allows them to keep up to three discs at a time an option that currently costs 20 per month compared to 10 per month for the one disc plan when we started going through all the movies we wanted to see we realized it was cheaper than paying 5 per movie on some streaming services neumann said plus we have found a lot of old horror movies and that genre is not really big on streaming konkle who has written a book about marilyn monroe s films says she still finds movies on the dvd service such as the 1954 film cattle queen of montana featuring future u s president ronald reagan alongside barbara stanwyck and the 1983 french film sugar cane alley that help her teach her film studies classes as an associate professor at georgia southern university it s a viewing habit she doesn t usually share with her classes because most of my students don t know what a dvd is said konkle 40 laughing but for all the dvd service s attractions subscribers are starting to notice signs of deterioration as the business has shrunk from producing more than 1 billion in annual revenue a year ago to an amount likely to fall below 200 million in revenue this year katie cardinale a subscriber who lives in hopedale massachusetts says she now has to wait an additional two to four days for discs to arrive in the mail than she used to because they are shipped from a distribution center in new jersey instead of boston netflix doesn t disclose how many dvd distribution centers still operate but there were once about 50 of them in the u s konkle says more discs now come with cracks or other defects in them and it takes forever to get them replaced and almost all subscribers have noticed the selection of dvd titles has shrunk dramatically from the service s peak years when netflix boasted it had more than 100 000 different movies and tv shows on disc netflix no longer discloses the size of its dvd library but the subscribers interviewed by the ap all reported the narrowing selection is making it more difficult to find famous films and popular tv series that once were routinely available on the service instead netflix now sorts requests for titles such as the first season of the award winning ted lasso series a release that can be purchased on dvd into a saved queue signaling it may decide to stock it in the future depending on demand knowing the end is in sight randolph said he will lament the death of the dvd service he brought to life while taking comfort its legacy will survive netflix s dvd

ponywang the clough global opportunities fund nyse glo relies heavily on its star manager to make differentiated macro calls unfortunately those calls proved to be wrong in 2022 leading to abysmal short term performance although the yield looks attractive at 19 8 there is a significant risk the distribution may be cut as it is clearly unsustainable judging by investment performance fund overview the clough global opportunities fund is a closed end fund cef that seeks to provide a high level of total returns through investments in equity equity related securities and fixed income securities the fund has approximately 250 million in assets strategy the glo fund primarily invests in a mix of u s and global equity and debt securities using the manager s fundamental research

the fund positioned heading into 2022 that have led to the abysmal ytd performance annual report provide some clues glo s 2021 annual report provide some clues to answer the questions above glo had a differentiated view on inflation expecting it to be transitory the fund was also bullish on electric vehicles and china below are some quotes from the annual report if goods and labor shortages are pandemicâ induced that suggests the stagflation thesis which calls for weak growth accompanied by uncontrollable price increases is unlikely that is possibly the reason the tenâ year u s treasury yield is struggling to get to 2 the positive to all this is slower demand growth will give the u s federal reserve the â fedâ room to slow the move to tapering while the fund holds tesla inc largely because of the companyâ s scale and technology lead our holdings also include two chinaâ based companies contemporary amperex technology co ltd and byd co ltd both large battery manufacturers and the china internet stocks are cheap that suggests chinaâ s housing market is too big to fail and government will intervene to avoid debt liquidation and the likelihood of any systemic collapse has a low probability we would argue chinaâ s housing stock will always need investment as much of chinaâ s housing was built for a 20â year life and many of the cranes you see in city centers are to replace construction made 20â 30 years ago sometimes all stars strike out in essence glo s star manager got the macro calls wrong with the benefit of hindsight it is clear that all three calls mentioned in the annual report went horribly wrong inflation was not transitory and the u s 10 year treasury yield climbed to over 4 causing the worst bond selloff since the 1940s while electric vehicles continue to be adopted by consumers ev and related company stocks have been horrible investments with by catl and byd both declining by 50 from 2021 highs and everybody knows what happened with chinese housing related stocks and bonds the weakness in glo s strategy is its reliance on the star manager to make differentiated macro calls unfortunately nobody gets the macro calls right all the time even the greats like stanley druckenmiller only get 6 out of 10 calls right and in this case glo got all the major calls wrong at the same time the problem is if we look at figure 7 at the best of times it performs on par with a passive index fund like the urth etf however if you include the poor 2022 performance glo s long term 10 yr average annual return of 3 7 to september 30 2022 vastly underperforms the passive urth etf s 8 3 figure 8 figure 8 urth average annual returns ishares com distribution yield glo pays a very high distribution of 0 0943 per month which annualizes to a 19 8

expenses of 2 78 in fiscal 2021 conclusion the glo fund relies heavily on its star manager to make differentiated macro calls unfortunately those calls proved to be wrong in 2022 leading to abysmal short term performance although the yield looks attractive at 19 8 there is a significant risk the distribution may be cut as it is clearly unsustainable judging by investment performance

vote occurs when a broker submits a proxy card with respect to shares of common stock held in a fiduciary capacity typically referred to as being held in street name but declines to vote on a

the shares with respect to matters that are considered to be routine but not with respect to non routine matters in the event that a broker bank or other agent indicates on a proxy that it does not have discretionary authority to vote certain shares on a non routine proposal then those shares will be treated as broker non votes we believe that all proposals in this proxy statement other than i

review and evaluation the board may solicit the views of management and other members of the board and may conduct interviews of proposed candidates the board generally requires that all candidates

separate the chairman and chief executive officer positions if it believes that doing so would serve the best interests of our company and its stockholders the board of directors has not named a lead

present at the annual meeting and entitled to vote either in person or by proxy is required for approval of proposal no 2 for purposes of the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm abstentions and broker non votes will have no effect on the result of the vote the board of directors recommends that stockholders vote for proposal no 2 10 proposal no 3 increase in number of authorized shares of common stock from 200 000 000 shares to 800 000 000 shares overview the board of directors has unanimously approved subject to stockholder approval an amendment to article 4 a of our certificate of incorporation certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 200 000 000 shares to 800 000 000 shares if this amendment is approved by our stockholders article 4 a of our certificate of incorporation will be amended and restated in its entirety as follows the total number of shares of capital stock which the corporation shall have authority to issue is eight hundred and fifty million 850 000 000 shares the classes and aggregate number of shares of each class which the corporation shall have the authority to issue are as follows 1 eight hundred million 800 000 000 shares of common stock par value 0 0001 per share the common stock and 2 fifty million 50 000 000 shares of preferred stock par value of 0 0001 per share the preferred stock the remaining provisions of our certificate of incorporation would remain unchanged the board of directors has determined that this amendment is in the best interest of the company and its stockholders and recommends that the stockholders approve this amendment as of november 10 2022 we have 179 756 491 authorized but unissued shares of our common stock and 49 496 492 authorized but unissued shares of our preferred stock which we believe is inadequate to provide us with the flexibility necessary to respond to future needs and opportunities if the amendment is approved then the number of authorized but unissued shares of common stock would be increased to 709 565 676 and the number of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock would remain at 49 496 492 the board of directors believes that the proposed increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock will benefit us by improving our flexibility in responding to future business needs and opportunities the additional authorized shares will be available for issuance from time to time to enable us to respond to future business opportunities requiring the issuance of shares including stock splits or dividends the consummation of common stock based and preferred stock based financings acquisition or strategic joint venture transactions involving the issuance of common stock or preferred stock issuances of common stock or preferred stock under our 2020 long term incentive plan or if approved our 2022 employee incentive plan or any new equity compensation plans that we may adopt in the future and issuances of common stock or preferred stock for other general corporate purposes that the board of directors may deem advisable the board of directors is seeking approval for the amendment at this time because opportunities requiring prompt action may arise in the future and the board of directors believes the delay and expense in seeking approval for additional authorized common stock at a special meeting of stockholders could deprive us and our stockholders of the ability to take advantage of potential opportunities the terms upon which any such shares of common stock or preferred stock may be issued would be determined by the board of directors our stockholders have no preemptive rights to acquire additional shares of common stock or preferred stock which means that current stockholders do not have a right to purchase any new issuance of shares of common stock or preferred stock in order to maintain their proportionate ownership interests in the company since our stockholders have no preemptive rights we could implement the amendment at any time following stockholder approval without further authorization from the stockholders of the company except to the extent otherwise required by law or regulation or nasdaq rules and listing standards the additional shares for which authorization is sought would be identical to the shares of our common stock now authorized the proposed increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock is not intended to impede a change of control of the company and we are not aware of any current efforts to acquire control of the company or otherwise accumulate shares of our common stock or preferred stock it is possible however that the additional shares contemplated by the amendment could be issued in connection with defending the company against a hostile takeover bid to dilute the equity ownership of a person or entity seeking to obtain control of the company or in a private placement with purchasers who might side with the board of directors if it chose to oppose a specific change of control these additional shares also could be issued in order to deter an attempt to replace the board of directors by diluting the percentage of shares held by persons seeking to control us by obtaining seats on the board of directors accordingly the amendment could have the effect of discouraging efforts to gain control of the company in a matter not approved by the board of directors the actual issuance of additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock in the future could have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and on the equity and voting rights of the present holders of our common stock and preferred stock we currently have no formal plans understandings contracts agreements or arrangements with respect to the issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock not previously authorized for issuance by the board of directors assuming the existence of a quorum the proposal to amend article 4 a of our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 200 000 000 shares to 800 000 000 shares requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of the record date because the proposal requires the vote of outstanding shares as opposed to votes cast abstentions will have the effect of a negative vote on this proposal if the amendment is approved by our stockholders it will become effective upon the filing of certificate of amendment with the secretary of state of the state of delaware vote required and board of directors recommendation assuming a quorum is present the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present at the annual meeting either in person or by proxy and entitled to vote is required for approval of this proposal no 3 because your vote is advisory it will not be binding upon our board of directors for purposes of the approval of proposal no 3 abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against this proposal and broker non votes will have no effect on the result of the vote the board of directors recommends that stockholders vote for proposal no 3 11 proposal no 4 proposal to approve 2022 employee incentive plan on october 31 2022 our board of directors approved the adoption subject to stockholder approval at the annual meeting of the crown electrokinetics corp 2022 employee incentive plan the 2022 plan as part of this process our board of directors reviewed the number of shares available under the crown electrokinetics corp 2022 employee incentive plan the 2022 plan and determined that the approximately 685 750 shares available for grant thereunder represented an insufficient number of shares to enable us to provide sufficient future grants of stock options or other stock awards as we seek to expand our business operations as a result our board of directors believes that the adoption of the 2022 plan is necessary and in the best interests of our company and its long term strategic growth to permit us to continue to attract retain and motivate officers employees non employee directors and consultants potentially all of our employees officers directors and consultants will be eligible to participate in the 2022 plan because participation in and the types of awards that may be made under the 2022 plan are subject to the discretion of the compensation committee or the board as applicable we cannot determine the dollar value or number of shares of common stock that will in the future be received by or allocated to any participant or groups of participants including our directors executive officers and other employees as of november 9 2022 there were approximately 3 executive officers and approximately 2 non employee directors of our company who will be eligible to participate in the 2022 plan during the 2021 fiscal year we granted options to purchase up to an aggregate of 13 149 shares of common stock to our executive officers as a group and granted 2 261 905 restricted shares of common stock to our executive officers as a group during

to awards under the 2022 plan shall automatically increase on the first trading day of each calendar year beginning with the 2023 calendar year by such number of shares of common stock as are necessary so that the total number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2022 plan shall be equal to 19 9 of the total number of outstanding shares of common stock determined on a fully diluted basis as of the applicable trading date the stipulated percentage b our board of directors may act prior to january 1st of a given calendar year to provide that i there will be no such automatic annual increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2022 plan or ii the increase in the number of shares for such calendar year will be a lesser number of shares than necessary to maintain the stipulated percentage of shares reserved for issuance under the 2022 plan and c unless an increase in shares reserved for issuance under the 2022 plan in excess of the initial share limit

directors interest of certain persons each of our directors and executive officers would be eligible to participate in the 2022 plan as a result approval of the 2022 plan impacts each of our directors and executive officers and each of them has a personal interest in this proposal and its approval by our stockholders vote required and board of directors recommendation assuming a quorum is present the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present at the annual meeting either in person or by proxy and entitled to vote is required for approval of this proposal no 4 because your vote is advisory it will not be binding upon our board of directors for purposes of the approval of proposal no 4 abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against this proposal and broker non votes will have no effect on the result of the vote the board of directors recommends that stockholders vote for proposal no 4 17 proposal no 5 proposal to approve reverse stock split of our common stock in a ratio of not more than 1 for 15 general description of corporate action on november 9 2022 the board approved the proposal to amend our certificate of incorporation to enable a potential reverse split the reverse split of our outstanding shares of common stock within a ratio of not less than 1 for 2 and not more than 1 for 15 to be selected at the discretion of our board stockholder approval of this proposal will authorize our board in its sole discretion to determine whether to effect the reverse split and to set the exact ratio within the range at which the reverse split will be effected at any time prior to our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders our board believes that approval of this proposal to effect the reverse split and to determine the ratio as opposed to approval of an immediate reverse stock split at a specific ratio and to effect such reverse stock split at any time prior to our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders will provide our board with maximum flexibility to react to current market conditions and therefore to achieve the purposes of the reverse split if implemented and to act in the best interests of our stockholders effecting the reverse split requires that our certificate of incorporation be amended if approved the reverse split will be effective upon the filing of a certificate of amendment to the certificate of incorporation in the form attached to this proxy statement as annex b the certificate of amendment with the secretary of state of delaware with such filing to occur if at all at the sole discretion of the board reasons for approving the reverse split the intention of the board in obtaining approval for the authority to effect a reverse split would be to increase the stock price of our common stock sufficiently above the 1 00 minimum bid price requirement to regain its listing on the nasdaq capital market nasdaq the board in its sole discretion can elect to abandon the reverse split in its entirety at any time one principal effect of the reverse split would be to decrease the number of outstanding shares of our common stock as described below except for de minimus adjustments that may result from the treatment of fractional shares as described below the reverse split will not have any dilutive effect on our stockholders whether such stockholders hold common stock since each stockholder would hold the same percentage of our common stock in hand or on an as converted basis outstanding immediately following the reverse split as such stockholder held immediately prior to the reverse split the relative voting and other rights that accompany the shares would not be affected by the reverse split general effect of the reverse split the table below shows the effect of the reverse split combined with the effect of the authorized shares increase on the common stock issued and outstanding as of the date hereof assuming an exchange ratio of each of 1 5 1 10 and 1 15 respectively for the reverse split the columns labeled after reverse split and authorized shares increase in the table do not reflect the adjustments that will result from the issuance of additional shares to certain holders to round up their fractional shares the company cannot calculate at this time the number of whole shares that will be issued in lieu of fractions as a result of the reverse split shares of common stock prior to reverse split and authorized shares increase after authorized shares increase and reverse split 1 for 5 after authorized shares increase and reverse split 1 for 10 after authorized shares increase and

a potential reverse split is to raise the per share trading price of our common stock our common stock currently trades on nasdaq under the symbol crkn on september 1 2022 we received a deficiency notice from nasdaq informing us that our common stock failed to comply with the 1 minimum bid price required for continued listing on the nasdaq capital market under nasdaq listing rule 5550 a 2 based upon the closing bid price of the common stock for the 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the notice from nasdaq to regain compliance the minimum bid price of the common stock must meet or exceed 1 00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days at any time prior to february 28 2023 if we do not regain compliance with rule 5550 a 2 by february 28 2023 we may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day compliance period to qualify we would be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for the nasdaq capital market with the exception of the bid price requirement and would need to provide written notice of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period for example by effecting a reverse stock split if necessary however if it appears to the nasdaq staff that we will not be able to cure the deficiency or if we are otherwise not eligible nasdaq would notify us that its securities would be subject to delisting in the event of such a notification we may appeal the nasdaq staff s determination to delist our securities our board believes that the reverse split and any resulting increase in the per share price of our common stock will enhance the acceptability and marketability of our common stock to the financial community and investing public many institutional investors have policies prohibiting them from holding lower priced stocks in their portfolios which reduces the number of potential buyers of our common stock although we have not been told by them that is the reason for not investing in our common stock additionally analysts at many brokerage firms are reluctant to recommend lower priced stocks to their clients or monitor the activity of lower priced stocks brokerage houses frequently have internal practices and policies that discourage individual brokers from dealing in lower priced stocks further because brokers commissions on lower priced stock generally represent a higher percentage of the stock price than commissions on higher priced stock investors in lower priced stocks pay transaction costs which are a higher percentage of their total share value which may limit the willingness of individual investors and institutions to purchase our common stock we cannot assure you that the reverse split will have any of the desired effects described above more specifically we cannot assure you that after the reverse split the market price of our common stock will increase proportionately to reflect the ratio for the reverse split that the market price of our common stock will not decrease to its pre split level that our market capitalization will be equal to the market capitalization before the reverse split or that we will be able to maintain our listing on nasdaq potential disadvantages of the reverse split as noted above the principal purpose of the reverse split would be to help increase the per share market price of our common stock by up to a factor of at least 15 we cannot assure you however that the reverse split will accomplish this objective for any meaningful period of time while we expect that the reduction in the number of outstanding shares of common stock will increase the market price of our common stock we cannot assure you that the reverse split will increase the market price of our common stock by a multiple equal to the number of pre split shares or result in any permanent increase in the market price of our common stock which is dependent upon many factors including our business and financial performance general market conditions and prospects for future success if the per share market price does not increase proportionately as a result of the reverse split then the value of our company as measured by our stock capitalization will be reduced perhaps significantly the number of shares held by each individual holder of common stock would be reduced if the reverse split is implemented this will increase the number of stockholders who hold less than a round lot or 100 shares typically the transaction costs to stockholders selling odd lots are higher on a per share basis consequently the reverse split could increase the transaction costs to existing holders of common stock in the event they wish to sell all or a portion of their position although our board believes that the decrease in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as a consequence of the reverse split and the anticipated increase in the market price of our common stock could encourage interest in our common stock and possibly promote greater liquidity for our stockholders such liquidity could also be adversely affected by the reduced number of shares outstanding after the reverse split 19 effecting the reverse split upon receipt of stockholder approval for the reverse split proposal if our board concludes that it is in the best interests of our company and our stockholders to effect the reverse split the certificate of amendment will be filed with the secretary of state of delaware the actual timing of the filing of the certificate of amendment with the secretary of state of delaware to effect the reverse split will be determined by our board in addition if for any reason our board deems it advisable to do so the reverse split may be abandoned at any time prior to the filing of the certificate of amendment without further action by our stockholders in addition our board may deem it advisable to effect the reverse split even if the price of our common stock is above 1 00 at the time the reverse split is to be effected the reverse split will be effective as of the date of filing of the certificate of amendment with the secretary of state of the state of delaware the effective time upon the filing of the certificate of amendment without further action on our part or our stockholders the outstanding shares of common stock held by stockholders of record as of the effective time would be converted into a lesser number of shares of common stock based on a reverse split ratio as determined by the board effect on outstanding shares options and certain other securities if the reverse split is implemented the number of shares our common stock owned by each stockholder will be reduced in the same proportion as the reduction in the total number of shares outstanding such that the percentage of our common stock owned by each stockholder will remain unchanged except for any de minimus change resulting from rounding up to the nearest number of whole shares so that we are not obligated to issue cash in lieu of any fractional shares that such stockholder would have received as a result of the reverse split the number of shares of our common stock that may be purchased upon exercise of outstanding options or other securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of our common stock and the exercise or conversion prices for these securities will also be ratably adjusted in accordance with their terms as of the effective time effect on registration our common stock is currently registered under the securities act of 1933 as amended and we are subject to the periodic reporting and other requirements of the exchange act the proposed reverse split will not affect the registration of our common stock fractional shares exchange of stock certificates our board does not currently intend to issue fractional shares in connection with the reverse split therefore we do not expect to issue certificates representing fractional shares in lieu of any fractional shares we will issue to stockholders of record who would otherwise hold a fractional share because the number of shares of common stock they hold of record before the reverse split is not evenly divisible by the reverse split ratio that number of shares of common stock as rounded up to the nearest whole share no stockholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares as of the record date we had holders of record of our common stock we do not expect the reverse split and the rounding up of fractional shares to whole shares to result in a significant reduction in the number of record holders we presently do not intend to seek any change in our status as a reporting company for federal securities law purposes either before or after the reverse split on or after the effective time we will mail a letter of transmittal to each stockholder each stockholder will be able to obtain a certificate evidencing his her or its post reverse split shares only by sending the exchange agent who will be our transfer agent the stockholder s old stock certificate s together with the properly executed and completed letter of transmittal and such evidence of ownership of the shares as we may require stockholders will not receive certificates for post reverse split shares unless and until their old certificates are surrendered stockholders should not forward their certificates to the exchange agent until they receive the letter of transmittal and they should only send in their certificates with the letter of transmittal the exchange agent will send each stockholder if elected in the letter of transmittal a new stock certificate after receipt of that stockholder s properly completed letter of transmittal and old stock certificate s a stockholder that surrenders his her or its old stock certificate s but does not elect to receive a new stock certificate in the letter of transmittal will be deemed to have requested to hold that stockholder s shares electronically in book entry form with our transfer agent 20 certain of our registered holders of common stock hold some or all of their shares electronically in book entry form with our transfer agent these stockholders do not have stock certificates evidencing their ownership of our common stock they are however provided with a statement reflecting the number of shares registered in their accounts if a stockholder holds registered shares in book entry form with our transfer agent the stockholder may return a properly executed and completed letter of transmittal stockholders who hold shares in street name through a nominee such as a bank or broker will be treated in the same manner as stockholders whose shares are registered in their names and nominees will be instructed to effect the reverse split for their beneficial holders however nominees may have different procedures and stockholders holding shares in street name should contact their nominees stockholders will not have to pay any service charges in connection with the exchange of their certificates authorized shares if and when our board elects to effect the reverse split the certificate of amendment will not reduce the authorized number of shares of our capital stock in accordance with our certificate of incorporation and delaware law our stockholders do not have any preemptive rights to purchase or subscribe for any of our unissued or treasury shares anti takeover and dilutive effects the authorized common stock will not be diluted as a result of the reverse split the common stock that is authorized but unissued provides the board with flexibility to effect among other transactions public or private financings acquisitions stock dividends stock splits and the granting of equity incentive awards however these authorized but unissued shares may also be used by our board consistent with and subject to its fiduciary duties to deter future attempts to gain control of us or make such actions more expensive and less desirable the certificate of amendment would continue to give our board authority to issue additional shares from time to time without delay or further action by the stockholders except as may be required by applicable law or regulations the certificate of amendment is not being recommended in response to any specific effort of which we are aware to obtain control of us nor does our board have any present intent to use the authorized but unissued common stock or preferred stock to impede a takeover attempt there are no plans or proposals to adopt other provisions or enter into any arrangements that have material anti takeover effects accounting consequences as of the effective time the stated capital attributable to common stock on our balance sheet will be reduced proportionately based on the reverse split ratio that is determined by the board including a retroactive adjustment of prior periods and the additional paid in capital account will be credited with the amount by which the stated capital is reduced reported per share net income or loss will be higher because there will be fewer shares of our common stock outstanding federal income tax consequences the following discussion is a summary of the u s federal income tax consequences of the reverse split generally applicable to u s holders as defined below of our common stock and is based upon u s federal income tax law and relevant interpretations thereof in effect as of the date of this proxy statement all of which are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect this summary does not discuss all aspects of u s federal income taxation that may be important to you in light of your individual circumstances

the writer a los angeles freelancer is a former detroit news business reporter who blogs at starkman approved by eric starkman one might expect that a practice of about 50 orthopedic surgeons ranked as the nation s 11th best would be getting the kid gloves treatment from the hospital where they perform their surgeries but at beaumont health supposedly a not for profit hospital network even the superstars aren t immune to the margin boosting ways of ceo john fox and coo carolyn wilson ceo john fox and coo carolyn wilson more than a year ago beaumont asked the trauma practice leaders of its royal oak and troy hospitals to evaluate medical implant devices from stryker corp a kalamazoo based medical technologies firm to determine whether they were of sufficient quality to use for 75 percent of the hospital s trauma procedures the leaders said they weren t nevertheless beaumont moved forward with a contract requiring its orthopods to use stryker products 75 percent of the time most surgeons resisted declaring that rival company devices they d trained with in their residencies and fellowships were far superior beaumont then issued an edict jeffrey fischgrund a spine surgeon and a top beaumont executive last august sent an email declaring that going forward any surgeon wanting to use alternative devices to stryker s must get his permission notably fischgrund insisted that all requests be made by phone not in writing several surgeons insisted on written requests to establish a paper trail dr jeffrey fischgrund on july 9 brett whitbread an mba grad with beaumont s value analysis team alerted orthopedic surgeons that they only used stryker products 48 percent of the time in may rather than the mandated 75 percent as a result whitbread said beaumont would no longer keep non stryker implant devices sterilized in advance thereby pressuring surgeons to use readily available sterilized stryker products the beaumont that john fox has instilled in the past five years is all about profits not patient safety said one beaumont surgeon whitbread s decision sparked a massive uproar as surgeons argued it would compromise patient safety the pushback was so fierce that firschgrund was forced to overrule whitbread s decision still beaumont s orthopedic surgeons are angered by the frequent lack of sterilized equipment they require thanks to chronic staff shortages because beaumont pays its equipment sterilization staff poorly often there is no one available to do the work delays can be so lengthy that one beaumont surgeon who recently began his day at 7 30 a m finished his last procedure at 11 p m canceling procedures he was among the more fortunate beaumont orthopedic surgeons increasingly are forced to cancel their procedures after several hours of delays because their preferred implant devices aren t in stock adding insult to injury the surgeons are personally required to inform patients and families of the delays and cancellations rather than someone from administration beaumont s orthopedic surgeons are also angry about wilson s decision to award a contract to a deep discount outsourcing provider called northstar to oversee and manage anesthesiology services at most beaumont hospitals as a result more than 100 of beaumont s current anesthesiologists the majority of them fellowship trained will be replaced northstar relies more heavily on lesser trained certified registered nurse anesthetists related the craig fahle podcast why beaumont health is in trouble not surprisingly many of beaumont s orthopedic surgeons are applying to join other hospitals or increasingly looking to perform their procedures at ambulatory surgical centers they must be grinning ear to ear over at st joseph mercy said one surgeon referring to the closest hospital to beaumont s flagship royal oak campus beaumont s orthopedic surgeons believe the hospital has a financial incentive to insist on the use of stryker s orthopedic implant products the statement issued by spokesman mark geary implies that s the case the selection of the products we choose is done by panels of our expert physicians our selection criteria for any patient care product is driven by high quality after we identify the highest quality product we work to secure the product in the most affordable way the industry uses many mechanisms for charging hospitals including discounts and rebates all of this is done in a legally appropriate manner using the highest ethical and legal standards these types of arrangements are standard in the health care industry stryker is a fortune 500 company with a history of controversies a subsidiary in december 2014 pleaded guilty to marketing and selling certain knee replacement products without government approval the subsidiary s ceo pleaded guilty to a felony charge in november 2014 stryker agreed to pay 1 billion to resolve separate litigation over thousands of hip implants recalled in 2012 after patients complained of pain swelling and metal debris stryker s knee implant device featured on beaumont s website also was subject to a product liability lawsuit fleeing surgeons beaumont s elite orthopedic surgeons are hardly alone in their outrage and disgust with beaumont s business practices and what they say is fox s and wilson s prioritization of profits over patient care more than 20 cardiac specialists at beaumont s flagship are known to be actively negotiating to join area hospitals and alan and julie koffron prominent liver and pancreatic surgeons have let it be known they too plan to jump ship last year marc sakwa chief of cardiac surgery at royal oak and jeffrey altshuler another prominent surgeon resigned a beaumont surgeon for weeks has been circulating a petition among doctors declaring no confidence in fox and david wood jr beaumont s chief medical officer many doctors were hesitant to sign because they feared management reprisals beaumont s head of pediatrics is understood to have been fired and escorted from his office after objecting to policies he believed would harm patient care the detroit free press and the detroit news reported on the petition last week and deadline detroit has reported critically about fox s and wilson s leadership for several weeks beaumont s board of directors held an emergency meeting monday evening the purpose isn t publicly known in a possibly ominous sign beaumont s doctors received a survey wednesday asking various questions including their confidence in beaumont s management and whether a proposed merger with advocate aurora would lead to improved patient care fox in june proposed merging beaumont into advocate aurora a reputationally inferior hospital network with dual headquarters in illinois and wisconsin doctors have been assured their responses will remain anonymous so it s pretty much a given the findings will be quite damning in the months i ve been writing about beaumont i ve yet to hear one beaumont employee say something remotely positive about fox wilson or anyone else in senior management team leaders who execute management directives are derided by staff as having drank the beaumont kool aid separately multiple beaumont employees say fox s claim that half of the 2 400 employees beaumont laid off in april have been called back is misleading while the 50 percent callbacks may be true insiders say that beaumont continues to layoff other employees in fact 10 assistant nurse managers were let go at beaumont troy on thursday reach eric starkman at eric starkmanapproved com beaumont

netflix set to shut down a service that has shipped more than 5 billion discs across the u s netflix s trailblazing dvd by mail rental service has been relegated as a relic in the age of video streaming but there is still a steady albeit shrinking audience of diehards like amanda konkle who are happily paying to receive those discs in the iconic red and white envelopes when you open your mailbox it s still something you actually want instead of just bills said konkle a resident of savannah georgia who has been subscribing to netflix s dvd by mail service since 2005 it s a small pleasure that konkle and other still dedicated dvd subscribers enjoy but it s not clear for how much longer netflix declined to comment for this story but during a 2018 media event co founder and co ceo of netflix reed hastings suggested the dvd by mail service might close around 2023 when not if it happens netflix will shut down a service that has shipped more than 5 billion discs across the u s since its inception nearly a quarter century ago and it will echo the downfall of the thousands of blockbuster video rental stores that closed because they couldn t counter the threat posed by netflix s dvd by mail alternative the eventual demise of its dvd by mail service has been inevitable since hastings decided to spin it off from a then nascent video streaming service in 2011 back then hastings floated the idea of renaming the service as qwikster a bungled idea that was so widely ridiculed that it was satirized on saturday night live it finally settled on its current more prosaic handle dvd com the operation is now based in non descript office in fremont california located about 20 miles from netflix s sleek campus in los gatos california shortly before breakup from video streaming the dvd by mail service boasted more than 16 million subscribers a number that has now dwindled to an estimated 1 5 million subscribers all in the u s based on calculations drawn from netflix s limited disclosures of the service in its quarterly reports netflix s video streaming service now boasts 223 million worldwide subscribers including 74 million in the u s and canada the dvd by mail business has bequeathed the netflix that everyone now knows and watches today marc randolph netflix s original ceo said during an interview at a coffee shop located across the street from the post office in santa cruz california the 110 year old post office has become a landmark in silicon valley history because it s where randolph mailed a patsy cline cd to hastings in 1997 to test whether a disc could be delivered through the u s postal service without being damaged the disc arrived at hastings home unblemished prompting the duo in 1998 to launch a dvd by mail rental website that they always knew would be supplanted by even more convenient technology it was planned obsolescence but our bet was that it would take longer for it to happen than most people thought at the time randolph said with netflix s successful streaming service it might be easy to assume that anyone still paying to receive dvds through the mail is a technophobe or someone living in a remote part of the u s without reliable internet access but subscribers say they stick with the service so they can rent movies that are otherwise difficult to find on streaming services for michael fusco 35 that includes the 1986 film power starring a then youthful richard gere and denzel washington and 1980 s the big red one starring lee marvin that s among the main reasons he has been subscribing to the dvd by service since 2006 when he was just a freshman in college and he has no plans to cancel it now i have been getting it for almost half my life and it has been a big part fusco said when i was young it helped me discover voices i probably wouldn t have heard i still have memories of getting movies and having them blow my mind tabetha neumann is among the subscribers who rediscovered the dvd service during the throes of the pandemic lockdowns in 2020 after running out of things to watch on her video streaming service so she and her husband signed up again for the first time since canceling in 2011 now they like it so much that they get the a plan that allows them to keep up to three discs at a time an option that currently costs 20 per month compared to 10 per month for the one disc plan when we started going through all the movies we wanted to see we realized it was cheaper than paying 5 per movie on some streaming services neumann said plus we have found a lot of old horror movies and that genre is not really big on streaming konkle who has written a book about marilyn monroe s films says she still finds movies on the dvd service such as the 1954 film cattle queen of montana featuring future u s president ronald reagan alongside barbara stanwyck and the 1983 french film sugar cane alley that help her teach her film studies classes as an associate professor at georgia southern university it s a viewing habit she doesn t usually share with her classes because most of my students don t know what a dvd is said konkle 40 laughing but for all the dvd service s attractions subscribers are starting to notice signs of deterioration as the business has shrunk from producing more than 1 billion in annual revenue a year ago to an amount likely to fall below 200 million in revenue this year katie cardinale a subscriber who lives in hopedale massachusetts says she now has to wait an additional two to four days for discs to arrive in the mail than she used to because they are shipped from a distribution center in new jersey instead of boston netflix doesn t disclose how many dvd distribution centers still operate but there were once about 50 of them in the u s konkle says more discs now come with cracks or other defects in them and it takes forever to get them replaced and almost all subscribers have noticed the selection of dvd titles has shrunk dramatically from the service s peak years when netflix boasted it had more than 100 000 different movies and tv shows on disc netflix no longer discloses the size of its dvd library but the subscribers interviewed by the ap all reported the narrowing selection is making it more difficult to find famous films and popular tv series that once were routinely available on the service instead netflix now sorts requests for titles such as the first season of the award winning ted lasso series a release that can be purchased on dvd into a saved queue signaling it may decide to stock it in

netflix s trail blazing dvd by mail rental service has been relegated as a relic in the age of video streaming but there is still a steady albeit shrinking audience of diehards like amanda konkle who are happily paying to receive those discs in the iconic red and white envelopes when you open your mailbox it s still something you actually want instead of just bills said konkle a resident of savannah georgia who has been subscribing to netflix s dvd by mail service since 2005 it s a small pleasure that konkle and other still dedicated dvd subscribers enjoy but it s not clear for how much longer netflix declined to comment for this story but during a 2018 media event co founder and co ceo of netflix reed hastings suggested the dvd by mail service might close around 2023 when not if it happens netflix will shut down a service that has shipped more than 5 billion discs across the u s since its inception nearly a quarter century ago and it will echo the downfall of the thousands of blockbuster video rental stores that closed because they couldn t counter the threat posed by netflix s dvd by mail alternative the eventual demise of its dvd by mail service has been inevitable since hastings decided to spin it off from a then nascent video streaming service in 2011 back then hastings floated the idea of renaming the service as qwikster a bungled idea that was so widely ridiculed that it was satirized on saturday night live it finally settled on its current more prosaic handle dvd com the operation is now based in nondescript office in fremont california located about 20 miles

nigerian men have been advised to develop emotional intelligence skills that would enable them to competently deal with the myriads of challenges that confront them daily especially now that the country is experiencing an economic downturn the advise was given by experts during a recent event organised by the peak performer africa to mark this year s international men s day in lagos speaking at the event which was held with the theme the magic of emotional intelligence the managing director of transatlantic development limited dr bankole allibay stated that emotional intelligence plays a central role in ensuring that men are able to stand firm in the midst of all the issues that they need to manage on a daily basis allibay who is a consultant at the world bank noted oftentimes there is this assumption that men have it all figured out and that they are actually doing well and perfect the truth of the matter is that the global business place actually requires more from us now than it has been over the years that means that we need to put in more than what we have in stock over the years so we need to reinvent ourselves and actually be up to the task and this is something that we cannot do without the internal energy which actually breeds from our emotional intelligence because the gap in that performance will actually leave a gap in all areas from children mentoring to family management business career and every aspect of our lives so emotional intelligence plays a central role in ensuring that we are able to stand firm in the midst of all these issues that we need to manage specifically speaking on how emotional intelligence could help men surmount the challenges posed by the current economic downturn in the country allibay added emotional intelligence is beyond us just reading the books it is basically making an informed decision at every point in time so at every point in time we need to take responsibility for our responses we need to be sure that we are making the best judgment at every point in time it s not an easy procedure it s a very challenging procedure but we need to consult our best reasonable resources at every point in time to be sure that we are making the best decision if not a simple response from an action of someone else can actually ruin our day so it is better for us to take a step back reassess the situation and be very skilful in responding so that we don t destroy the bigger picture with very minute details so that s very important on his part the head of marketing and corporate communications department ecobank nigeria babajide sipe noted that because every man goes through circles where he works with other people and has a family and children to raise it is important that he understands how to manage his emotions when he is in the midst of people people come from different backgrounds and different experiences how do you manage those experiences how do you manage people s expectations how do you manage people s reactions to certain things how are you able to actually put yourself in other people s shoes to be able to ensure that what you would like to be done to you is what you are doing to others also how do you reciprocate situations that are outside your control how do you stay back and think before you react to certain things so a lot of those things that go through our mind as men are the reason we are talking about emotional intelligence and why we need to understand how to manage our emotions as men he said in his remarks a television broadcaster and president of the united states government exchange alumni association nigeria mike okwoche noted that focusing on emotional intelligence was a very good way to celebrate international men s day in nigeria okwoche who applauded the peak performer africa for organising the event said emotional intelligence is what everybody underrates in the society but that is the crux of our inter relationships the reason people quarrel or have issues is because of insensitivity to each other and a lack of empathy so if you have consideration for what the other person is going through as the case may be and you have the mindset to assist and help it will reduce the kind of tension chaos and friction in our society so centring on emotional intelligence was a very good way to look at international men s day that window is really important if we have the mastery of our emotions if we have the mastery of our minds and ourselves we will be better off in our families places of work and society publisher of peak

even when he was just a 10 year old kid at haberdashers school rory sutherland was considering a career in advertising having grown up in the golden age of tv he reckons anyone his age couldn t help but be impressed by the commercials of the time that s hardly typical schoolboy thinking but rory is not your average person which is perhaps why the exuberant larger than life character has somehow found himself as a marketing genius who s worked with some of the world s biggest companies including coca cola american express and bt rory who grew up in well to do monmouthshire lives in west kent these days but we catch him during a brief stay in cardiff while he s giving a talk to the chartered institute of marketing at cardiff arms park dressed in bright primary colours with a gold buttoned jacket thrown over the top rory s outfit is as ebullient as his conversation his eyebrows have a life of their own underneath a shock of curly greying hair as they shoot up and down animatedly to reflect one of his many wide ranging theories on human behaviour covid on my part put paid to any meeting in person but even over a video call rory s enthusiasm is palpable an hour even in his digital company is like an episode of qi but at twice the speed and a bit more political there s barely a subject that rory doesn t have a view on his conversation bounces around seemingly randomly as ideas pop into his head from sleeper trains between haverfordwest and london in the eighties to comparing covid symptoms it s boundless he says interesting more times than i can count it s okay to be lazy post covid he says which somehow doesn t feel like a word that often pops up in rory s vocabulary image john myers rory is immediately likeable and genuinely interested in anything i say when he realises i m in pembrokeshire he tells me about his grandfather a doctor from tredegar who dreamed of retiring to pembrokeshire sadly he died before he got the chance but not before he d built several houses in little haven and ensured that the family enjoyed many holidays in west wales they are happy memories rory says cheerfully he s enjoyed his stay in the capital cardiff has a very interesting marketing crowd he confides in part due to the influence of the big insurance companies like admiral so begins another burst of enthusiasm what a fantastic city it is by the way he says jovially every time i go back to cardiff it s more interesting than the last time it does feel like coming home what i notice particularly having grown up in monmouth which let s be honest is fairly anglicised part of wales is you don t really realise you re welsh until you leave a big difference between wales and his home in the south east is that every commercial exchange even if you re just buying a cup of coffee involves a degree of social exchange as well he says there is some sort of general human warmth wrapped into every transaction which is not always the case in parts of southern england rory 57 has spent his entire career in the world of london ad agencies having started out as a graduate at ogilvy mather in 1988 after studying classics at cambridge i learned more in my first three years there than during my entire time at university he said there is a myth that education adds more to human capital than an equivalent time spent in an interesting business but i don t think that s true any more founded by david ogilvy a proud and passionate scot ogilvy mather grew into one of the biggest advertising networks in the world the man behind the brand famously said the customer is not a moron she s your wife and you will never win fame and fortune unless you invent big ideas more than three decades later rory is still there having risen through the ranks to spearhead its behavioural science unit ogilvychange gaining twitter s blue tick and ted talks along the way these days he s the vice chairman of what is the ogilvy mather group of companies he writes a fortnightly column in the spectator has written three books and it s been known for government advisers to phone him up and ask for his opinion this is a man who possibly knows more about us than we know about ourselves life as a boy in usk was a good one rory s parents were entrepreneurial and dabbled in property development running a steamboat on the usk canal and coming up with the odd invention rory enjoyed his school days and came away with a levels in maths further maths latin and greek i think if you grow up within a small business setting is like a free mba he says almost by osmosis i think you pick up a lot of the instincts of business just by participating in family life and involved in those questions rory always had a creative bent he continues for instance if you gave me a puzzle to solve i d only be interested in how oblique the solution was not how practical it was the school system encourages people to believe there is one single right answer to a question but i prefer questions where there is more than one it s the reason he s keen on detective fiction and cryptic crosswords he adds image john myers rory started out in ogilvy s planning department in 1988 but he was fired just a year later over a personal disagreement he wasn t rubbish at the job he insists it was merely a difference of opinion but the experience did help rory realise just how much he wanted to become a copywriter at ogilvy which he did also in that first year he learnt one very important lesson testing direct marketing messages the way people make decisions isn t the way we think we think he explains it often bears little relation to how we actually choose but in those days the job demanded a constant supply of ideas the bigger the better around which long running and expensive campaigns could be constructed it was the era in which television commercials spawned catchphrases dreamed up by copywriters which would become a part of mainstream culture that remain to this day think snap crackle and pop beanz meanz heinz finger lickin good rory is not an accountant in fact he blames economic theory for forcing marketing into stasis for all the brilliant ads the impact of tv advertising throughout the eighties and nineties was notoriously hard to measure the industry motto famously went i know half is working i just don t know which half but all that changed with the arrival of the internet as attention spans were dispersed across a whole new set of screens it offered the promise of a direct communication channel between seller and buyer the uncertainty of tv targeting was replaced by a new mantra of measurable customer engagement creative ideas were replaced with data and evidence to their detriment said rory the upshot is a world oversupplied with economists technocrats analysts and spreadsheet tweakers leaving very little room for magic and even emotion when you demand logic you pay a hidden price you destroy magic he writes in alchemy the surprising power of ideas that don t make sense we ve developed models for looking at the world which aren t necessarily bad but have been too universally used and believed he says just as the map is not the territory the tube map is a good way of thinking of the underground system but it s a very bad map of london economics is to the real world of business what the tube map is as a guide for getting around london it s sometimes useful and sometimes woefully misleading when everyone s using the same map it becomes more important for the things it leaves out as the things it contains rory looks at things differently my definition of marketing is simply the science of knowing what economists are wrong about he says the human mind does not run on logic any more than a horse runs on petrol image john myers there s no doubt rory is well educated and extremely knowledgeable but he somehow wraps all that up in a quirky way of looking at the world he nearly always makes it relatable to my own experiences he s penned columns about the genius of bottomless brunch to me there are no three more beautiful words in the english language than all day breakfast and motorway service stations all with a unique dose of humour and irreverence i see comedy as one of the forces that encourages us to look at things differently he agrees before launching into another theory about human behaviour there s some interesting research which suggests we re not really trying to explain things we re trying to come up with an explanation and once we ve come up with an explanation for something that makes sense we go right that s it done move on nothing to see here he says but there s always more than one explanation i like to say let s look at it a bit deeper about why people buy the things they do and make the decisions they do the same goes for looking at how people responded to the covid vaccine for example we stereotype opinions that disagree with us it s the same reason why we had unattractive features in the whole brexit debate he adds today we have people interested in politics because they see it as a way to solve problems and people in politics because they enjoy winning arguments he starts on another tangent this time about globalisation which inexplicably but somehow seamlessly comes back round to covid and the negativity bias in national media rory certainly is a force of nature and nigh on impossible to keep up with back to his marketing career rory explains that before you influence human behaviour you have to understand how people often don t think what they feel don t say what they think and don t do what they say rory instead recognises and celebrates that we re not robots and acknowledges the gulf between our unconscious emotional motivations and our post rationalisations so for example the fact we re speaking over a video call is a prime example of that it took a pandemic to get this technology to widespread acceptance he says but a logical world would have said do more of this and travel less the power of the internet was something rory worked on years ago in the early nineties rory was the man behind bt s drive to get people to sign up to this new concept called the internet it s almost impossible to believe now but there was a time it had to be sold to us rory adds nobody s noticed it but in terms of consumption the internet has taken away a lot of the advantage of living in a very big city the most interesting place to buy things now is no longer a place it s a channel nearly every topic generates a new theory on consumer patterns his most useful discovery during lockdown was what he calls a chronological hack if you work in the morning then take the afternoon off and then work in the evening after dark you get just as much work done but it feels as if you re on holiday he says triumphantly image john myers as someone who is regarded as a leading expert in the psychology of human behaviour yet who didn t actually study the subject he s entirely self taught he says advertising got me into behavioural science he goes on in those first months as a graduate he realised that mainstream economics was an interesting theory but bore very little relation in some cases to observed reality he says it s been an absolutely enduring source of fascination since that realisation 15 years ago which is why are people doing the things they do psychology doesn t give you the right answer but it does tell you better places to look and questions to ask he continues the marketer approach is as well suited to government as it is creating ads he says his outspoken views have even led the government itself to come knocking i ve given my opinion various times when they ve asked rory says who is highly critical of some of recent moves such as the 1 tax or rules on stamp duty one of the interesting things is if you went to a marketer and said we want to stop people doing this and start doing that instead they would at least have the decency to look at 10 things they could do before they resorted to either bribery or legislation he says government tends to have a very narrow economic view that the only way to get people to do things is to start with legislation and plan b is to use economics incentives and disincentives and only then if they fail do they consider the value of persuasion any marketer worth their salt will try to avoid the economic solution of dropping the product price to get more people to buy it because it s the most expensive solution he continues i ve always wanted to do an experiment where if you say 50 extra free on a bigger bar of chocolate and you put the price up by 50 do more people buy it says rory before acknowledging that s an illegal move and therefore will remain just a theory but he knows people see the deal and when in doubt they prefer to buy on a deal than a non deal or take the m s deal offering three things for 7 you think you re missing out on a deal so you buy the three things he says as it happens rory can actually answer his own question because once or twice a year that chocolate scenario actually happens by mistake he says a leading brand which he cannot divulge admitted that sometimes someone forgets to amend the price you end up doing 50 extra free and it s actually 50 more expensive than the smaller quantity says rory it s embarrassing how much money you make when that happens it all points to how us normal consumers aren t doing a price utility trade off rory adds something else is going on it s all the noise the razzmatazz the crowds fomo all sorts of psychological factors are at play there besides lower prices in fact it s really all about butterfly effects in consumer behaviour the very small contextual changes which can have enormous effects on the decisions people make one example is tripling the sales rate of a call centre by adding just a few sentences to the script effectively he s looking for invented media and discovered media seeking out those unexpected and inexpensive nudges that transform the way that people think and act in simple terms it s all about creating value out of nowhere he says the value of something is perceptually determined and getting people to think about something differently is a way of creating value out of nowhere he says that s why my book is called alchemy he uses the london overground as a prime example most of that existed beforehand but was massively underused he says okay they added new rolling stock and tarted up the stations but effectively by adding that line to the tube map and giving it a name it was all of a sudden the overground you effectively created an m25 for london public transport with mostly just ink more or less day one usage went up by over 100 and people completely rethought london a large part of value is informationally created if you don t understand it or see it in the right way what you ve done is created a product and squandered it because you ve failed to get people to understand it marketing is to think about a thing in a way that makes its value far more apparent it sounds simple but it s not and it s taken a man from wales to show the industry just what it s missing out on read next

researchers conducting excavations in mexico city found a series of boxes containing aztec treasures inside they discovered a cache of aztec ritual offerings including child remains precious stones and several animals including a flamingo an eagle a mexican wolf and a jaguar could it be that they ve found the legendary lost tomb of the aztec king ahuitzotl do the ritual offerings point to the tomb of lost aztec king located in their capital city of tenochtitlan modern day mexico city the templo mayor was the chief temple of the indigenous mexica known today as the aztecs buried at the center of a circular ceremonial platform associated with the aztec patron deity huitzilopochtli archaeologists have uncovered an ancient treasure trove of aztec ritual offerings including 180 coral branches 165 red starfish and a sacrificed jaguar dressed like an aztec warrior clutching a sacrificed eagle aztec priests boxed up and buried these items over 520 years ago experts believe that this indicates that this was once a very sacred site a strange bulge found at the bottom of one of the boxes of treasure has lead researchers to conclude that they have finally identified the lost royal tomb of emperor ahuitzotl an aztec king who ruled from 1486 ad to 1502 ad the treasure trove was unearthed near the templo mayor in mexico city javarman adobe stock a great discovery will soon be made a report in the daily mail explained that the team of archaeologists began excavating the site in 2020 but they were forced to stop during the 2021 lockdowns clutching a sacrificed eagle the sacrificed jaguar was dressed as a warrior with an atlati spear thrower copper bells tied around its ankles and a carved wooden disk on its back dedicated to the aztec patron deity huitzilopochtli at the time they suspected that all of these items as well as the 165 starfish and 180 coral branches were buried over the aztec king s cremated remains analysis of a mysterious bulge in the middle of one of the boxes suggests the researchers were right lead archaeologist dr leonardo lopez lujan has announced that a great discovery will soon be made an example of one of the offering boxes number 126 which could lead the archaeologists to pinpoint the cremated ashes of the lost aztec king mirsa islas inah spanish records seemingly confirm suspicions about aztec kings as the 8th ruler of the aztecs between 1486 ad and 1502 ad ahuitzotl deployed guerrilla warfare tactics on tribes in present day guatemala and along the gulf of mexico sparking what is known as the aztec golden age according to britannica the aztec king ruled the empire until 1503 ad at which time he tried to escape the great flood that devastated tenochtitlán in 1503 smashing his head on a stone lintel templo mayor was rebuilt on six occasions by different aztec emperors and when ahuitzotl died there were two temples dedicated to tlaloc the god of earth fertility and rain and huitzilopochtli the solar god of war when spanish conquistadors arrived in 1521 ad the templo mayor was destroyed and the stones were reused to build the catholic metropolitan cathedral of the assumption of the most blessed virgin mary into heaven while the spanish systematically destroyed aztec architecture they liked to keep records it was thus no surprise that they noted the burial rites of three brothers who served as aztec kings between 1469 ad to 1502 ad according to reuters the three rulers cremated remains were interred with luxury items and the hearts of sacrificed slaves in or near the circular platform at templo major the body of a young man offered to tezcatlipoca huitzilopochtli found at the possible burial site of the aztec king from the spanish codex by bernardino de sahagún public domain discovery of aztec king s tomb would be enormously important joyce marcus at the university of michigan is a specialist in ancient mexican cultures marcus explained that the recently unearthed offerings illuminate the aztec worldview she clarified that the artifacts speak of the aztec ritual economy and demonstrate the obvious links between imperial expansion warfare military prowess and the ruler s role these elaborate rituals and ceremonies according to marcus were conducted to sanctify conquests allowing tributes to flow into the ruler s seat archaeologists have so far located over 200 boxes containing ritual offerings at this site however dr lopez lujan stressed that no aztec royal tomb has ever been found and that the discovery of the aztec king ahuitzotl s tomb would be enormously important adding to the team s suspicions that they are digging into a royal burial site was the 2019 discovery of a child sacrifice this time a the remains of a 9 year old boy buried with a set of flint knives decorated with precious stones and mother of pearl he was wearing a jade bead necklace and priests had attached hawk bone wings to his shoulders to resemble huitzilopochtli the aztec solar deity and war god the researchers suspect both the sacrificed jaguar and the 9 year old boy would have had their hearts ripped out in the ruler s burial ceremony furthermore the skulls of another dozen sacrificed children aged between one to six years old were excavated from a nearby pit while these children were sacrificed several decades earlier than the 9 year old they were all symbolically linked to the god huitzilopochtli archaeologist at work during excavations at the templo mayor in mexico city melitón tapia inah the hunt for ashes is on the archaeologists also recovered hundreds of semi precious green stones and a pink roseate spoonbill a bird from the flamingo family copal incense bars a miniature wooden spear thrower and shield were found with 21 flint knives fashioned to resemble aztec warriors furthermore they recovered an intricate mother of pearl god disk similar to the one found with the sacrificed jaguar the researchers concluded that an aquatic theme binds all of these ritual items and offerings together this could mean that the sacrificed jaguar perhaps represents the watery underworld where the aztecs believed the sun sank each night or possibly the journey of the king s soul after death dr lopez lujan says the goal now is now clear to recover the burial urn of ahuitzotl which would contain the cremated ashes of the lost aztec king top image the

watermark corners was filled with shoppers friday afternoon those with the day after thanksgiving off sipping on drinks while finding holiday gifts the gifts and stationary store has been lucky so far co owner amy trimble said as the variety of stock the store offers allows her to substitute items that have become too expensive due to inflation or will take too long to arrive because of supply chain issues however that doesn t mean everything has been easy they ve had to raise some prices and these days having holiday events like small business saturday are more needed than ever to keep businesses afloat this is the time of year for everyone to really consider how they want their dollars to help and with dollars being limited because of the way our economy is it s more important than ever before that we are intentional with those dollars and make sure that we get the most back out of them trimble said the way to do that is to support local businesses quad cities businesses will open their doors with deals galore for small business saturday relying on holiday season shopping as they continue to face inflation and supply chain issues small businesses make up 99 of the retail sector according to the u s small business administration in an october 2020 report there were 31 7 million small businesses in the united states compared to the 20 139 large businesses joel youngs regional director of the eastern iowa small business development center said a small business is defined as having 500 employees or less the davenport office is located inside eastern iowa community college downtown where he helps more than 350 business owners per year we provide no cost confidential counseling and advising on small business he said whatever business issues our clients want to talk about we are here to help counsel and advise the tax payer funded service is crucial to the success of small businesses because it provides stability and support he said the business community is similar to a tree ecosystem the farther out the deeper you can reach your root system the more you can withstand the winds of economic stress and distress he said the more diverse business climate you have the more you are able to withstand the ups and downs this holiday season shoppers are expected to come out in droves the national retail federation nrf estimates a record 166 3 million people will plan to shop from thanksgiving day through cyber monday that s nearly 8 million more people than the year before and the highest estimate since the nrf began tracking data in 2017 while there is much speculation about inflation s impact on consumer behavior our data tells us that this thanksgiving holiday weekend will see robust store traffic with a record number of shoppers taking advantage of value pricing nrf ceo matthew shay said we are optimistic that retail sales will remain strong in the weeks ahead and retailers are ready to meet consumers however they want to shop with great products at prices they want to pay customers had already come out to the isabel bloom studio showroom and store in droves friday what showroom manager beth lovejoy called a quiet moment was actually a fairly busy time for any other day customers almost packing the place in but without a line out the door she said she expects things to be even busier on saturday stock that showed up late last holiday season due to supply chain issues have helped the studio store this year as problems persist lovejoy said and they haven t had to raise prices on sculptures they re continuing to make more pieces but lovejoy s advice to shoppers is to come out early on small business saturday so they have a better chance of finding what they want the holiday season was about 50 of our revenue for the year so it s great lovejoy said we love being busy the most popular day to shop remains black friday with 114 9 million people planning to score deals of those 67 say they plan to physically go to the store that s up 3 from last year cyber monday is expected to see 63 9 million online shoppers this year having days like black friday and small business saturday are more important than ever for local businesses trimble said walmart and amazon will always be around but that shop on the corner can disappear forever if it isn t supported everyone just needs to remember that every dollar you spend at a local business goes so much farther in staying and supporting the community than that same dollar spent at a at a big box store trimble said and then if you think about it zero comes back if you order online

piranka thesis equities have been recording losses since the beginning of the year on a global scale following escalating inflationary pressures the war in ukraine and a global energy crisis in this precarious environment investors that previously owned or were considering owning stocks and especially etfs with exposure towards foreign equity markets are growing warier in this analysis i look into one of the most popular international etfs the schwab international equity etf nysearca schf in the context of the challenges and prospects surrounding the globe as well as the fund s own features and parameters fund identity schwab s international equities etf tracks the ftse developed ex us index offering exposure towards developed stock markets across the world often viewed as a choice for diversification schf invests in international mid and large cap equities currently the fund maintains around 28b of net assets establishing its position as one of the largest international etfs schf charges a very low and competitive 0 06 expense ratio and pays a generous 3 9 dividend yield some of the etf s largest holdings include companies like nestle otcpk nsrgy 1 8 allocation asml holding asml 1 4 and samsung electronics otcpk ssnlf 1 2 more than 70 of the fund s holdings are companies with market capitalizations greater than 15b and less than 4 are geared towards companies with a 3b or less market cap schf also carries low average valuation multiples with a p e of 12x and a p b of 1 43x in terms of geographic diversification schf largest exposure is geared towards japan 21 3 followed by the u k 13 4 and canada 9 4 the fund only tracks developed economies and offers no exposure towards emerging markets this makes schf a more conservative and less risky choice compared to most international etfs schwab global challenges for equities a phenomenon almost forgotten since the 80s persisting inflationary pressures hurt investor sentiment decrease consumers purchasing power and lead central banks to engage in contractionary monetary policy that puts downward pressure on asset prices and valuations european markets are currently at the forefront of inflation recording yoy increases in prices of as much as 9 5 the situation is also pretty severe in both the u k and the u s asia pacific markets have been relatively less affected so far the war in ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis add to the pessimistic outlook for european markets aided by worsening business expectations international vs u s equities as the u s markets have captured an overwhelming amount of investors attention and interest for many decades in recent years investing in u s stocks and etfs has been easier than ever for investors outside the united states equities and etfs are now widely accessible at very low costs to virtually every potential investor with access to the necessary technological means the same is true for u s investors as well that are now able to easily invest in assets across different markets overall this globalization trend in financial markets is likely to benefit both domestic and foreign investment vehicles especially as far as the retail investor is concerned over the past decade u s stocks have rallied to new highs year in and year out with international markets falling behind by miles since 2010 the cagr of 12 4 for the s p 500 has compared to a 3 8 cagr for schf with most international etfs following a similar low performance trajectory portfolio visualizer the dividend argument on top of any potential diversification benefits schf offers an attractive dividend yield relative to u s broad market indexes and etfs the fund offers a 3 9 dividend yield compared to the s p 500 s 1 6 and the median etf dividend calculated at around 2 2 payouts have grown at a 9 62 cagr over the last five years while the payment frequency is semiannual in short it is fair to point out that schf represents a solid choice for more dividend oriented investors as well international funds comparison while a wide range of international equities etfs are available for investors in today s market for the purposes of this analysis i focus for comparison on schf s biggest competitor vanguard s total international stock etf vxus vxus maintains around 50b of net assets while charging a 0 07 expense ratio and currently offering a 4 0 dividend yield unlike schf vxus offers significant exposure toward emerging markets 25 of total allocation and even more asia pacific exposure despite some major allocation differences the two funds have performed rather similarly over the last decade or so in the table provided below employing the tools offered by portfolio visualizer risk and return data for both funds are available dividend reinvestment is assumed for both funds portfolio visualizer in fact despite a more conservative allocation approach with less exposure towards emerging markets schf has outperformed vxus 3 06 vs 2 50 cagr schwab s etf also displays higher sharpe and sortino ratios indicating superior risk adjusted returns in terms of risk metrics standard deviation and maximum drawdown both funds perform similarly it is important to note once again however that both etfs and international funds in general have significantly underperformed over the past decade as the u s equity market has seen one of its best decades in history foreign markets have lagged a cagr around 2 5 3 5 for a stock etf is rather disappointing overall it remains to be seen if the lagging performance has provided a signal for faster growth in the future or if the stretch of consolidation is bound to persist final thoughts after all things are considered in the midst of a wide set of challenges that compile a precarious outlook for global markets coupled with ample evidence of historical underperformance by ex u s markets many investors would be naturally reluctant to seek further international exposure for their portfolios for the few that will seek more international exposure however schf s efficiency dividends low cost inexpensive valuation multiples and relative attractiveness compared to competitive etfs are the main reasons for investing
brussels when the soviet union collapsed european nations grabbed the peace dividend drastically shrinking their defense budgets their armies and their arsenals with the rise of al qaeda nearly a decade later terrorism became the target requiring different military investments and lighter more expeditionary forces even nato s long engagement in afghanistan bore little resemblance to a land war in europe heavy on artillery and tanks that nearly all defense ministries thought would never recur but it has in ukraine the kind of european war thought inconceivable is chewing up the modest stockpiles of artillery ammunition and air defenses of what some in nato call europe s bonsai armies after the tiny japanese trees even the mighty united states has only limited stocks of the weapons the ukrainians want and need and washington is unwilling to divert key weapons from delicate regions like taiwan and korea where china and north korea are constantly testing the limits now nine months into the war the west s fundamental unpreparedness has set off a mad scramble to supply ukraine with what it needs while also replenishing nato stockpiles as both sides burn through weaponry and ammunition at a pace not seen since world war ii the competition to keep arsenals flush has become a critical front that could prove decisive to ukraine s effort

in a decade of soaring corporate profits and a booming stock market critics still carp that only fat cat executives and shareholders are benefiting from america s free enterprise system try telling that to anyone who has experienced parkinson s disease parkinson s is a degenerative disorder usually accompanied by uncontrollable shaking rigid limbs and slow movement an estimated 1 5 million americans suffer from it while another 2 million suffer from a similar condition that causes involuntary rhythmic shaking for the afflicted even the most basic actions like drinking a glass of water become difficult or impossible for decades these patients have relied on drugs which have limited effectiveness or brain surgery which may imperil the faculties for speech movement and swallowing in august 1997 however the fda announced its approval of a new treatment a tremor control implant device called activa a generator inserted under the collarbone sends a steady stream of tiny electrical pulses to an electrode implanted in the brain these pulses block the brain signals that cause the shaking nearly all the patients who use activa experience some reduction in tremors the activa pulse generator is an example of american entrepreneurship at its best it was created by medtronic corp of minneapolis the world leader in pacemakers and a model for entrepreneurial pluck the story of this company shows once again how a competitive economic system produces widespread social benefits just after world war ii earl bakken first started repairing electronic hospital equipment as a young graduate student in electrical engineering at the university of minnesota in 1949 he and a friend palmer hermundslie set up a business repairing hospital equipment in a dilapidated garage medtronic grew into a modestly successful regional business eventually medical research laboratories began asking bakken and hermundslie to design or customize special equipment during the 1950s their firm created some 100 custom medical devices on a shoestring in 1957 medtronic engineers and walton lillehei a medical researcher and a pioneer in open heart surgery at the university of minnesota came up with a new generation pacemaker combining a pulse generator with a wire electrode it was an improvement but like other pacemakers at the time it was bulky and needed to be plugged into a wall socket so bakken developed a pacemaker powered by batteries and small enough to be worn the age of the modern medical device was born by 1960 medtronic had established itself as a major manufacturer of pacemakers but these externally worn devices were still cumbersome and used primarily as temporary treatments to help sufferers of chronic heart disease doctors needed an implantable pacemaker in 1960 medtronic bought exclusive manufacturing rights from the inventors of just such a device over the next three decades medtronic became the leading manufacturer of pacemakers worldwide it also branched out into other lines such as drug delivery devices that can be implanted and programmed to provide regular precise dosages so who benefits from such innovation in addition to the estimated 1 5 million patients helped by medtronic products other beneficiaries include its 13 000 employees the universities and research labs it supports and its shareholders who have seen their investment grow in value by an average of 36 percent annually since 1985 a quarter of a million students have participated in the company s science and technology program medtronic s annual budget for corporate philanthropy is 8 2 million medtronic has also built state of the art facilities for training physicians and other health care professionals did earl bakken and palmer hermundslie found medtronic out of philanthropic impulses hardly though both men became philanthropists bakken and hermundslie started their business because they saw a market niche in medical equipment repair then by developing relationships with doctors hospitals and patients they recognized the need for new devices to solve medical problems no one could have foreseen that their fledgling firm would become a billion dollar corporation benefiting millions of people the profit motive and its accompanying concern for efficiency and quality gave medtronic s founders all the guidance they needed the free enterprise system provides opportunities for entrepreneurs to make money by solving problems which is why businesses like medtronic have found more ways to meet basic human needs in the past four decades than have been found in all of human history

natural gas is a highly popular commodity particularly amongst day traders the spread is reasonable with high liquidity making it easy for traders to get in and out of trades with little difficulty nat gas also appeals to longer term traders because this macro asset has been known to trend for extended periods of time furthermore natural gas is susceptible to pockets of volatility which lead to massive price spikes the good news is these spikes tend to have a seasonal component to them which traders can use to their advantage this article explores the nuances around the fundamental drivers of natural gas and how to trade them natural gas trading around seasonal patterns natural gas is most often used for heating power generation and industrial processes the use of natural gas across different sectors in the us is rather interesting as the gas tends to exhibit two seasonal peaks in consumption per year seasonal consumption patterns winter months consumption increased consumption of natural gas as households and businesses use it predominantly for heating summer months consumption increased consumption due to increased electricity demand the chart below denotes the summer spikes with red circles while the winter spikes are shown via the blue peaks occurring around january of each year seasonal price movements winter months higher average prices the major peak is usually seen in the winter months as households and businesses use the gas predominantly for heating and reduce a considerable amount of gas storage that has been saved up during the summer summer months higher average prices the smaller peak takes place in summer when electricity demand is at its highest often fueled by increased air conditioning use the chart below shows the winter price movements both higher and lower price movements in recent years therefore traders looking to trade the winter volatility may look for a pull back or period of consolidation in the lead up to the coldest period of the year before trading in the direction of the trend it is not unusual to witness higher prices in the lead up to the middle of winter especially if storage figures are lower than average this approach is shown below for long trades heading into the coldest period of the year trading natural gas during the winter months recommended by richard snow building confidence in trading get my guide trading natural gas trading storage figures demand vs supply the general principle of demand and supply is central to natural gas trading the relevant storage data required can be found via the u s energy information administration website every week the report shows a breakdown storage changes per region on a weekly yearly and 5 year average table us eia weekly natural gas storage figures due to the volatile nature of natural gas around the release of storage figures it is best to get these figures as soon as possible and in an easy to read manner at dailyfx we have a comprehensive economic calendar bringing you timely notifications on data that is relevant to you and the markets you trade recommended by richard snow strategies to help trade around nat gas data releases get my guide how natural gas storage figures can influence price sharp declines in storage figures or below average storage for extended periods may provide some info regarding future natural gas prices the chart below compares natural gas black dotted line with the us natural gas stock change blue line over the 5 year period september 2015 to september 2020 observing this market over such a long time period makes it possible to identify any trends or patterns that would not necessarily show up on a smaller time frame this analysis technique is called multiple time frame analysis and is a rather popular way to understand any market on a more intimate level one observation that appears several times on the chart in red occurs once more around the winter months as storage figures drop the drop in storage happens as a result of increased demand for natural gas for heating among other things the stored natural gas is drawn upon as demand for the gas outpaces supply in the colder months which results in an increased price for natural gas the price adjustment is a natural mechanism that is needed to bring demand and supply back into equilibrium as the colder weather subsides the demand for the gas decreases and storage figures will begin to increase once more natural gas storage vs natural gas price storage figures tend to substantiate what was mentioned in the earlier section on seasonal patterns as extreme weather is one of a number of factors that affect natural gas storage traders can once more consider the direction of the trend leading into the winter months and use any number of technical analysis tools to time entries into the market when storage figures drop and prices head higher thus far we have only considered long trades this is because their tends to be greater potential for volatility when prices go up as opposed to when prices go down or when storage figures increase however there do still exist opportunities to short trade natural gas in periods when demand tapers off and inventories begin to pile up trading natural gas the state of the economy and supply disruptions using the economic cycle as a trend filter the state of the economy also has an effect on natural gas prices due to the gasses strong link to industrial processes when the economy is growing there is more infrastructure being built and more machinery that is needed to support it furthermore the manufacturing industry tends to pick up too as natural gas is used to manufacture a wide range of chemicals such as ammonia methanol butane ethane and propane generally speaking economic expansions lead to increased demand for natural gas which props up the price of nat gas this is seen below where the s p500 is used as a proxy for the health of the economy in red with the natural gas price in blue moves up in a similar but more extreme fashion trend traders therefore keep a close watch on where we are in the economic cycle in an attempt to trade in line with the trend identify long trades in an expanding economic environment and short trades in a contracting economic environment natural gas prices tend to move inline with the economy supply disruptions continuing the analysis over the same time period shown above there also happened to be 3 major spikes witnessed as a result of external factors or extreme weather conditions outside of the normal warm summer and cold winter weather extremely cold temperatures and extreme weather conditions like hurricanes can cause significant supply disruptions especially if the conditions result in infrastructure damage or delays in transporting natural gas this is exactly what happened 2005 and 2008 these extreme cases and one other are explored in greater detail below extreme weather induced spikes in natural gas 2000 2001 the first big spike in this example was caused by an increase of demand after many years of declined production the increase in demand was caused by colder than normal weather and because storage figures were particularly low due to an extended period of low demand there was a major price shock 2005 the next spike occurred due to hurricane katrina in the gulf of mexico the gulf of mexico is crucial to the nat gas market as it is home to 51 of total us natural gas processing plant capacity as a result of the hurricane supplies from the gulf of mexico were significantly impacted causing a drastic rise in price 2008 instead of seasonal weather playing an important role in prices hurricanes gustav and ike cause production shut ins in the gulf of mexico and louisiana which saw nat gas prices spike in summer and drop in winter the opposite of what is expected trader take away stay up to date with both the storage figures and the potential for extreme weather in areas that are likely to directly affect natural gas supply chains speculators view the above events as an opportunity to benefit from increased nat gas prices and tent to consider timing

santa cruz calif netflix s trailblazing dvd by mail rental service has been relegated as a relic in the age of video streaming but there is still a steady albeit shrinking audience of diehards like amanda konkle who are happily paying to receive those discs in the iconic red and white envelopes when you open your mailbox it s still something you actually want instead of just bills said konkle a resident of savannah georgia who has been subscribing to netflix s dvd by mail service since 2005 it s a small pleasure that konkle and other still dedicated dvd subscribers enjoy but it s not clear for how much longer netflix declined to comment for this story but during a 2018 media event co founder and co ceo of netflix reed hastings suggested the dvd by mail service might close around 2023 when not if it happens netflix will shut down a service that has shipped more than 5 billion discs across the u s since its inception nearly a quarter century ago and it will echo the downfall of the thousands of blockbuster video rental stores that closed because they couldn t counter the threat posed by netflix s dvd by mail alternative the eventual demise of its dvd by mail service has been inevitable since hastings decided to spin it off from a then nascent video streaming service in 2011 back then hastings floated the idea of renaming the service as qwikster a bungled idea that was so widely ridiculed that it was satirized on saturday night live it finally settled on its current more prosaic handle dvd com the operation is now based in non descript office in fremont california located about 20 miles from netflix s sleek campus in los gatos california shortly before breakup from video streaming the dvd by mail service boasted more than 16 million subscribers a number that has now dwindled to an estimated 1 5 million subscribers all in the u s based on calculations drawn from netflix s limited disclosures of the service in its quarterly reports netflix s video streaming service now boasts 223 million worldwide subscribers including 74 million in the u s and canada the dvd by mail business has bequeathed the netflix that everyone now knows and watches today marc randolph netflix s original ceo said during an interview at a coffee shop located across the street from the post office in santa cruz california the 110 year old post office has become a landmark in silicon valley history because it s where randolph mailed a patsy cline cd to hastings in 1997 to test whether a disc could be delivered through the u s postal service without being damaged the disc arrived at hastings home unblemished prompting the duo in 1998 to launch a dvd by mail rental website that they always knew would be supplanted by even more convenient technology it was planned obsolescence but our bet was that it would take longer for it to happen than most people thought at the time randolph said with netflix s successful streaming service it might be easy to assume that anyone still paying to receive dvds through the mail is a technophobe or someone living in a remote part of the u s without reliable internet access but subscribers say they stick with the service so they can rent movies that are otherwise difficult to find on streaming services for michael fusco 35 that includes the 1986 film power starring a then youthful richard gere and denzel washington and 1980 s the big red one starring lee marvin that s among the main reasons he has been subscribing to the dvd by service since 2006 when he was just a freshman in college and he has no plans to cancel it now i have been getting it for almost half my life and it has been a big part fusco said when i was young it helped me discover voices i probably wouldn t have heard i still have memories of getting movies and having them blow my mind tabetha neumann is among the subscribers who rediscovered the dvd service during the throes of the pandemic lockdowns in 2020 after running out of things to watch on her video streaming service so she and her husband signed up again for the first time since canceling in 2011 now they like it so much that they get the a plan that allows them to keep up to three discs at a time an option that currently costs 20 per month compared to 10 per month for the one disc plan when we started going through all the movies we wanted to see we realized it was cheaper than paying 5 per movie on some streaming services neumann said plus we have found a lot of old horror movies and that genre is not really big on streaming konkle who has written a book about marilyn monroe s films says she still finds movies on the dvd service such as the 1954 film cattle queen of montana featuring future u s president ronald reagan alongside barbara stanwyck and the 1983 french film sugar cane alley that help her teach her film studies classes as an associate professor at georgia southern university it s a viewing habit she doesn t usually share with her classes because most of my students don t know what a dvd is said konkle 40 laughing but for all the dvd service s attractions subscribers are starting to notice signs of deterioration as the business has shrunk from producing more than 1 billion in annual revenue a year ago to an amount likely to fall below 200 in revenue this year katie cardinale a subscriber who lives in hopedale massachusetts says she now has to wait an additional two to four days for discs to arrive in the mail than she used to because they are shipped from a distribution center in new jersey instead of boston netflix doesn t disclose how many dvd distribution centers still operate but there were once about 50 of them in the u s konkle says more discs now come with cracks or other defects in them and it takes forever to get them replaced and almost all subscribers have noticed the selection of dvd titles has shrunk dramatically from the service s peak years when netflix boasted it had more than 100 000 different movies and tv shows on disc netflix no longer discloses the size of its dvd library but the subscribers interviewed by the ap all reported the narrowing selection is making it more difficult to find famous films and popular tv series that once were routinely available on the service instead netflix now sorts requests for titles such as the first season of the award winning ted lasso series a release that can be purchased on dvd into a saved queue signaling it may decide to stock it in the future depending on demand knowing the end is in sight randolph said he will lament the death of the dvd service he brought to life while taking comfort its legacy will survive netflix s dvd business was part and parcel of who netflix was and still is he said it s embedded in the company s dna

following the death of two year old awaab ishak from a respiratory infection caused by toxic mould in his rochdale home housing minister michael gove has announced that every council and housing authority must provide details of how they plan to tackle damp and mould in their properties but what is mould and why is it so common in rental homes it s a fungus rather like mildew or toadstools and it needs permanently damp conditions to grow and multiply health risk mould is an allergen and if allowed to spread can become highly toxic and cause severe respiratory infections it struggles to establish itself in dry conditions and if you can see mould growing on a wall you are looking at a colony of perhaps millions of mould spores once they start growing they increase rapidly and will continue to do so unless eradicated mould is an allergen and if allowed to spread can become highly toxic and cause severe respiratory infections spores can grow on plaster wood carpet and even dust the problem is worse in tenanted homes rather than privately owned ones as these properties tend to be cheaply built with thin walls and are prone to condensation also much rental stock is old and not built to current housing regulations another factor is that these properties tend to be less well looked after by landlords than owner occupied homes indeed according to the charity shelter around 40 per cent of rental homes are susceptible to mould as it happens i know what i m talking about as new tenants in my london rental flat complained that there was black mould growing in the bathroom i took swift action to remedy the problem and contacted pure maintenance uk a specialist mould removal company of course i knew the flat a 70 year old ex council property was at risk of mould but in the past either the tenants kept it down or it did not bother them i had provided a dehumidifier but it could not cope with the new mould creeping down walls blinds and even according to my tenants getting on their shoes they said the mould was making them ill how to rid your home of mould regularly open windows to air your rooms buy a powerful dehumidifier also buy a hygrometer which measures humidity levels and costs only around 5 after showering wipe down the glass cubicle doors and tiles because this will drastically impair the growth of mould always keep your furniture a few inches away from external walls dry the washing outside or in a tumble dryer never drape damp laundry over the radiators never store damp clothes in your wardrobes wipe windowsills with white vinegar from time to time maintain a temperature of 18 22c within the property when cooking or having a shower make sure that you turn on the extractor fan advertisement effective mould removal is not a simple job nor is it cheap i was quoted 1 200 to clear three smallish rooms it is rather like removing asbestos where hazmat suits have to be worn by operators and the property must be vacated while the treatment work is carried out the first task in my flat was to take moisture readings and thermal imaging to assess the type and extent of the mould after that the dew point the level of condensation was measured and found to be high once the surfaces had been cleaned the final job was to apply dry fog a disinfectant that creates an anti microbial barrier and eradicates mould and bacteria a few days later i received a five page report with about 100 photos attached showing the affected surfaces before and after treatment and was told that a technical lab report would follow this stated that although a significant reduction had been achieved the technicians wanted to come back to test the air quality and do more dry fogging if necessary at the same time they sent a list of tips to prevent the mould returning josh unice who co founded pure maintenance says about 15 years ago new anti microbial technology was invented in utah in the u s by a friend of mine and we decided to make use of this to eliminate mould in british homes one reason we started the company was because my business partner sam bowles had serious health issues at university caused by mould when tragic awaab ishak s father faisal abdullah became aware of the worsening mould problem he contacted rochdale boroughwide housing which owned the property and was told to paint over it but according to unice this is the very worst thing you can do because it encourages the mould to grow the technology to combat mould in the home is now there and we must make use of it before there are any other tragedies such as the death of a small child
