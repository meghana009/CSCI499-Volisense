market confusion in the week ahead getty the buyers finally took over the stock market last week as the s p 500 recorded gains of 2 45 tuesday 0 95 thursday and 3 06 on friday from a technical standpoint there was improvement in the futures on monday given the failing sharp rebounds so far in 2022 many are not expecting the stock market to continue higher as some are looking for more investor pain in the second half of 2022 i have been looking for a more sustainable market rally for some time especially after the selling climaxes just before the may lows there were several indications from both a technical and sentiment standpoint that the market was near a low instead the market was hit with another wave of heavy selling in june that dropped the averages to convincing new lows in last week s survey from the american association of individual investors aaii only 18 2 of those surveyed expect stock prices to be higher in the next six months it also revealed that 59 3 of investors are bearish as they expect prices to be lower in the next six months this is one of several contrary indicators that continue to show extreme readings when there are too few bullish investors or too many bearish investors the stock market is historically likely to move higher not lower when hedge funds and large money managers have a relatively high level of cash it is often a good time to buy in the may bofa survey those who manage just under 1 trillion have the highest cash levels since september 2001 from the lows that month the s p 500 began a 15 week rally that took the index 24 higher such a rally now would certainly change the market sentiment dramatically spyder trust tom aspray viper report com of course these contrarian measures have been sending warning signals since march but other than the rally from march 15th point 1 through march 29th point 2 the rallies in april and early may were brief there was a better rally from the may 20th low that ended with the downside reversal on june 9th point 3 the analysis on the spy py spy as well as the s p futures analysis both turned positive on friday june 24th markets tom aspray viper report com so after last week s impressive gains how much higher can the averages go also is this just a bear market rally or could it be the start of a longer lasting move to the upside the nasdaq 100 ndx was the week s top gainer up 7 4 barely outpacing the 7 4 gain in the dow jones utility average the ndx is still down 25 8 year to date ytd and is still the weakest of these markets the widely watched s p 500 was up 6 5 with the ishares russell 2000 gaining 6 and the dow jones industrials not far behind as it rose 5 4 the market internals were over 10 1 positive early friday and on the nyse for the week there were 2646 issues advancing and 847 declining invesco qqq trust tom aspray viper report com the weekly chart of the invesco qqq qqq trust qqq which tracks the ndx closed above its 20 day ema but is still 8 4 below its declining 20 week ema at 319 73 this is the area that some will be looking at for a failing rally but the weekly downtrend line a is at 341 99 this is just above the 50 retracement resistance from the november 2021 high as qqq made lower lows line b the weekly nasdaq 100 advance decline line formed higher lows line d since data was first available in 2009 it has never formed such a bullish divergence a move in the a d line above the may high will confirm the divergence similar formations in the nyse all a d line have corresponded to important market turns which raises the possibility that an important low may have been formed last week it is way too early to be planning for a major low and the market will need to be watched closely for signs the rally has fizzled all of the daily a d lines are positive but a higher weekly close is needed this week to further support the positive technical outlook 10 year t note yield tom aspray viper report com for the past few weeks i have noticed signs that the yield on the 10 year t note was topping out last week s action supports this view as the prior week s yield had a high of 3 473 and moved above the weekly starc band the yield declined further last week and a drop below the may low of 2 708 line a will complete the top formation the weekly macd and macd his have formed lower highs or negative divergences which is consistent with a top in yields the daily macds are negative and also formed bearish divergence at the recent highs lower yields should be supportive for stocks and could reduce some of the inflationary fears vix tom aspray viper report com the daily chart of the market volatility index vix has formed a series of lower highs line a since the start of the year this is in contrast to the lower lows in the market averages often times in a strong market decline the vix will form consistently higher highs the vix now looks ready to break the support at line b this would indicate a drop to the 20 area the macds has formed lower highs like bitcoin btc did before its recent plunge both macds turned negative on friday which should also be supportive for stocks in the weeks ahead those who used vix options to hedge their portfolio during the market s decline are likely to be disappointed again three sectors consumer discretionary xly xly health care select and real estate sector xlre xlre were up 8 or more last week the volume in the sector etfs has not been as impressive as it was in some of the stocks resources connection inc rgp tom aspray viper report com resource connection rgp showed up on my daily scan after wednesday s close and it was up 12 friday with four times the average volume the relative performance analysis shows that it has been a market leader since early may in fact there were also stocks on my weekly scan that had record daily volume for the year in friday s trading it would not be surprising to see some light selling early in the week as many are not likely to trust friday s market action for all new positions it is important to measure the risk on all new positions and until the a d lines are trending higher would not be an aggressive buyer
worried about an economic downturn here s what you can expect in a typical recession according to economists there has been a lot of chatter recently about the possibility of a recession yet what exactly does that mean and what would a potential downturn look like a recession is defined as a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months according to the national bureau of economic research more from invest in you suze orman every person should have series i bonds strategies to pay off credit card debt as interest rates rise what the fed s rate hike means for you it s also ultimately inevitable during the course of the normal economic cycle said mark hamrick senior economic analyst at bankrate it should not be shocking that they occur he said it is usually the timing the cause and the depth and duration of them that catch people by surprise the risk of a recession economists are watching the economy closely and many are boosting their odds of a recession occurring in the near term citigroup assessing global economic growth over the next 18 months sees a 50 probability of a global recession happening while goldman sachs has put the odds of a recession for the u s in the next year at 30 however not everyone is convinced a recession will happen ubs for example has a base case forecast of no recession mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics also thinks as things stand now a recession is unlikely the economy is slowing and it will be uncomfortable over the next 12 to 24 months but i think we will make our way through it without a recession he said of course something could happen to change that projection we are very vulnerable to anything else that could go wrong because things are so fragile zandi explained the economy comes to a standstill still zandi s current prediction still means some economic pain ahead the economy comes to a standstill meaning months where we are getting little job growth or negative job growth he said unemployment would start to notch higher perhaps hitting 4 or 4 5 and inflation while moderating will still be high he said he doesn t see stock prices going anywhere and housing values remaining at best flat or even declining in some markets for the average american it is not just going to feel great he said the duration and depth of recessions are characterized by shapes for instance a v shaped recovery is quick with a sharp decline to a bottom followed by a dramatic rise in a u shaped recovery on the other hand the economy spends longer at the bottom and then gradually rebounds a w recovery is when the economy passes through a recession and into recovery and then immediately enters another recession and k shaped means some parts of the economy recover more quickly than others what a typical recession looks like a post world war ii typical recession lasts about six to 12 months although some were longer and one was shorter zandi said the most recent recession occurred in 2020 and was brief only two months long the longest recession occurring after 1948 the great recession spanned 18 months beginning december 2007 and ending june 2009 in a garden variety recession the economy typically loses 3 million to 4 million jobs and unemployment can get as high as 6 zandi said the stock market may fall another 5 to 10 and national house prices decline about 5 to 10 he said that doesn t necessarily mean that s what will occur if the economy does fall into recession right now the fundamentals of the economy are good zandi said there is a good chance we do suffer a recession it will be less severe than a typical one he predicted prepare for the possibility of a recession whether a recession happens or not you should be ready just in case i counsel people to prepare for the possibility to pay down debt to save money to consider deferring large purchases said hamrick he anticipates that bankrate s second quarter economic indicator survey will put chances of a recession in the next 12 18 months higher than the 1 in 3 odds in the first quarter survey still that doesn t mean the worst case scenario if there is a downturn here i think that there is a possibility that it could be relatively short and shallow hamrick said it need not be ruinous source cnbc

inflation nation june 27 july 3 2022 by wesley brown as gas prices and inflation continue to soar president joe biden on wednesday june 22 called on congress to suspend the federal gas tax through september the traditional end of the nation s vacation season since 1993 the federal government has charged an 18 cent tax per gallon of gasoline and a 24 4 cent tax per gallon of diesel through the highway trust fund the major source of federal road and bridge funding the highway trust fund is an accounting mechanism in the federal budget with two accounts one for highways and the other for mass transit to which certain fuel and other vehicle related excise tax collections are credited according to the congressional budget office cbo federal spending on highways totaled 46 billion in 2019 most of those outlays were for grants to state and local governments to support their spending on capital projects those governments typically spend roughly three times as much of their own funds on highways each year not only on capital projects but also to operate and maintain roads that 46 billion also includes spending for federal programs that subsidize state and local governments borrowing for highway projects other subsidies for state and local borrowing are provided through the tax code in the president s appeal to congress biden administration officials said any new legislation should make sure that a gas tax holiday has no negative effect on the highway trust fund with our deficit already down by a historic 1 6 trillion this year the president believes that we can afford to suspend the gas tax to help consumers while using other revenues to make the highway trust fund whole for the roughly 10 billion cost the white house said in a statement this is consistent with legislation proposed in the senate and the house to advance a responsible gas tax holiday whether or not biden has enough support in the house and senate to gain approval for his three month moratorium the national average for a gallon of gas is 4 96 a nickel less than a week ago the primary cause of the modest decline is the tumbling cost of oil which fell from 122 to around 110 per barrel due to fears of a global recession and its associated economic slowdown the recent high prices may have led to a small drop in domestic gasoline demand as fewer drivers fueled up last week said andrew gross aaa spokesperson this dip coupled with less costly oil has taken some steam out of surging pump prices and this is happening right before drivers gas up for what aaa forecasts will be a busy july 4th travel weekend according to new data from the energy information administration eia total domestic gasoline stocks fell by 700 000 billion barrels bbl to 217 5 million bbl last week meanwhile gasoline demand declined slightly from 9 2 million barrels per day b d to 9 09 million b d the slight drop in gas demand has helped to limit pump price increases however as crude oil prices remain volatile the price per gallon for gasoline will likely remain elevated as of june 21 the national average of 4 96 is 37 cents more than a month ago and 1 89 more than a year ago at 4 50 per gallon to fill up a tank with regular unleaded arkansas is among the nation s top 10 least expensive markets behind georgia and mississippi at 4 46 and 4 47 the other top states well below the 5 per gallon mark include louisiana 4 51 south carolina 4 52 alabama 4 57 tennessee 4 58 north carolina 4 60 oklahoma 4 62 and texas 4 63 on the other end of the scale california continues to lead the nation with pump prices at a whopping 6 37 per gallon for regular unleaded followed by nevada and alaska at 5 62 and 5 60 per gallon respectively other states above the 5 mark include hawaii 5 55 washington and oregon 5 52 illinois 5 52 arizona 5 35 idaho 5 20 and utah 5 19 across the state pump prices in the state s key metropolitan service areas msa range from a low of 4 42 and 4 43 in hot springs and the little rock north little rock areas respectively to the highest recorded average of 4 55 and 4 60 per gallon at opposite ends of the state at the arkansas tennessee state line in west memphis and the arkansas texas stateline in texarkana in between drivers in pine bluff and jonesboro are paying on average about 4 48 and 4 49 per gallon to fill up their tanks pump prices in fayetteville rogers springdale msa and fort smith are averaging 4 53 per gallon for regular unleaded as noted drivers choosing to fill up the tanks with a higher grade of gasoline should expect to pay well over 5 per gallon big rig drivers and other diesel fuel users will see pump prices at a whopping 5 40 gallon up nearly 2 35 from a year ago according to aaa food prices see largest spike in 43

statistics reported today over the last 12 months the all items index increased 8 6 the largest 12 month increase since the period ending december 1981 for the month the increase was broad based with the indexes for shelter gasoline and food being the largest contributors after declining in april the energy index rose 3 9 over the month with the gasoline index rising 4 1 and the other major

irs on june 9 announced a rare mid year increase in the optional standard mileage rate for the final six months of 2022 taxpayers may use the optional standard mileage rates to calculate the deductible costs of operating an automobile for business and certain other purposes for the final six months of 2022 the standard mileage rate for business travel will be 62 5 cents per mile up 4 cents from the rate effective at the start of the year also the new rate for deductible medical or moving expenses for active duty members of the military will be 22 cents for the remainder of 2022 up 4 cents from the rate effective at the start of 2022 these new rates went into effect on friday july 1 in recognition of recent gasoline price increases the irs made this special adjustment for the final months of 2022 the irs normally updates the mileage rates once a year in the fall for the next calendar year for travel from jan 1 through june 30 2022 taxpayers should use the rates set forth in notice 2022 03 here the irs is adjusting the standard mileage rates to better reflect the recent increase in fuel prices said irs commissioner chuck rettig we are aware a number of unusual factors have come into play involving fuel costs and we are taking this special step to help taxpayers businesses and others who use this rate while fuel costs are a significant factor in the mileage figure other items enter into the calculation of mileage rates such as depreciation and insurance and other fixed and variable costs the optional business standard mileage rate is used to compute the deductible costs of operating an automobile for business use in lieu of tracking actual costs this rate is also used as a benchmark by the federal government and many businesses to reimburse their employees for mileage taxpayers always have the option of calculating the actual costs of using their vehicle rather than using the standard mileage rates the 14 cents per mile rate for charitable organizations remains unchanged as it is set by statute as noted midyear increases in the optional mileage rates are rare the last time the irs made such an increase was in 2011 photo captions 1

selinexor is an oral small molecule xpo1 inhibitor tislelizumab is an anti pd 1 checkpoint inhibitor shanghai and hong kong june 26 2022 prnewswire antengene corporation limited antengene sehk 6996 hk a leading innovative commercial stage global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering developing and commercializing first in class and or best in class therapeutics in hematology and oncology today announced that it has entered into a clinical trial collaboration with beigene to evaluate the safety pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of selinexor in combination with beigene s anti pd 1 checkpoint inhibitor tislelizumab this multi center open label phase i ii trial will evaluate the investigational combination as a potential treatment option for patients with t and nk cell lymphoma we are delighted to partner with beigene a company that strives for innovation and excellence and is committed to developing best in class or first in class anti cancer therapies for patients across the globe these qualities are very similar to those of our vision at antengene said dr jay mei antengene s founder chairman and ceo we look forward to advancing the combination of selinexor and tislelizumab to clinical development with good data we will be able to bring this treatment regimen to patients with t and nk cell lymphoma diseases that are endemic in asia but underserved by current therapies at antengene we believe that the combinational use of immuno oncology drugs and selective inhibitor of nuclear export sine compounds possesses huge potential as novel treatment regimens for cancer patients said dr kevin lynch antengene s chief medical officer the mechanism of action of selinexor in inhibiting the nuclear export protein xpo1 facilitates the intranuclear accumulation of tumor suppressors making it a good partner in multiple combination treatment regimens preclinical research we conducted demonstrated that selinexor combined with a checkpoint inhibitor increased anti tumor activity in multiple tumor models in addition deep and durable responses were also seen in multiple case reports of patients with t and nk cell lymphoma treated with selinexor in combination with an anti pd 1 checkpoint inhibitor we hope to confirm that selinexor can synergize with tislelizumab to deliver an effective treatment regimen and help address the huge unmet medical needs in t and nk cell lymphoma in the asia pacific regions and around the world continued dr lynch tislelizumab is a pd 1 inhibitor designed to help aid the body s immune cells to detect and fight tumors tislelizumab a humanized monoclonal antibody is specifically designed to minimize binding to fcγr on macrophages in pre clinical studies binding to fcγr on macrophages has been shown to compromise the anti tumor activity of pd 1 antibodies through activation of antibody dependent macrophage mediated killing of t effector cells about t and nk cell lymphoma t and nk cell lymphoma is a set of heterogeneous diseases accounting for 25 30 of non hodgkin lymphoma nhl cases in china and only about 10 in usa and europe there has been little improvement in the past decade when compared to b cell non hodgkin lymphoma b nhl as 5 year overall survival rate was only 30 in most common subtypes the unmet medical needs remain as agents with new mechanism of action to be explored and possibility to improve the treatment paradigm for the disease about the sine compounds selective inhibitor of nuclear export sine compounds are inhibitors of the major nuclear export protein exportin 1 xpo1 currently there are three oral sine compounds atg 010 selinexor atg 016 eltanexor and atg 527 verdinexor under clinical development antengene has obtained exclusive development and commercialisation rights from karyopharm therapeutics inc nasdaq kpti to these three compounds in certain apac markets about xpovio selinexor xpovio is the world s first approved orally available selective inhibitor of the nuclear export protein xpo1 it offers a novel mechanism of action synergistic effects in combination regimens fast onset of action and durable responses by blocking the nuclear export protein xpo1 xpovio can promote the intranuclear accumulation and activation of tumor suppressor proteins and growth regulating proteins and down regulate the levels of multiple oncogenic proteins xpovio delivers its antitumor effects through three mechanistic pathways 1 exerting antitumor effects by inducing the intranuclear accumulation of tumor suppressor proteins 2 reducing the level of oncogenic proteins in the cytoplasm by inducing the intranuclear accumulation of oncogenic mrnas and 3 restoring hormone sensitivity by activating the glucocorticoid receptors gr pathway to utilize its unique mechanism of actions xpovio is being evaluated for use in multiple combination regimens in a range of indications at present antengene is conducting 10 clinical studies of xpovio in mainland china for the treatment of relapsed refractory hematologic malignancies and solid tumors 3 of these studies are being jointly conducted by

the firm raised about 13m through the flotation scotland has a really vibrant life sciences sector says bia head of policy dr martin turner in 2020 it made up about 8 per cent of investment in the sector by venture capital and about the same from government research and development funding too so it s definitely battling its corner very strongly turner points to the findings from multiple reports including ian campbell s taskforce about the lack of institutional investors pumping capital into life sciences local council pension funds and bigger institutions aren t investing heavily

scotland continues to have a disproportionately high number of top research institutes for the life sciences and so we see a rich array of opportunities dunlop says the pipeline of research driven innovations remains strong and we have more demand for capital than we can supply although we work closely with co investors like scottish enterprise there s still not a critical mass of similar funds doing what we do in scotland the average size of even a seed stage deal for therapeutics has grown exponentially driven by investment trends in the us we recently seeded two edinburgh based spin outs kynos and macomics and both will soon have taken in close to 10m these would have been very large seed financings ten years ago but today that s typical and both companies are likely to raise 20m plus in their next rounds the average size of drug development financing continues to grow and that s something both public and private sectors need to keep an eye on if scotland is going to successfully bridge both the early and growth stage financing gaps the sector s global competitiveness is highly dependent upon scaling up locally accessible risk capital focus on the usa not the nhs scottish

president biden and big oil are at each other s throats at a time when gas prices are at the highest level in history hurting regular americans he points out that big oil companies are enjoying record profits the president earlier this month singled out exxonmobil saying the company made more money than god this year gas prices started skyrocketing following a raft of sanctions on russian oil after its invasion of ukraine in february the national average price of gasoline surpassed 5 a gallon for the first time ever this month prices have edged down by a few cents in recent days but remain elevated exacerbating these high gas prices is a huge shortage in refining capacity in the u s which isn t likely to be resolved any time soon refiners turn crude oil into usable products like gasoline diesel and jet fuel there s just fewer refiners in the u s today than a couple of years ago refining capacity in the u s is about a million barrels a day below what it was prior to the pandemic that s left the country unable to meet its fuel needs as more people are commuting traveling and driving as they emerge from the throes of the pandemic so where did all the refineries go some refineries shuttered during the pandemic induced recession in 2020 when demand for gasoline took a nosedive not all of those refineries have come back online the u s had five fewer refineries at the beginning of this year that at the beginning of 2020 when the pandemic hit and demand for oil evaporated during the recession refineries took a big financial hit when the price of gasoline plummeted some refiners threw in the towel they said the numbers just didn t work and closed up shop when you re losing money on doing it what do you do you stop making it and that s when you shut down refineries says denton cinquegrana chief oil analyst at oil price information service eduardo munoz alvarez getty images getty images fire smolders at an oil refinery that triggered several large explosions at the philadelphia energy solutions refining complex on june 21 2019 fire broke out in the early morning that triggered a vat of butane to ignite with an explosion so large that it was detected from space there were other disasters around the same time a philadelphia refinery one of the largest in the country was rocked by explosions a few months before the pandemic in louisiana another refinery was wiped out by hurricane ida both have been shut down oil is not where the future lies underpinning the decisions not to reopen refineries is the fact that the u s is undergoing an energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables the biden administration envisions a future where the world is powered by clean energy rather than oil with its destructive effect on the environment i think the refining executives say well looks like the writing s on the wall cinquegrana says in fact some refiners have repurposed their facilities where instead of making gasoline from oil they re ramping up to produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel out of feed stocks like soybean oil and used cooking oil biden wants a future in renewables but wants oil companies to pump more now of course high demand combined with high prices has led oil companies to make big profits exxonmobil s profit in the first quarter more than doubled from a year earlier meanwhile chevron reported its highest quarterly profit in nearly a decade while shell posted its highest earnings ever so president biden wants them to do more to bring down the price of gasoline justin sullivan getty images getty images petaluma california may 18 a customer pumps gas into their car at a gas station on may 18 2022 in petaluma california photo by justin sullivan getty images at a time of war refinery profit margins well above normal being passed directly onto american families are not acceptable the president wrote in a letter to the heads of seven oil companies earlier this month the president urged oil executives to increase the supply of gasoline and other refined products and to drill for more oil in a bid to bring gas prices down it s no surprise that this is raising eyebrows given the president s stated goals on an energy transition and also his promise to voters on the campaign trail that he would end fossil fuels francisco blanch head of commodities research at bank of america points out that the country is still heavily reliant on gasoline despite those goals the narrative until today was that we were going to be driving electric vehicles by the end of the year so who cares about refined products well it turns out a lot of people need refined products says blanch but could refiners be doing more u s refineries are already going gangbusters right now they re operating above 90 capacity according to the energy information administration and expected to run at 95 for the rest of the summer george frey getty images getty images salt lake city ut may 24 a driver unloads raw crude oil from his tanker to process into gas at marathon refinery on may 24 2022 in salt lake city utah photo by george frey getty images as for turning back on idled refineries that s not a quick fix either it would take months to bring the refineries back online and it would be costly for the refiners cinquegrana from oil price information service says that from the refiners perspective it doesn t make financial sense to invest in additional oil refining given the broader transition you re talking about a lot of money to get these refineries that are idled up and running when i m being told five years from now we hope you don t exist cinquegrana says the united states hasn t seen a major new refinery built since the 1970s and there s a good chance it never will chevron ceo mike wirth recently stated as much in an interview with bloomberg my personal view is there will never be another refinery built in the united states wirth said copyright 2022 npr to

experiencing heart problems and high blood pressure your physician may recommend that you take a prescribed medication to help maintain normal blood pressure while the benefits of these drugs are well documented what is less known are the risks associated with prolonged use for sure you don t want to suffer from these risks when it comes to heart health the root cause of many people struggling with blood pressure bp is not genetics poor lifestyle choices coupled with unhealthy food and the modern environment both contribute to it also the fact that most foods are packed with calories and hidden sugars might be good news for the food industry but is bad news for our health when you eat too many carbohydrates your body turns those carbs into simple blood sugar called glucose in response to this rapid blood sugar spike your insulin levels rise as well which causes a chain reaction your cholesterol levels rise and in turn raise your blood pressure hence uncontrolled high blood pressure is a vicious cycle you get the idea the longer you wait to deal with your high blood pressure the more damage it will do i can only wish you luck in finding the next healthy food that will somehow give you the blood pressure you want however if you re ready to move past this and if you want something natural and safe proven to support healthy blood pressure strictionbp can give you the solution people the world over seek the power of a rare and special spice known as ceylon cinnamon medical doctors and their patients have learned that this amazing spice is one of the most effective herbs for fighting and maintaining healthy blood pressure and that s what strictionbp contains studies show that users of cinnamon saw a decrease in blood pressure and glucose levels one study showed blood pressure dropping by 3 8 and glucose levels dropping by 8 4 the dosage was 250mg of cinnamon extract taken daily for 12 weeks you could consider using cinnamon but be careful to use ceylon cinnamon not the cassia variety this is because the latter contains coumadin an anticoagulant drug that can be dangerous in high doses the truth is you aren t likely to get the same results with the variety of cinnamon found in the stores should you just go buy ceylon cinnamon or should you try to make your own formulations what if you could avoid the inefficiencies of a homemade formulation plus get a better product because of stringent quality controls and guarantees if you want the potent power of ceylon cinnamon there s no need to hunt for ingredients or to go without quality control because

cancer therapies for patients across the globe these qualities are very similar to those of our vision at antengene said dr jay mei antengene s founder chairman and ceo we look forward to advancing the combination of selinexor and tislelizumab to clinical development with good data we will be able to bring this treatment regimen to patients with t and nk cell lymphoma diseases that are endemic in asia but underserved by current therapies at antengene we believe that the combinational use of immuno oncology drugs and selective inhibitor of nuclear export sine compounds possesses huge potential as novel treatment regimens for cancer patients said dr kevin lynch antengene s chief medical officer the mechanism of action of selinexor in inhibiting the nuclear export protein xpo1 facilitates the intranuclear accumulation of tumor suppressors making it a good partner in multiple combination treatment regimens preclinical research we conducted demonstrated that selinexor combined with a checkpoint inhibitor increased anti tumor activity in multiple tumor models in addition deep and durable responses were also seen in multiple case reports of patients with t and nk cell lymphoma treated with selinexor in combination with an anti pd 1 checkpoint inhibitor we hope to confirm that selinexor can synergize with tislelizumab to deliver an effective treatment regimen and help address the huge unmet medical needs in t and nk cell lymphoma in the asia pacific regions and around the world continued dr lynch tislelizumab is a pd 1 inhibitor designed to help aid the body s immune cells to detect and fight tumors tislelizumab a humanized monoclonal antibody is specifically designed to minimize binding to fcγr on macrophages in pre clinical studies binding to fcγr

suppressor proteins 2 reducing the level of oncogenic proteins in the cytoplasm by inducing the intranuclear accumulation of oncogenic mrnas and 3 restoring hormone sensitivity by activating the glucocorticoid receptors gr pathway to utilize its unique mechanism of actions xpovio is being evaluated for use in multiple combination regimens in a range of indications at present antengene is

in asia but underserved by current therapies at antengene we believe that the combinational use of immuno oncology drugs and selective inhibitor of nuclear export sine compounds possesses huge potential as novel treatment regimens for cancer patients said dr kevin lynch antengene s chief medical officer the mechanism of action of selinexor in inhibiting the nuclear export protein xpo1 facilitates the intranuclear accumulation of tumor suppressors making it a good partner in multiple combination treatment regimens preclinical research we conducted demonstrated that selinexor combined with a checkpoint inhibitor increased anti tumor activity in multiple tumor models in addition deep and durable responses were also seen in multiple case reports of patients with t and nk cell lymphoma treated with selinexor in combination with an anti pd 1 checkpoint inhibitor we hope to confirm that selinexor can synergize with tislelizumab to deliver an effective treatment regimen and help address the huge unmet medical needs in t and nk cell lymphoma in the asia pacific regions and around the world continued dr lynch tislelizumab is a pd 1 inhibitor designed to help aid the body s immune cells to detect and fight tumors tislelizumab a humanized monoclonal antibody is specifically designed to minimize binding to fcr on macrophages in pre clinical studies binding to fcr on macrophages has been shown to compromise the anti tumor activity of pd 1 antibodies through activation of antibody dependent macrophage mediated killing of t effector cells about t and nk cell lymphoma t and nk cell lymphoma is a set of heterogeneous diseases accounting for 25 30 of non hodgkin lymphoma nhl cases in china and only about 10 in usa and europe there has been little improvement in the past decade when compared to b cell non hodgkin lymphoma b nhl as 5 year overall survival rate was only 30 in most common subtypes the unmet medical needs remain as agents with new mechanism of action to be explored and possibility to improve the treatment paradigm for the disease about the sine compounds selective inhibitor of nuclear export sine compounds are inhibitors of the major nuclear export protein exportin 1 xpo1 currently there are three oral sine compounds atg 010 selinexor atg 016 eltanexor and atg 527 verdinexor under clinical development antengene has obtained exclusive development and commercialisation rights from karyopharm therapeutics inc nasdaq kpti to these three compounds in certain apac markets about xpovio selinexor xpovio is the world s first approved orally available selective inhibitor of the nuclear export protein xpo1 it offers a novel mechanism of action synergistic effects in combination regimens fast onset of action and durable responses by blocking the nuclear export protein xpo1 xpovio can promote the intranuclear accumulation and activation of tumor suppressor proteins and growth regulating proteins and down regulate the levels of multiple oncogenic proteins xpovio delivers its antitumor effects through three mechanistic pathways 1 exerting antitumor effects by inducing the intranuclear accumulation of tumor suppressor proteins 2 reducing the level of oncogenic proteins in the cytoplasm by inducing the intranuclear accumulation of oncogenic mrnas and 3 restoring hormone sensitivity by activating the glucocorticoid receptors gr pathway to utilize its unique mechanism of actions xpovio is being evaluated for use in multiple combination regimens in a range of indications at present antengene is conducting 10 clinical studies of xpovio in mainland china for the treatment of relapsed refractory hematologic malignancies and solid tumors 3 of these studies are being jointly conducted by

michel martin host surveys show roughly a quarter of american women have at some point in their lives used emergency contraception pills to prevent an unintended pregnancy this type of contraception is effective safe and legal throughout the u s and yet researchers are finding it is not always available when people need it npr s maria godoy has this report maria godoy byline imagine this scenario that untold numbers of women find themselves in each year you ve had sex but something went wrong maybe the condom broke maybe you forgot to take a couple of birth control pills maybe you re a teenager with no access to birth control you don t want to get pregnant so you rush to the pharmacy for emergency contraception all the while the clock is ticking sonya borrero these are medications that are incredibly time sensitive godoy dr sonya borrero is a professor of medicine at the university of pittsburgh who focuses on reproductive health equity she says emergency contraception needs to be taken within five days after unprotected sex borrero but the sooner the better godoy but there s a problem she says you can t always find emergency contraception pills when you need them take for example plan b which is supposed to be available over the counter on the shelf stock for all ages but when borrero sent a team of medical students to pharmacies across western pennsylvania to see what they actually had on hand they found a third of pharmacies didn t stock plan b at all and when they did have it borrero most of the time it wasn t really on the shelf it was either behind the counter or in one of those lock boxes like really constraining access godoy because having to ask somebody to actually get the emergency contraception pills for you could be a real deterrent for some people borrero so you can imagine especially for a teen going and asking for one of these products being concerned about potential judgment can be a significant barrier to purchasing godoy pharmacists say there are good reasons for putting plan b under lock and key don downing was a practicing pharmacist he also helped develop plan b he s a professor at the university of washington school of pharmacy he says many pharmacists have told him over the years that plan b is frequently a target of theft he says he d rather see it locked up in the store than not available at all donald downing if they could make it available by keeping it behind the counter that may be ultimately more helpful to a woman than not stocking it at all godoy and keeping a drug in stock is even more of an issue when it comes to the other form of emergency contraception pills ella which requires a prescription borrero s study found only 5 of pharmacies had it available for immediate purchase borrero so 5 was abysmal i really was very surprised i was really thinking it would be something like 50 like 5 is crazy godoy think about it emergency contraception has to be taken within a very narrow window if the pharmacist has to order it even if it arrives the next day for some people that could be one day too late and the problem isn t just confined to pennsylvania studies conducted in pharmacies across the u s have found pretty much the same thing and the pills tend to be even harder to find in independent drugstores rebecca stone is a clinical pharmacist at the university of georgia she says one reason why many pharmacies don t stock ella is because it doesn t get prescribed very often rebecca stone it s not very well known by prescribers meaning you know physicians nurse practitioners any type of traditional prescriber nor by pharmacists godoy and if providers aren t prescribing it pharmacies are less likely to keep it in stock kelly cleland of the american society for emergency contraception says that s really concerning because ella can be a better choice particularly for certain people kelly cleland there is an issue with plan b and its generics potentially not working for people who weigh more than 165 pounds and for those folks it seems like ella is more effective so it s important that ella is available in stock and that people know about it godoy people who work in reproductive health want to see more education on emergency contraception for pharmacists for women and for doctors laura bellis is already on the case she s the executive director of take control initiative a contraception access program in tulsa county okla the program just rolled out training for doctors and other providers after many of them said they had lots of questions about emergency contraception laura bellis sometimes clinicians are like can i just hand this to anyone and the answer s yeah if someone s you know of reproductive age it s safe to have on hand they can put it in their medicine cabinet at home godoy bellis says having emergency contraception on hand is especially critical in places like her home state in may oklahoma adopted the nation s most restrictive

michel martin host surveys show roughly a quarter of american women have at some point in their lives used emergency contraception pills to prevent an unintended pregnancy this type of contraception is effective safe and legal throughout the u s and yet researchers are finding it is not always available when people need it npr s maria godoy has this report maria godoy byline imagine this scenario that untold numbers of women find themselves in each year you ve had sex but something went wrong maybe the condom broke maybe you forgot to take a couple of birth control pills maybe you re a teenager with no access to birth control you don t want to get pregnant so you rush to the pharmacy for emergency contraception all the while the clock is ticking sonya borrero these are medications that are incredibly time sensitive godoy dr sonya borrero is a professor of medicine at the university of pittsburgh who focuses on reproductive health equity she says emergency contraception needs to be taken within five days after unprotected sex borrero but the sooner the better godoy but there s a problem she says you can t always find emergency contraception pills when you need them take for example plan b which is supposed to be available over the counter on the shelf stock for all ages but when borrero sent a team of medical students to pharmacies across western pennsylvania to see what they actually had on hand they found a third of pharmacies didn t stock plan b at all and when they did have it borrero most of the time it wasn t really on the shelf it was either behind the counter or in one of those lock boxes like really constraining access godoy because having to ask somebody to actually get the emergency contraception pills for you could be a real deterrent for some people borrero so you can imagine especially for a teen going and asking for one of these products being concerned about potential judgment can be a significant barrier to purchasing godoy pharmacists say there are good reasons for putting plan b under lock and key don downing was a practicing pharmacist he also helped develop plan b he s a professor at the university of washington school of pharmacy he says many pharmacists have told him over the years that plan b is frequently a target of theft he says he d rather see it locked up in the store than not available at all donald downing if they could make it available by keeping it behind the counter that may be ultimately more helpful to a woman than not stocking it at all godoy and keeping a drug in stock is even more of an issue when it comes to the other form of emergency contraception pills ella which requires a prescription borrero s study found only 5 of pharmacies had it available for immediate purchase borrero so 5 was abysmal i really was very surprised i was really thinking it would be something like 50 like 5 is crazy godoy think about it emergency contraception has to be taken within a very narrow window if the pharmacist has to order it even if it arrives the next day for some people that could be one day too late and the problem isn t just confined to pennsylvania studies conducted in pharmacies across the u s have found pretty much the same thing and the pills tend to be even harder to find in independent drugstores rebecca stone is a clinical pharmacist at the university of georgia she says one reason why many pharmacies don t stock ella is because it doesn t get prescribed very often rebecca stone it s not very well known by prescribers meaning you know physicians nurse practitioners any type of traditional prescriber nor by pharmacists godoy and if providers aren t prescribing it pharmacies are less likely to keep it in stock kelly cleland of the american society for emergency contraception says that s really concerning because ella can be a better choice particularly for certain people kelly cleland there is an issue with plan b and its generics potentially not working for people who weigh more than 165 pounds and for those folks it seems like ella is more effective so it s important that ella is available in stock and that people know about it godoy people who work in reproductive health want to see more education on emergency contraception for pharmacists for women and for doctors laura bellis is already on the case she s the executive director of take control initiative a contraception access program in tulsa county okla the program just rolled out training for doctors and other providers after many of them said they had lots of questions about emergency contraception laura bellis sometimes clinicians are like can i just hand this to anyone and the answer s yeah if someone s you know of reproductive age it s safe to have on hand they can put it in their medicine cabinet at home godoy bellis says having emergency contraception on hand is especially critical in places like her home state in may oklahoma adopted the nation s most restrictive abortion law it s now illegal in all but a few cases bellis and so with that we know how critical it is that folks have access to last lines of defense like emergency contraception godoy advocates say

that untold numbers of women find themselves in each year you ve had sex but something went wrong maybe the condom broke maybe you forgot to take a couple of birth control pills maybe you re a teenager with no access to birth control you don t want to get pregnant so you rush to the pharmacy for emergency contraception all the while the clock is ticking sonya borrero these are medications that are incredibly time sensitive godoy dr sonya borrero is a professor of medicine at the university of pittsburgh who focuses on reproductive health equity she says emergency contraception needs to be taken within five days after unprotected sex borrero but the sooner the better godoy but there s a problem she says you can t always find emergency contraception pills when you need them take for example plan b which is supposed to be available over the counter on the shelf stock for all ages but when borrero sent a team of medical students to pharmacies across western pennsylvania to see what they actually had on hand they found a third of pharmacies didn t stock plan b at all and when they did have it borrero most of the time it wasn t really on the shelf it was either behind the counter or in one of those lock boxes like really constraining access godoy because having to ask somebody to actually get the emergency contraception pills for you could be a real deterrent for some people borrero so you can imagine especially for a teen going and asking for one of these products being concerned about potential judgment can be a significant barrier to purchasing godoy pharmacists say there are good reasons for putting plan b under lock and key don downing was a practicing pharmacist he also helped develop plan b he s a professor at the university of washington school of pharmacy he says many pharmacists have told him over the years that plan b is frequently a target of theft he says he d rather see it locked up in the store than not available at all donald downing if they could make it available by keeping it behind the counter that may be ultimately more helpful to a woman than not stocking it at all godoy and keeping a drug in stock is even more of an issue when it comes to the other form of emergency contraception pills ella which requires a prescription borrero s study found only 5 of pharmacies had it available for immediate purchase borrero so 5 was abysmal i really was very surprised i was really thinking it would be something like 50 like 5 is crazy godoy think about it emergency contraception has to be taken within a very narrow window if the pharmacist has to order it even if it arrives the next day for some people that could be one day too late and the problem isn t just confined to pennsylvania studies conducted in pharmacies across the u s have found pretty much the same thing and the pills tend to be even harder to find in independent drugstores rebecca stone is a clinical pharmacist at the university of georgia she says one reason why many pharmacies don t stock ella is because it doesn t get prescribed very often rebecca stone it s not very well known by prescribers meaning you know physicians nurse practitioners any type of traditional prescriber nor by pharmacists godoy and if providers aren t prescribing it pharmacies are less likely to keep it in stock kelly cleland of the american society for emergency contraception says that s really concerning because ella can be a better choice particularly for certain people kelly cleland there is an issue with plan b and its generics potentially not working for people who weigh more than 165 pounds and for those folks it seems like ella is more effective so it s important that ella is available in stock and that people know about it godoy people who work in reproductive health want to see more education on emergency contraception for pharmacists for women and for doctors laura bellis is already on the case she s the executive director of take control initiative a contraception access program in tulsa county okla the program just rolled out training for doctors and other providers after many of them said they had lots of questions about emergency contraception laura bellis sometimes clinicians are like can i just hand this to anyone and the answer s yeah if someone s you know of reproductive age it s safe to have on hand they can put it in their medicine cabinet at home godoy bellis says having emergency contraception on hand is especially critical in places like her home state in may oklahoma adopted the nation s most restrictive abortion law it s now illegal in all but a few cases bellis and so with that we know how critical it is that folks have access to last lines of defense like emergency contraception godoy advocates say this access will become more critical throughout the u s in a post roe v wade america maria godoy npr news soundbite of music transcript provided by npr copyright npr

president biden and big oil are at each other s throats at a time when gas prices are at the highest level in history hurting regular americans he points out that big oil companies are enjoying record profits the president earlier this month singled out exxonmobil saying the company made more money than god this year gas prices started skyrocketing following a raft of sanctions on russian oil after its invasion of ukraine in february the national average price of gasoline surpassed 5 a gallon for the first time ever this month prices have edged down by a few cents in recent days but remain elevated exacerbating these high gas prices is a huge shortage in refining capacity in the u s which isn t likely to be resolved any time soon refiners turn crude oil into usable products like gasoline diesel and jet fuel there s just fewer refiners in the u s today than a couple of years ago refining capacity in the u s is about a million barrels a day below what it was prior to the pandemic that s left the country unable to meet its fuel needs as more people are commuting traveling and driving as they emerge from the throes of the pandemic so where did all the refineries go some refineries shuttered during the pandemic induced recession in 2020 when demand for gasoline took a nosedive not all of those refineries have come back online the u s had five fewer refineries at the beginning of this year that at the beginning of 2020 when the pandemic hit and demand for oil evaporated during the recession refineries took a big financial hit when the price of gasoline plummeted some refiners threw in the towel they said the numbers just didn t work and closed up shop when you re losing money on doing it what do you do you stop making it and that s when you shut down refineries says denton cinquegrana chief oil analyst at oil price information service eduardo munoz alvarez getty images getty images fire smolders at an oil refinery that triggered several large explosions at the philadelphia energy solutions refining complex on june 21 2019 fire broke out in the early morning that triggered a vat of butane to ignite with an explosion so large that it was detected from space there were other disasters around the same time a philadelphia refinery one of the largest in the country was rocked by explosions a few months before the pandemic in louisiana another refinery was wiped out by hurricane ida both have been shut down oil is not where the future lies underpinning the decisions not to reopen refineries is the fact that the u s is undergoing an energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables the biden administration envisions a future where the world is powered by clean energy rather than oil with its destructive effect on the environment i think the refining executives say well looks like the writing s on the wall cinquegrana says in fact some refiners have repurposed their facilities where instead of making gasoline from oil they re ramping up to produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel out of feed stocks like soybean oil and used cooking oil biden wants a future in renewables but wants oil companies to pump more now of course high demand combined with high prices has led oil companies to make big profits exxonmobil s profit in the first quarter more than doubled from a year earlier meanwhile chevron reported its highest quarterly profit in nearly a decade while shell posted its highest earnings ever so president biden wants them to do more to bring down the price of gasoline justin sullivan getty images getty images petaluma california may 18 a customer pumps gas into their car at a gas station on may 18 2022 in petaluma california photo by justin sullivan getty images at a time of war refinery profit margins well above normal being passed directly onto american families are not acceptable the president wrote in a letter to the heads of seven oil companies earlier this month the president urged oil executives to increase the supply of gasoline and other refined products and to drill for more oil in a bid to bring gas prices down it s no surprise that this is raising eyebrows given the president s stated goals on an energy transition and also his promise to voters on the campaign trail that he would end fossil fuels francisco blanch head of commodities research at bank of america points out that the country is still heavily reliant on gasoline despite those goals the narrative until today was that we were going to be driving electric vehicles by the end of the year so who cares about refined products well it turns out a lot of people need refined products says blanch but could refiners be doing more u s refineries are already going gangbusters right now they re operating above 90 capacity according to the energy information administration and expected to run at 95 for the rest of the summer george frey getty images getty images salt lake city ut may 24 a driver unloads raw crude oil from his tanker to process into gas at marathon refinery on may 24 2022 in salt lake city utah photo by george frey getty images as for turning back on idled refineries that s not a quick fix either it would take months to bring the refineries back online and it would be costly for the refiners cinquegrana from oil price information service says that from the refiners perspective it doesn t make financial sense to invest in additional oil refining given the broader transition you re talking about a lot of money to get these refineries that are idled up and running when i m being told five years from now we hope you don t exist cinquegrana says the united states hasn t seen a major new refinery built since the 1970s and there s a good chance it never will chevron ceo mike wirth recently stated as much in an interview with bloomberg my personal view is there will never be another refinery built in the united states wirth said copyright 2022 npr to

menafn caribbean news global by arthur deakin back in 2010 guyana and suriname were not known for their hydrocarbon reserves but now both neighboring countries have discovered more than 17 billion barrels of oil equivalent and gas reserves that exceed 30 trillion cubic feet by mid 2030 guyana is expected to produce over 1 4mn barrels per day bpd the third highest in the region while suriname will produce 650 000 bpd the fifth most in latin america despite the promising future for the two south american countries their energy developments will be hindered by the lack of access to affordable capital suriname who defaulted on its debt payments in 2021 and has historically suffered from double digit inflation is in a precarious position locally surinamese banks are severely undercapitalized and often breach regulatory requirements obliging them to have a minimum amount of capital outside of its borders bilateral foreign investors do not trust the surinamese government or the institutions that are responsible for safeguarding their assets although the situation is slightly better in guyana it still remains an underdeveloped capital market with limited financing options for local companies most of its local businesses resort to money lenders who charge exorbitantly high interest rates or families and friends for capital guyana s stock exchange is also minuscule with a us 2 8 billion market cap and 19 listed securities as a means of comparison the nyse has a market cap of u 27 trillion with nearly 3 000 listings limited funding opportunities are concerning as the lack of capital is the number one reason startups fail nowhere is this more apparent than in risky jurisdictions such as suriname or guyana in fact the international energy agency iea states that nominal financing costs are up to seven times higher in emerging and developing markets vis a vis europe and the us simply put if an investor wants to develop a solar farm in guyana they will have to pay seven times more for the same amount of capital they would receive in florida with the acceleration of net zero policies this situation is exacerbated for fossil fuel assets policymakers need to establish the necessary mechanisms to reduce overall cost of capital as well as increase its availability to help frontier markets develop their energy sectors at a sustainable pace much of capital in the near term will come from development finance institutions in april 2022 the idb announced a us 27 million loan to help guyana with the development of human resources however without the infusion of private capital from both local and foreign sources local companies will struggle to emerge in what could be an economic boom for the guyanese people there are five proposed solutions that frontier energy markets such as guyana can pursue to improve their access to capital improve their macroeconomic policies to avoid overheating although guyana hasn t suffered with inflation in recent years it has historically been high and volatile given the current inflationary times and guyana s rapid economic growth it is fundamental to implement macroeconomic reforms that will prevent an overheating of its economy this includes but is not limited to complying with the spending limits of the national resource fund implementing control mechanisms to measure the efficiency of the monies and directing resources towards infrastructure and social gaps rather than direct payments to citizens become more transparent less corrupt this is often investors biggest concern before investing in riskier jurisdictions such as guyana and suriname it is fundamental to respect contracts both new and old to provide investor certainty depoliticizing the regulatory system by keeping politicians at arm s length from regulatory institutions will also ensure a more accountable and transparent process failure to have proper regulatory and fiscal safeguards will discourage new capital from coming in outside of what is absolutely vital establish an investor friendly framework to attract blended capital from development finance institutions dfis and institutional investors this will require a more developed sovereign debt market as well as a secondary market especially a repo market to increase liquidity this framework as well as innovative financial instruments will help jumpstart investments and create momentum for new investments however without first implementing solutions 1 and 2 this framework will be rendered ineffective increase funding towards higher education and technical training to foster local entrepreneurs this is perhaps the most important element in the development of local companies without the proper skills and training and the dissemination of the different financial tools that are available local entrepreneurs will struggle to succeed investment in primary education must also be done in parallel to nurture future generations loosening immigration laws to encourage the migration of surinamese diaspora and regional neighbors another major challenge for frontier energy markets is the access to skilled local labor to sustain the large scale development of the economy while point 4 will help in this endeavor opening the country to ex pats and guyanese diaspora will lead to more local labor capacity and capital reinvestment into the community as seen in shoe dog the book written by nike founder phil knight the largest challenge for the oregon based company was having enough liquidity to sustain its purchase orders on numerous occasions nike almost declared bankruptcy because it lacked access to credit banks often made the situation direr by failing to understand the nature of nike s business to capture market share through high growth and cash

michel martin host surveys show roughly a quarter of american women have at some point in their lives used emergency contraception pills to prevent an unintended pregnancy this type of contraception is effective safe and legal throughout the u s and yet researchers are finding it is not always available when people need it npr s maria godoy has this report maria godoy byline imagine this scenario that untold numbers of women find themselves in each year you ve had sex but something went wrong maybe the condom broke maybe you forgot to take a couple of birth control pills maybe you re a teenager with no access to birth control you don t want to get pregnant so you rush to the pharmacy for emergency contraception all the while the clock is ticking sonya borrero these are medications that are incredibly time sensitive godoy dr sonya borrero is a professor of medicine at the university of pittsburgh who focuses on reproductive health equity she says emergency contraception needs to be taken within five days after unprotected sex borrero but the sooner the better godoy but there s a problem she says you can t always find emergency contraception pills when you need them take for example plan b which is supposed to be available over the counter on the shelf stock for all ages but when borrero sent a team of medical students to pharmacies across western pennsylvania to see what they actually had on hand they found a third of pharmacies didn t stock plan b at all and when they did have it borrero most of the time it wasn t really on the shelf it was either behind the counter or in one of those lock boxes like really constraining access godoy because having to ask somebody to actually get the emergency contraception pills for you could be a real deterrent for some people borrero so you can imagine especially for a teen going and asking for one of these products being concerned about potential judgment can be a significant barrier to purchasing godoy pharmacists say there are good reasons for putting plan b under lock and key don downing was a practicing pharmacist he also helped develop plan b he s a professor at the university of washington school of pharmacy he says many pharmacists have told him over the years that plan b is frequently a target of theft he says he d rather see it locked up in the store than not available at all donald downing if they could make it available by keeping it behind the counter that may be ultimately more helpful to a woman than not stocking it at all godoy and keeping a drug in stock is even more of an issue when it comes to the other form of emergency contraception pills ella which requires a prescription borrero s study found only 5 of pharmacies had it available for immediate purchase borrero so 5 was abysmal i really was very surprised i was really thinking it would be something like 50 like 5 is crazy godoy think about it emergency contraception has to be taken within a very narrow window if the pharmacist has to order it even if it arrives the next day for some people that could be one day too late and the problem isn t just confined to pennsylvania studies conducted in pharmacies across the u s have found pretty much the same thing and the pills tend to be even harder to find in independent drugstores rebecca stone is a clinical pharmacist at the university of georgia she says one reason why many pharmacies don t stock ella is because it doesn t get prescribed very often rebecca stone it s not very well known by prescribers meaning you know physicians nurse practitioners any type of traditional prescriber nor by pharmacists godoy and if providers aren t prescribing it pharmacies are less likely to keep it in stock kelly cleland of the american society for emergency contraception says that s really concerning because ella can be a better choice particularly for certain people kelly cleland there is an issue with plan b and its generics potentially not working for people who weigh more than 165 pounds and for those folks it seems like ella is more effective so it s important that ella is available in stock and that people know about it godoy people who work in reproductive health want to see more education on emergency contraception for pharmacists for women and for doctors laura bellis is already on the case she s the executive director of take control initiative a contraception access program in tulsa county okla the program just rolled out training for doctors and other providers after many of them said they had lots of questions about emergency contraception laura bellis sometimes clinicians are like can i just hand this to anyone and the answer s yeah if someone s you know of reproductive age it s safe to have on hand they can put it in their medicine cabinet at home godoy bellis says having emergency contraception on hand is especially critical in places like her home state in may oklahoma adopted the nation s most restrictive abortion law it s now illegal in all but a few cases bellis and so with that we know how critical it is that folks have access to last lines of defense like emergency contraception godoy advocates say this access will become more critical throughout the u s in a post roe v wade america maria godoy npr news soundbite of music transcript provided by npr copyright npr
for now the supreme court was clear that the constitutional right to access contraceptives would remain untouched however some people are concerned about whether their right to birth control or plan b could be in jeopardy the overturning of roe v wade enacted trigger laws in 13 states in some cases banning abortions immediately whether done via procedure or medication a lot of people didn t at all know that this law was going into effect they didn t know what the kind of parameters of the law was said activist meghan turner in kentucky turner said the decision created confusion so she immediately took to facebook to let people know emergency contraception like plan b is still available some people are trying to stock up because of contraceptive failure and potential contraceptive failure in the future said dr mary claire haver dr haver is a board certified ob gyn practicing medicine in the houston area saturday she spent more than an hour on livestream addressing questions we have a trigger law that goes into effect here in 29 days that virtually eliminates all abortion access said haver i am active on multiple social media platforms and just the comment section is tens of thousands of comments everything from people wanting to say their opinion or asking me questions and i m trying to keep up and it s virtually impossible and she s not alone a doctor in austin tweeted her ob gyn received 22 calls for appointments between midnight and 6 a m saturday showing the desperation for care with abortion access already off the table in some states haver says women need to be reminded of their options researchers say hormonal implants and intrauterine devices or iuds are both safe dependable methods of birth control another option is plan b or the morning after pill which has a nearly 90 success rate when taken correctly birth control iuds and plan b are still legal everywhere in the u s unfortunately the most utilized forms of contraception condoms and birth control pills have a much higher failure rate said haver when it comes to medicine there s a big difference between the abortion pill and emergency contraceptives according to data compiled by the guttmacher institute more than 90 of abortions take place in the first 13 weeks of pregnancy more than half are now done with pills not surgery both options soon to be done away with in texas and various other states it s going to change the way we practice medicine and it s probably going to delay care in emergency situations while we re weighing these options and are we willing to risk jail time or a 100 000 fine which is the law now in texas said haver still activists like turner say the fight is not over this can be overturned reproductive freedom is not something that should be in the hands of our government at all she said while birth control remains legal 12 states allow some health care providers to refuse to provide services related to contraception the supreme court s decision that overruled roe v wade does not indicate that the court would revisit past decisions about birth control however justice clarence thomas said he would welcome challenges to that right
habibah johnson breathed a sigh of relief on her youngest son s third birthday this past year because she no longer needed to worry about child care staffing shortages at day care centers because of the pandemic meant long waitlists or hefty price tags so johnson relied on family and friends to watch her children while she was at work last year now that her son is 3 she can send him to prek 3 a free state run program but a lack of child care is not the only crisis largely facing women of late over the last six months caretakers mothers and people who menstruate have also faced infant formula recalls and now tampon shortages experts nonprofit organizers and mothers have said that women s needs are often overlooked by governments and that inequity feels especially acute as women return to the workforce day cares are charging 1 200 to 1 400 per month for a single child mothers are paying 50 to 60 for a can of formula people who menstruate and can t find tampons might use paper towels and napkins to absorb their periods a lot of this also has to deal with that a lot of our lawmakers don t have a period will never have a period haven t had a period and so even though this tampon shortage has been happening for quite a while it s just not top of mind for so many lawmakers yet said dana marlowe the president of i support the girls an organization that allocates bras and menstrual products to people who need them the new jersey legislature has introduced bills to address the child care crisis and period poverty but without swift action experts said that many women may not be able to return to the workforce child care shortage johnson a working mother of four said most of the day care centers near her had long waiting lists or were too expensive to enroll her son in the programs with the average center charging 1 200 to 1 400 per month she said the solution to the child care crisis is making day care for children ages 0 to 3 free for every family the constant change up of teachers at day care programs has affected her children because there is too much turnover she said children can also suffer from not attending day care because they are not learning and socializing there s this revolving door of teachers that come and go which impacts them because they re having to say goodbye to teachers that they have been with so it can be sort of an unstable environment for children because of these constant changes johnson said child care package of nj bills aims to make child care services more affordable accessible baby formula shortage nj parents seeking scarce baby formula endure long rides share tips on social media roe v wade number of out of state pregnant people seeking abortions in nj expected to grow before the pandemic winifred smith jenkins two child care centers were fully staffed and served about 200 children 5 years old and younger now 13 of her classrooms are empty and she is turning away families because she does not have enough employees to staff the centers i definitely believe that this is a direct effect of the pandemic but child care has been teetering on the verge of collapse for so long said smith jenkins senior director of zadie s nurturing den of the oranges and summit the pandemic did not push us over the edge as much as it just highlighted all of the problems that we ve been struggling with for decades women typically bear the brunt of child care responsibilities with many sacrificing their careers nearly 10 of new jersey women who are unemployed said they were not working because they were caring for children compared to just 2 3 of men according to a report released in april by the rutgers center for women and work since the onset of the pandemic 92 child care centers in new jersey have closed according to the new jersey department of children and families the best solution for moving forward is having the government fund child care as a public good like public schools said cynthia rice a senior analyst at advocates for children of new jersey with rising tuition costs to pay the teachers fewer children are able to attend child care which means that fewer mothers can return to the workforce businesses should also look into how they can best support their employees especially women through providing assistance for child care and more flexibility in working hours for parents she said the takeaway in all this is no matter how much money has already been spent in the child care system since the beginning of the pandemic that problems are not solved rice said and i think it s important to mention that the child care system really is the workforce behind the workforce and we need to find ways to solve these problems and that includes stronger state investment infant formula crisis since the birth of her son three months ago francesca mitchell has not known where her son s next can of infant formula will come from the shortage continues to impact families across the country after abbott nutrition recalled several of its formula brands in february and shut down the formula plant in michigan mitchell s son was born with a cow s milk protein allergy meaning that finding formula for him is even more difficult because he has reactions to most of the mainstream brands it s just been really crazy and then to top it off with the formula shortage he has not found a formula that works for him mitchell said mitchell said she uses facebook groups to find what pharmacies and retailers have specialty formulas in stock but some sellers on facebook have taken advantage of her she said scammers photoshopped images of formula cans into a post and when she sent the money to purchase them the user blocked her and did not ship her any formula she said each can of formula lasts her son about two days and retails anywhere between 26 to 60 each insurance does not cover it i have enough for two weeks and then i don t know what to do from there because number one i can t afford the formula it s ranging from 50 to 60 a can right now mitchell said and number two i don t even know what s going to happen with him how he s going to react to it so either way you re in a catch 22 the michigan formula plant reopened about two weeks ago but has shut down again because of flooding from storms and that will likely exacerbate the shortage stores across the state and country were setting limits on how many formula containers someone could buy as shelves remained close to empty parents created facebook groups and other online forums to share what stores have formula in stock lisa pitz the assistant director of hunger free nj said mothers have reached out to food banks to see if they have formula and that mothers of children with special dietary needs are having even more trouble finding the formula they need low income families are disproportionately impacted by the formula shortage though and wic has taken some steps to improve access to formula as much as possible pitz said in an email referring to the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children tampon shortages women and people who menstruate are faced with another supply chain crisis tampon shortages caused by supply chain issues and staffing shortages nonprofit organizations who collect menstrual product donations said these shortages will strongly impact low income people who were already struggling to find and afford tampons marlowe the president of i support the girls said she first heard in january that there was likely going to be a shortage of tampons the number of tampons the organization has been able to distribute dropped dramatically in 2022 218 000 tampons compared to nearly 450 000 at this time in 2021 she said many women who can t afford to order menstrual products online or to use reusable options like menstrual cups and period underwear may resort to unsanitary options like torn up sheets or toilet paper this may prevent them from going to work or school which puts them at a disadvantage compared to their male counterparts when folks are marginalized or homeless so much of choice is stripped away whether it s the choice of how and when you know what you want to eat for dinner or you know what clothing you want to wear because you might be at the whim of whatever is donated and people give you on a given day marlowe said so one of the things that all of us at i support the girls like to do is provide that choice in how you manage your menstrual health the new jersey senate introduced legislation to reimburse school districts for suppling menstrual products in some public schools the legislation was referred back to the senate budget and appropriations committee earlier this month elise joy the co founder of girls helping girls period said her organization and others similar to it are having trouble keeping tampons stocked while they rarely had issues before she said many consumers have resorted to panic buying which is worsening the shortage because many people are hoarding tampons she said the shortage has brought the issues of period poverty to the forefront and she hopes that the state legislature can pass the bills to make menstrual products free in schools and more accessible to people with periods the tampon shortage has forced people to realize how low income families feel when they cannot get the products they need the silver lining to this is that more people will be educated on period poverty and about the need for us to find ways to support people in our society joy said and one of the simplest things we can do is by making menstrual products free to students and schools

selinexor is an oral small molecule xpo1 inhibitor tislelizumab is an anti pd 1 checkpoint inhibitor shanghai and hong kong june 26 2022 prnewswire antengene corporation limited antengene sehk 6996 hk a leading innovative commercial stage global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering developing and commercializing first in class and or best in class therapeutics in hematology and oncology today announced that it has entered into a clinical trial collaboration with beigene to evaluate the safety pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of selinexor in combination with beigene s anti pd 1 checkpoint inhibitor tislelizumab this multi center open label phase i ii trial will evaluate the investigational combination as a potential treatment option for patients with t and nk cell lymphoma we are delighted to partner with beigene a company that strives for innovation and excellence and is committed to developing best in class or first in class anti cancer therapies for patients across the globe these qualities are very similar to those of our vision at antengene said dr jay mei antengene s founder chairman and ceo we look forward to advancing the combination of selinexor and tislelizumab to clinical development with good data we will be able to bring this treatment regimen to patients with t and nk cell lymphoma diseases that are endemic in asia but underserved by current therapies at antengene we believe that the combinational use of immuno oncology drugs and selective inhibitor of nuclear export sine compounds possesses huge potential as novel treatment regimens for cancer patients said dr kevin lynch antengene s chief medical officer the mechanism of action of selinexor in inhibiting the nuclear export protein xpo1 facilitates the intranuclear accumulation of tumor suppressors making it a good partner in multiple combination treatment regimens preclinical research we conducted demonstrated that selinexor combined with a checkpoint inhibitor increased anti tumor activity in multiple tumor models in addition deep and durable responses were also seen in multiple case reports of patients with t and nk cell lymphoma treated with selinexor in combination with an anti pd 1 checkpoint inhibitor we hope to confirm that selinexor can synergize with tislelizumab to deliver an effective treatment regimen and help address the huge unmet medical needs in t and nk cell lymphoma in the asia pacific regions and around the world continued dr lynch tislelizumab is a pd 1 inhibitor designed to help aid the body s immune cells to detect and fight tumors tislelizumab a humanized monoclonal antibody is specifically designed to minimize binding to fcγr on macrophages in pre clinical studies binding to fcγr on macrophages has been shown to compromise the anti tumor activity of pd 1 antibodies through activation of antibody dependent macrophage mediated killing of t effector cells about t and nk cell lymphoma t and nk cell lymphoma is a set of heterogeneous diseases accounting for 25 30 of non hodgkin lymphoma nhl cases in china and only about 10 in usa and europe there has been little improvement in the past decade when compared to b cell non hodgkin lymphoma b nhl as 5 year overall survival rate was only 30 in most common subtypes the unmet medical needs remain as agents with new mechanism of action to be explored and possibility to improve the treatment paradigm for the disease about the sine compounds selective inhibitor of nuclear export sine compounds are inhibitors of the major nuclear export protein exportin 1 xpo1 currently there are three oral sine compounds atg 010 selinexor atg 016 eltanexor and atg 527 verdinexor under clinical development antengene has obtained exclusive development and commercialisation rights from karyopharm therapeutics inc nasdaq kpti to these three compounds in certain apac markets about xpovio selinexor xpovio is the world s first approved orally available selective inhibitor of the nuclear export protein xpo1 it offers a novel mechanism of action synergistic effects in combination regimens fast onset of action and durable responses by blocking the nuclear export protein xpo1 xpovio can promote the intranuclear accumulation and activation of tumor suppressor proteins and growth regulating proteins and down regulate the levels of multiple oncogenic proteins xpovio delivers its antitumor effects through three mechanistic pathways 1 exerting antitumor effects by inducing the intranuclear accumulation of tumor suppressor proteins 2 reducing the level of oncogenic proteins in the cytoplasm by inducing the intranuclear accumulation of oncogenic mrnas and 3 restoring hormone sensitivity by activating the glucocorticoid receptors gr pathway to utilize its unique mechanism of actions xpovio is being evaluated for use in multiple combination regimens in a range of indications at present antengene is conducting 10 clinical studies of xpovio in mainland china for the treatment of relapsed refractory hematologic malignancies and solid tumors 3 of these studies are being jointly conducted by

metro detroit parents have taken to social media to help each other locate what little stock of infant formula remains on store shelves as the nationwide baby formula shortage is well into a fourth month berkley parent heather chesnutt started the detroit area formula finders facebook group last month because she wanted to help save parents time and money spent searching for formula since online inventories struggle to keep up with in store stock i thought of the idea of utilizing a facebook group to connect caregivers with individuals that were out shopping and could just post a photo of the formula aisle while they were there you know being able to leverage somebody who s doing an everyday action to make them part of the solution and finding formula chesnutt said the group has grown to more than 2 000 members and chesnutt s efforts have since expanded parents post in the group offering formula they don t need anymore and others can post about specific brands they re searching for group administrators also source formula from local groups including honey for moms in ferndale and rise wellness collaborative in ann arbor which both have free formula libraries the formula finders are among facebook groups of varying sizes that started to crowd source for formula in metro detroit others include formula finders southeast michigan baby formula finder for michigan and metro detroit finding formula it s wonderful to see michiganders and people in general come together during these times of need to support each other said elizabeth griem a sterling heights mom whose children no longer rely on baby formula but helps other parents across several facebook groups with the crowdsourcing information and letting people know i know if there s ever a shortage on anything else there ll be another group that pops up pontiac mom averi wilson 28 was weathering the formula shortage until recently she was connected with someone this past week who had extra formula via the formula finders facebook group there was a woman in the group that saw me posting about the trouble that i was having wilson said she sent me a message and said hey you know i happen to have some extra formula that you re looking for if you want to come pick it up the shortage is partly the result of a february recall of products including formula made at the abbott nutrition plant in michigan linked to nine children s deaths earlier this month production was halted again at the sturgis factory due to extensive flooding abbott has stopped production of its elecare specialty formula and is doing clean up resanitizing and testing before it restarts production and distribution in what the company estimated would be a few weeks the pause of the abbott plant is compounding a formula shortage that has been most dire for children with allergies digestive problems and metabolic disorders who rely on specialty formulas the abbott factory is the only source of many of those products providing nutrition to about 5 000 u s babies according to federal officials wic formula challenges half of the children born in michigan receive benefits from the women infants and children program a federally funded initiative administered by the michigan department of health to help low and moderate income families obtain affordable nutritious food wic credits can be exchanged for abbott baby formula brands and other foods at participating retailers detroit area parents and children using wic benefits face unique challenges in finding baby formula because wic credits are only accepted in person at specific retailers where popular formulas are often out of stock and gas prices have been uncharacteristically high parents say michigan department of health and human services spokeswoman lynn sutfin said about 85 of michigan s formula fed wic participants have been affected by the abbott recall and they are prioritizing families most critical and immediate needs chesnutt said one of the formula finders main purposes is to help combat the additional challenges parents using wic benefits face big box chain stores that have not accepted wic credits receive a large portion of the available baby formula forcing several program users to pay for formula themselves according to metro detroit parents while the wic program store locator says all metro detroit costcos and targets accept wic benefits several parents claim otherwise some of the places that would actually have some formula wouldn t accept wic said dearborn resident alyssa english who had been searching for her daughter s hypoallergenic brand of formula the cans are really expensive so i was actually having to pay out of pocket for her formula when i would find it waterford township resident kasaundra evens 26 uses the formula finders facebook group to find food for her 3 month old son and said she wished more costcos and targets accepted her wic credit i do have wic and yes it is a challenge to find a formula sometimes i do have to purchase it with my own money if they re not accepted evens said i know at costco they don t accept wic and i did find some at costco and i had to pay out of my pocket issues at big box stores pontiac resident wilson said she experienced similar issues while the facebook updates about in stock formula are helpful it can be difficult to find the money to buy her baby s formula when many local target and costco locations don t accept wic benefits she said as the companies are finally able to start making more formula they re sending them to the really popular big name stores and they re not sending it to the spartan foods on the corner or the little corner family owned grocery store wilson said those are the places that accept wic target spokesperson jessica carlson told the detroit news in an email that the company offers a number of payment options at their stores including wic in nearly all states and is working with local agencies to expand wic benefits to more stores and locations costco did not respond to requests for comment sutfin said any store including large chains can apply to be a wic authorized vendor in michigan applications are accepted on a rolling basis and approved based on a store s ability to provide the minimum amount of wic approved formula and the current number of vendor openings in a zip code based on the number of wic participants living there she said providing real time updates while parents previously resorted to driving around southeast michigan in search of in stock formula 5 a gallon gas prices have made this unfeasible for some families especially those with low incomes the formula finders group helps with this since shoppers provide real time updates about in stock formulas at local stores chesnutt said i would dedicate a day to formula finding english said with the gas prices being so high it s just expensive all around to drive around for a whole day it s so time consuming and costly since wic benefits can only be used in person retailers that put available stock online exclude a large percentage of people from accessing formula during the shortage chesnutt said sutfin confirmed that wic credits cannot be used in online transactions in michigan and said the state health department is researching how residents can do this soon at a lot of stores like walmart and stuff my daughter s formula is available for shipping and that s cool and all but you can t use wic for shipping said clinton township resident annie gallagher 27 english was only able to find her daughter s brand of nutramigen formula because of a posting in the formula finders facebook group i found it on the group about two weeks ago through a posting that another mom posted of the stock at the allen park meijer she said so i was able to find her two big cans of formula and it was really helpful because i m searching everywhere for it and i couldn t find it gallagher similarly was recently struggling to find her daughter s formula and looked to the formula finders group chesnutt found her a couple of cans it s terrifying as a parent and my baby she s not even old enough to eat food yet so really she s primarily formula gallagher said you just don t know what you re gonna do it s my job to take care of her and she depends on me for that hmackay detroitnews com

markets equities had a solid finish to the week as the reversion lower in yields created a meaningful tailwind for growth stocks and given the market body language of late i suspect long term investors were more than happy to ride a sea of green for a change indeed it was an epic bear market bounce especially as doom and gloom prophecies have recession storm clouds billowing vertically with the horizon we calculate the lack of selling was enough to explain some of the bounce as there was minimal buy flow from retail or otherwise bankrolling this rotation rally on bonds we think the street will wait until we are closer to the next cpi release to re enter shorts as seasonal factors support the duration rally so there might be more breathing room for stocks amid this fragile détente university of michigan s final release revised the 5 10y inflation expectation to 3 1 from 3 3 and the 1y inflation expectation was adjusted to 5 3 from 5 4 on the surface it suggests it was unreasonable for the fed to decide on monetary policy with a backward looking approach with 5y5y breaks still in check many now think it was unnecessary to hike 75bp based on one data survey so the softer fed funds curve on friday was due to the more faded inflation reprint i would ignore it for a straightforward reason higher oil prices are inflation enemy number one for the fed and lower gasoline prices are at the top of the biden administration s election plan ahead of the november midterms with the fed focusing on headline over core us monetary policy is increasingly captive to oil prices that observation implies higher volatility around the fed s reaction function hence with oil and gasoline prices staying high the fed will keep the rate hike pedal to the metal in addition any hot data prints will provide room for higher repricing in front meetings especially with a narrow window for the fed to sprint to the finish line and hit the end of year terminal rates target in that view the risk reward for further front loading of hikes is attractive we think the next multiple legs lower in the s p 500 will come from a de rating in earnings last week i suggested there was no need to risk a career mistake selling blocks of spx 3700 at 30 vix indeed institutional sellers will need a lot more confidence that the earnings deterioration is happening now and that the consumer has stopped spending both go hand in hand declining consumer spending does represent the main threat to earnings for big ticket items especially in the case of a recession and of course with the most significant pension month end and quarter end rebalancing buy estimate since march 2020 laying in wait folks are less inclined to step in front of a month end bounce energy equities were under enormous pressure until friday s reversal consistent with the broad drawdown across the commodity complex driven by growing recession and demand concerns and that should remain a pressure point hence i suspect commodity markets will remain in focus particularly oil given the extent to which energy inflation fears have driven risk this year oil prices price action will soon tell us if the latest dive was a function of demand destruction or crowded positioning but one thing is sure the oil complex is not nearly as impervious as many had thought after getting hammered most of last week due to recession and fuel demand destruction concerns oil prices rallied into the weekend on the back of physical demand those global economic worries were seemingly offset by higher china demand for real world barrels indeed energy demand in northern central and northwestern china hit record levels as millions turned on the ac to escape the oppressive heatwave which likely created the domino effect record high electricity impacts not only fuel intensive industry production but also oil prices there could have been some element of the tail time spreads wagging the dog spot but the curve in heavy backwardation for a while but when word starts spreading that china is a premium for prompt barrels it s more than enough to spook shorts although oil is a spot asset usually driven by supply and demand fundamentals it is not unusual for the complex to trade like an anticipatory asset stocks and forex driven by the broader economic growth rate of demand which is slowing if the pmi data are dependable our view has been unwavering in the absence of fresh supply it will be challenging to see brent trading below 100 as ukraine russia war escalation will continue to drive energy price fears on the other hand it is a fallacy to think brent crude l could stay 120 given the amount of central bank induced slowdown likely to be seen later in the year the fed and other inflation fighting central banks want lower commodities which is what they are explicitly trying to engineer gold g 7 countries will make it official that they have stopped buying russian gold since russian bars have been considered politically tainted in the west following the country s invasion of ukraine i doubt making it official will have much impact on the gold market as it was assumed that russia would keep domestic production at home to soak up surplus usd and prevent excessive appreciation of the ruble but there could be some headline bounce at the open forex g 10 last week s eurozone pmis added to a laundry list of reasons to be suspicious about chasing the euro higher from the ukraine war to china s lockdowns economic activity looks bleak at the same time this would typically be enough to send the eurusd shuffling towards parity on the back of a hawkish fed however the street is conflicted with the ecb on the brink of a momentous policy pivot while setting the springboard to exit negative rates i do not think the street wanted to be short euro ahead of this week s sintra meeting that could cement expectations for an impending exit from negative rates and possibly rolling out a functional anti fragmentation backstop on another counter trend trade we still think the yen offers attractive skew due to rising us recession risks and the prospect of a change in monetary policy in japan itself and with intervention rhetoric picking up tokyo could be guarded about buying dollars up here asia fx as usual the ringgit continues to be driven by external factors while underperforming the terms of trade improvement due to its high beta to cnh weakness outflows from domestic investors and exporters unwilling to convert usd due to the hawkish fed however with global risk sentiment improving and the yuan rallying we could see follow through below 4 40 early in the week if us yields continue to trade soft
new york cnn business russia s invasion of ukraine is a major reason that us drivers are paying record prices for gasoline but it s not the only cause of the spike numerous factors are pushing prices up with regular gasoline hitting a record 4 87 a gallon monday according to aaa s survey up 25 cents a gallon in just the last week gas prices were already expected to breach the 4 a gallon mark for the first time since 2008 with or without shots fired in eastern europe or economic sanctions imposed on russia but now the national average is expected to hit 5 a gallon within the next two weeks said tom kloza global head of energy analysis for the opis which tracks gas prices for aaa i think we reach 5 somewhere between this weekend and juneteenth father s day weekend he said it was back in march that prices first broke the record of 4 11 a gallon which had stood since 2008 that now seems like the good old days the national average has been rising steadily for the past month setting 27 records in the last 28 days more than one out of every five gas stations nationwide is now charging more than 5 a gallon for regular and just more than half are charging 4 75 there are 10 states plus washington dc where the average price is already at 5 or more alaska arizona california hawaii indiana michigan illinois nevada oregon and washington several more are within a penny of 5 so those states prices are likely only a day or two at most from crossing the mark that s because there s a number of reasons beside the disruption of russian oil exports driving prices higher according to kloza and making predictions about where prices will go has proved difficult as school let out and summer travel picks up so will gasoline demand and price he said anything goes from june 20 to labor day kloza said we could certainly see the national average approach 6 here s what s behind the record price surge russia s invasion of ukraine russia is one of the largest oil exporters on the planet in december it sent nearly 8 million barrels of oil and other petroleum products to global markets 5 million of them as crude oil very little of that went to the united states in 2021 europe got 60 of the oil and 20 went to china but oil is priced on global commodity markets so the loss of russian oil affects prices around the globe no matter where it is used the concerns about disrupting global markets led western nations to initially exempt russian oil and natural gas from the sanctions they put in place to protest the invasion but in march the united states announced a formal ban on all russian energy imports and last week the eu announced a ban on imports of russian oil by ship which represented about two thirds of the oil european nations imported from russia russia s oil is slowly and steadily being removed from global markets china lockdowns ending one factor keeping oil prices somewhat in check has been the surge of covid cases and strict lockdown rules in much of the country that was a major drag on demand for oil but as the covid surge has started to retreat the lockdowns are being lifted in major cities such as shanghai and more demand without increased supply can only drive up prices video ad feedback this is what determines the price of gas 01 57 source cnn less oil and gas from other sources oil prices plunged when pandemic related stay at home orders around the world crushed demand in the spring of 2020 and crude briefly traded at negative prices in response opec and its allies including russia agreed to slash production as a way to support prices and even when demand returned sooner than expected they kept production targets low us oil companies don t adhere to those types of nationally mandated production targets but they have been reluctant or unable to resume producing oil at pre pandemic levels amid concerns that tougher environmental rules could cut future demand many of those stricter rules have been scaled back or failed to become law the biden administration is suddenly interested in more drilling not less robert mcnally president of consulting firm rapidan energy group said earlier this spring people are more worried about high oil prices than anything else it takes time to scale up production particularly when oil companies are facing the same supply chain and hiring challenges as thousands of other us businesses they can t find people and can t find equipment mcnally added it s not like they re available at a premium price they re just not available oil stocks have generally lagged the broader market over the last two years at least until the recent run up in prices oil company executives would rather find ways to boost their share price than increase production oil and gas companies do not want to drill more pavel molchanov an analyst at raymond james said earlier this spring they are under pressure from the financial community to pay more dividends to do more share buybacks instead of the proverbial drill baby drill which is the way they would have done things 10 years ago corporate strategy has fundamentally changed one of the starkest examples exxonmobil xom last month announced first quarter profits of 8 8 billion more than triple the level of a year ago when excluding special items it also announced a 30 billion share repurchase plan far more than the 21 billion to 24 billion it expects to spend on all capital investment including searching for new oil not only is oil production lagging behind pre pandemic levels us refining capacity is falling today about 1 million fewer barrels of oil a day are available to be processed into gasoline diesel jet fuel and other petroleum based products state and federal environmental rules are prompting some refineries to switch from oil to lower carbon renewable fuels some companies are closing older refineries rather than investing what it would cost to retool to keep them operating especially with massive new refineries set to open overseas in asia the middle east and africa in 2023 and the fact that diesel and jet fuel prices are up far more than gasoline prices shows that refiners are shifting more of their production to those products economics mandate you make more jet and diesel fuel to the detriment of gasoline said kloza and with prices in europe even higher than in the united states both canadian and us oil producers have increased exports of oil and gasoline to the continent that has also limited the us supply strong demand for gas but supply is only part of the equation for prices demand is the other key and while it s very strong right now it s still not back to pre pandemic levels video ad feedback how to save money on gas by being more fuel efficient 01 40 source cnn the us economy had record job growth in 2021 and while those gains have slowed they remain historically strong demand is getting another boost as the many employees who have been working from home for much of the last two years return to the office the start of the summer travel season on memorial day weekend likely sparked the typical annual increases in demand for gas and jet fuel us airlines all report very strong bookings for summer travel even with airfares climbing above pre pandemic levels the end of the omicron surge and the removal of many covid restrictions is encouraging people to get out of the house for more shopping entertainment and travel come hell or high gas prices people are going to take vacations said kloza commuting may remain down slightly many who plan to return to the office will be there only three or four days a week and the total number of jobs is still a bit below 2019 levels but there will be periods most likely this summer with higher demand for gas than during comparable periods before the pandemic kloza predicts even before ukraine i was expecting to break the record kloza said now it s a question of how much we break the record by
selinexor is an oral small molecule xpo1 inhibitor tislelizumab is an anti pd 1 checkpoint inhibitor shanghai and hong kong june 27 2022 prnewswire antengene corporation limited antengene sehk 6996 hk a leading innovative commercial stage global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering developing and commercializing first in class and or best in class therapeutics in hematology and oncology today announced that it has entered into a clinical trial collaboration with beigene to evaluate the safety pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of selinexor in combination with beigene s anti pd 1 checkpoint inhibitor tislelizumab this multi center open label phase i ii trial will evaluate the investigational combination as a potential treatment option for patients with t and nk cell lymphoma we are delighted to partner with beigene a company that strives for innovation and excellence and is committed to developing best in class or first in class anti cancer therapies for patients across the globe these qualities are very similar to those of our vision at antengene said dr jay mei antengene s founder chairman and ceo we look forward to advancing the combination of selinexor and tislelizumab to clinical development with good data we will be able to bring this treatment regimen to patients with t and nk cell lymphoma diseases that are endemic in asia but underserved by current therapies at antengene we believe that the combinational use of immuno oncology drugs and selective inhibitor of nuclear export sine compounds possesses huge potential as novel treatment regimens for cancer patients said dr kevin lynch antengene s chief medical officer the mechanism of action of selinexor in inhibiting the nuclear export protein xpo1 facilitates the intranuclear accumulation of tumor suppressors making it a good partner in multiple combination treatment regimens preclinical research we conducted demonstrated that selinexor combined with a checkpoint inhibitor increased anti tumor activity in multiple tumor models in addition deep and durable responses were also seen in multiple case reports of patients with t and nk cell lymphoma treated with selinexor in combination with an anti pd 1 checkpoint inhibitor we hope to confirm that selinexor can synergize with tislelizumab to deliver an effective treatment regimen and help address the huge unmet medical needs in t and nk cell lymphoma in the asia pacific regions and around the world continued dr lynch tislelizumab is a pd 1 inhibitor designed to help aid the body s immune cells to detect and fight tumors tislelizumab a humanized monoclonal antibody is specifically designed to minimize binding to fcr on macrophages in pre clinical studies binding to fcr on macrophages has been shown to compromise the anti tumor activity of pd 1 antibodies through activation of antibody dependent macrophage mediated killing of t effector cells about t and nk cell lymphoma t and nk cell lymphoma is a set of heterogeneous diseases accounting for 25 30 of non hodgkin lymphoma nhl cases in china and only about 10 in usa and europe there has been little improvement in the past decade when compared to b cell non hodgkin lymphoma b nhl as 5 year overall survival rate was only 30 in most common subtypes the unmet medical needs remain as agents with new mechanism of

mary curnock cook network chair at edtech venture capital fund emerge education and chris hale interim ceo at universities uk attended a gathering of leading edtech founders and report back you can find the authors on twitter marycurnockcook and chrishaleuk london edtech week runs from 20 to 26 june you can find out more here as in many sectors venture funding prospects for early stage start ups have been disrupted by the pandemic the war in ukraine and the effect that higher interest rates have on financial markets and investor appetite valuations are down the cost of money is up and risk appetite is flexing with the uncertain times nevertheless a sense of optimism prevailed at the emerge education summit in may hosted at one of its investee organisations the london interdisciplinary school edtech it seems is unbowed by the headwinds former president of the american public university system dr wally boston also reviewed the summit here in a conference largely directed at founders and funders we were amongst a small number of sector facing delegates and we reflect here on the implications for higher education firstly the sense of purpose and mission amongst delegates was palpable edtech founders and funders are drawn to the education sector because it has meaning and social purpose and emerge s own manifesto is strongly rooted in its principals backgrounds that have been dramatically shaped by education opportunity the edtech community has no pretentions to make a quick buck with one delegate saying that it takes at least ten years to develop into a mature successful operation and observing that i m nine years in and only just getting started we noted that a new generation of edtech opportunities is emerging going beyond some of the narrow functional innovations of the last five years for example simple matching algorithms for students and courses think paas over saas platform as a service over software as a service although as this excellent piece from michael feldstein points out universities erp and student records systems may yet be holding them back there are new providers reimagining higher education and it is merging seamlessly into a renewed interest in using personal learning and development in the corporate world not just for upskilling and reskilling but also as an employee benefit to address the shifting balance of power between employer and employee driven by acute skills shortages many delegates assume that demand for the traditional school leaver undergraduate experience will fall and rapidly as people recognise that they might be able to learn more and better in the context of their own career story as it unfolds the growing offer of micro credentials in higher education and the opportunity that the lifelong loan entitlement offers to fund potential students will fuel this shift in turn this puts a new focus on innovative approaches to learning and teaching and a nuanced conversation about the relative importance of face to face learning and the opportunities to apply digital tools to enhance student engagement and improve outcomes as professor jeff grabill wrote in the recently learning and teaching needs to go digital not online both of us reflected that developments in digitally enhanced learning and teaching delt create an urgent need to provide support and training to academic teachers not just to demystify the tech but also to ensure that educators have the confidence to introduce and use the enhancements that digital can bring to the student academic experience with an emphasis on the underpinning pedagogy the unhelpful public and policy narrative that pits face to face teaching against online learning is out of date with developments in this space which amongst other things have the potential to prepare students much better for the changing world of work they will encounter when they graduate graduate jobs and careers were singled out as an under served segment where edtech has yet to come up with solutions that go beyond the often flawed matching of skills to jobs several people noted that the early career job switching cycle has moved from an average of around four years to more like 18 months to two years and in the us already a third of workers are freelancers this points to a fundamental shift in what we understand a job an employer or a career to be with important implications for how we support students to imagine and pursue their future in a changing world of work as a consequence universities need to get better at surfacing the transferrable skills their courses provide to students so that graduates can be much more fluent in articulating what they are good at and in mapping this to the jobs and projects they want to participate in perhaps it also heralds a generation of new course programme or module offers that will make the link between going to university and a successful career more explicit without losing the inherent motivation of studying a subject which in itself might not seem to point directly to a particular career sector importantly careers education needs as much focus on sectors as it does on job roles because of the interdependence between the two in a changing landscape perhaps the most important takeaway from this event however was the feeling that higher education policy needs to move on from merely improving the current offer effective policy and regulation should support and encourage universities to innovate in learning and teaching as well as in research students want and deserve this but the regulatory sandbox remains small and regimented many providers are playing safe as a result as franklin d roosevelt said we cannot always build the future for our youth but we can build our youth for the future get our updates via email

members of the queer community in the respective country spartacus said in its report the index focused on the political decision making legal frameworks and whether episodes of violence against the lgbtq community were recorded in the countries recently the index attempts at finding a balance between measuring the rights of the local lgbtiq community and considering the demands of queer holidaymakers said spartacus our aim is to monitor the safety of queer people in each country and also increase the awareness on grievances it added advertisement not great choice for lgbtq travelers the index according to spartacus consisted of 17 categories at present namely anti discrimination legislation marriage civil partnership adoption allowed transgender rights intersex 3rd option equal age of consent conversion therapy lgbt marketing religious influence hiv travel restrictions anti gay laws homosexuality illegal pride banned locals hostile prosecution murders death sentences each country was rated per category and their overall score 13 being the highest total score it has a negative impact on the rating of a country if human rights are not observed nor guaranteed or even worse violated a zero rating as the lowest rating is only awarded if a county is lacking in important but not elementary categories such as lgbt marketing or anti discrimination legislation spartacus explained on the map based on the index scores countries were color coded with dark green indicating the most liberal and queer friendly countries while red assigned to the most dangerous countries for homosexuals to visit or live in canada was the only country that ranked 1st in the index with a total score of 13 the country which upholds the canadian human rights act received a high score of 3 on the anti discrimination legislation meanwhile at the other end of the spectrum were the republic of chechnya in russia 19 points saudi arabia and somalia both with 18 points and iran 17 points the middle east north africa and central asia are the regions least safe for lgbtq travelers while latin america proves more welcoming than asia with the exception of taiwan india and thailand at least score 1 point on the index while nepal ranks at a neutral 0 and japan scores 2 said katharina buchholz senior data journalist at consumer company statista the philippines which ranked 117th along with 17 other countries received a total score of 7 the country scored seven 1 scores in seven different categories unfortunately it did not have any positive scores below are the philippines scores per

separate report published in 2020 by the international lesbian gay bisexual trans and intersex association ilga a worldwide federation of more than 1 700 organizations from over 160 countries and territories campaigning for lesbian gay bisexual trans and intersex human rights gave a closer look on the sexual orientation laws in countries worldwide including the philippines the recent state sponsored homophobia report as explained by ilga is a world survey of sexual orientation laws which ranges from criminalization of consensual same sex sexual acts between adults to protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation the sexual orientation laws covered in the report were divided into three categories criminalization protection and recognition under the three categories were different sub categories or questions pertaining to the specific sexual orientation laws which might or might not be enacted in countries included in the report below were the observations made by the ilga in 2020 regarding the sexual orientation laws or the lack thereof in the philippines criminalization are same sex sexual acts legal yes date of decriminalization 1870 max penalty none protection constitution no broad protection limited employment limited hate crime no incitement no ban conversion therapies no recognition same sex marriage no civil unions no joint adoption no second parent adoption no the 1870 spanish penal code which contained no provisions criminalizing same sex sexual relations between consenting adults applied in the territory until the approval of the 1932 revised penal code rpc which likewise did not include such criminalizing provisions the ilga stated the report likewise acknowledged the efforts made by certain local governments on enacting anti discrimination laws which criminalize discrimination against individuals based on their sexual orientation in the philippines the cities of dumaguete ilagan manila marikina valenzuela and zamboanga passed local ordinances that prohibited acts of discrimination against individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation including employment ilga said this had the effect of expanding the scope of protection at the subnational level as local activists continue to push for national protections it added however on the national level the philippine government has yet to push the sexual orientation and gender identity and expression sogie equality bill the bill aims to give equal rights to all persons and prohibits people from discriminating other people based on their sogie or sexual orientation gender identity or expression last june 15 sen risa hontiveros vowed to carve the runway to pass the sogie equality bill at long last in the 19th congress spotlight on conversion therapy conversion therapy is the practice of attempting or forcibly making someone straight because society or people perceive homosexuality as a disease that needs to be cured so called conversion therapy sometimes known as reparative therapy is a range of dangerous and discredited practices that falsely claim to change a person s sexual orientation or gender identity or expression said the human rights campaign america s largest civil rights organization working to achieve lgbtq equality however according to the american non governmental media monitoring organization glaad the practice has come under increasing scrutiny as a result providers or supporters of the practice frequently change their terminology to avoid detection other terms used for conversion therapy include sexual orientation change efforts soce sexual attraction fluidity exploration in therapy safe t eliminating reducing or decreasing the frequency or intensity of unwanted same sex attraction ssa reparative therapy sexual reorientation efforts ex gay ministry promoting healthy sexuality addressing sexual addictions and disorders sexuality counseling encouraging relational and sexual wholeness healing sexual brokenness based on the 2020 state sponsored homophobia report by ilga out of the 193 countries and territories in the report only four countries have fully banned conversion therapy meanwhile 10 others made limited laws or took legal actions to ban it or some areas in those countries or territories have banned the practice these countries include argentina limited brazil banned dominican republic banned mexico limited peru banned uruguay limited canada limited united states limited germany banned spain limited australia limited fiji limited nauru limited samoa limited in the

this delivery comes after ukrainian presidential adviser mykhailo podolyak made a recent request through twitter where he pleaded to their western allies to supply them with 1 000 155mm caliber howitzers 300 mlrs 500 tanks 2 000 units of armored vehicles and 1 000 drones himars have arrived to ukraine thank you to my colleague and friend secdef lloyd j austin iii for these powerful tools summer will be hot for russian occupiers and the last one for some of them ukraine has confirmed that the us donated high mobility artillery rocket systems himars has now arrived this comes after ukraine had requested the west to replenish their supply of heavy weaponry with longer ranged munitions to push the russians back as the fighting rages on in the eastern ukrainian city of severodonetsk himars have arrived to ukraine thank you to my colleague and friend secdef lloyd j austin iii for these powerful tools summer will be hot for russian occupiers and the last one for some of them pic twitter com btmwadthpp oleksii reznikov oleksiireznikov june 23 2022 this request was made public as the ukrainians still continue to suffer under continued and intensified russian shelling in the east with the ukrainian government admitting that they have been outgunned in terms of artillery the long ranged nature of russian artillery and the sheer number of shells they are firing per day has led to some 200 ukrainian troops dying daily as reported by the ukrainian authorities the russian forces are reportedly equipped with smerch and uragan mlrs that can hit ukrainian targets from 50 to 180 miles away whereas ukraine only has howitzers that can accurately hit targets up to 15 5 miles away with the long range high power himars now in ukraine the ukrainian armed forces will now have a significant answer to the russian onslaught the himars typically armed with 200 pound high explosive warheads is actually able to hit targets up to 190 miles away however the us decided that it was only going to send rockets with the system that can only reach targets up to 43 miles this was done because the ukrainians might give in to temptations to strike targets within the russian mainland using the himars which could potentially be interpreted as an act of war by russia as these are us supplied weapons in response to the donations russian president vladimir putin threatened to increase russian bombardments if the west were to send these himars along with other long range weaponry stating that they would start bombing places they have avoided so far more himars to ukraine in new military aid package while the us had only initially sent 4 himars to ukraine kyiv will be receiving more of these systems in the near future it was announced by the us government last thursday that it will be giving ukraine an additional 450 million in military support to fend off the russian invaders from advancing further in the east this new package is the 13th presidential drawdown of the department of defense stocks since august 2021 it notably includes 4 more additional himars with 36 000 rounds of 105 ammunition 18 tactical vehicles for towing purposes 2 000 machine guns and 1 200 grenade launchers as per the department of defense s statement furthermore 18 coastal and riverine patrol boats and some spare parts will also be sent to ukraine with this new military support package the united states leads the military support effort by a huge margin contributing over 6 1 billion to ukraine since the war started last february 24th if we include all security related donations of the us to ukraine since 2014 this number would go up to 8 7 billion not including economic and humanitarian financial backing ukraine what everyone has been awaiting for so long

president zelenskyy when they spoke last week the united states will continue to bolster ukraine s defenses and support its sovereignty its territorial integrity national security council coordinator for strategic communications john kirby stated along with the himars the united kingdom has also pledged to donate an unspecified number of its m270 multiple launch rocket systems mlrs to ukraine it seems like the us and the uk have been talking behind closed doors to help out ukraine as the us was also considering giving the m270 mlrs to ukraine prior to the first delivery the us also had to sign off on the m270 mlrs to be transferred to ukraine as the system is us made and thus needs approval from the us whitehouse has announced 4 additional himars for ukraine good news while waiting for them uaarmy did not sit idly by the otr 21 tochka successfully carried out strikes on the ruscist s ammunition warehouses thanks to potus glory to ukraine pic twitter com qzvgve3qbs defence of ukraine defenceu june 23 2022 the two systems are notably very similar as the himars is the wheeled version of the m270 with the himars now in ukrainian hands they can now a have a formidable answer to russian shelling that has been pummelling them down for weeks more so it also gives the russians a taste of good old american firepower as they have experienced with the us donated m777 howitzers more aid is to come ukraine s way ahead of nato s 2022 summit to be held in madrid spain to discuss new security realities in europe expect that western donations for ukraine will also be the subject

selinexor is an oral small molecule xpo1 inhibitor tislelizumab is an anti pd 1 checkpoint inhibitor shanghai and hong kong june 27 2022 prnewswire antengene corporation limited antengene sehk 6996 hk a leading innovative commercial stage global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering developing and commercializing first in class and or best in class therapeutics in hematology and oncology today announced that it has entered into a clinical trial collaboration with beigene to evaluate the safety pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of selinexor in combination with beigene s anti pd 1 checkpoint inhibitor tislelizumab this multi center open label phase i ii trial will evaluate the investigational combination as a potential treatment option for patients with t and nk cell lymphoma we are delighted to partner with beigene a company that strives for innovation and excellence and is committed to developing best in class or first in class anti cancer therapies for patients across the globe these qualities are very similar to those of our vision at antengene said dr jay mei antengene s founder chairman and ceo we look forward to advancing the combination of selinexor and tislelizumab to clinical development with good data we will be able to bring this treatment regimen to patients with t and nk cell lymphoma diseases that are endemic in asia but underserved by current therapies at antengene we believe that the combinational use of immuno oncology drugs and selective inhibitor of nuclear export sine compounds possesses huge potential as novel treatment regimens for cancer patients said dr kevin lynch antengene s chief medical officer the mechanism of action of selinexor in inhibiting the nuclear export protein xpo1 facilitates the intranuclear accumulation of tumor suppressors making it a good partner in multiple combination treatment regimens preclinical research we conducted demonstrated that selinexor combined with a checkpoint inhibitor increased anti tumor activity in multiple tumor models in addition deep and durable responses were also seen in multiple case reports of patients with t and nk cell lymphoma treated with selinexor in combination with an anti pd 1 checkpoint inhibitor we hope to confirm that selinexor can synergize with tislelizumab to deliver an effective treatment regimen and help address the huge unmet medical needs in t and nk cell lymphoma in the asia pacific regions and around the world continued dr lynch tislelizumab is a pd 1 inhibitor designed to help aid the body s immune cells to detect and fight tumors tislelizumab a humanized monoclonal antibody is specifically designed to minimize binding to fcr on macrophages in pre clinical studies binding to fcr on macrophages has been shown to compromise the anti tumor activity of pd 1 antibodies through activation of antibody dependent macrophage mediated killing of t effector cells about t and nk cell lymphoma t and nk cell lymphoma is a set of heterogeneous diseases accounting for 25 30 of non hodgkin lymphoma nhl cases in china and only about 10 in usa and europe there has been little improvement in the past decade when compared to b cell non hodgkin lymphoma b nhl as 5 year overall survival rate was only 30 in most common subtypes the unmet medical needs remain as agents with new mechanism of action to be explored and possibility to improve the treatment paradigm for the disease about the sine compounds selective inhibitor of nuclear export sine compounds are inhibitors of the major nuclear export protein exportin 1 xpo1 currently there are three oral sine compounds atg 010 selinexor atg 016 eltanexor and atg 527 verdinexor under clinical development antengene has obtained exclusive development and commercialisation rights from karyopharm therapeutics inc nasdaq kpti to these three compounds in certain apac markets about xpovio selinexor xpovio is the world s first approved orally available selective inhibitor of the nuclear export protein xpo1 it offers a novel mechanism of action synergistic effects in combination regimens fast onset of action and durable responses by blocking the nuclear export protein xpo1 xpovio can promote the intranuclear accumulation and activation of tumor suppressor proteins and growth regulating proteins and down regulate the levels of multiple oncogenic proteins xpovio delivers its antitumor effects through three mechanistic pathways 1 exerting antitumor effects by inducing the intranuclear accumulation of tumor suppressor proteins 2 reducing the level of oncogenic proteins in the cytoplasm by inducing the intranuclear accumulation of oncogenic mrnas and 3 restoring hormone sensitivity by activating the glucocorticoid receptors gr pathway to utilize its unique mechanism of actions xpovio is being evaluated for use in multiple combination regimens in a range of indications at present antengene is conducting 10 clinical studies of xpovio in mainland china for the treatment of relapsed refractory hematologic malignancies and solid tumors 3 of these studies are being jointly conducted by

the real estate and construction sector uses up 43 per cent of global energy production the energy consumed by the industries to produce myriads of building materials causes massive emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere thus the sector becomes the biggest contributor to global warming since the sector is conducive to invariably increasing housing needs the world requires a new equation to battle the worst climate change partially caused by the sector readdressing esg environmental social and governance values in the industry could pour oil on troubled waters the esg model in real estate warrants sustainable environment protection the sociability of real assets safety of the construction crew and the capacity of real estate companies to ensure post development property management i would encourage investors to realize esg elements while making financial decisions it may in the long run enforce the property tycoons to consider fair play while architecting developing and managing housing and business districts government should mandate investors to realise esg elements while architecting developing and managing housing and business districts according to the european cfo survey 2020 a bit more than half of the real estate companies in europe consider esg measures they are more responsible business doers and the rest of the world could follow their footprints in this regard to what extent are the real estate conglomerates socially responsible according to the us department of labour around 900 workers die on construction sites in the united states every year it equals 20pc of total workplace fatalities upwards of 175 000 occupational injuries are in addition to this just imagine the condition of safety at construction scaffolds in developing and underdeveloped countries where obsolete technology unskilled labour and least safety measures hamper the way forward as per pakistan social sciences review stfs slips trips and falls are the key contributors to the total number of fatalities in the construction industry about 6pc of pakistan s total workforce in construction suffers from workplace injuries and fatalities because of governance failure this is why esg values have become inevitable in the construction segment specifically the ban on conventional brick kilns in pakistan in the last few years is an appreciable step brick kilns in developing and underdeveloped countries are playing havoc with the environment emitting millions of tons of carbon dioxide annually around 19 500 brick kilns across pakistan emit monoxides and dioxides of carbon sulphur and nitrogen which are detrimental to both man s health and the environment bio kilns are being installed to mitigate the release of poisonous gases pakistan s provincial governments invariably require the brick entrepreneurs to shift to zigzag technology to make the kilns environment friendly enabling the industry to consume less energy and squeezing the demand for superfluous building materials could lessen the emission of greenhouse gases the replacement and recycling of contemporary building materials are perhaps much needed milestones to be achieved the world s construction glass manufacturing industry emits 88 5 million tons of poisonous gases every year research is being done and technological advancements are about to invent carbon free glass manufacturing methods despite this fact glass is considered to be a micro contributor to climate damage increased use of glass in construction could therefore be encouraged being the most frequently used building material concrete is an unbridled enemy to the human environment its production takes poisonous oxides and dioxides into the air apart from constituting 8pc of global emission of carbon dioxide concrete induces scarcity of fresh water at the local level and imparts soil erosion it heats up quickly and lets the heat passage into the interiors thus requiring more energy to settle indoor temperature nature always pays off its debt the damage the world does to the climate while constructing superstructures comes back in the form of catastrophic tsunamis and erases the same high rise buildings from the face of the planet the world needs to install a thousand trees to combat one skyscraper s net contribution to global warming it is disturbingly true installing more trees under social forestry initiatives and inventing newer building materials could contain the environment for the generations to come the incorporation of esg standards in the real estate sector has got momentum in recent years the essential operational strategy finds its roots in the consideration of esg factors which bolster the sustainability of real estate investments worldwide efforts are being poured to decarbonise real estate assets the securities exchange commission of pakistan has already issued corporate social responsibility instructions to be practised by the listed companies on the other hand conventional building materials production units are hardly registered on the pakistan stock exchange the implementation of these standards is therefore a fairytale development authorities at the governmental level could chalk out clear bylaws for the construction segment these regulations could be considered while sanctioning the launch of new housing societies and commercial projects there could be a stipulated threshold of deforestation for domestic and commercial use minimum service delivery standards could be met by the realty developers general labour rights could be protected at the workplace affordable housing could be made available for all keeping the social factors aside could harm the real estate sector and its stakeholders the author is a

it held up well and traded just in the green wealth within founder and chief analyst dale gillham said as he assessed the current state of the market on monday last week the all ordinaries index fell to a low of 6 581 points and while this is around where i stated the market would find support it is too early to tell whether the market has stopped falling if it does fall further i am confident it will find strong support around 6 200 points and is unlikely to fall further to confirm that the low of 6 581 points on monday is the end of the current down move we need to see a sustained upward movement in the all ordinaries index over at least the next three weeks until this occurs the safest option for investors is to err on the side of caution and to assume that further falls may unfold and to plan accordingly right now i recommend investors look at the top 50 stocks as many are setting themselves up nicely for the impending rise that is likely to unfold in the second half of this year us markets investors seem to be factoring in a lighter touch from the federal reserve in its battle against inflation common sentiment is that a recession can be avoided aspiriant s managing director for investment strategy and research dave grecsek told marketwatch that the thinking suggests we really can avoid a recession with the fed potentially needing to become less aggressive in hiking rates to bring down inflation as the economy slows with commodity prices falling there could be a lower peak in the fed s interest rate target of course this is all speculation however according to the cme s fedwatch tool investors expect the fed funds rate to peak at between 3 25 and 3 50 in december down from 3 50 to 3 75 just one week ago we ve seen a two week drop in commodity prices and now we are seeing fed funds futures pricing in rate cuts out in 2023 the thing holding back the market was endless rate hikes if we ve found the terminal rate then stocks can make headway here baird market strategist mike antonelli said inflation expectations lowered according to university of michigan s final reading on consumer sentiment inflation five to 10 years out had been revised lower to 3 1 down from 3 3 hopes that inflation is peaking and that the economy is still on solid footing has some investors confidently buying up heavily discounted stocks said oanda s senior market analyst for the americas edward moya st louis federal reserve president james bullard said recession talk was premature based on the central bank s position on jacking up interest rates faster than usual he said a rapid rise in interest rates was the best way to curb inflation and void a recession san francisco fed president mary daly has also signalled support for another big rate increase in july to slow inflation the market is being driven by this push and pull between inflation risk recession risk and the fed s ability to navigate a path forward in terms of rate policy said plante moran financial advisors chief investment officer jim baird investors were trying to work out how quickly and how far the fed will need to go or will be able to go in terms of further tightening amid

a decade after a former citigroup financial advisor said the firm first cut off her access to its stock allocation system she received vindication in the form of a finra arbitration award erin ann daly won an award of more than 1 4 million from citigroup global markets and other citi entities for compensatory damages plus interest and attorney fees along with an expungement of her u5 termination disclosure after a new york panel ruled on june 24 that the firm had violated the section of the civil rights act prohibiting discrimination in employment the award also held citi liable for breaching its own code of conduct and new york state laws against harassment and a hostile work environment as well as a law forbidding retaliation the termination explanation shall be deleted in its entirety and shall be replaced with the following language in a decision on ms daly s gender discrimination and defamation claims an arbitration panel has found that she was illegally discharged the award stated the panel recommends expungement based on the defamatory nature of the information the striking language taking citi to task for its treatment of daly came on the same day as the supreme court s decision to overturn roe v wade the 1973 case that affirmed women s rights to abortions citi led other megabanks as the first to pledge to pay travel costs for any employee needing to cross state lines for reproductive health care its ceo jane fraser received american banker s most powerful woman in banking award last year after becoming the first woman named chief of a major u s bank however the arbitration award offered a reminder of the industry s legacy as a boys club as daly s lawsuit put it to this day fewer than a quarter of planners are women the firm still denies daly s allegations though it may seek to vacate the decision in court where she ll have to seek confirmation of the award and the company will have a small chance of getting a reversal of the decision as we have maintained for the last six years we do not believe ms daly s claims have any merit spokeswoman danielle romero apsilos said in a statement we disagree with this decision and will explore our options daly s attorney didn t immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision she hasn t been registered with any firm since 2014 and first filed a federal lawsuit in 2016 only to have it ordered into finra arbitration two years later she had alleged in her lawsuit that the promising start to her career which included accomplishments like the ceo award for excellence in 2012 ran into the proverbial glass ceiling in june 2012 she found that her entire identification for citi private bank s stock allocation system had been deleted according to the lawsuit citi deliberately prevented daly from getting the functionality back because she is female the lawsuit said when she reported the conduct she learned that she could only keep her job by apologizing according to the lawsuit she then became a glorified secretary the lawsuit stated she alleged that the firm fired her after she reported a supervisor who constantly harassed her for protected inside information so that he could pass the information along to his favored clients the suit shows this exclusion from her business functionality resulted in loss of opportunity and is a result of citi s boys club policies and practices which underlie a culture of gender discrimination according to the lawsuit the gender disparity is most clearly evidenced by the deliberate exclusion of females on the desk from allocating stock or even being able to view the full book which is the itemized and summarized description of the involved parties their respective interest and finally allocation on each deal this systematic exclusion of females from any real functionality resulted and continues to result in diminished client contact opportunity for advancement and pigeonholing into service administrative and secretarial roles for females three years after a federal judge upheld citi s motion to compel arbitration and dismiss her whistleblower claim in 2018 daly filed the arbitration claim against the firm the original april 2021 claim included allegations of retaliation under the civil rights act violations of dodd frank s whistleblower protection provisions and blacklisting or interference with a prospective employment relationship the three member panel dismissed those claims this past april in a partial ruling in favor of citi s motion to toss the whole case in the claim she sought reimbursement for lost earnings double back pay damages for mental anguish loss of dignity humiliation and injury to livelihood among other requests citi denied the allegations and asked the panel to order daly to pay the reasonable costs and disbursements incurred in defending this proceeding in an evidentiary hearing last month it imposed a sanction of 200 against daly after the arbitrators ruled that she had tried to introduce additional documents resulting in an unnecessary executive session in nearly every other possible way they unanimously ruled for daly the award comes with 3 25 interest and due to the new york state human rights law 42 000 in attorney fees in addition the panel approved the removal of the december 2014 termination explanation filed on daly s form u5 daly can now get the statements removed from her permanent record after forwarding a copy of the award to finra s credentialing registration education and disclosure department for review the 2016 lawsuit cited the language that she says the firm used to explain her dismissal at the time the firm alleged there were concerns that included tardiness and insubordination in connection with working hours concerns about a separate incident in which the representative forwarded confidential information about a planned offering to a co worker without providing notice and receiving appropriate approvals within the firm even though such notice and pre approval were required by firm policy and concerns about representative s responses to certain firm questions the firm s conduct toward her essentially ended daly s career according to the lawsuit citi s deliberate discriminatory acts towards erin because she is a woman directly resulted in diminished client contact and interaction marginalization and reduced her commercial opportunities down to zero the lawsuit stated citi s deliberate exclusion of erin from her normal business function and her exclusion from meetings with upper management discredited her to her peers and her clients and ultimately destroyed her professional career

the leaders of britain france germany and the united states will hold four way talks tuesday on iran s nuclear programme the french presidency said with tehran s oil exports as one of the issues to be raised the talks will come on the sidelines of the g7 gathering of the world s top industrialised powers which will also discuss iran s nuclear ambitions at a dinner during a session on foreign policies among topics to be broached are the question of oil and a willingness to stop proliferation said a senior french official without giving further details iran will be raised in the quad we have a meeting in this format on tuesday morning said the official iran has among the world s biggest oil reserves but its ability to sell crude has been hobbled by crippling sanctions imposed over its nuclear programme the united states has sought to prevent any nation from buying iranian oil since 2018 after then president donald trump walked away from a negotiated agreement in which tehran drastically scaled back its nuclear programme in return for promises of sanctions relief but the administration of incumbent us president joe biden has sought to return to the nuclear agreement saying it would be the best path with the islamic republic with crude prices soaring over russia s invasion of ukraine market analysts have meanwhile suggested that iranian oil could replace some of the shunned russian stocks talks to revive the iran nuclear deal will resume within days after being stalled for months the eu s top diplomat josep borrell said saturday during a surprise visit to tehran the negotiations began in vienna in april last year but hit a snag in march amid differences between tehran and washington notably over a demand by iran that its islamic revolutionary guard corps be removed from a us terror list
russia has just defaulted on its foreign debt for the first time since the 1917 bolshevik revolution according to bloomberg further alienating the country from the global financial system following sanctions imposed over its war in ukraine the country missed a sunday night deadline local time to meet a 30 day grace period on interest payments originally due may 27 last month the us treasury department ended russia s ability to pay its billions in debt back to international investors through american banks russia has defaulted on its overseas debt for the first time in more than a century after missing a sunday deadline ap mikhail metzel in response the russian finance ministry said it would pay dollar denominated debts in rubles and offer the opportunity for subsequent conversion into the original currency russia calls any default artificial because it has the money to pay its debts but says sanctions have frozen its foreign currency reserves held abroad there is money and there is also the readiness to pay russian finance minister anton siluanov said last month this situation artificially created by an unfriendly country will not have any effect on russians quality of life tim ash senior emerging market sovereign analyst at bluebay asset management tweeted that the default is clearly not beyond russia s control and that sanctions are preventing it from paying its debts because it invaded ukraine here are key things to know about a russian default how much does russia owe about 57 6 billion in foreign bonds about half of that to foreigners before the start of the war russia had around 922 billion in foreign currency and gold reserves much of which was held overseas and is now frozen before today russia had not defaulted on its international debts since the

will now shift to what investors do next ap russia defaulted on its domestic debts in the late 1990s but was able to recover from that default with the help of international aid investors have expected russia to default for months insurance contracts that cover russian debt have priced a 80 per cent likelihood of default for weeks and rating agencies like standard poor s and moody s have placed the country s debt deep into junk territory how do you know if a country is in default ratings agencies can lower the rating to default or a court can decide the issue bondholders who have credit default swaps contracts that act like insurance policies against default can ask a committee of financial firm representatives to decide whether a failure to pay debt should trigger a payout which still isn t a formal declaration of default russia calls any default artificial because it has the money to pay its debts but says sanctions have frozen its foreign currency reserves held abroad ap the credit default determination committee an industry group of banks and investment funds ruled on june 7 that russia had failed to pay required additional interest after making a payment on a bond after the april 4 due date but the committee put off taking further action due to uncertainty over how sanctions might affect any settlement what can investors do the formal way to declare default is if 25 per cent or more of bondholders say they didn t get their money once that happens provisions say all russia s other foreign bonds are also in default and bondholders could then seek a court judgment to enforce payment in normal circumstances investors and the defaulting government typically negotiate a settlement in which bondholders are given new bonds that are worth less but that at least give them some partial compensation but sanctions bar dealings with russia s finance ministry and no one knows when the war will end or how much defaulted bonds could wind up being worth in this case declaring default and suing might not be the wisest choice auslander said it s not possible to negotiate with russia and there are so many unknowns so creditors may decide to hang tight for now the last time russia fell into default was more than a century ago ap read more russia strikes as western leaders meet in europe investors who wanted out of russian debt have probably already headed for the exits leaving those who may have bought bonds at knocked down prices in hopes of profiting from a settlement in the long run and they might want to keep a low profile for a while to avoid being associated with the war once a country defaults it can be cut off from bond market borrowing until the default is sorted out and investors regain confidence in the government s ability and willingness to pay but russia has already been cut off from western capital markets so any return to borrowing is a long way off anyway the kremlin can still borrow rubles at home where it mostly relies on russian banks to buy its bonds what would be the impact of russia s default western sanctions over the war have sent foreign companies fleeing from russia and interrupted the country s trade and financial ties with the rest of the world default would be one more symptom of that isolation and disruption investment analysts are cautiously reckoning that a russia default would not have the kind of impact on global financial markets and institutions that came from an earlier default in 1998 back then russia s default on domestic ruble bonds led the us government to step in and get banks

erik norland cme group at a glance the u s equity market has been declining on and off all year inflation has risen to above 8 in both europe and the u s over the past quarter century central banks such as the u s federal reserve and the european central bank have often stepped in and eased monetary policy when equity markets sold off they did it in 1998 2001 2008 and again in 2020 but the central banks were able to lower rates when equities sold off for one reason and one reason only inflation was low and stable at around 2 in the united states and even lower in europe now that inflation has risen to above 8 in both europe and the u s lowering rates when the equity market gets in trouble is no longer an obvious solution in fact doing so could cause a rise in inflation expectations which could make inflation more difficult to contain this is problematic because the equity market in the u s has been declining on and off all year higher inflation has pulled long term government bond yields higher and higher bond yields have begun to attract capital away from the equity market pushing stocks lower there are many things that remain unclear for example will inflation continue to rise or has it already peaked are bond yields which are still only around 3 high enough given the level of inflation one thing is clear so long as inflation remains high equity investors probably shouldn t count on central banks to ease policy even if equities continue to sell off read more articles like this at openmarkets

representative forwarded confidential information about a planned offering to a co worker without providing notice and receiving appropriate approvals within the firm even though such notice and pre approval were required by firm policy and concerns about representative s responses to certain firm questions the firm s conduct toward her essentially ended daly s career according to the lawsuit citi s deliberate discriminatory acts towards erin because she is a woman directly resulted in diminished client contact and interaction marginalization and reduced her commercial opportunities down to zero the lawsuit stated citi s deliberate exclusion of erin from her normal business function and her exclusion from meetings with upper management discredited her to her peers and her clients and ultimately destroyed her professional career

volatility is here to stay shibani sircar kurian for consumer facing companies it will be a mixed thing because volumes are under pressure so on one side volumes are under pressure and because of that many of the fmcg companies on the last round raw material price hikes actually did not increase their final product prices so much this moderation is welcome but whether it will add to their margins is tough to say only results will show says founder the market got sold out significantly and a bounce back was imminent now the texture of the bounce back and the kind of stocks participating is changing and that is what investors should keep into mind sectors like capital goods autos especially four wheelers will be the preferred sectors for me and i believe that these sectors will continue to outperform and investors should keep on allocating here because for many capital goods companies in the last 18 months especially the ones which bid at fixed price it was quite devastating because of the way commodity prices steel copper aluminium everything went up now many of these companies have good order books and the same thing works on the flip side this year the earnings growth could be very strong i think that is where people should start focusing for consumer facing companies it will be a mixed thing because volumes are under pressure so on one side volumes are under pressure and because of that many of the fmcg companies on the last round raw material price hikes actually did not increase their final product prices so much this moderation is obviously a welcome thing but whether it will add to their margins or benefit them in the near term is tough to say only results will show but some of the companies showed outperformance in terms of operating margin performance even when the input price pressures were severe for example britannia industries could actually see better performance coming through whereas i am not sure about a lot of the other fmcg companies because the market demand has come under very severe pressure and we need to watch the space as many of these companies still trade at very high valuations yes because the company will actually do very well over the next two years at least this year many of the auto companies starting the second quarter onwards will see significant tailwinds because of input price pressures wearing off and on top of that if they have a good product pipeline and volumes are good then that company should do very well the good part for m m is not only their new product cycle which includes thar scorpio xuv700 are doing well they are taking initiatives on the ev side also which was a big concern for legacy auto companies the tractor segment is outperforming the rest of the industry and gaining market share and that is one segment which could do well the spoiler there is if monsoons do not do well and farm incomes are not so great then some pressure will come on the tractor side and that is something we need to watch out for it was very strange the way bajaj auto did not take a decision last time because a board meeting should be called ideally when the decision on the management side has been taken more or less then it only depends on the quantum of buyback and the mood of the buyback the market did not like the fact that it was postponed in this board meeting they will probably announce the buyback for the second time they cannot have a scenario where they again say that we are not going to do it bajaj auto has done well in the export market because many of their export geographies are crude oil producing companies and those markets have been doing well for them domestic markets for two wheelers are still under pressure and that is the pull which is there as reopening happens the three wheeler demand could come back and that is a high margin product for them so on balance things are going well for them and bajaj auto did not fall as much as many of the auto companies it has been quite resilient as a stock i would think that it is a low volatility stock depending on the contours of the buyback it should do reasonably well i do not see a huge upside in two wheelers at this stage because domestically on ground demand situation is not very good commodities saw a hyped up move based on some super cycle assumptions which were never going to play out because there is no super cycle in commodities as there is no super cycle in economic growth so supply constraints led to huge rally and then it always leads to excessive stocking by companies etc because of the fact that people are not sure of prices in a month s time so many companies which used to keep one month s inventory started keeping two months inventory on the flip side the opposite happens destocking happens and then people wait to buy and that is the cycle which will play out economic growth prospects globally are not so great higher interest rates will moderate growth in many western economies the chinese economy is in the dumps so unless you are a trader there is not much ahead for an investor trading is possible because if a commodity stock halves from the top a 10 15 20 up move can happen and that is a play people can go for it is not a long trade also longer term the commodity super cycle was just a myth and i do not think it is going to play out many of the defence stocks will remain buy on dips because the visibility of growth is significant and also the fact that the order flows over the next few years will only keep on accelerating they would not decelerate because the recent russia ukraine war etc also has shown that we need to have reasonable domestic ability across the board otherwise we could get constrained if some issues come up these plays will remain strong and so on corrective moves many of these companies should be in the portfolio of investors what percentage they want to keep can differ but at least 10 across two three stocks is not a bad idea if the rebound lasts long then obviously all the beaten down midcaps small caps will start participating and i think it could become more widespread but i think the preferred bets have to be the users of commodities for now and i would think that where we could have relative avoid should be broadly commodities although bounce backs cannot be moved out and technology where i think slowdown in demand and margin contraction is coming technology company management just react to the market they have no idea beyond a couple of quarters on what is going to hit them and many times discretionary spending cuts are very sudden as demand drops off for example this is playing out in many of the textile companies also the retailers were doing so well in the usa there was a huge demand for outsourcing and suddenly many of them have started cutting estimates big time demand has come under pressure and we have seen a sell off there that is how the us economy operates sudden decisions are taken as profits come under pressure and cuts are made it spending in many areas tends to be discretionary some are strategic and that continues but discretionary spending gets cut and that is where pressure will be built i think anyone is very heavily overweight on technology even now people should keep on trimming positions and adding elsewhere and whenever the rally happens yes the key is that when they are continuously coming out with new offerings with faster delivery cycles etc and expanding to new cities what that does is that it puts more pressure on profitability so that is a challenge for most of these companies which have been formed and there was no pressure on profitability till they were unlisted the challenge is how do you transform yourselves into public limited companies where profits matter and that is the key thing i will watch out for i do not think the stock is cheap at rs 500 because the visibility of profit at least for two years is not so great and we need to see how they transform how they get profitability back on the plate and then we will evaluate it is not a company which will be completely avoided it should be under consideration but at lower prices
exclusive what made the world s bankers laugh at australia s reserve bank boss during a speech to the financial elite in switzerland reserve bank of australia governor philip lowe laughed at during swiss forum he was explaining how australia only releases inflation data every three months other advanced economies like us uk eu canada have monthly inflation data australian bureau of statistics said monthly inflation data used to be too costly rba last year vowed to keep cash rate on hold until 2024 despite inflation data australia s chief central banker was laughed at by other global bankers in switzerland when he revealed how he has to wait three months for inflation data reserve bank governor philip lowe expressed his dissatisfaction with australia s official consumer price index data collection during a conference in zurich sponsored by swiss bank ubs the other thing that s different and this is a bad difference is our cpi is only available quarterly dr lowe said yes you laugh as well reserve bank of australia governor philip lowe expressed his dissatisfaction with official consumer price index data collection during the zurich conference sponsored by swiss bank ubs no we ve been working with the bureau of statistics to try and get a monthly cpi and maybe later this year they will have an experimental series but we only have one reading on inflation every three months the case against philip lowe and the rba the reserve bank governor last year repeatedly promised to keep the cash rate on hold at a record low of 0 1 per cent until 2024 at the earliest philip lowe has now complained about inflation only being released quarterly yet on july 28 last year the australian bureau of statistics revealed annual inflation in the june quarter of 2021 had climbed by 3 8 per cent this was well above rba s 2 to 3 per cent target and more than triple the 1 1 per cent annual pace during march quarter of 2021 yet on august 3 2021 dr lowe and the reserve bank released a statement saying the cash rate would not increase until 2024 despite the evidence of rapidly rising inflation the board will not increase the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 per cent target range it said the central scenario for the economy is that this condition will not be met before 2024 advertisement australia and new zealand still only release inflation data on a quarterly basis but the u s united kingdom european union and canada release their consumer price index figures every month australia s next inflation figures covering the june quarter won t be released until july 27 potentially leaving the country s top financial officials on the back foot when it comes to addressing spiking costs the australian bureau of statistics data release would be occurring three weeks after the rba s next board meeting on july 5 dr lowe hinted another 0 5 percentage point increase was likely next month on the back of june s half a percentage point increase the steepest in 22 years if you read the minutes of our previous meeting we discussed 25 basis points or 50 he said i don t want to forecast the next meeting but i suspect it will be the same discussion again at our next meeting 25 or 50 again australia s march quarter inflation data was released on april 27 with the figures showing a 5 1 per cent surge the fastest since 2001 less than a week later the rba increased interest rates for the first time since november 2010 with the 0 25 percentage point rise in may ending the era of the record low 0 1 per cent cash rate the long gaps between inflation data also aggravates financial market speculation with a 3 65 per cent cash rate expected by march 2023 based on nine rate rises from the existing 0 85 per cent level an australian bureau of statistics spokeswoman said monthly inflation data until recently was too costly to produce australia and new zealand still only release inflation data on a quarterly basis but the u s united kingdom european union and canada release their consumer price index figures every month pictured is sydney woolworths shopper monique the abs recognises there is increasing interest in understanding cost of living pressures and the implications for monetary and fiscal policy she told daily mail australia until recently the costs to produce a monthly cpi have been prohibitive the abs in march announced it was exploring a monthly inflation series covering significant everyday items to complement the quarterly series dating back to 1949 the spokeswoman said automated and scanner data could provide high frequency data at a lower cost dr lowe this month told outgoing abc 7 30 host leigh sales australia s inflation rate was likely to hit seven per cent by the end of 2022 reaching a level last seen in 1990 american inflation in may hit 8 6 per cent the highest rate since 1981 canada s equivalent consumer price index rose to 7 7 per cent last month the highest since 1983 the uk s 9 1 per cent inflation pace in may was the highest since 1982 while the eurozone inflation hit 8 1 per cent last month the long gaps between inflation data also aggravates financial market speculation the abs previously collected unemployment data every three months but introduced a monthly series in 1978 dr lowe who is paid 1 076million a year last year repeatedly promised to keep the cash rate on hold at a record low of 0 1 per cent until 2024 at the earliest even though inflation in mid 2021 rose above the rba s 2 to 3 per cent target the rba in august 2021 said it would not raise the cash rate until 2024 even though the abs on july 28 last year revealed annual inflation in the june quarter of 2021 had risen to 3 8 per cent up sharply from 1 1 per cent in the march quarter of 2021 the board will not increase the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 per cent target range dr lowe said in that monthly statement the central scenario for the economy is that this condition will not be met before 2024 dr lowe earlier this month in that interview with sales rejected the suggestion he had made a vow to keep the cash rate on hold until 2024 so sometimes my comments get interpreted as me having made a promise or a very strong statement that interest rates would stay where they were to 2024 he said in our own communication in our own way of thinking that was very much a conditional statement if the economy evolved as we had expected we d keep rates where they were until 24 advertisement treasurer jim chalmers has announced a review into the reserve bank
us fed chair admits recession a possibility after rate hikes in this file photo us federal reserve chairman jerome powell gives a press briefing after the surprise announcement the fed will cut interest rates on march 3 2020 in washington dc federal reserve chair jerome powell on february 23 2021 pledged that the us central bank will keep benchmark lending rates low until the economy is at full employment and inflation has risen consistently washington united states the us economy remains strong but a series of aggressive rate hikes meant to cool soaring inflation could eventually trigger a recession federal reserve chair jerome powell cautioned wednesday powell whose testimony before senators was closely watched by investors and analysts also said the world s largest economy faces an uncertain global environment and could see further inflation surprises the fed chair again stressed that policymakers understand the hardships caused by rising prices and are committed to bringing down inflation which has reached a 40 year high last week the us central bank announced the sharpest interest rate increase in nearly 30 years and promised additional similar moves to combat the price surge with gas and food costs skyrocketing and millions of americans struggling to get by but when peppered with questions about the prospect of a recession powell acknowledged the risk it s not our intended outcome at all but it s certainly a possibility he told the senate banking committee and frankly the events of the last few months around the world have made it more difficult for us to achieve what we want which is 2 inflation and still a strong labor market in his opening remarks powell insisted the us economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year and further surprises could be in store the fed chief said in his semi annual appearance before congress policymakers will need to be nimble given that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways he said the fed is facing intense criticism that it was too slow to react to the changing economy which benefited from a flood of federal government stimulus last week s super sized 0 75 percentage point increase in the benchmark lending rate was the third since march taking the policy rate up a total of 1 5 points powell at the time said a similar increase was likely in july the ideal scenario would be for those moves to cool the economy enough to douse inflation pressures without choking off growth the hoped for soft landing i think it s going to be very challenging powell said insisting there are pathways to avoid recession and that he does not view the risk of a downturn as particularly elevated financial markets seemed cheered by his relatively upbeat comments which echo those of other fed officials in recent days who have pushed back against rising pessimism but wall street stocks lost steam late in the trading session and the dow finished the day down 0 2 essential to curb inflation in addition to easing the financial strain on less wealthy american families the fed chief said tamping down inflation was essential to maintain a healthy labor market the us economy recovered quickly from the covid 19 pandemic helped by robust consumer spending and has continued to create jobs at a strong pace pushing unemployment down to near a 50 year low but the buoyant demand for homes cars and other goods clashed with transportation and supply chain snarls in parts of the world where covid 19 has remained a challenge that fueled inflation which got dramatically worse after russia invaded ukraine in late february and western nations imposed stiff sanctions on moscow sending food and fuel prices up at a blistering rate but powell noted that inflation is a global issue not unique to the united states many major central banks have joined the fed in beginning to tighten monetary policy with the notable exception of the bank of japan powell said many factors driving inflation are beyond the fed s control but he pointed to signs that rising rates are having an impact as business investment slows and activity in the housing sector looks to be softening in part reflecting higher mortgage rates average home loan rates jumped to 5 23 in may for a 30 year fixed rate mortgage from 4 98 in april according to freddie mac while the median price for homes topped 400 000 for the first time the tightening in financial conditions that we have seen in recent months should continue to temper growth and help bring demand into better balance with supply powell said
