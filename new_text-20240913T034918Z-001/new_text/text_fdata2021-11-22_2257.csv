dear earthtalk what are conservation dogs jon gretcham portland or simply put conservation dogs are canines specially trained in sniffing out evidence of specific wildlife species that scientists are seeking to learn more about for one reason or another most commonly these dogs are used to help biologists understand where and how threatened or endangered wildlife species are hanging on or if they are still around at all at the forefront of this burgeoning field is rogue detection teams rdt a washington state based non profit that sends their specially trained dogs around north america and beyond to help scientific researchers government agencies and non profit groups gather field evidence in order to further their conservation work it s no wonder that conservationists have started using detection dogs a standard practice in the military and law enforcement since the 1940s when u s troops first employed canines to detect german land mines in north africa by pairing human handlers well versed in ecology and biology the bounders with detection dogs trained on a specific scent conservationists can monitor the density distribution and overall health of certain species of concern to wit rogue s dogs have worked all over the world helping conservation groups bolster their cases with hard data collected in the field the majority of the rogue s work so far has been in the american west but teams are scattered as far afield as brazil europe africa southeast asia and the middle east in search of everything from sea turtles to grasshoppers to pygmy rabbits big cats red foxes and bumblebees what makes for a perfect conservation dog the best detection dogs wouldn t necessarily make a great pet as they tend to be obsessed with reward accumulation our dogs are typically considered unadoptable due to their high energy and obsessive desire to play fetch says rogue s jennifer hartman this obsessive energy is quite perfect for us because we pair this with detecting an odor and reward our dogs with their ball for locating the odor rogue s dogs can cover up to 15 miles a day in survey work and still have energy left over for more playtime after the search and it doesn t take a specific breed or size dog it s all about the dog s so called high ball drive we have quite a few labrador mixes as well as heeler mixes because these seem to be high drive dogs that end up in shelters but we also have a chihuahua mix and what might be a papillon mix in our program reports hartman we love all dogs though and don t discriminate as long as they like to play fetch currently rogue runs 19 dogs out of its washington state headquarters the organization founded in 2019 by a group of conservation oriented dog handlers who had been doing this sort of work on their own for more than a decade also runs programs to train others dogs and their owners in these canine detection practices through its training work rogue hopes to develop the next generation of bounders to carry on the innovative work of the conservation dogs in helping other species hang on in this warming compromised world contacts rogue detection teams roguedogs org a nose for science conservation dogs may help in search for endangered franklin s bumblebee therevelator org conservation dogs bumblebee earthtalk is produced by roddy scheer doug moss for the 501 c 3 nonprofit earthtalk see more at emagazine com to donate visit earthtalk org send questions to
algoma wis â anthony bilwin is enthusiastic about making wine heâ s said thereâ s nothing not to love about the process from the fruit to the finished product but itâ s a business thatâ s been throwing him and other winemakers supply curveballs over the past year what you need to know wineries have faced a number of supply chain issues in the past year everything from increased transportation costs to a scarcity of wine bottles planning and flexibility are helping many operations stay ahead â at some point through the last year to year and half we have run into an issue on every level â said bilwin who is general manager of von stiehl winery in algoma â itâ s either adhesives for labels or labelers not being able to get paper stock which has delayed some of the labels bottles sitting in the la harbor that just arenâ t getting unloaded so they get to us maybe a month two months or six months later than when we need it â along with delays on some hard goods like bottles the winery is also facing higher costs and exponential increases in shipping for the west coast grapes it uses in conjunction with wisconsin varieties â and itâ s a driver shortage so thereâ s no guarantee when you can get a truck or if you can get a truck â bilwin said about the scope of the challenges â this year we were pretty fortunate but we scrapped by many of the trucks we got were very last minute â all of that means the wineries prices will be on the rise in january how much is still being determined beth levendusky of door peninsula winery said theyâ ve also had some availability issues with bottles â weâ ve run into issues where things we normally bottle in a certain style weâ ve had to switch â she said â we havenâ t run out of glass but we have had to change green to clear for a couple of items screw cap to cork for a couple of items just whatever is available â wineries have been quick on their feet â weâ re pretty flexible when it comes to that kind of thing so itâ s definitely been to our advantage levendusky said that flexibility and planning months sooner than usual are likely to be part of the business for some time to come bilwin said when it comes to bottlesâ global supply issues price increases could linger into the spring â or longer â if we canâ t put wine into bottles we canâ t sell it â he said â the longer it sits in tank then we run the risk of it going bad or spoiling wine is a living organism so if we canâ t get it into bottle and get it sealed then we have no way go getting it to the customer â
one in five u s adults will experience a mental illness in their lifetime according to the national alliance of mental health but standard treatments can be slow to work and cause side effects to find better solutions a virginia tech researcher has joined a renaissance of research on a long banned class of drugs that could combat several forms of mental illness and in mice have achieved long lasting results from just one dose using a process his lab developed in 2015 chang lu the fred w bull professor of chemical engineering in the college of engineering is helping his virginia commonwealth university collaborators study the epigenomic effects of psychedelics their findings give insight into how psychedelic substances like psilocybin mescaline lsd and similar drugs may relieve symptoms of addiction anxiety depression and post traumatic stress disorder the drugs appear to work faster and last longer than current medications all with fewer side effects the project hinged on lu s genomic analysis his process allows researchers to use very small samples of tissue down to hundreds to thousands of cells and draw meaningful conclusions from them older processes require much larger sample sizes so lu s approach enables the studies using just a small quantity of material from a specific region of a mouse brain and looking at the effects of psychedelics on brain tissues is especially important researchers can do human clinical trials with the substances taking blood and urine samples and observing behaviors lu said but the thing is the behavioral data will tell you the result but it doesn t tell you why it works in a certain way he said but looking at molecular changes in animal models such as the brains of mice allows scientists to peer into what lu calls the black box of neuroscience to understand the biological processes at work while the brains of mice are very different from human brains lu said there are enough similarities to make valid comparisons between the two vcu pharmacologist javier gonzález maeso has made a career of studying psychedelics which had been banned after recreational use of the drugs was popularized in the 1960s but in recent years regulators have begun allowing research on the drugs to proceed in work by other researchers primarily on psilocybin a substance found in more than 200 species of fungi gonzález maeso said psychedelics have shown promise in alleviating major depression and anxiety disorders they induce profound effects in perception he said but i was interested in how these drugs actually induce behavioral effects in mice to explore the genomic basis of those effects he teamed up with lu in the joint virginia tech vcu study gonzález maeso s team used 2 5 dimethoxy 4 iodoamphetamine or doi a drug similar to lsd administering it to mice that had been trained to fear certain triggers lu s lab then analyzed brain samples for changes in the epigenome and the gene expression they discovered that the epigenomic variations were generally more long lasting than the changes in gene expression thus more likely to link with the long term effects of a psychedelic after one dose of doi the mice that had reacted to fear triggers no longer responded to them with anxious behaviors their brains also showed effects even after the substance was no longer detectable in the tissues lu said the findings were published in the october issue of cell reports it s a hopeful development for those who suffer from mental illness and the people who love them in fact it wasn t just the science that drew lu to the project for him it s also personal my older brother has had schizophrenia for the last 30 years basically so i ve always been intrigued by mental health lu said and then once i found that our approach can be applied to look at processes like that that s why i decided to do research in the field of brain neuroscience gonzález maeso said research on psychedelics is still in its early stages and there s much work to be done before treatments derived from them could be widely available

the 2021 holiday season has put more pressure on already tight american supply chains leaving some sought after goods off the shelves but perhaps no shortage will have more consequences than the shortage of blood donations faced with this dire situation national and local organizations are stepping up to ensure this lifesaving gift is in stock the american red cross first issued a warning in september that there was an emergency shortage of blood and platelet donations in the country heading into november the red cross said the blood supply was the lowest it has been in more than a decade and at least 10 000 additional donations a week would be needed to keep pace with demand diane concannon a regional spokesperson for the american red cross in new jersey said the critical need for blood had not yet abated and there was an urgent need for volunteers to continue donating concannon said during typical years the red cross which provides around two fifths of the country s blood supply sees donations pick up around september around the time when schools and colleges begin to reopen from summer vacation and begin hosting community events in 2021 however many schools and other organizations have continued to limit large inside events due to the ongoing covid 19 pandemic leaving fewer opportunities for events like blood drives exacerbating an already critical situation the holiday season usually brings about a decline in donations as people become busier just as demand spikes due to holiday related accidents she emphasized however that there continued to be organizations willing to help everything is still different due to the pandemic concannon said but we keep asking and people do keep coming out hospitals churches the casinos and other community groups from across south jersey are stepping up to help atlanticare for example organized a staff blood drive with the aid of the red cross in august kelly vasquez the director of clinical services quality and transfusion service at atlanticare said a record setting number of nurses doctors and other hospital staff took time out of their workday to donate blood atlanticare also regularly lends space at its lifecenters for red cross blood drives while vasquez said atlanticare normally did events like the staff blood drive she it was important that atlanticare employees were able to contribute at such a critical time we re very proud of our staff in the way they really take care for the patients and they get personal by donating blood for them vasquez said vasquez said a steady supply of blood as well as different kinds of blood types was needed to ensure trauma patients had access to transfusion while she reiterated atlanticare was well stocked with enough blood to meet demand she said hospitals in more rural regions of the country might be left strained given the shortage she noted transfusions can be needed for a wide range of medical treatments including emergency trauma care chemotherapy open heart surgery and care for premature infants there are so many patients that really need this precious resource vasquez said and the pandemic s been a stress on an already burdened system to obtain blood it s one more thing that the pandemic has taken a toll on that you wouldn t necessarily think of other south jersey organizations are also lending aid to the red cross hammonton volunteer fire company no 1 is hosting a red cross run blood drive at its firehouse on nov 30 from 9 a m to 3 p m ronald mascola the director of the company said the fire house has already hosted three other red cross blood drives this year noting that several of the company s firefighters were among those who stepped forward to donate mascola said blood drives complemented firefighters commitment to keeping the community safe we re always out in the community with events and helping out he said mascola said that while some people might feel they are too busy during the holiday season to take time to give blood he and his colleagues were accustomed to responding to the emergency calls we never get to pick and choose when we contribute or help out because it s always dictated to us by the fire or the accident he said we re used to any kind of inconvenience leaders at the united methodist church at absecon also see volunteering as an extension of the service they provide the community lay leader barbara sabath said the church has helped organize multiple well attended blood drives with the red cross over the course of the pandemic the church also provides light food and drink to donors after their blood is drawn united methodist at absecon is holding its next blood drive monday from 1 to 6 p m sabath said the pandemic could be a calling to people to assume a responsibility to help those in need blood is always needed we know that but i think during the pandemic we all felt a need to in some way reach out and help she said i think the pandemic has made people s eyes open up to realize that there are a lot of things that we can do that we sometimes don t realize we can do the rev dave ledford iii also of united methodist at absecon said many people who attended the church s blood drive in july felt donating blood was almost a religious obligation for them having just delivered a homily on health and thankfulness during one of sunday s services ledford said giving would be a way of expressing thanks for one s health donors actually tell me that that they give thanks for their good health by ensuring the good health of others ledford said we can give blood and it ll come back for us but we can give life to somebody else to learn more about the blood donation process and find upcoming blood drives go to redcrossblood org

sunday is one of the worst days to suffer a heart attack and for various reasons scarcity of specialists and reduced onsite staffing most weekends increases the time taken to attend to patients what is more most people who suffer heart conditions on sundays normally have other underlaying conditions in kenya most people are unfamiliar with heart attack symptoms which coupled with thinning finances only makes matters worse indeed medical research found that patients admitted with acute coronary syndrome acs on weekdays had better recovery outcomes than those treated on weekends especially sundays irrespective of demographics comorbidities and hospital characteristics patients admitted on weekends showed significant differences in treatment length of stay in hospital mortality and major procedural complications the timelier revascularization study by three american medical researchers took 11 years and data analysis from over 10 million patients it was published in 2017 and among the recommendations was a sunday rest for cardiologists who work 50 to 60 hours on weekdays lead researcher prof vanessa k martin the chief surgical pathology fellow at the university of southern california los angeles says the weekend effect on heart patients was worsened as most cases had more comorbidities and other chronic ailments prof nasim murnateghi a cardiology researcher at the university of california irvine also says heart patients during weekdays were more likely to get a procedural intervention but on weekends they fair worse due to decreased onsite staffing which in turn increased door to procedure time which can have disastrous results but dr ruguru nyaga a cardiologist at kenyatta national hospital says cardiologists work throughout and when off duty have standby specialists to treat patients as it s impractical for some specialists not to work on sundays heart conditions in kenya also have other issues unrelated to availability of specialists in a 2017 article titled alarming projections of heart attacks in africa by 2030 dr mohamed jeilan a cardiologist and director cardiac programme at aga khan university hospital says the main challenge in kenya is that patients suffering from a heart attack do not receive timely treatment signs of a heart attack says dr jeilan include discomfort in the chest and painful sensation that may be felt in the arms jaws and neck sometimes it feels like gas in the upper stomach sweating and shortness of breath but he says many victims have poor knowledge of the seriousness of the symptoms and poor accessibility of acute medical services and financial barriers one can call an ambulance for first aid but taking aspirin reduces the clumping of the blood clot within 30 minutes which is not usually a sufficient remedy and a hospital visit is advised there two methods are used clot breaking drugs thrombolysis to unblock the artery but many centres in kenya do not stock this medicine and the second method is the gold standard involving specialists using special x ray to find the clot

sola oni writes that efforts towards investor education speak to the future that there is hope through the nigerian financial market the concept of audacity of hope emanated from the keynote address of barack obama at the 2004 democratic national congress dnc when he was an illinois senator and presidential aspirant the address which he delivered in just 20 minutes contains his family background and vision for america this address shot him to fame when he embarked on his presidential campaign in america some of the issues raised in the address formed the fulcrum of his presidential campaign the ideas became published as his memoir when he emerged the president of the united states of america this week investors worldwide are in the mood of world investors week wiw an annual event initiated by the international organization of securities commissions iosco a leading global policy forum for securities regulators to promote investor education and protection our own securities and exchange commission sec is on the governing council it has therefore directed all the securities markets in nigeria to celebrate investors this week and symbolically ring the bell or beat the gong a euphemism for either opening or closing the market the initiative of iosco is not new to securities exchanges as they all know the essence of investor education it is as old as the history of the nigerian stock exchange which has metamorphosed into ngx after demutualisation the same applies to investor protection however it is to the credit of the international body that world investor week wiw is a wake up call for the regulators of securities markets to defend market integrity as the spokesman for the exchange in 2005 a senior colleague and i were sponsored to the stockholm stock exchange in europe to participate at intercontinental investor education forum stockholm exchange was primarily chosen to enable us to have insight into how the exchange demutualised in 1993 got listed in 2000 and made history as the first securities exchange to demutualize and list itself globally without investors there is no securities market and without their trust the securities market is on the way to extinction at the core of market regulators duties is investor protection while the operators should be pre occupied with creation of securities innovative products and services to attract investors it is settled in financial management that money has no colour race or creed it gravitates to wherever it is needed securities market deals in intangible assets and therefore requires integrity of regulators and operators to build and sustain investor confidence the market exists to provide a platform that mobilizes funds from surplus economic units and channels same to deficit ones the market is guided by rules and regulations while the market operators as intermediators investor education has widened in scope because of the rapid development in information and communications technology ict it is ironic that worldwide while many investors have made fortunes through securities market others have watched helplessly as their live savings vanished when the market moved against them the ngx is still contending with the flame of the global meltdown of 2008 as many investors in nigeria have developed apathy to the market due to their massive loss some have died in the process while some stockbrokers have either died or remained at correctional centers to date prior to the meltdown drivers mechanics and other artisans became investment advisers in nigeria many banks coerced their staff to obtain loans to take position in the securities market swindlers who paraded themselves as stockbroker made fortune through over ambitious investors who wanted to become instant millionaires the market became predominantly short term and securities prices were overvalued it was a case of vicarious liability for the regulators operators and investors everyone is culpable the rest is history the substance and essence of this year s world investors week is beyond bell ringing or gong beating but a critical appraisal of how investor education and protection could be more effective unarguably the inclement operating environment in nigeria characterized by misalignment of fiscal and monetary policies sub optimal utilization of the capital market by all tiers of government forex scarcity exchange rate volatility unfriendly market policies and insecurity which has heightened the country risk have discouraged many portfolio investors from participating in our market but as we celebrate investors both the regulators and operators should intensify efforts on investor education and protection the emergence of millennials and generation z demands for more creative means of growing retail investors in nigeria market operators at various groups are also investing in investor education the exchange s renewed approach towards capacity building for retail investors is commendable in a population of over 200 million less than six million retail investors is not comforting the ngx investor protection fund ipf its multiple windows for disseminating information to investors sec s complaints management framework the commission s resolves to sanction market infraction with dispatch direct cash settlement of transactions policy on multiple subscription and efforts at addressing unclaimed dividends challenge amongst others are strategic means of connecting with investors to build trust in the market at the normative level an average investor is expected to understand risk and return tradeoff personal risk profile fundamentals of asset allocation portfolio construction and re balancing analysis of financial ratios in an annual report and market timing to deploy technical or fundamental analysis for buy and sell orders but at the positive level few investors have the technical knowledge as part of the key messages of this year s investor week investors should partner with securities dealers for investment advice the regulators and operators should harmonize relationship toward market development high transaction cost on our market is still a bitter pill for investors to swallow all efforts towards investor education speak to the future that there is audacity of hope for investors through the nigerian financial market despite the challenges the premier securities market ngx has been adjudged topmost in return on investment worldwide in recent past the resilient market beacons alpha returns on

at 9 45 am on may 18 1927 explosions ripped through the bath consolidated school outside lansing michigan at first witnesses and survivors didn t know the cause but within half an hour as rescuers worked within the school a man drove to the scene in a truck loaded with dynamite and detonated it killing himself and four bystanders in total the dynamiter andrew kehoe killed 44 people with the two explosions most of them children even in an age like ours well acquainted with school violence the bath school massacre can be shocking to learn about perhaps the most surprising part of the event however is the motive kehoe was a trustee and treasurer of the bath school district but he had recently lost his house in a foreclosure afterward the local sheriff heard kehoe mutter if it hadn t been for that 300 school tax i might have paid off this mortgage kehoe had clearly gone mad but the focus of his rage against the world and the school was centered on high property taxes in the 1920s and 1930s americans became obsessed with property taxes like their better known descendants in the 1970s these americans spawned a tax revolt that moved a seemingly mundane issue to the forefront of national consciousness though occasionally destructive the revolt found broad support among all segments of the population and eventually led to the reform of the tax system today the property tax rarely makes headlines but it is essential to american life about 3 percent of americans income goes to property taxes the levy is the foundation of local governments accounting for nearly three quarters of their taxes and underpinning their school systems without the property tax independent local governments could not exist economists generally argue that the property tax is a good tax since much of it falls on immovable land that can t be hidden created or destroyed and since the revenue it generates is tied to the services that local governments provide the stable nature of the tax during the recent pandemic showed some of these virtues yet the public seems to disagree surveys show that americans hate the property tax more than any other local state or federal levy and by wide margins new york governor andrew cuomo no tax cutter convinced the state legislature in 2011 to cap property taxes and in 2019 to make the cap permanent maybe calling the property tax a good tax is a stretch but when properly administered it is the least bad tax the problem state and local laws have attenuated the tax s connection to local benefits made it a tool of redistribution degraded the transparency of its administration and expanded the shadowy districts that receive its revenues earlier generations showed how to turn a bad property tax system into a good one if we heed their lessons we can fix the system again in the process we can bolster the one part of our political system that most americans remain happy with local government the most important benefit of property taxes which economists have touted for decades is that americans cannot maintain truly local government without them governments in small areas need to levy taxes that won t cause people to run next door income taxes are more likely to make people flee and only a few cities in the country mostly in pennsylvania ohio and new york impose them outside new york city local income taxes are usually about 1 percent likewise since a high sales tax in one location will cause shoppers to go elsewhere states usually impose uniform sales taxes either giving some of this revenue back to local governments or letting the local governments add 1 or 2 percentage points extra by contrast property taxes give local governments some leeway to set their own rates and therefore derive their own source of revenue it s a tax not on people but on things such as land and buildings which can t move the tax can also be tied to explicitly local benefits such as schools parks and police and fire protection appropriately managed a property tax is a benefit tax meaning that it is more like a fee that one pays for specific services property taxes also encourage localities to govern well when governments offer good services at low cost the added value gets capitalized in the value of land and homes people pay more to live in towns with good schools clean streets and low taxes these homevoters as economist william fischel calls them have a financial incentive to keep the government running well namely to improve the value of their homes they act like interested shareholders and get more involved in their communities political scientists and economists have long argued that small and competing governments tend to be more efficient than large regional governments or state governments stanford professor caroline hoxby has shown that areas with competing school districts for example have better and cheaper schools than those with large centralized districts vying with one another local governments tend to be more responsive than distant ones to voters decades of studies have shown that when property values and therefore tax revenues suddenly increase in small towns and suburbs these places tend to return those funds to the taxpayers but state and federal governments rarely do the same with sudden windfalls the reason is simple the local governments already provided the right level of services and benefits to their voters the extra tax money was a boon that they returned thus local governments that subsist on property taxes often provide good services at low cost why then did the property tax become so despised starting a century ago to private citizens back then it was the most hated tax to experts such as edwin r a seligman of columbia university then the nation s foremost tax scholar it was the worst tax in the early twentieth century the property tax had indeed become outmoded and outdated despite claims that the tax supported local benefits states captured much of the tax revenue and kept up to 50 percent of the total for themselves according to economist john joseph wallis s history of the property tax in america this meant that local assessors who valued the property to be taxed and local voters who elected the assessors had reason to keep taxes down since much of the increased value got siphoned away maybe calling the property tax a good tax is a stretch but when properly administered it is the least bad tax many states also had uniform and universal clauses in their constitutions which stipulated that all property not just real estate should be taxed at the same rate this meant that every piece of furniture every tool and every stock certificate had to be announced to the local assessor while the ability of the wealthy to stuff bonds and expensive pieces of art in the walls became legendary farmers with their large plots of unconcealable land bore the brunt of the tax and the powerful and the connected had other ways to exempt themselves assessors were often tied to political machines and exhibited favoritism most concerning for taxpayers was that property taxes kept going up they consumed 3 percent of national income in the early twentieth century rising to 5 4 percent in 1929 and then in a collapsing economy soaring to 11 7 percent by 1932 a proportion never matched before or since at the height of the great depression writes david t beito in taxpayers in revolt about one in every four households had stopped paying property taxes when numerous groups declared tax strikes they were acknowledging the inevitable people didn t have the money they couldn t pay high property taxes were not a partisan issue as governor of new york franklin roosevelt worked to lower local property taxes and he made reducing the property tax burden part of his presidential campaign in 1932 roosevelt s presidential predecessor herbert hoover also railed against high property taxes in his campaign though he knew that the federal government had almost no power over the situation the 1930s did bring reform during 1932 33 16 states set maximum tax limits allowing local governments to take no more than a set amount often 1 percent or 2 percent of property values almost every state relinquished its claim to the property levy often substituting sales and income taxes in their place and let local governments keep all the revenue states ended their universal and uniformity clauses and lifted taxes on personal property and financial assets they professionalized and de politicized assessors even as they gave local governments more leeway to determine what types of property got taxed governments at all levels soon enacted homestead exemptions letting everyone deduct a certain proportion of his home value from the tax bill and freeing the poorest from property taxes entirely americans have a long tradition of protesting against taxes especially at the local level bettmann getty images states also gave more authority to local governments especially in the suburbs to incorporate and administer themselves and to keep their tax dollars out of the hands of urban political machines instead of having one dominant metropolitan government that could tax its residents at will center cities now had to contend with suburbs on both services and taxes despite claims that such suburbs bled the cities of tax money these competing governments kept all elected leaders responsive to their constituents for the next 30 years property taxes worked like the new crop of economic and public finance experts said that they should the reliance on property taxes turned suburban governments into growth machines that demanded new development many suburbs used their new autonomy to overvalue and thus overtax new developments relative to old property which became known drily as the welcome stranger policy yet the extra property tax benefits of such new projects made them even more enticing to local voters as one san francisco bay area newspaper said in supporting new development on nearby pastureland cows don t pay taxes locals tailored the property taxes to meet their needs and it seemed to work cities and new suburbs grew and expanded taxes were reasonable and local schools and amenities found broad support but a host of changes first scandals and then overreactions upset the cheery age of the property tax yet again in the 1960s and 1970s a series of investigations of assessors in san francisco los angeles and chicago found political skullduggery and haphazard assessments that rivaled the worst of the old days new laws aimed to standardize and modernize assessments on property and make them uniform so that all property at least in real estate would pay the same rate some state supreme courts for example in massachusetts and new york mandated uniform assessments reformers and jurists argued that downtown skyscraper and industrial owners had gotten tax breaks for too long and that homeowners were getting shortchanged the reformers were wrong whenever a modernization occurred it became clear that commercial and industrial property had been overtaxed and homeowners undertaxed relative to a uniform standard this made sense because homevoters not businesses elected the local governments but to many it came as a rude surprise modernization led to a surge in charges for homeowners and to understandable outrage in california all property taxes rose after modernization in 1966 but the proportion paid by homeowners jumped by one third studies have shown that equalization hurt school quality and tended to lower test scores in states that implemented it standardization had some virtues but the rigid rules generally prevented local governments from tailoring taxes to their needs and burdened many poor and elderly homeowners with explosive charges such surprising bedfellows as the national welfare rights organization radical organizer saul alinsky and republican taxpayer groups worked together to limit increases as isaac martin points out in the permanent tax revolt almost every state modernization push was followed by a property tax revolt but the most important and damaging change to property taxes came from another sort of standardization this one on the spending side namely where the tax revenue went to previously school finance was the principal use of local property taxes besides a few grants from the state locals paid for and ran their own schools even today half of all property taxes go to schools yet advocates have long argued that the connection between property taxes and schools was unfair as it led to racial and economic inequities at least since arthur wise s 1968 book rich schools poor schools advocates have called property tax funded schools inequitable and unconstitutional in the famous 1976 case serrano v priest the california supreme court agreed declaring that every school district had to spend the same amount on every child similar equalization court rulings in other states reached their peak in the 1990s and changed the shape of local governments after equalization rulings states began to centralize financing again when a kansas court struck down the state s school finance system the legislature had to reimpose the old state property tax in 1992 and redistribute the funds to any district that was underspending after the texas supreme court made a similar ruling the state legislature created a robin hood tax in 1993 which collected excess property tax money from well off local school districts and distributed it to others in other states elected officials responded to threats of litigation and centralized financing themselves the problem with these rulings then and now lies in confusing poor school districts with poor people research from the 1970s to today shows that minorities and poor people were actually more likely to live in the richest districts these groups often lived in center cities that had loads of commercial property to tax ironically this led to school districts in cities with many impoverished students such as san francisco and austin texas sending money to middle class suburbs with lots of homeowners but few commercial properties the negative ramifications of equalization laws affected all aspects of local government school finance reform severed the link between good school districts and the value of local homes consequently homeowners took less interest in their local districts studies have shown that equalization hurt school quality and tended to lower test scores in states that implemented it it also led to cuts in school spending after the serrano case in california voters passed proposition 13 by a nearly two to one margin rolling back assessments and limiting property tax increases to 2 percent yearly a similar proposition before serrano went down by two to one the difference was that after equalization voters decided that if their property tax payments were just going to be stolen they might as well not pay them california went from leading the nation in both the quality and funding of its schools to becoming a perpetual laggard states also changed what types of governments get the property tax some made it harder to create new suburban municipalities others tried to organize regional governments or force county city consolidations with less competition urban areas imposed higher even confiscatory property taxes many studies show that small competitive local governments tend to return any extra tax revenue to taxpayers those same studies show that when large urban centers get increased assessments and taxes they use them to boost their budgets the same goes for state and federal grants to these big cities or regional governments larger cities manifest more of what economists call the flypaper effect new money sticks wherever it hits no matter what voters want large urban centers turned the property tax into just one of many local levies damaging their own cities as a result while most of the u s imposes property taxes of about 1 percent of the value of property rates in such cities as detroit and camden new jersey run to 3 5 percent and residents receive atrocious services in return for these punitive levies while states have made new municipalities harder to form they ve made it easy to create special districts most americans are at least familiar with their city government and their school district but they are likely oblivious to the array of special districts that may overlap their home administering everything from water and sewer services to fire departments hospitals and mosquito prevention programs these districts can impose property taxes and issue bonds with little voter input since the 1980s states have created more than 8 000 local governments 96 percent of them special districts according to the u s census more than 51 000 of these districts exist today across the country most americans couldn t name one of them competing local governments are a good thing but overlapping local governments prevent accountability and drive up taxes studies show that areas with more overlapping districts with california and illinois being the two champions in this regard tend to have higher taxes and less responsive services perhaps the most pervasive and least justifiable of these are tax increment financing tif districts these districts claim to rejuvenate blighted urban property by issuing bonds and giving subsidies to local developers in return the districts get to keep all the increases in property taxes after they were formed on the assumption that the tif district improved the land value and thus earned the extra increment yet on average the land inside tif districts gains no more value than the land outside them and a study of wisconsin tif districts showed that almost half were on greenfield land not deteriorated inner city districts in some cities tif districts become a burden for the other taxpayers who have to pick up the fiscal slack in chicago 1 billion sits in tif funds spread over more than 100 tif districts the total city budget is about 6 billion in some states these districts have become notorious redevelopment authorities issuing bonds based on property tax increases using the money to buy up local property through eminent domain and giving the property to eager developers in california the redevelopment authorities spread rapidly because they circumvented school equalization rulings whatever money went to redevelopment authorities didn t go to local school districts which themselves just redistributed money to the state governor jerry brown ended such redevelopment districts in california in 2011 precisely because doing so meant that the state had to spend less money equalizing school districts see california s secret government spring 2011 states have also become ever more generous in encouraging the rise of nonprofit economic empires especially hospitals and schools in many cities up to one third of all property is exempt from taxation in boston about half of all real property is exempt from property taxes putting the onus on the city s shrinking for profit sector these rules leave homeowners rental property owners and private companies bearing the burden and wondering who the real beneficiaries of the property tax are finally the ongoing proliferation of special districts tif districts and exemptions has made it harder for local voters to see the financial benefits of new development thus they tend to be less welcoming of new housing the more that property tax dollars get siphoned away the less that local voters see growth as a benefit voters don t want to get rid of property taxes entirely they want local control and some basic state guardrails but the property tax can be fixed again despite voters supposed hatred of it they loathe turning funding and control over to the state even more before judges intervened five states including california held referenda in the 1970s on reducing local property taxes and funding their schools at the state level the voters rejected them all by wide margins similarly a north dakota initiative to centralize school financing in 2012 went down to an overwhelming loss voters may not like high property taxes but they don t want to get rid of property taxes entirely they want local control local input and some basic state guardrails returning power and funds to local governments will once again make them responsive to voters first on the list of reforms should be the assessment system since the standardization debacles of the 1960s and 1970s states have created more breaks from uniform taxation levels some for the better and some for the worse breaks for agriculture and the elderly should remain though some rail at the inequity of these exceptions cities understand that farmers and the elderly use less of the social services especially schools that represent the main benefit of local governments yet states have gone far beyond such exemptions turning the property tax code into just another way to dole out favors tax exemptions now exist for veterans the disabled historic properties affordable housing blighted property pollution control equipment solar panels wind energy geothermal heating and so on minnesota now has 55 classifications each with its own rate the many classifications should be standardized into a few basic categories states should also stop assessing the personal property and equipment of businesses personal property taxes currently discourage manufacturing and industry see can american cities manufacture again winter 2020 states should also rein in the proliferation of special districts tifs and redevelopment authorities all extract revenue from taxpayers while operating in the shadows many should be brought under the auspices of local municipalities some basic transparency rules for local governments will also help utah s 1985 truth in taxation law and its many progenitors require governments to notify citizens and hold public hearings when tax revenues exceed expectations and the governments don t return them to taxpayers sudden increases in assessments shouldn t cause spikes in spending and such laws prevent the flypaper effect from happening automatically and give voters a say in any new spending a major virtue of the property tax in its mid twentieth century golden era was its transparency only local governments collected property taxes and most voters knew where the money went now multiple impenetrable governments and countless state tax and redistribution schemes make it impossible to know what the tax is really funding in california to take a representative example local governments still collect property taxes but the amount collected has nothing to do with the amount spent so taxpayers don t know whom to get mad at restoring transparency is imperative most important states should push back against equalization and return more funds to the school districts and localities that collect them right now property taxes are themselves effectively taxed by state governments and given away to other governments this helps neither students nor homeowners control and funding of school districts should be returned to local parents and taxpayers even as more charter school and private school competition in the largest districts is permitted the state should support needy students without assuming falsely that they live only in poor districts as in so many things america s dependence on local property taxes is exceptional u s property taxes as a percentage of income are 50 percent above those of other developed countries even in countries that do impose property taxes it is just one national levy among many in the u k local governments are generally powerless conduits passing down cash from on high people who vote in local elections around the world generally don t get to determine how much government they want or what they want it to spend money on but americans rely on local government despite recent centralization 15 percent of all u s tax revenue mainly from property levies still comes from local governments in the u k and belgium that figure is only about 5 percent americans have real discretion in these localities to express their views on education urban noise parks and public works without our local property tax funding we would lose our ability to accommodate the diversity in american lifestyles and preferences and to elect local officials who will respond to their constituents to believe in one s local government is to believe in the property tax but if we are to believe in the property tax we need to fix it it must be made more like a fee for good local service and less like a general revenue raising tool with some tinkering the tax can become a benefit once again

salvador s president nayib bukele plans to encourage the use of bitcoin as legal tender will see taxes in the central american country plummet demonstrators take part in a protest against the bitcoin

months ago people protested against president nayib bukele s policies on independence day in san salvador on september 15 thousands of salvadorans demonstrated to demand that president nayib bukele respect the separation of powers and reject the introduction of bitcoin as legal tender just after the country commemorated the bicentenary of its independence salvadoran veterans of the army and the

washington s new long term care tax is up against a class action lawsuit and a new initiative seeking to make the program optional olympia wash what is the washington cares fund what s behind the class action lawsuit and initiative 1436 seeking to modify or halt the tax altogether washington state passed a first of its kind long term care tax in 2019 intended to help pay for long term care expenses as the state s population gets older residents will start paying into the funding beginning in 2022 however the tax has sparked opposition from some groups who argue the act violates federal law or that taxpayers should have the option to opt out lawmakers say they intend to act on several common sense fixes to the act in the 2022 legislative session below is a closer look at the washington cares fund including what it does its intended benefits how the law could change in the future and what opponents are saying about the long term care act what is the washington cares fund starting in january 2022 washington workers will pay 0 58 percent of every 100 earned into the washington cares fund the fund ensures taxpayers who have contributed for 10 years receive 36 500 over their lifetime to help pay for long term care needs like in home care nursing home care hearing aids trained support for caregivers home delivered meals memory care necessary home renovations and many other services according to the wa cares fund website the fund will begin paying out benefits in 2025 the benefit level will adjust with inflation over the years the fund was created to address gaps in private long term care insurance and to provide for older residents with no insurance or ability to pay for long term care costs which otherwise fall to medicaid a survey conducted by aapr of washington found 50 percent of 65 year olds have no money in retirement savings the same survey found 75 percent of respondents wrongly believed private insurance would pay for a stay at a nursing home and 78 percent of respondents wrongly believed private insurance would pay for a home visit by a paid caregiver while families are far and away the main providers of long term care when more help is needed it s medicaid that bears the cost said dan murphy executive director of the northwest regional council area agencies on aging so wa cares helps protect medicaid from a cost explosion as the age wave crests although private long term care insurance is available it can exclude certain people based on pre existing conditions and can cost more for women than men murphy said people also have to keep paying into private insurance while payments into the wa cares fund stop when someone retires the deadline to opt out of the state s long term care tax passed on nov 1 2021 those wanting to opt out had to prove to the employment security department that they acquired private long term care insurance how could wa cares change in the 2022 legislative session washington legislators say they intend to make common sense fixes to the law in the upcoming legislative session as the law stands workers who live in other states but work in washington cannot opt out of the long term care tax members of the long term services and supports trust commission also recommended the legislature allow military spouses and veterans and temporary non immigrant permit work holders be allowed to opt out of the tax the commission is also looking into the possibility of allowing residents to take their long term care tax funds with them if they leave washington state washington state representative nicole marci d seattle said the issue was complicated because long term care services vary from state to state but we do think that there is work that can be done here she said investing the wa cares funds into a higher yield portfolio like the state has done with state employee pension funds and funds in the paid family leave trust would require a constitutional amendment which legislators are hoping to put on the ballot in the future washington cares faces class action lawsuit in early november three companies and six individuals filed a lawsuit against gov jay inslee and other state officials alleging the washington cares fund violates federal law the lawsuit argues the tax violates the employee retirement income security act of 1974 which forbids the state from passing a law requiring employees to participate in a plan that provides sickness or medical benefits according to davis wright tremaine llp the firm that filed the complaint none of the individuals represented in the suit purchased private long term care insurance before the nov 1 deadline meaning they will have to pay into the fund starting in january one plaintiff plans to retire before reaching the required 10 year contribution deadline another plaintiff lives across the border in eagle point oregon proponents of the tax claim the lawsuit is an effort to push private long term care insurance policies at the expense of more accessible long term care options it s not surprising to us that given the deep pockets of the opposition they re that they re launching a legal attack as part of their strategy to ultimately make long term care less affordable and less accessible to washington seniors and people with disabilities said madeleine foutch with washingtonians for a responsible future initiative 1436 a new initiative proposed by state representative jim walsh r aberdeen would allow people to opt out of the washington cares fund the initiative is currently in the signature gathering phase spearheaded by the group reform washington according to the state s employment security department 279 465 individuals have applied for exemptions so far 33 7 have been processed with 93 039 of those individuals granted exemptions more than 1 000 of the applications of those hoping to opt out of the fund are considered incomplete proponents of the washington cares fund argue the initiative will make it harder for the most vulnerable to pay for long term care costs it is an initiative to the legislature that will make it harder for washington families to afford and access long term care by threatening the viability of wa cares foutch said we re taking this threat to wa cares very seriously and ultimately if brought before the legislature we believe that the legislature should reject this pathway and will reject this pathway
the auto makers mutually decided to focus on their own projects backing away from an earlier strategic pact ford motor co and rivian automotive inc have decided to go their separate ways rather than collaborate on future electric vehicles backing away from an earlier strategic pact that led to a multibillion dollar windfall for ford executives from both companies last week decided to scrap plans for a specific electric vehicle a ford spokesman said the auto makers mutually decided to focus on their own projects scrapping plans to jointly develop a new model as had been envisioned under a partnership struck in early 2019 representatives from each company said ford remains an investor and ally on our shared path to an electrified future rivian said the ford spokesman said both their ev development and ours have advanced to a significant degree since the original deal was formed giving each company more confidence to move ahead independently trade publication automotive news earlier reported ford s decision to end the co development plans citing comments from ford chief executive jim farley during an interview the change of plans comes after rivian made its debut on the public markets this month with a blockbuster ipo that raised about 13 7 billion investors have since piled into the stock pushing rivian s valuation past that of both ford and larger rival general motors co as of friday s close the company was worth about 113 billion ford s market value was about 77 5 billion there already were signs that the strategic aspect of the agreement between the companies had faded since the deal was outlined in april 2019 which included a 500 million investment by ford into the startup ford in early 2020 canceled plans for a different model one for ford s lincoln luxury brand that would have been built using rivian s technology citing cash concerns amid the onset of the pandemic last spring ford s representative on rivian s board stepped down ford s early investment and subsequent infusions into rivian gave ford a 12 stake in rivian worth about 13 5 billion as of friday s close mr farley who took the top job in october 2020 has accelerated ford s electric vehicle push the dearborn michigan based auto maker plans to release a battery powered pickup in the spring that would compete directly with rivian s own electric truck the r1t mr farley told automotive news the decision to drop joint development plans with rivian was made in part because of ford s growing confidence in its own electric vehicle strategy
to those who ever harbored any doubts about how blatant and virulent the racism and white supremacy were that dominated north carolina s culture law and politics well into the 20th century pulitzer prize winning author david zucchino s most recent book wilmington s lie the murderous coup of 1898 and the rise of white supremacy is a must read to get a sense of how grim the reality was that zucchino describes in his painstaking account of the brutal insurrection that was perpetrated against the multi racial government of what was at the time north carolina s largest city try doing the following take a moment to picture some of the worst and most fiendish villains you ve ever seen in a film or another work of fiction the bad guys who are so evil that they seem like caricatures of bad guys now imagine that a large collection of such individuals have been transported to late 19th century north carolina for the purpose of executing a publicly proclaimed campaign to violently impose white supremacy as the law of the land that s the remarkable story that wilmington s lie documents the horrors zucchino reports are utterly stupefying and nauseating the people who carried out these despicable acts were representatives of the human species at its lowest and most shockingly vile what s more just because the coup occurred well over a century ago don t imagine that its legacy didn t and doesn t continue to live on as zucchino reminds us for decades afterward violent racism remained dominant in north carolina and throughout much of the nation in north carolina state history textbooks and other works purporting to be nonfiction continued well into the 20th century to describe the insurrection as a benevolent intervention by heroic kkk members seeking to bring order to a struggling town meanwhile on the ground the systematic disenfranchisement of and denial of opportunity to black north carolinians in wilmington and elsewhere persisted it took 74 years for another black wilmington resident to win elected office nearly a century for an african american to win statewide office and a congressional seat and of course to this day people of color throughout north carolina disproportionately lack the wealth health and well being influence and security of their white neighbors this is not to say that there hasn t been important progress over the decades in many many ways the ugly tentacles of racism and white supremacy have assuredly loosened their grip on our state but to pretend that the terrible legacy of the wilmington coup the post civil war era that birthed it or the decades of systematic jim crow oppression that followed much of which was sustained or endorsed by individuals families and institutions whose wealth and influence continue to this day have somehow been scrubbed from the state s ledger is preposterous and given this undeniable reality it s hard to gauge what s more disturbing in the present moment the horrific history itself or the efforts of modern conservatives to whitewash it this latter phenomenon has been on display at the general assembly recently as republicans in the state house approved a bill that would restrict what north carolina school children can be taught about american history as policy watch education reporter greg childress reported last week house bill 324 would prohibit teachers from promoting the idea that america is racist or sexist or even that it was created by members of one race or sex to oppress members of another group in other words as unc law professor gene nichol observed last week in a trenchant op ed the proposed law would require teachers to ignore the reality that is obvious to anyone with open eyes and ears about life for black north carolinians and because there s no other way to say it lie and while it would be bad enough if the bill in question was merely the work of a delusional soul like rep larry pittman that noisy beacon of reaction who once infamously compared abraham lincoln to adolf hitler what really renders this measure doubly offensive is its clear link to a concerted nationwide strategy not only was the bill approved by the house on a straight party line vote without a single republican no as childress reported the measure is like dozens of bills around the country being pushed by republican legislatures in tennessee ohio and elsewhere which seek to ensure that unflattering parts of the nation s history are not taught in public schools and coming as these bills do at a moment in which a the country faces massive and unprecedented challenges and b president biden s progressive policy agenda enjoys strong national support and momentum and support for traditional conservative policies like trickledown economics and small government has been plummeting it s hard to see these bills as anything other than a renewed effort by the party of donald trump to reprise their dear leader s special gift for thinly veiled appeals to race in order to galvanize white voters somewhere in the nether regions the architects of the wilmington coup are smiling knowingly note click here to watch david zucchino describe his book and respond to questions at

president joe biden s request for an investigation into anti competitive behaviour in the oil and gas markets may be smart politics in response to rising fuel prices but he failed to present evidence of collusion in this case i am writing to call your attention to mounting evidence of anti consumer behaviour by oil and gas companies biden wrote to the federal trade commission ftc in a letter released by the white house on wednesday the federal trade commission has authority to consider whether illegal conduct is costing families at the pump the president wrote i believe you should do so immediately at the heart of the president s complaint is that gasoline prices at the pump remain high even though oil and gas companies costs are declining prices at the pump have continued to rise even as refined fuel costs go down and industry profits go up he observed in the last month the price of unfinished gasoline is down more than 5 percent while gas prices at the pump are up 3 percent in the same period the unexplained large gap between the price of unfinished gasoline and the average price at the pump is well above the pre pandemic average the letter goes on to complain that profits of some oil and gas companies have almost doubled compared with 2019 and they are using the proceeds to fund stock buybacks and increase dividends i do not accept hard working americans paying more for gas because of anti competitive or otherwise potentially illegal conduct i therefore ask that the commission further examine what is happening with oil and gas markets and that you bring all the commission s tools to bear if you uncover any wrongdoing but the president s advisers are conflating different markets and different timescales to make a confused and confusing argument about prices and profitability which fails to provide a compelling rationale for intervention there are undoubtedly parts of the oil and gas industry where anti competitive behaviour and attempts to support prices have been common crude volatility the history and the future of boom bust oil prices mcnally 2017 for the most part the history of the oil industry is the history of producers trying to coordinate investment and output to hold prices above the level that would prevail with all out competition there may be a case for the ftc and the u s department of justice to investigate elements of the oil and gas industry for anti competitive behaviour but the white house has not made it in this letter confusion the letter is a heartfelt plea from a president under political pressure because of rising fuel prices and a sudden acceleration in inflation unfortunately the letter conflates as many as four different industries crude oil production petroleum refining fuel retailing and possibly natural gas production as well each one of these industries is cyclical with violent swings in prices and profitability subject to its own dynamics which makes comparisons between them less relevant the letter also conflates short term price movements over the last month with longer term comparisons with conditions before the pandemic it ignores the fact margins between the retail and wholesale costs of gasoline are extremely volatile in the short term which ensures one month s price data is not enough to draw even tentative conclusions and it presents a selection of metrics on costs wholesale and retail prices margins net income and shareholder payouts to imply the industry is making excess profits in this it seems to be conflating upstream profits from exploration and production with downstream profits from refining and retailing as well as profits made in the domestic market with those from overseas operations nowhere does it specify the mechanism by which oil and gas companies are supposed to be making excess profits at the expense of customers in the united states evidence the core of the president s argument is an empirical observation that margins between the wholesale cost of unfinished gasoline and the retail cost of fuel at the pump have widened in the last month it is true that the gap between retail prices including taxes and various measures of wholesale prices has increased in recent weeks but the margin has always been volatile in the short term and is not currently abnormal there is nothing in the data to substantiate the claim that retail prices are somehow being manipulated relative to wholesale costs gasoline stocks at wholesale level are low for the time of year which likely explains some of the recent upward pressure on margins and retail prices gasoline inventories held by refiners tank farms pipelines and fuel blenders have fallen in each of the last six weeks by a total of 13 million barrels stocks stand at just

overview concerns about the virus surge in europe cut short the euro s bounce and sent it back below 1 1300 and are also weighing on central european currencies including the hungarian forint despite yesterday s aggressive hike of the one week deposit rate austria has reintroduced a hard 20 day lockdown germany s health minister warned that the situation deteriorated and vaccines were not enough to break the wave he was explicit that a lockdown cannot be ruled out the us dollar is trading broadly higher only the yen is resilient on the day but sterling is the only major currency that has edged higher this week the scandis and euro are off more than 1 speculation that turkey may announce measures over the weekend to stabilize the lira may be helping to deter new sales today after yesterday s rout in the nine day drop through today it is depreciated by almost 15 the jp morgan emerging market currency index is off for the fourth consecutive session to bring this week s loss to more than 2 the most in five months equities do not know of the consternation in the foreign exchange market disappointing alibaba results weighed on the hang seng 1 while most other large regional bourses but taiwan and india closed the week on an up note europe s stoxx 600 snapped a six day advance yesterday it was only the second loss since october it began firmer today but has reversed lower putting at risk the six week rally us futures are mixed with the nasdaq outperforming bond markets are in rally mode as well the us 10 year yield is off three basis points to approach the week s low near 1 53 european bonds are off mostly 3 5 basis points even in the uk where retail sales surprised on the upside gold is steady finding support near 1850 oil initially extended yesterday s recovery but is reversing lower leaving the january wti contract set to test yesterday s low near 76 45 this is the fourth consecutive weekly fall in crude oil european natural gas netherlands benchmark is off 4 4 today the third drop in a row and pares the week s gain to almost 19 in singapore iron ore prices jumped 5 7 to break a five week slide that saw prices tumble by about 28 copper is firmer and paring this week s loss to around 2 asia pacific there were two developments in japan to note first october cpi was largely in line with expectations surging gasoline prices seven year highs helped keep the headline rate positive for the second month 0 1 year over year excluding fresh food the core rate was steady at 0 1 however the deflationary forces are evident when fresh food and energy are removed the measure deteriorated to 0 7 from 0 5 the most since june 0 9 second prime minister kishida unveiled an overall package of jpy78 9 trillion 690 bln it is larger than the previous two pandemic packages fiscal measures refer to spending investment and loans and this is seen worth about jpy55 7 trillion it is not clear yet how much represents new spending as opposed to the reallocation of funds from earlier budgets that were not used however it appears to be about jpy32 trillion of new spending the chinese yuan up a modest 2 1 for the year is the strongest currency against a trade weighted basket cfets the yuan is pulling back from a six year high set earlier this week as the euro recovers a cent consider that the yuan has appreciated by more than 9 against the euro and 11 5 against the yen this year that means that investment in china has the same tailwind as the dollar and is compensated a bit for the relative lack of transparency and liquidity the financial times estimates that foreign holdings of chinese bonds and stocks rose to around 1 1 trillion at the end of september about a 13 increase this year china s stock market has underperformed this year and the csi 300 is off around 7 this year on the other hand china s bonds have fared well it is the only 10 year bond that has not weakened this year china s figures show foreign direct investment has risen by almost 18 this year through october to nearly 142 bln the dollar is posting an outside down day against the japanese yen by first rising above yesterday s high before reversing and taking out yesterday s low it is approaching the week s low near jpy113 75 in the european morning below there support is seen around jpy113 60 a break would warn of a return to jpy113 00 the australian dollar has been sold to its lowest level since october 6 when it recorded a low of almost 0 7225 it has broken the trendline that connected the august and september lows 0 7250 the september low was around 0 7170 and maybe the next important technical target the dollar is trading with a firmer bias against the chinese yuan but the greenback remains in the range set on tuesday cny6 3670 cny6 3965 the dollar gained on the yuan four sessions this week the most since july but the net gain of less than 0 2 still shows an extraordinarily steady exchange rate with the yuan near six year highs against its trade weighted basket cfets the pboc warned against one way moves and encouraged financial institutions to bolster fx risk management it set the dollar s reference rate at cny6 3825 slightly above expectations bloomberg survey for cny6 3822 europe the stronger than expected october retail sales capped the week s data that points to a rebounding economy and boosts the chances of a rate hike next month a strong jobs report was followed by a larger than expected rise in cpi and ppi retail sales jumped 0 8 in october and the september series was revised to flat from 0 2 it was the first increase since april pre xmas sales were reported separately the uk government reported that the cost of servicing the national debt has risen more than three fold over the past year leaving the budget deficit higher than anticipated it appears that the swaps market is pricing in a 15 bp hike at the december 16 boe meeting though some are talking about a bigger move several ecb officials including president lagarde have successfully pushed back against expectations of a 20 bp rate hike next year that had appeared discounted by the swaps market earlier this month the market has pushed it into early 2023 the implied yield of the december 2022 euribor futures contract has fallen 20 bp this month the december 2022 eurodollar futures contract is moving in the opposite direction the implied yield has risen by about 4 5 bp this month the net result is the us premium has increased to over 125 bp the highest since last march in late 2019 the premium was around 180 bp this is recognized as a factor helping lift the dollar against the euro and it appears to have become more salient recently the euro s bounce yesterday its first gain in seven sessions since the us cpi shocker stalled near 1 1375 where a 780 mln euro option expires today the euro traded quietly in asia before being sold aggressively as news of the virus hit the wires the euro traded through 1 1285 before catching a bid resistance now will likely be encountered around 1 1320 the euro is posting its first back to back weekly of more than 1 since march 2020 sterling is also sliding back toward the week s lows just above 1 3400 a break could signal a test on the 1 3350 area but it appears stretched on an intraday basis while the euro sterling cross is practically flat the euro has punched below chf1 05 for the first time in six years it would not be surprising to learn that the snb has been intervening there appears to be little chart support until closer to chf1 0250 america the nonpartisan congressional budget office offered its evaluation of the biden administration s build back better initiative it sees 1 636 trillion in spending over the next decade and almost 1 27 trillion in revenue that leaves a deficit of 367 bln a notable difference between it and the administration is how much more revenue will be generated by increasing the number of irs agents even if it passes the house of representatives it will likely be marked up in the senate the jockeying for position and spin around it will likely dominate the session which sees no us economic reports outside of the rig count later today the fed s clarida and waller speaker today it seems that most market participants still see the fed behind the curve and disagree with our idea that to secure the ability to respond to a wide range of possible outcomes the federal reserve may accelerate its tapering starting in january it is not clear exactly when the debt ceiling will be reached but it is being played the democrats do not want to lift it through the reconciliation process though they have forced the republicans to do so in the past the republicans appear to have the discipline and will to oppose no one seems to think the us will really default and getting even this close seems undignified yet the desire to avoid being caught out encouraged investors to demand a high yield on the four week bill sold yesterday s auction saw the yield more than double to 11 bp annualized it is the highest yield since july 2020 in contrast the eight week bill which is thought to be beyond the shenanigans yield slipped to 4 5 bp from six previously and a higher bid cover ratio canada reports september retail sales figures today after a 2 1 rise in august some weakness is expected ahead of it the canadian dollar is trading at new lows for the week though it is faring better than the other dollar bloc currencies the us dollar is approaching the 61 8 retracement objective of the decline since the cad1 29 level was tested on september 20 the retracement level is near cad1 2665 and a break would target cad1 2700 cad1 2750 the upper bollinger band is found near cad1 2655 today the mexican peso is also under pressure it too has fallen to a new low for the week today the greenback looks set to test the eight month high set earlier this month near mxn20 98 note that the central bank s deputy governor warned that inflation was accelerating and it could rise to 7 this month and 7 1 7 3 next month in october the cpi stood at 6 24 year over year banxico meets next on december 16 the day after the fomc meeting lastly we note that the brazilian real is off for four consecutive sessions coming into today the dollar closed above its 20 day moving average against it yesterday and looks poised to probe above brl5 60 today the high for the month was closer to brl5 70
investors are in the stock market to find growth returns and profits and the last year has brought plenty of that the s p 500 and nasdaq both finished last week at near record high the indexes are up 25 for the year the gains have not come easy stocks are gaining for now while the fed continues to hold interest rates low and inflation has jumped to a 30 year high cash is simply not a good investment as savings real yields are turning negative and rising prices are eating away at purchasing power even treasury bonds long considered a safe haven investment are only yielding 1 5 just one quarter of the annualized inflation rate this leaves stocks and especially those stocks with a growth oriented reputation or potential as the only game in town for investors seeking a strong upside we ve used the tipranks platform to look up two such stocks a look at their details along with commentary from the wall street analysts should tell why they are such compelling buys arcus biosciences rcus we ll look first at arcus a clinical stage biotech company developing new molecules to act in combination therapies in the treatment of cancer the company s drug candidates are immunotherapy products four leading candidates are subjects of 12 active research tracks ranging from early phase 1 to phase 3 pivotal studies the research pipeline includes four small molecule drug candidates etrumadenan ad dual a2ar a2br antagonist quemliclustat a cd73 inhibitor domvanalimab a tigit mab and zimberelimab pd 1 mab the drug candidates are being evaluated in multiple overlapping clinical trials in various combinations with each other the clinical trials are testing the therapeutic agents against a variety of cancers including non small cell lung cancer nsclc colorectal cancer crc castrate resistant prostate cancer crpc and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma pdac arcus is pursuing several of these tracks in partnership with larger pharmaceutical companies collaborators include taiho which has an option to commercialize arcus products in japan and gilead with whom arcus announced a 10 year partnership beginning last year that partnership with gilead has brought arcus its major recent catalyst the company s stock has been rising all year up 83 year to date on the strength of its research pipeline but last week it jumped over 20 when gilead announced that it was moving to exercise its development and commercialization rights on several of arcus experimental medications the announcement came 8 months earlier than expected and shows gilead s confidence in arcus pipeline arcus stands to receive option payments from gilead up to 725 million among the bulls is leerink analyst geoff porges who sees the gilead announcement as a substantial de risking event for rcus stock we had expected gilead to opt in to all three medicines by mid 2022 and instead they have moved earlier and more decisively to accelerate the development of all of them by year end assuming the opt in transactions close around the turn of the year gilead will assume financial and operational control of the development of the drugs rapidly and is likely to significantly expand the number of pivotal trials and the breadth of the combinations being explored we believe the announcement is further validation for rcus and their management team porges noted to this end porges rates rcus an outperform i e buy along with a 100 price target this figure implies an upside of 110 for the next 12 months to watch porges track record click here are other analysts in agreement they are only buy ratings 7 in fact have been issued in the last three months so the consensus rating is a strong buy given the 67 average price target shares could rise 41 in the next year see rcus stock analysis on

dunlop has been steadily raising its dividend even during the pandemic crisis the company currently pays out 50 cents per common share and the annualized rate of 2 gives a yield of 1 3 while lower than current bond yields the wd dividend is reliable and the company s pattern indicates a likely increase in the first quarter of next year jefferies analyst ryan carr points out that the company scale and market share have combined with the inflationary trends in the housing markets to solidify the company s position and prospects in his niche the cre and multifamily origination market has thrived ytd particularly as significant home price appreciation and domestic migration trends have supported robust rental volumes wd boasts a competitive advantage to disproportionately benefit from

u s representative mariannette miller meeks didn t move quickly enough to correct some obvious problems with her financial disclosure forms the iowa democratic party s executive director erin davison rippey filed a complaint with the office of congressional ethics on october 11 highlighting at least four ways in which miller meeks misstated her assets first the complaint says miller meeks failed to properly disclose all of her earned income on her 2019 and 2020 filings as a candidate in iowa s second district and on her annual report covering 2020 none of those reports listed miller meeks salary as a state senator the cedar rapids gazette flagged that omission in mid september the 2020 candidate report disclosed 34 646 income earned in 2020 from her state pension and great river health systems but that income was missing from the annual report covering the same calendar year second miller meeks allegedly incorrectly disclosed a deferred compensation payout from the great river health systems according to the iowa democratic party any deferred compensation should have been listed as earned income in a different part of the annual report and the agreement to pay that compensation should also have been reported if miller meeks has any ownership interest in the great river health systems that should also be disclosed third some investment and retirement accounts that miller meeks listed on her 2020 disclosure as a congressional candidate were omitted from the 2020 annual report as bleeding heartland discussed here that annual report listed no banking investment or retirement accounts which was difficult to imagine since miller meeks loaned her campaign 195 000 last year fourth miller meeks candidate financial disclosures did not list the underlying assets in her retirement or investment accounts any stocks or other holdings should be disclosed so the public can assess any potential conflicts of interest davison rippey requested an immediate investigation into this matter in an october 11 news release iowa democratic party state chair ross wilburn said iowans expect transparency and honesty as a bare minimum from their elected representatives for wilburn the republican s refusal to comply with basic transparency measures suggests miller meeks is untrustworthy the daily iowan s natalie dunlap quoted spokesperson eric woolson as saying miller meeks is working with the house ethics committee and house clerk s office on several substantive questions to resolve the discrepancies of her most recent personal financial report he added this will ensure that her upcoming amended report covers all the necessary bases we anticipate that the amended report will be filed as soon as her staff receives the answers to those questions woolson also told the newspaper wilburn should focus on issues such as inflation rather than partisan attacks tell that to the republican operatives who immediately cut an ad calling axne corrupt after her annual disclosures drew scrutiny she filed amended reports last week the republican party of iowa issued not one but two press releases about axne s disclosure omissions state party chair jeff kaufmann organized a press call where he described the democrat s mistakes as deliberate and illegal criminal activity and political corruption i believe both axne and miller meeks made honest mistakes and were not intentionally hiding assets but woolson should not expect others to give his boss the benefit of the doubt when his allies including not just kaufmann but also the iowa gop s bro like communications staffer kollin crompton accused axne of deliberately breaking the law miller meeks disclosure errors were in plain view she should have moved quickly to amend her filings before anyone had time to file a formal ethics complaint ethics complaint filed on october 11 by the iowa democratic party

25 years ago establishment of european monetary union sparks protests on november 22 23 1996 workers throughout europe protested and struck against austerity measures imposed to meet targets under the proposed european monetary union the most explosive conflict took place in france where truck drivers marked the eighth day of their nation wide strike by blockading english channel ports and german border crossings the strike was the most powerful since the general strike movement the previous november and december which challenged the alain juppé government s plans to cut pensions and health benefits the strikers were seeking higher wages shorter hours and retirement aged 55 instead of 60 demands which directly contradicted the policies of president jacques chirac and prime minister juppé drivers set up nearly 150 blockades on the highway system in germany tens of thousands of bank workers took to the streets to protest cuts in sick benefits made by the government of chancellor helmut kohl the largest protest in frankfurt germany s financial center came outside a meeting of european bankers at which kohl reaffirmed his commitment to the emu in italy more than 150 000 metal workers staged a one day strike and thousands marched through rome condemning the refusal of industrialists to make a pay offer that kept pace with inflation in spain nearly 200 000 workers rallied in the center of madrid to oppose a pay freeze for government workers imposed by the right wing regime of prime minister jose aznar the pay freeze was part of the same measures to bring spain into line with emu requirements for cutting the budget deficit coal miners struck in león and asturias over cuts in government subsidies another requirement of the emu in britain the issue of emu implementation began to split both the major capitalist parties up to 150 conservative mps threatened to break with prime minister john major while labour party leader tony blair was publicly criticized for his pro emu stance former deputy labour leader denis healy said that there would be rioting in the streets if the austerity measures required for emu membership were carried out the austerity measures imposed by europe s ruling classes and the spontaneous opposition from europe s workers posed the need to unify the working class in struggle across the continent this unified struggle was bitterly opposed by the existing workers organizations all of which were committed to the nation state framework with the trade unions and the social democratic and ex stalinist parties all collaborating with the emu inspired austerity policies it was the extreme right wing parties that stood to profit politically from the popular opposition 50 years ago britain grants independence to apartheid rhodesia on november 23 1971 british foreign minister alec douglas home concluded negotiations with the prime minister of rhodesia s apartheid regime ian smith for the formal recognition of independence for the southern african country the agreement was a major concession to the minority white population who remained in control of virtually all political power the independence agreement and new constitution granted an immensely unequal distribution of seats in the parliament with 50 seats reserved for the 250 000 white rhodesians while the majority black population of 5 million were given just 16 seats government resources for education land development and other social needs were to be divided in half and split between the white and black population giving whites a greatly disproportionate share all government administration and professional jobs were reserved only for whites in the 1960s the previous british government of harold wilson had adopted a policy of no independence before majority rule the british labour party government was a fervent defender of british imperialism it insisted that political rights must be granted to the majority population of the colonies before independence could be granted in order to block revolutionary upheavals and preserve capitalism both the white rhodesians led by smith and the british conservatives opposed the majority rule policy in 1965 smith and other rhodesian leaders signed a unilateral declaration of independence stating their intent to gain independence while maintaining the apartheid system the british responded by imposing some minor trade restrictions on rhodesia the largely cosmetic sanctions had no significant impact the november 23 agreement between smith and eduard heath s conservative government essentially accepted all the terms of the unilateral declaration and abandoned the majority rule policy as the news hit the london stock market share prices of tobacco and other goods imported from rhodesia soared with the recognition of the independent apartheid rhodesia british capitalism was sanctioning the continued colonial suppression and extreme exploitation of the black working class imperialism is throwing all pretense of democracy to the winds in the face of the necessity of keeping down the working class of the colonial and advanced countries alike observed the bulletin the american trotskyist newspaper 75 years ago french forces massacre vietnamese on november 23 1946 french military vessels opened fire on the vietnamese coastal city of haiphong in a brutal massacre that claimed at least 6

powers for nearly 30 years the attack took place in the fluid situation that followed the end of world war ii during the conflict japan had taken control of indochina from france ending its longstanding colonial rule with tokyo s defeat france sought to regain its former possession the stalinist communist party of vietnam and its leader ho chi minh maneuvered among the imperialist powers and sought to reach an agreement with them in september 1945 ho proclaimed an independent democratic republic of vietnam but over the following months the french in collaboration with the british would secure control of much of indochina especially the south ho would make overtures to the us and in 1946 held a series of talks with the french including in march when he signed the ho sainteny agreement allowing for a continued french military presence in indochina on november 20 1946 with talks for the implementation of the deal postponed a french patrol ship seized control of a chinese junk attempting to bring so called contraband from china into haiphong vietnamese fighters responded angrily opening fire the french seized on the incident as a pretext for launching a major assault jean étienne valluy commander of french forces in indochina instructed his subordinates that the moment has come to give a severe lesson to those who have treacherously attacked you use all the means at your disposal to make yourself complete master of haiphong this was accompanied with a provocative ultimatum to the vietnamese independence movement demanding that it leave the french and chinese quarters of the city on the morning of november 23 the ultimatum having been rejected three french avisos or dispatch boats together with the suffren cruiser approached the port at haiphong they began bombarding the largely defenseless city thousands would die as a direct result of the shelling and from stampedes the attack caused within a week the french would take control of haiphong 100 years ago hirohito becomes regent in japan on november 25 1921 the crown prince of japan hirohito a major in the army and lieutenant commander in the navy took over the state functions of his father the emperor yoshihito yoshihito had performed no official role in the government since 1919 due to incapacitation from mental illness the maneuvering of japanese imperialism in the years after world war i required a diplomatic face and since march 1921 hirohito had already made official visits to the united kingdom france the netherlands belgium italy and the vatican in may he had been feted in splendor all over england at the behest of the british monarchy during the visit the prince was quoted as saying the rise of bolsheviks won t happen if you live a simple life like duke athol one of his hosts under his regency japan negotiated the five power naval treaty with italy france the united states and britain for stability in the pacific and the withdrawal of troops from soviet siberia in 1922 only a few days before his accession as regent japan had recognized manchuria as a chinese possession hirohito became emperor in 1926 after his father s death and ruled japan during the brutal expansion of the japanese empire in 1931 1945 as head of state he endorsed the invasion of manchuria in 1931 and after the end of japanese civilian control of the military in 1932 he authorized war crimes including the use of poison gas in wuhan in 1938 hirohito consented to an alliance with nazi germany after the success of the wehrmacht in poland in 1939 hirohito supported war preparations against american british and french imperialism in 1941 although there is little doubt that hirohito was a war criminal particularly because of his support for the aggressive war against china and the horrors of the japanese occupation there after the defeat of japan in 1945 he was never tried american imperialism instead chose to maintain him as a figurehead of bourgeois rule

to listen to this statement in audio format click here the world socialist web site is initiating a global workers inquest into the covid 19 pandemic drawing upon the research of scientists the knowledge of public health experts and the real world experience of working people and students the inquest will investigate and document the disastrous response of governments corporations and the media to the outbreak of sars cov 2 the virus that causes covid 19 it will seek to expose the political and economic forces and interests that drove the policies that allowed the uncontrolled transmission of the virus and its development into a catastrophic pandemic that has killed millions worldwide the pandemic is an event of historic magnitude its impact on the course of the twenty first century may well prove to be as far reaching as that of the two world wars on the twentieth century therefore the origins causes and consequences of the pandemic must be thoroughly investigated and understood this disaster was neither an act of god nor the result of a malevolent conspiracy in a chinese laboratory the time has come to decisively refute the lies in which the pandemic narrative has been enshrouded by governments and the corporate media this inquest is necessary to break through the cover up falsifications and misinformation that have been deployed to justify policies responsible for the avoidable deaths of millions since the initial detection of sars cov 2 the inquest will gather and make available to the public ample evidence of socially malign and even criminal indifference to human life the launching of this inquest cannot be delayed as the world enters the third year of the pandemic the global contagion is not abating far from it the sixth global surge of the pandemic is now well under way with cases hospitalizations and deaths once again on the rise as winter approaches in the northern hemisphere after reaching a trough of 402 548 global average daily new cases on october 17 2021 the official number of average daily new cases surpassed 500 000 in mid november with all of europe and north america experiencing a significant rise in cases while powerful vaccines have been manufactured only 41 percent of the world population has received two doses of vaccine including fewer than 7 percent of africans and 3 percent of people in low income countries just 2 6 percent of the world population has received a necessary third dose of vaccine scientists have repeatedly warned that continued mass infection amid the slow rollout of vaccines creates evolutionary pressures that threaten to produce a vaccine resistant variant the official global death toll now stands above five million people which is known to be a vast undercount the institute for health metrics and evaluation ihme at the university of washington estimates that the most likely number of deaths from covid 19 globally is 12 1 million people with an average of nearly 13 300 people now dying each day worldwide the long term societal impacts which could include hundreds of millions of people suffering from long covid are not yet fully known the number of excess deaths during the pandemic those from all causes above and beyond what would be expected during normal conditions is estimated by the economist to be more than 17 million a recent study published in the bmj formerly british medical journal found that life expectancy dropped significantly in 2020 in countries that allowed the virus to spread in particular russia 2 32 years and the us 2 years the pandemic was foreseen the inquest will debunk the myth that the pandemic was an unforeseeable and unstoppable disaster in the decades prior to the initial outbreak of sars cov 2 in wuhan china which experts have overwhelmingly attributed to animal to human zoonotic transmission most likely from a bat at a wet market there was a mass of scientific literature books and even films that anticipated such a pandemic the 2002 2004 sars outbreak the 2003 h5n1 bird flu epidemic the 2009 swine flu pandemic the 2012 mers outbreak and the 2013 2016 ebola virus epidemic prompted scientists throughout the world to raise the alarm that a pandemic was imminent in july 2005 epidemiologist dr michael osterholm wrote a detailed essay in the journal foreign affairs titled preparing for the next pandemic in all essentials this paper outlined the worst case scenario that in fact took place globally starting in january 2020 warning that a coming pandemic cannot be avoided dr osterholm called for each country to develop a detailed operational blueprint for how to get a population through one to three years of a pandemic as well as an initiative to provide vaccine for the entire world he also warned that if the next pandemic began that night virtually every piece of medical equipment or protective gear would be in short supply within days of the recognition of a pandemic while noting that global supply chains would be severely disrupted he concludes the essay by stating this is a critical turning point in history time is running out to prepare for the next pandemic we must act now with decisiveness and purpose dozens of similar articles essays and research papers written over the next 14 years endorsed and added to dr osterholm s prognosis but these warnings were ignored by almost all governments and society was left totally unprepared for such an event the financial resources necessary to counteract the danger were not provided instead trillions of dollars were poured into the financial markets and ever ballooning military budgets the unbridled destruction of critical ecosystems left society increasingly vulnerable to zoonotic transmission stockpiles of personal protective equipment were not maintained research into mrna vaccines and other technologies was cut off when deemed unprofitable hospital systems were left understaffed and underresourced the global transmission of sars cov 2 could have been stopped in early 2020 the inquest will critically investigate and refute the untenable claim that once sars cov 2 began to spread there was little that could be done to stop it this assertion is clearly contradicted by the experience in china a society of 1 4 billion people where emergency measures were taken that rapidly eliminated the virus these included the use of masking social distancing testing contact tracing the closure of nonessential workplaces and the construction of isolation centers and health care facilities by march 14 2020 china had brought daily new cases down to only 25 one month after they reached a peak of 4 602 on february 14 the virus was soon eliminated with periodic minor outbreaks in which daily new cases only once surpassed 200 to date there have only been 4 636 deaths from covid 19 in china with all but four taking place before april 17 2020 similar measures were implemented in new zealand vietnam taiwan and other countries in the asia pacific region with great success the refutation of the assertion that the virus could not be stopped is not a matter of purely historical interest today alongside the global deployment of vaccines it is still possible and vital to implement policies directed toward the elimination and eradication of covid 19 elimination vs herd immunity the inquest will confront the following critical question why were the measures that proved successful in china new zealand and other asia pacific countries not implemented in the united states brazil germany india and throughout the world what economic political and social interests dictated an entirely different response the ancient question of criminal law cui bono i e who benefits must be raised in the context of the pandemic the unavoidable answer as the inquest will demonstrate is that a conscious decision was made to prioritize the performance of financial markets and corporate profits over saving human lives the facts speak for themselves while millions of workers died of covid 19 the wealth of corporate ceos and major shareholders vastly increased in the first 19 months of the pandemic us billionaires alone increased their wealth by 2 1 trillion or 70 percent a disease that ravaged the globe vastly enriched the pandemic profiteers wealthy us senators privy to an intelligence briefing on sars cov 2 in january 2020 dumped millions of dollars worth of stock while staying silent on the dangers of the virus on march 19 2020 us president donald trump secretly told journalist bob woodward that he deliberately misled the public in order to prevent a run on the markets saying i wanted to always play it down i still like playing it down because i don t want to create a panic numerous such incidents took place in countries throughout the world in opposition to the strategy of elimination or zero covid governments implemented the socially criminal policy of herd immunity i e letting the virus rip through society until the majority of the population is infected first implemented in sweden this policy was enthusiastically touted by new york times columnist thomas friedman promoted by the trump administration and his co thinkers globally and consciously articulated in the great barrington declaration the guiding anti elimination mantra of herd immunity coined by friedman is that the cure cannot be worse than the disease i e public health must be subordinated to corporate profits to justify the herd immunity policy basic scientific truths about covid 19 were suppressed and falsified official institutions including the world health organization and the centers for disease control and prevention denied the airborne character of the virus for over one year after finally admitting that aerosols are the dominant mode of transmission they have made no effort to educate the public mandate masks or systematically improve ventilation in public spaces including schools politicians of every stripe as well as the pro capitalist labor unions falsified the effects of covid 19 on children and the role that schools play in viral transmission in the united states the president of the american federation of teachers led the criminally reckless campaign on behalf of the biden administration to drive children back into the schools while feigning concern for the mental health of students their underlying motive has always been to send parents back to work to ensure the continued flow of profits to corporations encountering widespread resistance the elites have responded with repressive measures in britain lisa diaz a parent who is leading a popular movement against the unsafe reopening of schools was threatened with fines and maligned in the press david o sullivan a london bus driver who warned his co workers of the danger posed by covid 19 was fired in retaliation in the process of discrediting public health policies herd immunity advocates whipped up right wing fanatics rejected lockdowns and pursued a systematic campaign of misinformation centered on opposing masks and vaccines generating a dangerous level of public confusion then president donald trump watches as white house coronavirus adviser and herd immunity promoter dr scott atlas speaks during a september 2020 news conference on the pandemic at the same time lies were concocted about the origins of sars cov 2 claiming that the virus was engineered in a lab in wuhan this conspiracy theory was fabricated by the far right and later picked up by the establishment media in particular the washington post and new york times not only did this distract from the real causes of the pandemic but it was used to advance a militaristic geopolitical agenda directed against china with the rollout of vaccines in the wealthiest countries in 2021 an offshoot of herd immunity developed based on the false claims that vaccines and masks alone could bring an end to the pandemic this found its sharpest expression in the us under the biden administration which on may 13 2021 advised vaccinated people to stop wearing masks and prematurely proclaimed independence from the pandemic on july 4 2021 since that date more than 170 000 americans have died from covid 19 the wsws has noted that three strategies towards the pandemic have emerged herd immunity vaccinations with limited mitigation measures and the global elimination of sars cov 2 the first two strategies are based on the subordination of public health to private profits while only the last represents a path forward towards ending the pandemic and saving lives the same financial interests responsible for the disastrous herd immunity policies have exerted enormous pressure on countries throughout the asia pacific to abandon the elimination strategy and allow mass infections to take place the government of new zealand which had successfully suppressed the virus for nearly 18 months finally succumbed to international pressure in october it abandoned the zero covid policy developed by scientists the result of this retreat has been a dramatic increase in covid infections pressure is also being exerted on china to retreat from its commitment to covid elimination these global machinations aimed at forcing countries to accept mass infection in the interest of corporate profits will also be investigated by the inquest the scope and aims of the global workers inquest into the covid 19 pandemic one cannot speak of the deaths of millions of people without posing the question of criminal culpability while donald trump overtly lied to the public and boris johnson blurted out let the bodies pile high in their thousands the actions of joe biden justin trudeau angela merkel emmanuel macron and dozens of other world leaders resulted in comparable levels of needless suffering and death narendra modi vowed to save the indian people from lockdown not the virus in april 2021 as the country was ravaged by the delta variant as a result authoritative studies show that covid 19 has killed at least 3 million and more likely 5 million indians sections of the us political establishment and media including the washington post and the new york times have called for a 9 11 style commission to investigate the pandemic such an investigation would only deepen the cover up that has taken place not a single government will tolerate any serious investigation because they themselves are implicated in this massive social crime the global workers inquest into the covid 19 pandemic does not seek nor require the sanction of governments the world socialist web site is well equipped to initiate the inquest it recognized from the earliest public reports of sars cov 2 the danger of a global pandemic since january 24 2020 when it first reported on the initial coronavirus outbreak the wsws has posted more than 4 000 articles on this subject it has demanded since early 2020 the implementation of a globally coordinated plan to stop the pandemic it has denounced government policies responsible for mass death in a statement published on february 28 2020 the wsws stressed the need for global action to stop the pandemic writing the response to the coronavirus cannot be coordinated on a nation by nation level the virus does not respect borders or visa and immigration restrictions the global networks of transportation and economic integration have turned the virus into a global problem the solution must be global scientists from all over the world must be allowed to share their research and technology unencumbered by the national interests and geopolitical conflicts that serve only to delay the development of effective countermeasures to contain cure and ultimately eradicate the coronavirus on march 6 2020 the wsws stated the indifference of the trump administration to the health of the population is not better and perhaps worse than the attitude of the pharaohs of ancient egypt to the slaves the media has spent far more time bemoaning the fall in share values on wall street than the loss of human life opposing these policies the wsws posted a statement on march 17 2020 which declared the essential principle that must guide the response to the crisis is that the needs of working people must take absolute and unconditional priority over all considerations of corporate profit and private wealth the wsws has not only reported on the impact of the pandemic it has sought to impart to workers and young people a scientific understanding of the pandemic and what must be done to stop it toward this end the wsws cosponsored in conjunction with the international workers alliance of rank and file committees two global webinars on august 22 and october 24 2021 featuring leading scientists who have fought for a policy of global elimination sri lankan health workers shout slogans demanding better pay and personal protective equipment during a strike action in colombo sri lanka friday oct 8 2021 ap photo eranga jayawardena the october 24 webinar proposed the following as the basis for the fight to end the pandemic the target of sars cov 2 the virus that causes covid 19 is not individuals but entire societies the virus mode of transmission is directed toward achieving mass infection sars cov 2 has evolved biologically to strike billions and in so doing kill millions therefore the only effective strategy is one based on a globally coordinated campaign aimed at the elimination of the virus on every continent in every region and in every country there is no effective national solution to this pandemic humanity people of all races ethnicities and nationalities must confront and overcome this challenge through a vast collective and truly selfless global effort the policies pursued by virtually all governments since the outbreak of the pandemic must be repudiated the subordination of that which should be the unquestioned priority of social policy the protection of human life to the interests of corporate profit and private wealth accumulation cannot be allowed to continue the initiative to bring about a decisive turn to a strategy directed toward global elimination must come from a socially conscious movement of millions of people this global movement must draw upon scientific research the persecution of scientists many of whom labor under threats to their livelihoods and even their lives must be ended the global elimination of the virus requires the closest working alliance between the working class the great mass of society and the scientific community building upon these principles and the work of the last two years the world socialist web site will conduct the inquest on a global scale it will interview and gather information from scientists and public health specialists from all over the world the inquest will examine a wide range of critical issues relating to the outbreak spread and management of the pandemic in all parts of the world it will reach out to workers and students for real life information to document the impact of the pandemic on the lives of ordinary people the wsws which is the publication of the international committee of the fourth international and its affiliated socialist equality parties will provide organizational scaffolding and impulse for the inquest but this immense project requires the active collaboration of specialists in many fields active in the fight against the pandemic in seeking to develop this collaboration in the practical work of the inquest the wsws does not require agreement of all participants with the socialist program that it advocates there will be differences among those involved in the inquest on the best forms of political social and economic organization of future society but this collaboration will require among its participants an unyielding commitment to scientific truth the elimination and eradication of covid 19 and the safeguarding of life culture and the future of humanity we appeal to all those who wish to assist in the work of the inquest to fill out the form below

threat explaining how she s already leasing part of jamie s share of the ranch and that the ranch will continue to lose money anyway stubbornness she says is not a successful business model warner then makes an offer for some reason now on the defense beth will join market equities to help oversee all development in montana protecting the yellowstone by making market episode billions in other projects presuming the offer too good to be true because beth still hasn t agreed to sell any part of the land trust beth makes a seemingly impossible demand in exchange for her working with market equities she will acquire all of market equities shares in schwartz meyer helping her vindictively ruin them later beth confers with john over the potential employment explaining how it might be useful for her to work for the enemy she also expresses disbelief at warner s offer suspecting there s something else behind the overly fair deal the bunkhouse show photo credit paramount jimmy heads

the yellowstone to sell advertisement advertisement during his talk with kayce however jamie seems to buckle he still desires john s approval appearing chuffed when told john needs him he affirms his loyalties to the duttons a gesture that in earlier episodes felt empty and manipulative but now feels increasingly genuine jamie then explains to kayce why he never visited john in the hospital he was using his position to squash investigations into the attack on the ranch that left several militiamen dead to visit john would have complicated his impartiality as attorney general at the end of the

in this new era of jihad and universal victimization i would expect the term army chaplain to drive the good men and women of the west to create a more pc term for priest soldiers it would have to be something that steered the consciousness away from irony and dissonance because each of us no matter where she lives wants to know beyond doubt that the creator of the universe stands beside her and not the guys pointing guns at her and so we have religious people to remind us god is always on our side the army chaplain must exist for those who need to know excalibur is still in a rock on our soil but in light of developments which pit against us people praying to our god it seems a new name is in order something like theologian at arms or battleman of peace soulman of siege when i was young the term army chaplain seemed oxymoronic for how could anyone serve god and country at once we the people who are the country require that when all other avenues have failed the wrath of our violence must descend upon our enemies with all the force our atoms and technology can muster this is necessary to keep our sidewalks safe from bullets and thermonuclear weapons all the while god demands unconditional love was i the only kid dragged into sunday services who paid enough attention to be confused so i sat in catholic church seething with teenage angst my hormones were in charge of my sex life i had to fill out a card so the country could snag me out of my school if it needed me to hurl bullets and here was a priest telling me week after week that the rules he d said were inviolable because they were the utterances of an omnipotent being were suspended when we got slugged on the playground it wasn t that i didn t want us to defend ourselves as far as i was concerned anyone who would come here to do violence should learn the why we stand behind our yag lasers when we re burning holes through brick walls but i figured religion should be left out of it to be consistent i thought we should admit war is the devil s work and some times the goddamned devil s work needed to be done and the priests should admit it turn away go home and pray while we hack some enemy flesh to mostly cooked hamburger but damn don t tell me god wants me to kill people after you spend a couple of years telling me to turn the other cheek and love my neighbor as myself god had nothing to do with that crap i thought they re jerking us around with circular logic i d say to my father just shut the hell up until you know what s going on was my father s stock answer to teleological questions that have puzzled mankind since neanderthal wondered if it was okay to eat the children if the mammoths went scarce one sunday i was dragged off to church and our usual priest father ennui wasn t there instead there was someone younger he d come up from fort monmouth to fill in for our apathetic pastor who had been taken away in an ambulance for reasons that concerned no one this priest was an army chaplain and when it came time for the holy thou art amens and we sat down for his sermon i was ready to hear what one of god s own riflemen had to say he told this story after he had been redeployed from vietnam he was attached to a unit doing humanitarian work in central america while he was there a hurricane blew through and wrecked a huge portion of costa rica many homes were destroyed and people killed he was assigned to a corps of engineers and physicians who assisted in the recovery one day while they were plodding through the heat and humidity helping to vaccinate children against water borne diseases and clearing destroyed buildings he and his team came across a grisly scene the force of a hurricane s winds can turn any inanimate object to a missile two by fours travelling at 300 kilometers per hour can penetrate solid concrete walls in this case a large palm frond had impaled a mother and child to the side of a wooden shed the 6 leaf had become a flying blade and had passed through the child and the mother s chest the tip had embedded in the wooden shed planks and it was strong enough to hold them up so the woman was still standing with her arms wrapped around her baby her eyes glaring listless at the horizon her clothes fell in tatters around her waist and shoulders her blood and viscera had mixed with those of her baby and hung like rags among them like weathered cloth it had been several days since the hurricane had ended and in the blistering heat and tropical bacteria the bodies had already begun to decompose so that the american team could smell the corpses and hear the flies before they saw them fatigued by the heat and long days one of the soldiers threw down his shovel and fell sitting to a pile of rubble beside the erect bodies what kind of sick motherfucker for a god does something like this the soldier asked then wiped the sweat from his forehead goddamned innocent mother and baby expletives mine not the priest s the chaplain stared for a moment said a prayer then got another soldier to help him take the bodies down they put them in a thick black plastic bag and loaded them onto a truck when it was finished the soldier who had been sitting stood and confronted the chaplain you didn t answer me he said nose to nose with the man of god what kind of god does something like that where s your god of mercy now yeah i ve lived through people killing each other but now it s plain even god doesn t want us why should i believe one goddamned thing you have to say from now on and the chaplain reached into his sweaty shirt and pulled out a small gold cross that was on a chain around his neck he asked the soldier if he knew what it was and even when the soldier answered the chaplain told him he didn t have the slightest idea what it was it was an icon of our world it was a symbol to remind us of a truth so terrible the only salvation could come from the glint of life each of us could muster he told the soldier what it meant and he told those of us listening in church that day what it meant and i had never heard more inspired words truly this man was a prophet for only a warrior would have been able to deliver that message only someone who had been to the depths of the human soul and emerged alive would have the guts to explain to an audience of middle class suburbanites the true message god had in store it was elegant in its purity its finality its unabashed viciousness and i adored that message the way i adored rock and roll and my girlfriend it was the only true thing i d ever heard in the halls of that building they called a church it was the only thing consistent with the entire body of knowledge the catholic schools tried to cram into my head and feed me on sundays when mass was over i broke away from my family the priest was standing next to one of the opened doors shaking the hands of patrons on their way out not many took his hand not even to be polite but i rushed him shook his hand and thanked him he could never know he d smoothed out a lifetime of ripples in my mind it all made perfect sense now i could be a part of this world because i understood as much of it as it did of me all we got is each other right that was the sermon that was great i said yes he said just each other i shall never forget the sadness in that man s eyes nor how he smiled when i told him i understood him it made sense to me but it didn t make sense to anyone else mother complained to my father about the abysmal sermon and how dare that alien priest bring such base terminology to a decent church my dad asked me what i had said to the priest and i told him an abridged version that basically it was the best sermon i d ever heard by anyone claiming to be part of the catholic church and my dad an ex soldier agreed with me against my mom s protestations they got rid of that priest the following week he was never invited back the church hq received so many complaints they were afraid the collection baskets would go empty for weeks maybe he knew what he had done maybe that s why he looked so sad or was it the weight of what he alone seemed to understand what a church load of parishioners eager to get into their cars to speed home would never want to hear a truth so horrible it tore into everything real it was a truth so wonderful my world came alive that day i left the church and never went back in my mind s eye i see the chaplain in his sweaty sleeveless green cotton shirt his crucifix chain intertwined with his steel dog tags around his wet skin he s holding the cross out toward his comrade in arms he tells him that cross is an icon of this place it s an icon of the earth a warning sign tacked up to the gates to strike fear into the hearts of the weak and the brave alike he says that none of us know what this place is but it sure as hell isn t heaven god himself couldn t survive here he was nailed to a tree and suffocated in his own blood what made any of us think we could possibly be worthy of better treatment and in light of the terrible inevitability of our personal terminus everything was laid bare except our souls and our beating hearts all of the bills and the arguments and the engine trouble and asshole bosses were meaningless we live continuously in the midst of the nuclear explosion of our own deaths in that hideous brilliant light there is only one thing brighter one thing true expect no mercy love each other take care of each other we have been given to each other in this place we are all we have

global supply chain woes are beginning to recede but shipping manufacturing and retail executives say that they don t expect a return to more normal operations until next year and that cargo will continue to be delayed if covid 19 outbreaks disrupt key distribution hubs in asia covid related factory closures energy shortages and port capacity limits have eased in recent weeks in the u s major retailers say they have imported most of what they need for the holidays ocean freight rates have retreated from record levels still executives and economists say strong consumer demand for goods in the west ongoing port congestion in the u s shortages of truck drivers and elevated global freight rates continue to hang over any recovery the risk of more extreme weather and flare ups of covid 19 cases can also threaten to clog up supply chains again an easing of supply chain choke points would allow production to move toward meeting strong demand and would lower logistics costs if sustained that in turn would help alleviate the upward pressure on inflation the number of ships waiting to unload at the ports of los angeles and long beach the biggest u s gateway for imports from asia has improved but is still hovering near record levels there were 71 container ships anchored offshore on nov 19 down from a peak of 86 three days before according to the marine exchange of southern california and 17 more were expected to arrive within three days before the pandemic it was unusual for any ships to anchor offshore shipping and retail executives say they expect the u s port backlogs to clear in early 2022 after the holiday shopping season and when lunar new year shuts many factories for a week in february slowing output german shipowner jan held said congestion particularly in asia is getting better his ships transport mainly industrial goods like giant windmills rather than containers but would sometimes spend a month waiting outside of asian ports christmas 2021 experts anticipate most expensive in decades as inflation supply chain crisis lingers mr held said it would be some time before the global transport system normalizes for that the pandemic has to end and that is not happening any time soon in my opinion said mr held co owner of held bereederungs gmbh co kg based in the north german city of haren trans pacific freight rates have cooled in recent weeks as most big u s retailers have imported what they need for the holiday season gradually opening up space on the front end of the trip the cost to move a container across the

year ago levels according to the freightos baltic index globally speaking the worst is behind us in terms of the supply chain problems said louis kuijs head of asia economics at oxford economics a survey by the research house among what it described as country experts covering 45 economies found that almost all believe supply chain disruptions have peaked or will peak in the last quarter of this year any hiccups such as a repeat of the temporary closure of china s ningbo zhoushan port in august due to a single covid 19 infection could send freight rates soaring again many big chains including walmart inc home depot inc and target corp said this past week they are well stocked for the holidays mainly because they imported goods earlier than usual this year some also chartered their own ships to get around bottlenecks few executives said their problems are over and in the most recent round of results global companies continued to cite issues at ports and roads around the

that many countries continue to grapple with other problems like shortages of workers there are certain aspects of supply chain shocks that are easing but the shortage issue isn t going to completely disappear she said in vietnam factory owners in the country s southern manufacturing hub said production is far smoother than it was several months ago but challenges remain including high shipping costs and labor shortages as many workers that had returned to their villages during the covid 19 wave have yet to return do xuan lap the head of vietnam s timber and forest products association said that the situation is improving and that medium size furniture factories with around 200 to 500 workers are operating at around 80 capacity but larger furniture makers with up to 3 000 workers were missing more laborers and operating at around 65 capacity in china a power crunch that hit the country s manufacturing hubs earlier this fall has eased in recent weeks after authorities allowed coal fired power plants to charge higher prices previously some plants were curbing power output oil prices too have pulled back after hitting their highest level since the 2014 energy bust manufacturing

investors are in the stock market to find growth returns and profits and the last year has brought plenty of that the s p 500 and nasdaq both finished last week at near record high the indexes are up 25 for the year the gains have not come easy stocks are gaining for now while the fed continues to hold interest rates low and inflation has jumped to a 30 year high cash is simply not a good investment as savings real yields are turning negative and rising prices are eating away at purchasing power even treasury bonds long considered a safe haven investment are only yielding 1 5 just one quarter of the annualized inflation rate this leaves stocks and especially those stocks with a growth oriented reputation or potential as the only game in town for investors seeking a strong upside we ve used the tipranks platform to look up two such stocks a look at their details along with commentary from the wall street analysts should tell why they are such compelling buys arcus biosciences rcus we ll look first at arcus a clinical stage biotech company developing new molecules to act in combination therapies in the treatment of cancer the company s drug candidates are immunotherapy

castrate resistant prostate cancer crpc and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma pdac arcus is pursuing several of these tracks in partnership with larger pharmaceutical companies collaborators include taiho which has an option to commercialize arcus products in japan and gilead with whom arcus announced a 10 year partnership beginning last year story continues that partnership with gilead has brought arcus its major recent catalyst the company s stock has been rising all year up 83 year to date on the strength of its research pipeline but last week it jumped over 20 when gilead announced that it was moving to exercise its development and commercialization rights on several of arcus experimental medications the announcement came 8 months earlier than expected and shows gilead s confidence in arcus pipeline arcus stands to receive option payments from gilead up to 725 million among the bulls is leerink analyst geoff porges who sees the gilead announcement as a substantial de risking event for rcus stock we had expected gilead to opt in to all three medicines by mid 2022 and instead they have moved earlier and more decisively to accelerate the development of all of them by year end assuming the opt in transactions close around the turn of the year gilead will assume financial and operational control of the development of the drugs rapidly and is likely to significantly expand the number of pivotal trials and the breadth of the combinations being explored we believe the announcement is further validation for rcus and their management team porges noted to this end
