nobel prize winning economist esther duflo sympathizes with students who have no interest in her field she was such a student herself until an undergraduate research post gave her the chance to learn first hand that economists address many of the major issues facing human and planetary well being most people have a wrong view of what economics is they just see economists on television discussing what s going to happen to the stock market says duflo the abdul latif jameel professor of poverty alleviation and development economics but what people do in the field is very broad economists grapple with the real world and with the complexity that goes with it that s why this year duflo has teamed up with professor abhijit banerjee to offer 14 009 economics and society s greatest problems a first year discovery subject a class type designed to give undergraduates a low pressure high impact way to explore a field in this case they are exploring the range of issues that economists engage with every day the economic dimensions of climate change international trade racism justice education poverty health care social preferences and economic growth are just a few of the topics the class covers we think it s pretty important that the first exposure to economics is via issues duflo says if you first get exposed to economics via models these models necessarily have to be very simplified and then students get the idea that economics is a simplistic view of the world that can t explain much arguably duflo and banerjee have been disproving that view throughout their careers in 2003 the pair founded mit s abdul latif jameel poverty action lab a leading antipoverty research network that provides scientific evidence on what methods actually work to alleviate poverty which enables governments and nongovernmental organizations to implement truly effective programs and social policies and in 2019 they won the nobel prize in economics together with michael kremer of the university of chicago for their innovative work applying laboratory style randomized controlled trials to research a wide range of topics implicated in global poverty super cool first year jean billa one of the students in 14 009 says economics isn t just about how money flows but about how people react to certain events that was an interesting discovery for me it s also precisely the lesson banerjee and duflo hoped students would take away from 14 009 a class that centers on weekly in person discussions of the professors recorded lectures many of which align with chapters in banerjee and duflo s book good economics for hard times public affairs 2019 classes typically start with a poll in which the roughly 100 enrolled students can register their views on that week s topic then students get to discuss the issue says senior dina atia teaching assistant for the class noting that she finds it super cool that nobelists are teaching mit s first year students atia points out that both duflo and banerjee have also made themselves available to chat with students after class they re definitely extending themselves she says we want the students to get excited about economics so they want to know more says banerjee the ford foundation international professor of economics because this is a field that can help us address some of the biggest problems society faces using natural experiments to test theories early in the term for example the topic was migration in the lecture duflo points out that migration policies are often impacted by the fear that unskilled migrants will overwhelm a region taking jobs from residents and demanding social services yet migrant flows in normal years represent just 3 percent of the world population there is no flood there is no vast movement of migrants she says duflo then explains that economists were able to learn a lot about migration thanks to a natural experiment the mariel boat lift this 1980 event brought roughly 125 000 unskilled cubans to florida over a matter a months enabling economists to study the impacts of a sudden wave of migration duflo says a look at real wages before and after the migration showed no significant impacts it was interesting to see that most theories about immigrants were not justified billa says that was a real life situation and the results showed that even a massive wave of immigration didn t change work in the city question assumptions find the facts in data since this is a broad survey course there is always more to unpack the goal faculty say is simply to help students understand the power of economics to explain and shape the world we are going so fast from topic to topic i don t expect them to retain all the information duflo says instead students are expected to gain an appreciation for a way of thinking economics is about questioning everything questioning assumptions you don t even know are assumptions and being sophisticated about looking at data to uncover the facts to add impact duflo says she and banerjee tie lessons to current events and dive more deeply into a few economic studies one class for example focused on the unequal burden the covid 19 pandemic has placed on different demographic groups and referenced research by harvard university professor marcella alsan who won a macarthur fellowship this fall for her work studying the impact of racism on health disparities duflo also revealed that at the beginning of the pandemic she suspected that mistrust of the health care system could prevent black americans from taking certain measures to protect themselves from the virus what she discovered when she researched the topic however was that political considerations outweighed racial influences as a predictor of behavior the lesson for you is it s good to question your assumptions she told the class students should ideally understand by the end of class why it s important to ask questions and what they can teach us about the effectiveness of policy and economic theory banerjee says we want people to discover the range of economics and to understand how economists look at problems story by mit shass communications editorial and design

the 105 million clawback that mcdonald s is getting from the severance paid to its ex ceo steve easterbook stands out for its massive size it is also notable for the fact that such efforts to recoup payouts or deny them in the first place to misbehaving corporate chiefs remain unusual despite the metoo era cbs several years ago refused to pay former ceo les moonves a 120 million severance that he claimed to be entitled to after finding he violated company policies the 105 million clawback that mcdonald s is getting from the severance paid to its ex ceo steve easterbook stands out for its massive size it s also notable for the fact that such efforts to recoup payouts from misbehaving corporate chiefs remain unusual despite the metoo era this type of outcome is rare said david larcker a stanford university business professor who co authored a 2016 paper titled scoundrels in the c suite which examined how corporate boards should respond to ceo misconduct but larcker added that such outcomes are becoming less rare as boards of directors see that a ceo s bad behavior such as easterbrook s inappropriate sexual relationships is going to have an impact on shareholders and customers and everything else related to a company get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters these are things that are going to have an impact on the bottom line and that s going to be serious he said larcker also said the prevalence of social media sharing information about allegations against executives is among other factors going to lead to a lot more pressure on companies to resist paying out ceos who are fired or pressured to resign because of misconduct easterbrook s settlement with mcdonald s which was announced thursday came two years after the fast food giant s board fired him on the heels of an investigation that found he had a consensual relationship with a subordinate that violated company policy despite getting the boot easterbrook also was handed a severance package valued at 42 million in august 2020 mcdonald s sued easterbrook seeking to recoup that payout claiming he lied and committed fraud after a whistleblower said he had a sexual relationship with an employee a subsequent probe allegedly revealed that easterbrook had destroyed information regarding his inappropriate behavior including three alleged additional sexual relationships with employees before his firing easterbrook fought the lawsuit before agreeing to the payback and apologizing in a statement thursday for failing at times to uphold mcdonald s values dieter waizenegger executive director of the soc investment group said the mcdonald s case is probably the third largest clawback we ve seen by a corporation for an individual it s probably the largest around sexual harassment said waizenegger his firm along with the new york city comptroller s office that it advises had called for mcdonald s chairman enrique hernandez jr to be replaced on the board because of the company s failure to conduct a probe in 2019 that would have uncovered the full extent of easterbook s conduct in recent years the biggest clawbacks involved ones against former wells fargo ceo john stumpf and carrie tolstedt who had led the company s community banking division the pair presided at a time when wells fargo employees created up to two million bank and credit card accounts without customers consent stumpf had to return 69 million while tolstedt surrendered 67 million scott mlyn cnbc before that in 2007 former unitedhealth group ceo william mcguire agreed to give up a total of 618 million to settle claims by company shareholders and the securities and exchange commission over the backdating of stock options waizenegger noted that wells fargo was able to claw back money from the former executives because then new york city comptroller john liu who was responsible for overseeing city pension fund investments in 2013 got the company to expand its clawback policy to include executives whose conduct caused reputational harm instead of only harm that led to a restatement of financial statements liu s successor comptroller scott stringer in 2016 successfully asked wells fargo to claw back payments to stumpf and tolstedt after wells fargo paid nearly 200 million to settle probes of the account scandal waizenegger said other companies should adopt such a policy to make it easier to recoup payouts to executives but he also said that corporate boards should take steps to get rid of what are effectively no fault severance agreements in ceo contracts which allow them to get paid in the first place even if they are fired or pressured to resign after violating a company s internal code of conduct you just need to stand your ground when you hire a new ceo there s going to be a zero tolerance provision that bars such payouts in the first place waizenegger said waizenegger said that it s taken the metoo movement and other scandals to say we need to take a much stiffer look at what we re willing to tolerate by a ceo the zero reward for code of conduct violations should just become the norm he said but waizenegge also called for a shakeup of the membership of corporate boards to get newer members and to replace directors who often have spent more than a decade in the positions i think you really basically have a glacial turnover rate in boards he said the metoo movement exploded in october 2017 when articles in the new york times and the new yorker detailed accusations by multiple women of sexual misconduct including claims of rape against hollywood movie producer harvey weinstein the articles were followed by a cascade of accusations of misconduct by hundreds of powerful men in business media entertainment and politics many of whom lost their jobs one of those men cbs ceo les moonves resigned in 2018 after being accused of sexual harassment and assault he denied the claims cbs s board later refused to pay moonves 120 million in severance that he claimed to be owed the board said in a statement at the time that with regard to mr moonves we have determined that there are grounds to terminate for cause including his willful and material misfeasance violation of company policies and breach of his employment contract as well as his willful failure to cooperate fully with the company s investigation moonves then filed an arbitration action seeking to get the money the dispute was settled earlier this year with an agreement that saw moonves drop his claim to the severance this month cnn president jeff zucker reportedly told employees that the cable news network will not pay the fired prime time anchor chris cuomo severance cuomo was fired after disclosure of documents that revealed he had been much more involved than previously known in counseling his brother then new york gov andrew cuomo when andrew was accused of sexually harassing multiple women the attorney debra katz has said she notified cnn shortly before it fired chris cuomo of an allegation that he had committed sexual misconduct against a client of katz chris cuomo s spokesman has denied the allegations additional reporting by cnbc s amelia lucas

leaving it to traders human or not to play silly buggers they have a think about it overnight and then respond on the following day on wednesday night the nasdaq responded to a doubling of the pace of tapering and fomc forecasts of three rate hikes next year by rallying 2 1 last night it fell over 3 at its low before closing down 2 5 in a wild session that had the dow up 260 in the morning and down 150 in the afternoon despite the dow s rollercoaster it was really all about tech which makes up the bulk of the nasdaq around 25 of the s p500 and impacts the dow via components apple and microsoft we might argue the reason tech rallied on the fed news was because all it did was bring the fed in line with market expectations that were months old buy the fact but given the likes of apple had already pressed on to ever new highs one could also argue the market had not priced in the impact of rate hikes on growth stocks at all the faamgs or if you prefer maamgs were all sold off last night by 2 4 but there were other extenuating circumstances last night the bank of england hiked its rate for the first time to 0 25 from 0 10 it had been threatening to do so for a while but was held back

strong earnings report but disappointing guidance and fell 10 this rather set the tone for the tech sector irrespective of monetary policy apple announced that given the ongoing chip shortage it would look at moving chip manufacturing in house it was goodnight for the high flying chip makers including sector leader nvidia the end result was quite a dichotomy between banks energy and materials which

following the house financial services committee hearing on cryptocurrency last week the senate banking committee held a related hearing to discuss the stablecoin market entitled stablecoins how do they work how are they used and what are their risks the senate banking committee had a single representative from a platform representing the industry dante disparte from circle other witnesses included alexis goldstein open markets institute jai massari davis polk wardwell and professor hilary allen american university washington college of law as has become almost routine republicans lean towards supporting fintech innovation and democrats mainly emphasize any potential risk that may impact consumers to open the hearing senator sharrod brown chairman of the committee said we must protect consumers and the economy from stablecoin risks in prepared remarks senator brown said we ve been told that blockchain the technology these coins are built on will democratize money or build a more inclusive economy but none of those promises have materialized and likely never will instead we ve gotten wild financial speculation pointing a finger directly at stablecoins senator brown said that if you put your money in stablecoins there is no guarantee you will ever get it back many of these companies hide their terms and conditions in the fine print allowing them to trap customers money and if there s no guarantee you ll get your money back that s not a currency with a fixed value it s gambling and with this much money tied up it sure looks to me like a potential asset bubble stablecoins make it easier than ever to risk real dollars on cryptocurrencies that are at best volatile and at worst outright fraudulent just a few weeks ago we saw how quickly these tokens can crash with crypto markets diving by almost thirty percent in one day history tells us we should be very concerned when any investment becomes so untethered from reality look at the 1929 stock market crash senator pat toomey the ranking republican on the committee announced that congress should not stifle innovation nor undermine us competitiveness when it comes to stablecoin development senator toomey said stablecoins can speed up payments especially cross border transfers reduce costs including remittances and help combat money laundering and terrorist financing through an immutable and transparent transaction record stablecoins can also be programmed and made interoperable with other currencies creating efficiencies to improve access to financial services for more americans professor hilary allen provided several options regarding the emerging stablecoin market including an outright ban on these digital assets in prepared remarks professor allen stated given stablecoins inherent fragility limited utility outside of the defi ecosystem and potential to cannibalize monetary policy congress should consider whether banning stablecoins is appropriate a somewhat less draconian approach would be stricter regulation and blocking private firms like meta facebook from issuing stablecoins jai massari noted that stablecoins are largely regulated at the state level today but acknowledged there may be an expanded role for the federal government to provide oversight this could include an optional federal charter for stablecoin issuers that would preempt the need for state by state licensing in return for supervision by federal regulators a new and well designed federal charter could accommodate a business model premised on the issuance of stablecoins fully backed by short term liquid assets and the provision of related payments services this charter could impose requirements for reserve asset composition while tailoring leverage ratios or risk based capital requirements and other requirements to the nature of the business model and it could restrict the stablecoin issuer from engaging in riskier activities to minimize other claims on reserve assets this option would likely be welcomed by many stablecoin issuers even though it would entail comprehensive federal oversight massari believes that stablecoins in fact can boost the strength of the dollar as its standing as a reserve currency similar to other global payment instruments alexis goldstein testified there are many investor national security and usability concerns with both algorithmic and asset backed stablecoins congress should continue to examine if there are regulatory gaps that require new legislation to ensure consumer and investor protection as it relates to stablecoins and regulators should continue to monitor stablecoins and ensure compliance with existing laws dante disparte advised emerging policy and regulation for the future growth of stablecoins and the digital

senator elizabeth warren went straight after tether who lacked a representative at the hearing if i wanted to trade my 10 worth of these tokens am i guaranteed to get my ten dollars back asked warren no goldstein explained if tether s tokens were actually backed 1 to 1 it would be one of the largest banks in the country warren said that tether was only backed by 10 of us dollars and the rest is something else we know that stablecoins are not always stable warren said predicting they will take a nosedive at some point when a run on the bank occurs defi is the most dangerous part of the crypto world warren added it should be clear by now that congress will soon add more stringent federal regulation in regards to stablecoin issuers and how they manage their reserves this may be sufficient

opinion our national debt today stands at a staggering 29 trillion every dime of this debt is money that has been borrowed and already spent to make life better easier or more luxurious at some point in the past sometimes this money was spent for the benefit of americans but very often this long gone money was spent for the benefit of people living in far flung places around the world no american child alive today will live to see this debt paid off they will be in debt paying off the spoils of their parents enjoyment for the rest of their lives and they will never get to take part in the luxury and treasure of the debt they inherited twenty nine trillion dollars in debt is a generational monument to greed theft hubris and stupidity egyptian pharaohs had their pyramids low slow and slothful american politicians leave behind a mountain of debt and just when our financial future could not look any bleaker democrats in washington swoop into action again on wednesday congress voted almost exclusively along party lines to take out yet another credit card in the name of america s future children democrats approved borrowing another 2 5 trillion that they will never ever pay off president biden and democrats happily signed away your children s future with this new line of credit and then breathed a sigh of relief because they avoided an uncomfortable political pickle and it wasn t just democrats who were thrilled so was wall street by the end of the day wednesday the stock market roared the dow jumped 380 points and the nasdaq spiked more than 2 perhaps it is unfair to blame mr biden entirely for this current debt to be sure he is not the only political criminal responsible but it is worth remembering a few dates in recent history when mr biden became vice president of the united states under former president barack obama our national debt stood at 11 trillion by the time he left office eight years later the debt had reached 20 trillion and no politician has been lying around washington longer than joe biden as this avalanche of debt has accumulated when he first joined the united states senate in 1972 the national debt was less than half a trillion to be sure wall street is popping champagne over more than just america s new credit card taken out in your grandchild s name sleazy debt merchants are also tickled by the federal reserve s recent political maneuverings promising to squeeze down on all the stimulus that government politicians have flooded into the economy with bad debt and printed money it turns out as federal reserve chairman jerome powell admitted recently inflation is not so transitory after all in fact the government now admits that inflation has reached levels not seen in nearly a half century and that is only because the government cooks the books on inflation real actual inflation is higher than it has ever been in the history of the u s dollar all because of massive government spending billed to your children while all the goons from the fed to the ranks of the republican party are to blame nobody deserves more blame than mr biden and the present crop of kleptocrats in the democrat party black lives matter open borders brutal taxes defunding the police and teaching hate in public schools are all prominent planks of today s democrat party but nothing mr biden embraces is more immediately damaging to the poor people particularly the working poor than this unbridled campaign of stagflation that he leads when everyone gets poorer and poorer the already poor pay the harshest price inflation does not see skin color or gender or political persuasion yet today democrats in congress want to pile trillions more in spending and savage debt upon an already staggered people inflation is the civil rights issue of our day mr biden and his democrats will pay the political price charles hurt is the opinion editor at the washington times
bloomberg lp has launched a u s municipal impact index designed to track municipal bonds categorized under green social and sustainability the index which went live monday currently tracks over 2 800 securities and is the first such standardized measure of the u s municipal tax exempt investment grade impact bond market the index is derived from bloomberg index services limited s flagship municipal index and uses bloomberg s data and its municipal data analysts research to individually vet and categorize as green social or sustainability municipal bonds a core principle of bloomberg s sustainability initiatives is to incentivize disclosure and help establish standards and frameworks that will create a foundation of trustworthy information on sustainability said nick gendron global head of fixed income index product for inclusion in the index a bond must either be self labeled as green social or sustainability directly from an initial offering reviewed by independent assurance providers or use 100 of proceeds for a project in line with the international capital market association icma principles investor demand for municipal impact bonds has been growing and its market value has more than doubled in the last three years but participants have lacked a standard reference point for esg adherent securities said nick gendron global head of fixed income index product at bloomberg bloomberg in february 2020 debuted a green leaf icon next to certain bonds on its terminal designating them as green this includes clean water renewable energy wind solar geothermal green building construction and other related projects although some of these bonds have not self designated or had a third party verification bloomberg doesn t evaluate for sustainability so we will only utilize either the issuer or 3rd party verification gendron told the bond buyer for green we do a review based on bloomberg s own scores to date we haven t had a case where we disagree with the issuer but we would still display as issuer labeled as per our index methodology they currently add the third party verifier in the text notes of the des or bond description function on the terminal as an involved party similar to how they show the underwriter bond council trustee and others a core principle of bloomberg s sustainability initiatives and its product development strategy is to incentivize disclosure and help establish standards and frameworks that will create a foundation of trustworthy information on sustainability gendron said for example bloomberg esg scores and bloomberg index services limited methodologies are all fully transparent and available on our website or the bloomberg terminal while esg investment considerations have grown around the globe the u s municipal securities market is just beginning to delve into the space in varying degrees and there is no universally accepted definition of esg according to refinitiv mmd data 36 60 billion of esg bonds have been issued this year as of nov 30 that surpasses the 16 621 billion issued in all of 2020 compared to annual municipal issuance 484 billion total in 2020 and currently at 466 610 billion through thursday the figures are small but growing with esg representing 3 4 of annual municipal issuance in 2020 but 11 68 year to date 2021 refinitiv data shows according to the climate bonds initiative a nonprofit that certifies green bonds and whose standards and criteria many issuers use for verifying their deals u s green bond issuance increased by almost a factor of five from 12 8 billion in 2015 to 61 5 billion in 2020 cbi does not have its final figures for 2021 but sean kidney chief executive officer of cbi expects at least 50 growth in 2022 over this year s numbers we ve seen strong growth for green muni bonds capped off by california s 464 million certified climate bond from the state public works board kidney said the broader esg bonds issuance market is growing as well in europe in november 40 of all bonds issued were green or esg the u s is heading in that direction bloomberg joins others in providing data and analytics with the rise of sustainable investing as more investors have become focused on incorporating esg data into their investment research and decision making processes in november intercontinental exchange expanded its reference data coverage to include two million fixed income instruments including municipals in an effort to provide greater transparency for users to understand esg risks and opportunities cusip global services in october announced the addition of esg data attributes for corporate and municipal bonds in its data feed and desktop products in october the municipal securities rulemaking board launched a feature on its electronic municipal market access site that indicates if an upcoming municipal security new issue is either self designated or certified as meeting certain esg criteria the government finance officers association in october released best practices for esg for the issuer community while calls for greater equity and inclusion have prompted some of the largest investment firms on wall street to prioritize esg concerns when working on municipal bond deals with state and local governments kestrel verifiers an approved verifier accredited by the climate bonds initiative verifies bonds that meet the icma or the cbi standards and criteria sustainalytics provides green designations as well build america mutual also has a green designation for insuring bonds and nasdaq in late 2019 introduced a sustainable bond network a global online platform designed to improve transparency in the market for green social and sustainability bonds there is demand for all of this data a bond buyer report released in october noted that more than half of respondents 56 rate esg as important to the municipal industry with the greatest importance placed on the environmental aspect at 73 followed by governance at 60 and social at 50 a large majority 77 of respondents believe there should be a universal language for esg in the municipal space in terms of pricing benefits one of the key metrics about which issuers care most gendron said they have not seen specific price adjustments due to the green social or sustainability labels at this time but certainly recognize there is potential as the market grows and we will continue to monitor this space from an overall performance standpoint although the compositions of this impact index vs the overall market are quite different this impact market has had annual returns of 8 03 5 42 and 1 57 in 2019 2020 and 2021 ytd through end of november vs returns of 7 53 5 21 and 1 35 for the overall non taxable muni index over the same timeframes he said for almost a year now refinitiv mmd has been putting out a monthly report on esg peter franks senior market analyst at refinitiv said to date we have not seen any significant value difference between an esg bond or comparative non esg bond it may happen at some point but for now our research shows no difference gendron said the company believes the index will hold broad appeal for both exchange traded fund product creation and traditional benchmarking while also providing a useful tool for in depth research of this growing segment of the municipal bond market the index was launched with history calculated back to jan 1 2019 eligible bonds within the index are required to have principal and interest denominated in usd at least one year until final maturity and hold an investment grade rating only fully tax exempt issues are included and rebalancing will occur on a monthly basis bloomberg clients can access the index using the ticker i36676us index
there was a time long ago when gargantuan tour buses splashed with pink and stock images of girlfriends sipping on cocktails roved the isle of manhattan they transported women mostly huddled masses from across the middle america all yearning to breathe free and drink a cosmopolitan cocktail at the same bars frequented by carrie miranda samantha and charlotte the characters of hbo s sex and the city but much like the once ubiquitous going out top such tours have become a rare albeit ongoing sight many of the restaurants featured on the original show which ran from 1998 to 2004 and somehow never addressed 9 11 have long been closed the women s favorite hangout coffee shop in union square closed in 2018 and has been replaced by a chase bank city bakery where carrie re encounters the face girl nina katz has also permanently closed its doors denying the city its top rate chocolate chip cookies the new york we enter in and just like that the sex and the city reboot on hbo max is not the new york we left in 2004 we ve experienced hurricanes market crashes and a deadly pandemic that we re still contending with the lavish lifestyle demonstrated by the series main ladies has taken on a grotesqueness especially following the trump presidency which further laid bare the inequities inherent in capitalism bisexuality can no longer be written off as carrie once did as a layover to gaytown but still there are bars and restaurants bars and restaurants on the brink of doom sure but they re hanging on all the same no pandemic or death of a loved one by peleton for the best it seems will stop carrie miranda and charlotte sans samantha as actor kim cattrall who declined to return to the series due to friction with lead and executive producer sarah jessica parker from dining across the city want to pretend like it s 2004 again well throw on some low rise jeans and manolos and hit the town masked and boosted or better yet maybe just in your imagination here we ll be charting every restaurant bar and cafe that makes a featured appearance on and just like that for your touring convenience obviously there will be some spoilers episode one hello it s me this premiere was obviously dominated by one major controversy which has little to do with food and that s carrie not attempting cpr or calling 911 as big flopped around on the floor of their gigantic shower and died clee a k a the whitney cafe 99 gansevoort street but before that there are some restaurants in fact we re reintroduced to carrie miranda and charlotte as they wait for a table at clee a fictional restaurant that was filmed in non fictional restaurant the whitney cafe part of the whitney museum the real star of this meal is carrie s stupid little robin hood hat which she is not pulling off nearly as well as that sexy cartoon fox also great news in this alternate reality covid is over how nice for them their fellow patrons and the staff of clee smith s bar and grill 701 8th avenue before her first class at columbia where she s enrolled to get her master s degree in human rights miranda stops for a drink at this theater district mainstay and while she s there we re introduced to an exciting new character miranda s alcoholism she tries to order a glass of chablis at 10 45 a m which yes is pretty early for wine but more concerning is why she d stop at a bar on 8th and west 44th street which is nowhere near her townhouse in brooklyn or columbia university which is all the way up on west 114th street in manhattan there are plenty of bars to get lost in and most of them fortunately are not next to times square episode two little black dress this episode is mostly taken up by big s ugly and sparse funeral at the greene naftali gallery and not so much on the streets of new york city which as everyone knows is the show s other leading lady carrie does however stare wistfully at a couple eating on the patio of the east pole located on the upper east side the couple remind her of her and big because the woman is blonde and the man has dark hair and is wearing an expensive suit understandably this makes grieving carrie sad but she shouldn t be as far as she knows that guy works for the blackstone group or makes his money developing property that displaces poor people maybe big did that too anyway lunch looked nice and we ll be revisiting the east pole later episode three when in rome did you know that even charlotte s best friend anthony got into sourdough during the pandemic only he turned it into a bustling business called hot fellas did the writers even try on this one where the bread is delivered by hot fellas this scene is largely marked by anthony s dismissal of charlotte s child s trans identity stating that kids are confused and charlotte should ignore it good to know that in addition to making bread he s up to date on jesse singal s substack anyway i will not be ordering my bread from hot fellas in the future the east pole 133 east 65th street i had to send a lot of screenshots of this dining room where charlotte miranda carrie and stanford gathered for lunch in order to identify the restaurant even though as noted above the show has already visited the exterior thankfully eater ny s bao ong came to my rescue even providing the following instagram from the restaurant more fun than the restaurant itself though is stanford played by the late willie garson telling charlotte that he used to work at the iconic tribeca bistro odeon and that s how he knows a three top can always become a four top many servers will disagree starbucks 72 spring street charlotte miranda and miranda s many bottles of airport cart tito s wait for carrie at this starbucks in soho right across the street from balthazar once featured in sex and the city under the name balzac in a tv series full of necessary belief suspension this one will put you over the edge because that starbucks location has never had less than 700 people stuffed into it at one time and that s an official statistic also the barista brings miranda a muffin to her table and it s even on a plate in real life the overworked barista would have shouted morganda and hurled it at her from the register chalait uws 461 amsterdam avenue it s at chalait a cafe specializing in matcha drinks that carrie is finally able to corner big s ex wife natasha by accidentally walking in on her while she s trying to take a piss in peace but with the door puzzlingly unlocked what s unbelievable here is that there s a new york coffee shop where you don t need a special code or key to get into the bathroom in the fumble to close the door carrie spills hot coffee and burns herself so maybe chalait is actually good the bar at webster hall 125 east 11 street carrie charlotte and miranda go to see carrie s colleague che diaz sara ramirez shoot their standup special at venue webster hall afterward miranda her sexuality re awakened by che s wit sticks around for the afterparty che not disinterested shotguns a mouthful of weed vape into miranda s mouth deblasio s new york baby episode four some of my best friends cafe kitsuné 550 hudson street and parliament espresso and coffee bar 170 central park west this episode begins with everyone in new york city indulging in their favorite coffees and while carrie dressed in a petticoat and striped crewneck a return to her old self chooses a dark roast with no sugar from her corner store charlotte is ordering lattes at cafe kitsuné to share with new friend lisa todd wexley nicole ari parker meanwhile ltw as she s known is ordering charlotte a coffee at parliament espresso and coffee bar revisited again later in the episode which is inside the new york historical society the women exchange their javas in front of their kids school the exterior of which is actually the city museum of new york on 5th avenue right across the street from central park fun ish fact the city museum is also used as the exterior of the school in gossip girl in reality cafe kitsuné is in the west village right around the corner from the shooting location of carrie s brownstone and nowhere near the upper east side where charlotte and her family lives similarly inconvenient is the distance between parliament espresso and the city museum of new york these details are not to nitpick the show which can rearrange locations as it sees fit rather it s to help you maximize your inevitable and just like that walking tour sant ambroeus 1000 madison avenue i struggled to identify this location where carrie miranda and charlotte have brunch and discuss carrie s plans to sell the apartment she shared with big thankfully karli mullane who runs the instagram account celeb map reached out over email to tell me she had identified it as the upper east side location of sant ambroeus a milanese inspired restaurant and wine bar funny because carrie soon shares a cocktail with her realtor at sant ambroeus 265 lafayette street having befriended the outgoing samantha esque seema patel sarita choudhury carrie joins her at the soho location of sant ambroeus which is in real life a great place to spot models actors and the paparazzi who follow them sarah jessica parker is a regular here the fast friends decide to split the cacio e pepe even after carrie rudely gives kudos to seema for continuing to put yourself out there on dating apps luckily pasta heals all wounds boutros 185 atlantic avenue brooklyn miranda meets up with her professor dr nya wallace karen pittman at a very trendy looking dark restaurant with a vertical garden behind the bar and rustic lighting made from thick rope and edison bulbs i couldn t figure out where it was but i put it to the good readers of eater and one delivered in a big way thanks to elisa zuritsky a frequent peruser of eater and freakin executive producer writer on and just like that we now know it s boutros a middle eastern and new american restaurant in brooklyn heights conveniently located near miranda s brownstone i hope dr wallace either a picked the location or b lives around there too because that s a long trek from columbia they already share a train stop though so my guess is it s a location of mutual convenience episode five tragically hip there was plenty of action in the kitchen that s right i m talkin sex during the fifth episode of and just like that but only one scene in a restaurant freehold 45 s 3rd st brooklyn freehold is a cafe bar events space and workspace in williamsburg brooklyn it is also where charlotte miranda carrie and anthony have brunch after carrie learns she needs hip surgery later in the episode carrie pees in an empty snapple bottle not a restaurant scene but it does feel worth mentioning episode six diwali joe coffee company multiple locations throughout new york city when miranda is fantasizing about having sex with che diaz oh yeah yeah i get that even charlotte admits she s having a leisurely coffee with her professor cum friend but not like cum friend as we must clarify for shows like this dr nya wallace the pair walk through the park carrying cups of joe from the nyc coffee chain joe coffee company there s a location conveniently located at columbia university though it s been temporary closed probably because of the pandemic which in the world of and just like that has all but disappeared good for them bistrot leo 60 thompson street another big thank you to karli mullane of celeb map who tipped us off to the location of the brunch spot bistrot leo where carrie tells miranda and charlotte that she sold the apartment she shared with big and bought a downtown apartment that looks like an apple store instead and she doesn t even like the new apartment money like these picked at meals in beautiful spaces is wasted on the rich le crocodile 80 wythe avenue brooklyn nya has bonded with miranda thanks to her own uncertainty about motherhood and miranda s no bullshit approach to the subject unfortunately miranda can t help her when nya and her husband meet up with another couple who are expecting their third baby for dinner at le crocodile a restaurant inside the wythe hotel in williamsburg brooklyn fun little bit of history while in the show nya mentions that the restaurant was once a shoe factory the actual wythe was built in 1901 as cooperage or barrel factory episode seven sex and the widow mcglorick park russell street nassau ave brooklyn miranda runs into nya and her hot husband at a greenmarket at mcglorick park in the greenpoint neighborhood of brooklyn don t rush out now it s a seasonal farmers market that doesn t pick up again until spring still the park is beautiful and you can always stop at the nearby outpost for variety coffee which has gone from a singular coffee shop that opened in williamsburg in 2009 to a citywide chain that has now appeared on to go cup branding at least multiple times in and just like that allow me one moment of sentimentality i used to sit at the original variety in 2009 and 2010 as an unemployed person sending out resumes and freelance pitches to anywhere i could think of i lusted after their hot baristas got their coffee on the way to the train when i was a desperately hungover after a night of being a 24 year old idiot and became friendly acquaintances with the fellow regular who d come in to watch wrestling on his laptop all day and just like that my lil roastery is all grown up and starring on hbo i could cry quality bistro 120 west 55th street the women now including seema because a three top throws off the entire balance of a table and a scene meet for dinner at jewel toned pre pandemic hot spot quality bistro the restaurant with its arched green lit bar look like a restaurant you d find in the emerald city of oz s arts district which is to say very pretty after turning in her book on widowhood carrie s publisher suggests she go on one date for the purpose of writing an epilogue that would make her readership which craves fun and frivolity over grief and husbands killed via peleton hopeful that she might find love again little does she know that seema bored because of a real estate slump has already been busy making a variety of online dating profiles for her you listed me carrie quips a classic bradshaw bon mot au cheval 33 cortlandt alley carrie ends up going on first date at high end burger outpost au cheval once described as a meaty retrograde misfire by eater ny critic ryan sutton with a math teacher from the school charlotte s daughters attend the date starts out kind of nice similar to carrie this is his first date since losing his spouse and the widow and widower decide to get blotto because life is short this too ends up being a meaty misfire as it ends with them both blowing chunks on the street outside the restaurant now we re talking the next morning carrie considers the date a total misfire hope be damned but the math teacher isn t so easily deterred by acts of public vomiting he ends up bidding 1 050 for a date with carrie during a school benefit auction and carrie ends up being kind of happy about it it s the hopeful epilogue she needs to make it into oprah s bookclub more hopeful to me however is that a math teacher even a private school math teacher could afford to bid a full grand to save the pride of the woman he barfed on episode eight bewitched bothered and bewildered this episode begins at a pride rally in foley square in lower manhattan from a dais che does some comedy about being true to oneself then shouts out our lgbtq allies who are not so much interspersed with the crowd as they are corralled in one area from the queer section miranda spots her son brady standing in the ally holding area and makes a run for it because she s not out to him yet nor has she told his father that she wants a divorce to smooth things over for bailing on che s act she returns with iced coffees from her standby joe coffee company but it doesn t do the trick che finds out that miranda has been using them to cheat on her husband steve and as a devotee of honesty ends things welp looks like miranda should ve brought coffees from one of the nearby and superior australian cafes like bluestone lane or black fox or told che that she left because their comedy is unbearable either option would ve left things less bitter the lobster place 75 9th avenue new york carrie charlotte and miranda meet for a meal at the lobster place located inside the chelsea market while there miranda tells her friends that she s going to ask her husband for a divorce so she can live a more honest life with che if they ll have her charlotte then shares that her daughter lily now 15 was left emotionally and physically bruised after charlotte slammed a door in her face because she walked in on her and husband harry having oral sex carrie and miranda are more shaken that charlotte is still giving bjs in her 50s anyway there s always great conversations to be had over lobster rolls fat witch bakery 75 9th avenue new york after all that blowjob talk carrie and miranda go to the chelsea market bakery fat witch so carrie can buy her cool young jewelry designing downstairs neighbor lisette katerina tannenbaum some brownies while there she encourages miranda to buy steve some brownies too because it will make the divorce news slightly sweeter that s not going to help carrie if anything steve will be turned off expensive luxury brownies for life la grande boucherie 145 w 53rd street new york charlotte takes lily out to lunch at this airy parisian style brasserie so that they can have a mature conversation on what lily walked in and why charlotte freaked out the way that she did unfortunately the meal is interrupted before lily can take a sip of her damn iced tea because charlotte learns about her daughter s finsta account where she s recently posted a photo of herself posing sexily in workout gear charlotte panics thinking her daughter is already beyond her guidance with regards to sexuality and lily walks out but it all turns out okay after some time at auntie carrie s lily confides in charlotte that she was just experimenting with expressing herself on a private instagram account that s only followed by her best girlfriends and someone s younger brother named connor maybe they can return to la grande boucherie for the rest of their lunch soon i ll note that seema is again seen eating at sant ambroeus during this episode but beyond this mention i refuse to write about that restaurant in this space ever again episode 9 no strings attached lafayette grande cafe and bakery 380 lafayette street the penultimate and just like that episode begins in a cozy brown leather corner booth at lafayette grande cafe and bakery in the bowery near astor place a beautiful neighborhood with brick streets fancy shops and luxury hotels until recently it was also the location of manhattan s last remaining kmart which you could enter directly from the subway which along with the store s mostly unstocked shelves really led to that fifth circle of hell vibe that makes new york city feel like home at the restaurant charlotte reveals that she s officially in menopause a plot point that would ve merited an entire episode in the halcyon sex and the city days as my viewing buddy joanna rothkopf pointed out it s also over this brunch that miranda asks her friends to come help with a volunteer project at a women s shelter in greenpoint brooklyn when carrie no fan of manual labor offers a donation instead miranda replies you can t be the white lady who just writes a check if i can paint you can paint disagree miranda carrie is the exact type who should just write a check because she will and does get in the way it takes her all day to paint one room and most of her time in the shelter is spent ruining her beautiful highly impractical high heels and dissolving into histrionics when she accidentally drops her dead husband s wedding ring again why wear it while painting down the drain had i been supervising that women s shelter i would ve much preferred the money empire diner 210 10th avenue miranda and che share a meal at this chic renovated railcar diner that you can find under the high line in chelsea it s here that che encounters some fans sorry don t believe it and miranda boldly identifies herself as che s girlfriend no friend to traditional relationships che s not having it a great time to move on from this character and the maniac miranda has become but no che ck please dante west village 551 hudson street initially deciding to give the math teacher who barfed at au cheval a second chance carrie meets him again in front of the west village location of dante a very trendy cocktail lounge and restaurant they don t make it past the door though because carrie has only arrived dressed to the nines in order to tell him she s not actually ready to date again and wanted to tell him in person call him on the phone carrie this poor man on a teacher s salary took a yellow cab to see you and now you re plopping him right back in one with no offer to cover the fare also have these two considered the insane concept of friendship seems like a recent widow and widower could provide a lot of support for each other in a way that doesn t involve mashing face or other body parts have a negroni talk about your lives or just keep having unromantic dates that end with awkward kisses what the hell do i care veniero s pasticcheria caffé 342 e 11th street miranda makes a fool of herself yet again by surprising che with cookies from the italian bakery veniero s an east village institution which has been open since late 1800s isn t that incredible even more incredible is none of che s neighbors yelling at the couple to shut the hell up as they have the loudest conversation about commitment and taking things slowly in the middle of the dang stairwell when the caterers bail for nya s volunteer event the one where they re spending hours painting a single room of a women s shelter charlotte s friend lisa todd wexley steps up by calling in a herd of food trucks from various beloved restaurants there s a truck for tacos el bronco a mexican restaurant with a brick and mortar at 4324 4th avenue in brooklyn makina cafe an ethiopian eritrean eatery located at 36 47 30th street in queens and roberta s the pioneering bushwick wood oven pizza restaurant dined at at least once by beyoncé located at 261 moore street in brooklyn but now with other locations across the city note i ve been unable to identify the meal seema and carrie share for seema s birthday is it even real so if you happened to recognize the brightly colored space let me know at madeleine eater com i did however immediately identify seema s hot new boyfriend zed as tony the prada guy from the season six episode of sex and the city lights camera relationship episode 10 seeing the light first of all i want to end this journey with a big thank you to celebmap s karli mullane who s been a huge help and fun unexpected partner in id ing these many restaurants it s thanks to her that i didn t spend hours trying to figure out where carrie miranda and charlotte are eating at the beginning of the and just like that finale because guess what it s an event space designed to look like a restaurant the magic of production design her name was carmen 527 broome street miranda goes to meet che s family at this latin american restaurant in soho and is surprised when che gets up on stage to perform a rendition of the beach boy s california girls they make it clear though that they re actually doing the van halen version this is their way of telling all their friends that they re moving to california to produce a pilot a surprise even to miranda may i clarify something i actually really like the actor sara ramirez i don t recognize myself in che they recently told the new york times thank god but this scene actually murdered me with second hand embarrassment i m a ghost now like big only instead of haunting a lamp on carrie s bookshelf i m forced to write and re write this blog for eternity perry street 176 perry street carrie meets big s brother richard at this jean gorges restaurant off the west side highway in greenwich village over this four dollar sign lunch richard asks what s going on with big s ashes and suggests carrie inters them at the family crypt in connecticut where one day if she s interested there d be room for her to join him le cafe de l epoque 2 rue du bouloi paris france in a dream carrie sees herself in paris sitting in front of this brasserie in the 1st arrondissement of paris which is but a brief stroll from the louvre and domaine national du palais royal this we can presume is where big should have reappeared had all traces of chris noth not been erased from the show following multiple accusations of sexual assault against the actor in fact they even erased any mention of him from and just like that the documentary the surprisingly delightful end point to this ellipses of a series turns out however that the real drama of the paris restaurant scene centered around a hat that was beloved by sarah jessica parker and costume designer molly rogers but axed from the scene by showrunner michael patrick king rogers even wrote an angry poem about it anyway it s in this dream that carrie realizes she wants to bring big s ashes to paris the city where they reunited for good but also where she got slapped by

minimum wage is not enough a true living wage is necessary to reduce poverty and improve health 2021 overview the federal minimum wage has remained stagnant at 7 25 per hour for the past 12 years while the u s minimum wage was never truly a living wage over time it has done less to reflect the true value of workers and no longer supports families in a way that promotes health and keeps them out of poverty employees working full time at minimum wage cannot afford basic necessities such as food housing transportation childcare and healthcare in any location across the country recent calls to raise the federal minimum wage to 15 per hour are necessary and well intentioned however even that amount is inadequate to truly support working families a true living wage that supports a basic standard of living without food and housing insecurity would be between 20 and 26 or more per hour depending on the state additionally it would need to adjust regularly to keep pace with inflation and cost of living increases with the covid 19 pandemic laying bare the dire economic situation for many of america s essential low wage workers now is the time to increase the federal minimum wage to meet the true cost of living background the federal minimum wage was created by congress in 1938 as part of the fair labor standards act which also included federal guidance on overtime pay and child labor regulations the minimum wage is the lowest amount an employer may pay a worker for an hour of work with the exception of tipped wage workers who may receive a subminimum wage as long as their wages with tips amount to at least the mandated minimum wage per hour congress created the minimum wage to protect workers specifically lower level workers with less bargaining power create a minimum standard of living and stabilize the economy following the great depression though often considered the baseline of livable wages it is important to note that even when it was first created it did not represent a true living wage in 1938 the federal minimum wage was set at 25 cents per hour and rose periodically over the following 71 years in 2009 it increased to 7 25 per hour and remained at this level for more than 12 years in the past two years 27 states and a number of cities passed legislation raising the minimum wage in those locations to exceed the federal mandate in 2021 20 remain at or below the federal minimum wage only 6 states mandate a wage at or above 12 50 per hour but no state reached 15 per hour or higher yet a number of cities and counties including washington d c seattle and numerous california cities counties set recent minimums for all employees that meet or exceed 15 per hour with current legislation by 2026 just 10 states will be at or above 15 per hour currently 42 percent of all u s workers make less than 15 dollars per hour as of 2019 39 million workers made 15 or less per hour almost 30 percent of the workforce the raise the wage act of 2021 was introduced in the u s senate and proposed to raise the federal minimum wage incrementally each year starting in june 2021 until it reached 15 per hour federally in 2025 a similar act was proposed in each

wage workers are significantly less likely to receive benefits such as health insurance sick leave fair scheduling paid family leave and others provided to higher wage employees because many employers hire low wage workers in part time roles they are not required by the affordable care act to offer health insurance this means low wage employees must pay extra for insurance from low wages go uninsured work sick and avoid taking time off for mental and physical health 10 15 home nurses home care workers cooks and restaurant servers were uninsured at rates significantly higher than the 9

the same period this is only possible by keeping worker compensation low to increase profits by paying minimum wage companies like walmart and many fast food chains are making the government and by extension taxpayers subsidize their payroll while they take home millions in profits many employees must depend on public benefits like snap and medicaid paid for with tax dollars mcdonald s and walmart ranked in the top four employers in all included states for number of full time workers utilizing federal safety net programs they employ thousands of staff who despite working full time hours still made so little that they met income eligibility requirements for snap and medicaid minimum wage vs living wage living wage or subsistence wage is a measure of basic needs that draws on geographically specific data related to a family s likely minimum costs for food childcare health insurance housing transportation and other basic necessities it determines the minimum employment earnings necessary to meet basic needs while also maintaining financial self sufficiency taking into account income and payroll taxes living wage is the minimum income standard that draws a very fine line between financial independence and the need to seek out public assistance or suffer consistent and severe housing and food insecurity living wage unlike minimum wage factors in cost of living which may vary by location the range in the u s varies widely for example the most expensive places to live are hawaii and washington d c where one would need to make 38 57 per hour and 39 41 respectively to meet the basic necessities as an adult with one child two states that have the lowest cost of living are south dakota and mississippi where one would still need to make 27 06 and 26 74 to meet basic needs further in many places 15 per hour would not be a sufficient living wage for a single person even without children living wages in hawaii and washington d c are 19 43 and 20 49 respectively it is important to note that the living wage calculation is based on working full time hours 52 weeks per year and does not factor in the opportunity to take unpaid time off for illness family leave or vacation it also does not include setting aside any income as savings for emergencies large purchases such as a car or house or retirement it also excludes the comforts that many people think of as essential to living such as occasionally eating out birthday and holiday gifts and celebrations cable television or streaming services high speed internet and education expenses living wage should be viewed as an entry point to the conversation about wages the amount necessary just to get by minimum wage has not kept up with inflation while the minimum wage has been adjusted numerous times since its implementation in 1938 it has failed to keep up with inflation and the rising cost of living the purchasing power of minimum wage reached its peak in 1968 and steadily declined since if it had kept up with inflation from that point it would have reached at least 10 45 in 2019 instead its real value continues to go down meaning minimum wage employees are essentially being paid less each year additionally some economists argue if minimum wage increased with u s productivity over the years it would be set currently at 26 per hour today and poverty rates would be close to non existent with little negative impact on the economy however because gradual change was avoided the extra funds were instead shifted to ceo compensation a sudden change in wages now could possibly make a more noticeable impact on the economy which is often cited as reasoning for a slower increase over time moving forward gradual increases with inflation and productivity could have avoided any potential economic ripple effects from wage increases and should be considered in ongoing plans because of pandemic induced labor shortages many industries saw modest wage increases over the past year annual wages grew 4 8 percent for workers earning the lowest 25 percent in august according to the federal reserve of atlanta on the surface this seems promising however when adjusting for inflation wages actually fell 1 8 percent in 2021 assuming all workers face the same inflation rate in fact because lower income households spend a larger portion of their income on commodities that saw the largest price increases they face a higher inflation rate research shows the annual inflation experienced by the lowest earning income quartile was 0 3 percent higher than for the top earning quartile from 2003 2018 minimum wage insufficient to cover basic living expenses the gap between wages and cost of basic living expenses widens each year without participating in government assistance programs families are unable to afford basic housing food healthcare and childcare and are forced to make spending choices that have major impacts on their families health safety and well being housing low income households are more likely to rent their homes and spend a higher percentage of their earned income on housing rent prices increased an average of 8 86 percent each year since 1980 consistently and significantly outpacing wages in 2021 a worker receiving minimum wage would be unable to afford housing anywhere in the u s in many locations two full time minimum wage workers would still be unable to afford a fairly priced two bedroom apartment in order to stay financially healthy families should spend no more than 30 percent of their income on housing in order to cover all living expenses with that in mind the average u s worker would need to make 20 40 per hour to afford a modest one bedroom rental home or 24 90 per hour for a two bedroom rental home the average renter makes 18 78 per hour less than the national one and two bedroom housing wage the average renter would have to work more than 53 hours per week to afford a two bedroom apartment a virtual impossibility for working parents rental costs out of reach for most workers monthly rent affordable on various incomes versus monthly fair market rent according to data from national low income housing coalition individual relying on ssi 238 household with one full time minimum wage worker 377 individual with average unemployment benefit 503 family of four with income at poverty level 663

to estimate the cost of a healthy diet used for determining funding for the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap it was updated in august 2021 to reflect the increased cost of food and new dietary guidance prior to this it had not been adjusted since 2006 it represents the lowest possible cost of a nutritious cost effective diet prepared at home which may not always be practical for working parents based on schedules skill and available cooking equipment the market basket or reference sample of foods determined for a healthy diet for a family of four at june 2021 prices was 835 57 per month many expect the cost of food to continue to increase with ongoing disruptions to the food system grocery prices on average rose 4 3 percent from february 2020 to 2021 with items such as fish poultry meat and eggs increasing 8 1 percent during that time healthcare the cost of health insurance premiums continues to increase making health insurance harder for low wage workers to afford the average premium for families increased 22 percent over the past 5 years about half of the people in the u s receive employer sponsored health insurance for employees lucky enough to receive health insurance benefits lower wage workers saw lower cost premiums which is likely due to plans being less comprehensive or having higher out of pocket expenses when used workers paid an average of 1 242 18 percent of the premium for single coverage or 6 015 30 percent of the premium for family coverage per year job market fluctuations and accompanying insurance lapses bring into question the very concept of employer provided healthcare and offer an additional argument for public insurance taking a larger role in the u s employment changes caused by covid 19 led to an estimated 9 million workers losing access to employer sponsored health insurance at some point during the pandemic additionally enrollment in medicare increased by 4 million during covid 19 childcare childcare is one of the highest budget items for families and exceeds the cost of all expenses except housing in all u s regions the challenge for most low wage workers lies in the fact that they may not make enough to pay for childcare to allow them to work for example in the southern u s the average household spent 18 422 on childcare in 2018 the lowest of all regions if two adults worked full time for minimum wage they would make just 30 160 before taxes leaving very little to cover housing food healthcare and other expenses because of the inability to afford childcare many families must choose to have a family member stay home to serve as a caretaker instead of working resulting in lower household earnings and additional financial challenges with childcare facilities shut down due to the pandemic or operating at reduced capacity and students engaged in remote learning many low wage workers have been unable to return to their pre pandemic jobs as parents return to work after covid 19 shutdowns it is harder than ever for them to find affordable childcare additionally because many low wage workers do not have access to paid time off or paid sick leave they often must take off work without pay to care for a sick child as many schools and childcare facilities will not allow a sick child to remain in the facility this disproportionately impacts female workers as mothers are more often responsible for staying home when children are sick or off for school holidays lived experience of low wages when i was 23 i was working at mcdonald s i started at 7 25 an hour as a single father of a 2 month old it didn t leave me enough to buy a crib diapers or anything after a year i asked for a raise but didn t get one after four years i became a manager but it was only a 1 raise i was doing a lot more work for just a little bit of pay i knew they were making tons of money off of me i couldn t support my child on this a 1 raise helped a little but after taxes not that much i ended up having to get a second job while still in school and taking care of my daughter at the end of the day it was never enough once i paid my main bills i wasn t left with much i wasn t saving i worried what are my children going to live off in the future even now 15 an hour isn t enough luis philadelphia impact of increasing wages there has been much debate about the impact of raising worker wages at both the state and federal level it is important to understand and evaluate the impact it would have on workers businesses community and the economy as a whole impact on worker health and well being everyone knows the saying money cannot buy you happiness however researchers trying to prove disprove this statement intentionally base their work on populations making more than 40 000 per year knowing that basic needs must be met before they can accurately measure subjective well being happiness if money is needed to meet basic needs necessary for well being the corollary would be that lack of money can make you unhealthy low wages force workers to make tough choices regarding their health that have life long impacts on them and their families food insecurity low wages and food insecurity go hand in hand one in ten working adults faced food insecurity in the period between 2015 to 2017 in states with a minimum wage set at 10 or higher 8 6 percent of employed adults were food insecure in 2016 however in states with a minimum wage set at the federal minimum of 7 25 that number was much higher 9 9 percent were food insecure as one would expect households with low wage workers and those working part time or multiple jobs oftentimes all three are significantly more likely to be food insecure than those working full time at one job paying higher wages not surprisingly front line low wage workers such as those in childcare health care grocery store and food service roles are more likely to experience food insecurity many roles praised as essential during the covid 19 pandemic were also more likely to need federal assistance such snap to get by even prior to covid more than 5 5 million essential workers relied on snap at some point in 2018 some reports estimate increasing the federal minimum wage to 15 per hour would support almost 1 2 million households in becoming food secure reducing food insecurity by 6 5 percent food security and health are intertwined when workers do not have sufficient income to cover basic expenses they are forced to skip meals or purchase nutritionally deficient food for their families this causes an urgent crisis especially for children research finds even very low levels of food insecurity can impact children s brain development social development mental health and physical health that can have lasting impact into adulthood food insecurity also impacts children s academic performance and school attendance which impairs their future wage earning potential and creates an intergenerational cycle of food insecurity and poverty but food insecurity does not just impact the individual family we all pay the price for hunger in the u s the health related costs of food insecurity for just one year 2014 were estimated at 160 7 billion with another 18 8 billion estimated related to poor educational outcomes mental health and well being when families do not have enough money to afford rent and other basic necessities their physical and mental health suffers and stress increases impacting both adults and children adequate family income helps children long term by reducing severe poverty related stress which is linked to life long impact on children s brain development and physical health and allowing families to afford better learning environments from childcare through college increased wages have been linked positive health impacts as a result of improved mental health including decreases in smoking among adults and specifically among pregnant women resulting in increased child birth weights 38 they have also been linked to a reduction in suicides specifically in those with high school or lower education levels improvements in worker mental and physical well being also positively impacts businesses the integrated benefits institute estimates that illness related productivity losses cost employers 575 billion in 2019 on top of the 950 billion spent on healthcare benefits by employers reducing poverty related stress and improving overall health results in fewer sick days taken and improved performance self reliance and personal freedom with increased wages workers rely less on public assistance programs laden with rigid and confusing guidelines when families are allowed greater freedom and flexibility in how they spend their income it allows them to make decisions that best meet the needs of their families and help them move out of poverty specifically means testing associated with public assistance programs limit assets which are necessary for families to move out of poverty and off public assistance workers cannot become self reliant without building savings it is essential for their transition away from assistance programs benefit cutoffs from small wage increases when families are unable to build sufficient savings result in poor child and caregiver health outcomes as well as food and energy insecurity and housing instability increased wages offer workers the opportunity to save for major purchases or financial crisis low wages paired with means tested public assistance programs often trap people in poverty research shows that when minimum wages are increased it reduces total household debt for those with low credit scores and increases their access to credit business and economic impact determining the economic impact of raising the minimum wage through research has been mixed and inconclusive often depending on the approach taken to evaluating the available data mixed employment impact a review from 1992 to 2020 concluded that overall economists estimate some loss of jobs would occur due to raised wages with more direct impact on teens young adults and workers in low wage and lower skilled industries however studies on minimum wage increases using the most rigorous research designs often find they have little or no effect on rates of employment the small job loss from raised wages could be balanced by workers currently holding multiple jobs increased hourly wages would allow them to leave second and third jobs without negative financial impacts of reduced employment over the past two decades the number of workers holding multiple jobs has increased steadily to 7 8 percent of workers in 2018 women and low wage healthcare retail and food service workers were most likely to hold multiple jobs with secondary jobs making up 28 percent of their income on average with the rise of the gig economy some estimate as many as one in four workers participate in non standard gig work in some capacity and up to 10 percent of workers rely on gig work for their primary income piecing together multiple jobs to get by none of which provide health insurance or paid leave benefits working multiple jobs can have a number of negative outcomes on worker well being and their families minimal increase in cost of goods and services another concern is the impact of increased labor costs being passed through to the price of products and services for consumers many advocates are concerned price increases will offset wage increases and negatively impact the poorest families over a ten plus year period research found that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage resulted in just a 0 36 percent increase in prices passed on to the consumer at grocery stores a similar seattle based study showed that supermarket food prices were not impacted by their minimum wage increase limited small business impact some argue against raising the minimum wage because of the potential impact on small businesses with small profit margins who may be challenged to cover additional payroll costs but focusing on small business is the wrong approach the employers most likely to be impacted by raising wages are large retail and food service corporations such as walmart and fast food chains who have long exploited their workers with sub living wages while making billions of dollars in profits and offering millions of dollars in bonuses to executives they have left it up to the u s taxpayers to make up for their insufficient wages by forcing employees to depend on public assistance programs such as snap improved employee retention and productivity providing a living wage also offers benefits to employers because bringing in new employees can be a major expense for businesses retaining employees by offering better wages can reduce costs related to recruitment hiring and training over the long term higher wages increase the potential applicant pool making it easier to find the right fit for open positions additionally paying employees a wage that allows them to cover their living expenses means they are less likely to work a second job put less than their full effort into their work or leave for another job offering higher pay a study of minimum wage in seattle showed an eight percent reduction in employee turnover tied to the wage change dan price of gravity payments has been outspoken about his choice to double minimum pay for all of employees of his company and how it has resulted in a broader applicant pool greater retention and increased profits research also shows pay increases result in increased worker productivity community impact community cost saving poverty comes at a huge cost for communities public assistance programs such as medicaid children s health insurance program chip temporary assistance for needy families tanf snap and the earned income tax credit eitc provide a lifeline for low wage workers but come with hefty price tag when businesses pay workers too little workers must rely on these programs to help make up the difference or they must make tough decisions about their health and safety increased wages relieve pressure on these programs caused by low wage industries and allow state and federal dollars to be more effectively targeted to people with the greatest needs forcing families to depend on public assistance programs due to low wages costs state and federal governments and by extension taxpayers billions of dollars researchers estimate that a minimum wage below 15 per hour costs u s taxpayers over 107 4 billion per year a federal increase to 15 per hour would impact 10 5 million working families enrolled in at least one public assistance program or about 32 percent of program participants raising the minimum wage would release pressure from public assistance programs caused by low wage industries and allow state and federal dollars to be more effectively targeted to the families most in need allowing them to be more effective in addressing poverty increased wages also lead to cost savings by lessening the health burden by improving community health access to preventive care food security and community engagement crime reduction wage increases have even been linked to reduction in crime and recidivism rates one comprehensive study found that a minimum wage increase of 50 cents reduced the probability that a person returned to prison within one year by 2 8 percent rates of drug and property crime were reduced when wages increased concluding that if legal well paying jobs are made available people will not be as likely to engage in criminal activity as a source of income gender and racial equity women and people of color are disproportionately confined to minimum wage jobs specifically in the healthcare and service industries providing little opportunity for upward mobility and building wealth women compose the majority of low wage workers making less than 11 per hour and almost 80 percent of the lowest wage workers making less than 10 per hour black and latina women are far more likely than white women to hold these kinds of jobs more than half of african american workers and almost 60 percent of latinx workers make less than 15 while the overall number of americans making 15 or less per hour is going down the proportion of black and latina women continues to increase in this category it is no surprise then that black 21 7 percent and latinx 17 2 percent households experienced food insecurity at rates triple and double that of white 7 1 percent households in 2020 this income inequality is the product of historical and ongoing systemic racial and gender discrimination economic exploitation and unequal opportunities raising the minimum wage would help reduce the wage gap and begin to address these issues conclusion families across the u s are working hard and struggling to get by wage increases are long overdue and it is time for a change at the federal level while many arguments have been made against raising the federal minimum wage it is clear the benefits to individual workers businesses and the community outweigh the potential challenges that will arise living wage should be the starting point in the conversation of wages this conversation of course will lead to questions that go beyond just wages to engage the public in considering what it really means to live what quality of life should be accessible to all and the need for affordable access to healthy food clean water safe housing universal health care paid sick and vacation leave affordable childcare and more for all residents of the u s to have a safe and healthy life additionally policies and regulations to protect workers should be considered to limit the impact of inevitable backlash from corporations as wage changes are implemented policy recommendations raise federal minimum wage to 15 by 2022 immediate action is necessary to support the health and wellbeing of families across the country raising the federal minimum wage to a minimum of 15 per hour will immediately boost the income of lowest wage workers and support economic security while acknowledging that 15 is a starting point and not the end of working toward living wage and economic security for all immediate action is necessary to support the health and wellbeing of families across the country raising the federal minimum wage to a minimum of 15 per hour will immediately boost the income of lowest wage workers and support economic security while acknowledging that 15 is a starting point and not the end of working toward living wage and economic security for all implement a federal mandate to raise state minimum wages to a location specific living wage by 2030 because the cost of living varies by location it will be necessary for each state to determine the true living wage for the residents of its state and develop a plan to reach a minimum living wage between 20 and 30 by 2030 in a

have affected the business during our most recent quarter said thomas d hull iii kewaunee s president and chief executive officer we were successful in continuing to grow our backlog reporting a record high for the second consecutive quarter in response to this favorable market demand we have been focused on restoring and expanding manufacturing capacity we had to reduce last year because of covid 19 though it s been challenging due to the tight labor market we made progress during the quarter in adding new associates who will contribute to sustained manufacturing volume increases during the second half of our fiscal year much of the product manufactured during the quarter was priced during the peak of weak demand due to covid 19 which was also before raw material inflation began because of the global supply chain crisis these orders had fixed contracts that prevented the company from passing along and recovering the unprecedented increases in raw material costs that have occurred looking forward surcharges have been implemented on all new orders which will result in our revenue being better aligned with our costs in the second half of the current fiscal year we believe the worst of the impact of the timing lag between increased raw material costs and the associated surcharge implementation is behind us based on this we expect improved financial performance in the second half of this fiscal year and into our fiscal 2023 while november s previously disclosed cyber attack resulted in a temporary shut down of our operations we rebounded quickly and continue to ramp production levels in response to strong demand 1 ebitda is a non gaap financial measure see the table below for a reconciliation of ebitda and segment ebitda to net earnings loss the most

time for biden to build bridges with hun sen barack obama greets cambodian prime minister hun sen before the 4th asean us leaders meeting in phnom penh in this nov 19 2012 photo photo reuters as is widely known in 1975 the united states abandoned cambodia s lon nol government and the khmer rouge took power what is less known is that at the time then freshman senator joseph biden of delaware supported the evacuation of vietnam and cambodia on april 25 1975 the united states exited cambodia sirik matak sisowath the former cambodian prime minister who refused to leave and who was killed by the khmer rouge days later famously remarked i have only committed the mistake of believing in you while critics said mr biden s recent afghanistan policy was ad hoc and not well thought out it is the same as his approach to cambodia in the 1970s and is essentially unchanged the biden administration s recent sanctions on cambodia must be viewed in this historical context it is part of mr biden s mindset it is based on misapplying the afghanistan paradigm to an incomparable situation an independent and democratic country cambodia has been used as a pawn in cold war politics this includes kissinger s secret bombings of suspected communist bases and supply lines in cambodia starting in 1969 the post world war ii cambodian government was first a french centric colony then in a us centric period then in a china centric period then in a vietnam centric period and now arguably reverting back to a china centric period it is like a ping pong ball none of this was or is inevitable and reflects a misunderstanding of cambodian politics cambodia gained independence in 1953 under norodom sihanouk in 1955 he abandoned the throne to his father and was the head of government for 15 years in the sihanouk era after world war ii the united states provided economic support to cambodia from 1960 1970 the late norodom sihanouk was prime minister he had long had ties to china the sihanouk and sisowath families are two of the eligible royal families in cambodia in may 1965 cambodia broke diplomatic relations with the united states sihanouk wanted to be neutral during the vietnam war from 1970 1975 the united states supported the coup against sihanouk who fled to beijing and later supported the khmer rouge and the lon nol government khmer republic washington made a loan of us 278 million 9 3 billion baht to the lon nol government which it is now claiming has doubled to be 500 million recently the biden administration has demanded repayment of this loan in 1975 1979 the united states condemned pol pot s democratic kampuchea in the cambodian vietnam war of 1979 vietnam ousted the khmer rouge from power in 1989 vietnam withdrew from cambodia in 1985 hun sen was the prime minister at the age of 33 he was the youngest prime minister in the world he now ranks as the longest serving having been in power for 36 years at 26 he was the youngest foreign minister in the world after that cambodia entered into civil war in 1991 the warring factions agreed to a ceasefire in 1992 1993 the country was under the united nations transitional authority in cambodia untac in my opinion the untac was a successful transition to elections and kept the peace in 1992 significantly the united states ended its economic embargo of cambodia and in 1994 opened the us mission in phnom penh from 1997 to the present time hun sen has been the prime minister of cambodia he is a genius and a perfect ally for washington his son who he has recently endorsed as his successor is a graduate of the us military academy west point hun sen is part of an emerging democracy that is free market capitalist it is one of the 10 member states of the association of southeast asian nations asean which is historically though less so recently pro western and a political bloc that china is not part of under hun sen cambodia established a stock market the world bank says cambodia has the most open foreign direct investment regime in asean while thailand has the most restrictive cambodia s currency is the greenback on nov 12 2021 the biden administration announced an arms embargo against cambodia due to allegations of growing chinese military influence and china s refurbishment of the ream naval base since the us is not an important arms supplier to cambodia it is a pointless policy that coincides with the us led boycott of china s winter olympics another paper tiger which reflects more weakness than strength and is a way of appearing to do something when in fact it is nothing hun sen s reaction to the embargo was to use the afghan analogy a lot of those who use us arms lost wars citing afghanistan even before the embargo on sept 12 hun sen said the situation in afghanistan evoked memories of when the khmer rouge took over phnom penh in 1975 cambodia could and should be a key ally of the united states but first washington has to understand how hun sen views the world first cambodia lost a lot of land area to vietnam the map shows the loss of cambodian territory as the price of vietnam s occupation in the 1980s and also continuing into the 1990s china provides a counterbalance to vietnam s threat to and incursions on cambodian sovereignty and land area the united states is not offering to protect cambodia from vietnam whereas china is so the united states is not giving cambodia any choice this is different from thailand which has never faced aggression from china or vietnam because it is viewed as being under the security umbrella of the united states in 2003 under former president george w bush thailand was named a key non nato ally hun sen is the ideal leader to have constructive relations with china vietnam and the united states president biden is still stuck in the afghanistan mindset which has roots in his leading role in america s evacuation of cambodia in 1975 in fact he owes a debt to cambodia mr biden needs to view hun sen as the current chairman of asean a political and economic competitor of china s made up of democratic countries he is a mastermind who wants to be a key ally of the united states president biden needs to build bridges with cambodia and spend time with hun sen hun sen was a poor soldier who became prime minister he is a nationalist who mr biden needs to understand must protect his country from numerous external threats instead of this unwise embargo mr biden should write off the contentious 500 million debt and name cambodia as a key non nato ally cambodia can then rest assured that like thailand which is under no threat cambodia can count on american protection and not be another lon nol government or afghanistan the ghosts of mr biden s past
former president donald trump has asserted that americans quickly started to say merry christmas again during his presidency trump told former arkansas governor mike huckabee that the common holiday greeting experienced a resurgence when he took office during an interview that aired on the conservative network newsmax on thursday huckabee who was one of trump s republican presidential primary opponents in 2016 claimed that america had gone into a long period where people quit saying merry christmas this is incredible pic twitter com jhyhkjehy6 aaron rupar atrupar december 16 2021 you deliberately changed that huckabee said while emotional piano and strings music played in the background and openly said merry christmas we re going to say it again that was part of my campaign trump responded the country had started with this woke i guess a little bit before that and it was embarrassing for stores to say merry christmas you d see these big chains they want your money but they don t want to say merry christmas and they d use reds and they d use whites and snow but they wouldn t say merry christmas when i started campaigning i said you re going to say merry christmas again and now people are saying it he continued that was a big part of what i was doing i would say it all the time during that period i tell you we brought it back very quickly former president donald trump has claimed victory in a war on christmas battle insisting that his presidency resulted in americans saying merry christmas again trump is pictured on the phone in front of a christmas former president donald trump has claimed victory in a war on christmas battle insisting that his presidency resulted in americans saying merry christmas again trump is pictured on the phone in front of a christmas tree at mar a lago in palm beach florida on december 24 2017 more nicholas kamm afp getty huckabee agreed that trump really did bring the phrase back he said that the greeting was a part of the american culture and not meant to exclude anybody he went on to say that the phrase was just simply a celebration of what america does at christmas while stock video panned over images of a christmas tree decorated with the american flag and be best ornaments america loves christmas trump agreed whether you re muslim whether you re christian whether you re jewish everyone loves christmas and they d say merry christmas until these crazy people came along and they wanted to stop it along with everything else trump concluded by insisting that he was very proud of his supposed accomplishment of bringing the greeting back into widespread use there is little evidence to quantify how often people greet each other using any particular phrase during the holiday season regardless perceptions that the phrase merry christmas unfairly fell out of favor have been frequently cited by largely conservative commentators touting a so called war on christmas in recent years a notion that former fox news host bill o reilly popularized on air in 2004 those who have argued that merry christmas was unjustly taken out of circulation have often complained that christians are being sidelined as other greetings like happy holidays have grown in popularity in order to include people who may celebrate seasonal holidays other than christmas newsweek reached out to trump s office for comment

illegal and unreported fishing is happening on an industrial scale around the globe and the culprit often is china s subsidized fishing fleet navy secretary carlos del toro said today speaking thursday at the center for strategic and international studies he added one in five fish sold on international markets is illegally caught declining fish populations due to climate change and overfishing are having a profound effect on sources of protein in poorer nations food supplies the secretary said in his meetings with counterparts in oceania and other nations del toro said violations of their exclusive economic zones rise to the top of their concerns as does their need for better maritime awareness of what is happening in their waters to include mineral and energy exploration earlier monica medina assistant secretary of state for oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs said sometimes in dealing with china and illegal fishing there is a race to the bottom on addressing the problem coast guard commandant adm karl schultz speaking at the same forum said the united states can bring some leadership to raising that awareness through hands on training in maritime law enforcement and information sharing with south american african and pacific navies and coast guards as an example of the difficulty in tracing illegal fishing schultz noted that the automatic identification systems or ais aboard many of those vessels are turned off so they are not readily plotted if we re chasing folks who are spoofing ais i m not sure we re winning there maybe we help stitch these arrangements together through the state department s legwork he added these kind of arrangements weren t there before medina said we re only just beginning on how to use new technological tools with other nations in law enforcement in the maritime domain we need to harmonize things better inside and outside the united states government and with the private sector on what can be done better collectively she saw value in expanding focus on this issue in the united nations and before the international maritime organization we have to know where the fish are and those organizations can help in tracking that as arctic waters warm and fish stock is depleted in the tropics medina added that nations and organizations engaged in illegal fishing follow those changes closely to drive the point home on how important illegal fishing is to the american public schultz said we need to put a face on the challenge that can be understood in ways that supply chain disruptions are now del toro said exercises with other nations show how other countries can work with the american sea services and u s allies and partners like australia and new zealand in oceania in building their capacity to protect their own territory he and schultz said the coast guard law enforcement detachments aboard navy ships also could provide a model for those nations in collaboration to monitor illegal activities beyond drug smuggling schultz said persistent partnerships have an impact in southeast asia the philippines and oceania which share concerns over future food supplies and the fishing industry s history of forced labor practices as they have in the anti narcotics efforts in latin america he added the u s coast guard is not interested in being the world s fish cops schultz said the coast guard is absolutely a key enabler when collaborating with the navy in showing presence internationally and carrying out operations other than ones that are purely military when asked by an audience member if it was possible to reach any agreement with china and russia on these issues del toro said we have to have a very open dialogue with them on where the three nations can agree one can t give up trying he added

valued at less than 18 000 remove tax liability from the gifter the recipient may be subject to capital gains tax though the rate depends on their taxable income what s a better gift to give your loved ones this holiday season than the chance to build wealth although some people prefer to get cash for the holidays you can do them one better by gifting stock compared to tangible gifts that can wear and tear stocks can be more beneficial over the long term since they can appreciate in value over time plus by giving stock as a gift to your friends or family you may even be able to gift yourself a tax break if you re looking to give back a little more this holiday season you can even gift stock to charities you can gift stocks through some of the best stock trading apps these apps have low fees human advisor access and much more but keep in mind that there s no guarantee that the stock you gift will increase in value also recipients may be subject to a robust gift tax which may put a damper on your generous sentiment here are four ways to gift stock in 2023 4 ways to gift stock in 2023 stock of course isn t a physical gift that you can buy at the store and wrap in a bow when you gift a stock you re delivering shares to another individual or institution who has a brokerage account and senders don t have to sell the shares before transferring the stock to the recipient doing so would leave you with a tax bill 1 gifting stock to friends and family one of the most common ways to gift stock is by transferring it from one brokerage account to another to get started you ll need to contact your investment custodian and you can expect to complete custodian mandated paperwork before gifting the shares of stock according to brian fry founder and cfp at safe landing financial for instance if you re a current fidelity account holder and want to gift stock to another fidelity user you ll need to provide a letter that contains instructions on who you re gifting to as well as a description of the securities you re gifting some of the information the brokerage asks for includes the recipient s name social security number and fidelity account number if you choose to transfer stock directly the recipient can receive the full share value or fractional share dollar amount if your brokerage allows it however the stock transfer process may vary for different brokerages or investment platforms gifting stock you ve purchased through investing apps may be possible but could cost additional fees for example with robinhood you can transfer assets out of the app and into other brokerages but there is a 100 fee on all partial or full transfers 2 gifting stock to kids children and minors are also eligible to receive stock as a gift through a custodial brokerage account like a utma or ugma the gifting process is the same as when you transfer stock or another security between brokerage accounts you also have the option to buy stock directly within a custodial account even if you re not the parent or guardian of the reception grandparents aunts uncles cousins and even family friends can open and contribute through some of the best custodial accounts as long as the beneficiary is a minor but be careful how much contribute to a custodial account or you may lose out on tax benefits under the kiddie tax rule for 2023 the first 1 250 of a child s unearned income is tax free the following 1 250 of unearned income is taxed at the lower child tax rate after that all contributions are taxed at the parent s tax rate 3 gifting stock to charities you can gift stock to other individuals but you can also gift it to charities the process for gifting stock to charity is similar to that of gifting stock to other individuals but the tax implications differ to initiate the transfer you ll generally need to include things like the charity s name its account information and the stock s you re transferring but you can contact your brokerage if you re not sure where to begin you want to be giving your lowest basis shares to charity since charity does not pay tax and those shares are the least valuable to you because they have the highest percentage of capital gains explains nicole webb cfp and senior vice president at wealth enhancement group since capital gains are taxable she adds you certainly want to look for your lowest basis shares and be very specific with which shares you re transferring to charity if you sell your stock s before donating to charity you ll have to account for short or long term capital gains taxes and in such situations your tax rate can be higher if you hold the stock for less than one year tax rates are generally lower for assets you hold for one year or more but if you transfer the stock directly to the charity of your choice you won t have to worry about paying capital gains taxes quick tip another option is to gift stock to charity by setting up a donor advised fund and contributing low cost basis shares this can help stack your deductions according to webb you can make one larger gift to that donor advised fund and receive a larger deduction in specific tax years if you re eligible and then give to charity in the following years out of that account she explains plus you ll have to account for irs deductibility limits when making charitable contributions for tax year 2023 the annual income tax deduction limit for non cash assets that have been appreciated is between 20 to 50 of your adjusted gross income agi 4 gifting stock through a service or gift cards alternatively you could look into gifting stock or cryptocurrencies with gift cards through companies like stockpile they re almost like a transfer of an amount of cash then chooses where it goes owens explains you could also purchase single shares of a company s stock through services like giveashare and uniquestockgift com these options even come with a certificate who s eligible to gift stocks everybody is eligible to gift stock but the real question is about who will be receiving the stock explains webb the thing to keep in mind is that the recipient of that stock if you re giving it while you re alive receives your cost basis for that stock says webb the cost basis represents the price as well as any trading fees or other associated expenses you originally paid for the stock you re gifting when you transfer stock to someone else that person assumes the cost basis and thus the tax liability for the stock you ve given them in other words gifting stock to individuals isn t a taxable event as long you remain within the allowance threshold the rules are slightly different for charities the cost basis doesn t matter when it comes to gifting to charities since charities don t pay taxes according to webb so if they want to sell the stock which most charities would you don t have to worry about any tax consequences for charity she explains benefits of gifting stocks stock gifting is often done within families especially from parents to children says dondrea owens cpa and founder of the creative s cfo a lot of parents and grandparents don t necessarily want to buy toys or just give kids money but they will give them stock because it s a way for them to start building wealth at a very early age owens explains with the added value of time gifting stock to kids and young adults could maximize the potential return for some it may even be a valuable tool used to educate loved ones about money and investing as the gifter you can enjoy zero capital gains tax on the appreciated value of the investment in 2023 you can gift up to 17 000 per person up to 18 000 per person in 2024 the current lifetime limit for gifted stock as of 2023 is 12 92 million benefits of gifting stock to charity a warm fuzzy feeling in your chest isn t the only benefit to gifting stock to charity as you may also be able to receive a charitable deduction for the total value of gifted stock if i paid 1 000 for this stock and now it s worth 25 000 i will still get a charitable deduction for 25 000 explains dennis laporte owner at uhy advisors mi inc moreover you gift as much as you like to your charity of choice there s no maximum amount you re allowed to gift to charity in a year says webb this way you ll also be able to give more to the organization than you would by selling the stock paying tax on the appreciation and then gifting whatever is left tax implications of gifting stocks when gifting stock there will be tax implications for both the giver and the receiver luckily it may be possible for both parties to come out on top in general when you sell an asset for more than the price you paid for it or your cost basis you re subject to a tax on the capital gains the rate is determined both by how long you hold the asset and your taxable income however once the gifter transfers ownership of the stock they no longer have to worry about capital gains taxes when you decide to gift it there s really nothing to be taxed says owens still transferring stock from one person to another won t take capital gains tax out of the equation completely someone will have to pay it eventually or at the very least report the gain an important thing to remember with regards to capital gains taxes when you re giving a stock you own as a gift is to let the recipient know what you originally paid for it laporte notes the value of your stock gift is also a major caveat the irs allows you to give away 17 000 tax free per year per person in 2023 and the limit increases to 18 000 in 2024 the same holds true for stocks if you re gifting more than the gift allowance per year as the donor you will need to file a gift tax return and may be subject to a gift tax ultimately every situation is different and it s best to consult with a professional about your potential tax liability before making any decisions tax implications of gifting stock to charity with charitable giving you can deduct the complete fair market value or current market value of the stock you re gifting of the security you re donating for instance if you originally invested 10 000 into a certain stock and held it for more than one year and the fair market value at the time of your donation was 40 000 you could both avoid long term capital gains taxes and make a 40 000 charitable deduction as long as you don t surpass irs deduction limits quick tip holding assets for longer than a year ensures you ll be taxed at a long term capital gains rate which could be as low as 10 depending on your taxable income and filing status short term capital gains are taxed like ordinary income potentially up to 37 what other investment types can you gift you can gift most types of investments like bonds mutual funds commodities or cryptocurrencies as long as the amount falls within the annual limit in 2023 the limit for individuals is 17 000 and 34 000 for couples in 2024 the limit is 18 000 for individuals and 36 000 for couples and according to webb the gift allowance applies to the fair market value not the original cost basis whether you re gifting traditional assets like mutual funds or stocks or offering things like jewelry precious metals or other alternative assets you need to remain mindful of the fair market value of the assets you re transferring webb explains alternatives to gifting stock there are multiple methods you can utilize if you want a longer term approach to gifting stock these include setting up a custodial account or trust account custodial accounts with the custodial option you can open an investment account for a minor typically someone under age 18 or 21 depending on the state and that minor will assume complete control over the account once they reach their state s age of majority for instance charles schwab offers custodial accounts that let you gift schwab stock slices or fractional shares to minors these are portions of stocks or etfs often at a lower price popular custodial account options include uniform gift to minor act ugma accounts and uniform transfers to minors act utma accounts although these accounts operate similarly the kind of assets they hold varies for example ugmas are limited to liquid assets like cash and stocks whereas utmas can hold alternative investments like real estate or collectibles some other gifts to help advance others financial future may include funding 529 plans for college or roth iras for children or adult children with income according to fry trust accounts trust accounts function like custodial accounts but they offer more wiggle room when it comes to transferring account ownership in addition they allow you the owner to provide specific instructions for how you want the assets distributed trust accounts are managed by trustees on behalf of a third party and typically can hold assets like stocks cash bonds real estate and much more however there s a lot more leg work needed to set up a trust account compared to a custodial account gifting stock frequently asked questions faqs what is a gift stock chevron icon it indicates an expandable section or menu or sometimes previous next

comparing stock versus cash the stock is the better gift since it has the potential to rise in value over time however if the giftee wants to purchase something immediately with the gifted amount then cash is preferred what is the difference between gifted stock and inherited stock chevron icon it indicates an expandable section or menu or sometimes previous next navigation options gifted stock and inherited stock are received in different manners but once the assets are in your account they act the same anyone can receive a gifted stock from a family member friend or colleague inherited stock on the other hand is given to recipients through an inheritance after the original owner of the stock passes away also inherited stock provides more tax advantages than gifted stock since inherited stock is considered long term property the base cost of the stock becomes the market value the asset had at the time of the original holder s death is it worth gifting stock in 2023 gifting stock can be a great way to educate children about money and investing defer capital gains taxes and make charitable donations though there are plenty of avenues for stock gifting most commonly it s done by transferring shares from one brokerage account to another or creating a custodial account and funding it for children and minors but children aren t the only ones that can benefit from being gifted a stock anyone with a brokerage account can be gifted a stock this holiday season if you re giving stock it s helpful to gather any upfront documentation such as the cost basis of the shares and provide

ethereum upside key reversal gold and oil steady wall street rebounds china property still under pressure and will require more urgent action soon fed doubles taper signals three 2022 hikes in

the pace at which it s scaling back purchases of treasuries and mortgage backed securities to 30 billion a month putting it on track to conclude the program in early 2022 rather than mid year as

markets have been pricing in for the last month even though this statement is headline grabbing it is not sufficiently surprising to have had an immediate negative effect on the market however the reality is liquidity is being withdrawn interest rates will begin to rise next year and financial conditions are going to begin to tighten the most interest rate sensitive portions of the market are

reversal today confirming short term support eoin s personal portfolio profits taken on shorts eoin treacy s view one of the questions subscribers as most often is how to find details of my open traders to make it easier i will simply repost the latest summary daily until there is a change the market has not pulled back in the manner i was initially expecting when i opened my shorts so i closed them today following the fed statement my nasdaq 100 short in the march contract was closed at 15808 against my sale at 16 126 i also bought sold my long in the jan 21st 2022 apple 175 put for 7 08 against my initial purchase at 6 i increased my platinum long on august 27th paying 1002 for another position my existing platinum longs were purchased at 1072 and 885 i remain of the view that precious metals are still cheap and are to be bought on significant dips i also continue to hold my silver trading position initiated at 23 7 i will buy more if the current reaction deepens i have been saying for months that i have purchase orders below the market in gold and silver the first of these was triggered on august 9th i was filled at 1702 3 including spread bet dealing costs my original positions were opened in q4 2020 at 1879 2 and 1818 6 that reduces by average purchase price to 1800 i still have additional bids in the market below prevailing prices in gold and silver and will leave them in place to take advantage of any possible additional volatility these are leveraged trading positions rather than medium to long term investments with baby steps trading one must have high conviction prices will recover and the patience to buy on weakness before eventually being proved right hopefully among my investments my original position in the vaneck vectors gold miners etf was purchased on march 25th at 20 12 i bought another unit at 35 79 on december 1st i continue to shop for opportunities in the gold sector my two investment positions in rolls royce were purchased at 154 75 and 105p respectively i also took up the rights issue which has resulted in an average purchase price of 54 63p rolls royce continues to form a first step above the type 2 base formation email of the day on demand surges versus supply disruptions the author of this article in the ft argues that the current rise in inflation is a demand side event and not due to supply shortages he argues that the statistics show that global supply has risen in 2021 but not as fast as global demand eoin treacy s view thank you for this insightful email and related article here is a section there may be a case for such a policy turn but the main factual premise of the new resilience cum autonomy doctrine is false the pandemic put capitalist globalisation to the test with sudden and enormous surges in demand and it passed with flying colours take durable goods headlines about shortages are the only thing that seem in ample supply and everyone is experiencing delays in obtaining items such as cars that could previously be had with instant gratification but the actual supply of durable goods is at record highs since the summer of last year american consumers have been obtaining them in volumes much larger than the pre pandemic trend many eu economies including germany italy and the netherlands have also matched or exceeded 2019 levels of durable goods consumption what about semiconductors in a short paper published a month ago daniel rees and phurichai rungcharoenkitkul of the bank for international settlements showed that semiconductor exports from taiwan and korea in 2020 exceeded the volumes recorded in 2019 and 2021 exceeded 2020 exports currently appear to be running at a good 30 per cent above two years ago the bis s hyun song shin has added that semiconductor sales in the us are much higher than in the years before the pandemic when i think about my family since early 2020 we fitted out a whole kitchen did some modest repairs bought a couple of ipads macbook surface a quest vr headset six new phones a table tennis table and too many small household items to count there is no question demand surged during the pandemic millions of people moved home and more had to set up work from home environments i ve been living at work for 14 years and can testify that having a well laid out office makes all the difference to productivity i suspect everyone understands that now so demand for bigger homes is still strong the challenge for manufacturers is they are under a great deal of pressure to boost supply to satiate this rising demand that doesn t change the fact that the market for durable goods is cyclical i won t but a new phone for years i expect my new kitchen appliances to last twenty years the pandemic has pulled orders from the future into the present and that represents a significant future headwind for everything from semiconductors to consumer electronics and other durable goods even a modest dip in consumer sentiment could result in a significant retrenchment in the demand growth forecasts for durable goods the s p500 consumer discretionary index rebounded from above the previous peaks today to confirm a near term low the philadelphia semiconductors index has a similar pattern taiwan s taiex continues to pause in the region of the all time peak and is susceptible to some additional consolidation south korea s kospi continues to encounter resistance in the region of the 200 day ma and has suffered considerable consistency degradation the baltic dry index is easing back from the region of the 200 day ma following a brief reversionary rally it needs to find support above 2000 if the return to medium term demand dominance is to be given the benefit of the doubt china s economic slump fuels calls for more stimulus this article from bloomberg may be of interest to subscribers here is a section the weakening of retail sales surprised analysts who were expecting a boost from the annual online singles day shopping festival spending in the restaurant and catering sector fell year on year in november while car sales dropped for a fifth straight month china has been facing persistent outbreaks of the delta variant and recorded its first cases of the more contagious omicron variant this week adding to pressure on authorities to implement local lockdowns what bloomberg economics says china s november activity data suggest the economy is still under strain though the production side appears to be stabilizing the pressure on the demand side was clear with growth in both fixed asset investment and retail sales extending slowdowns we expect fiscal and monetary policies to become more supportive in the months ahead the central bank refrained from easing monetary policy on wednesday it kept the interest rate for one year loans to banks unchanged and only rolled over about half of the maturing debts withdrawing liquidity from the banking system a recently announced cut to the reserve requirement ratio for banks takes effect from wednesday which should make it cheaper for them to extend new loans there was limited reaction in financial markets to the data the csi 300 index was down 0 6 as of 1 45 p m in shanghai the yield on 10 year government bonds was flat at 2 88 and the yuan strengthened less than 0 1 to 6 3644 per dollar a weak labor market further worsened the outlook for consumer spending the surveyed jobless rate inched up to 5 while the average number of hours worked per week fell slightly from the previous month domestic consumption remains weak with retail sales disappointing said raymond yeung chief economist for greater china at australia new zealand banking group ltd the incremental increase in the jobless rate is concerning the authorities should pledge more support and offer a stronger signal to the market eoin treacy s view the contrast between china and the rest of the world is growing increasingly stark the demand surge during the pandemic has not yet ebbed in much of the rest of the world but is quickly receding in china the key variable is liquidity the usa and europe spent inordinate sums to support their economies china clamped down on personal freedoms and did what was necessary to ensure factories were operational but did not engage in anywhere near the same level of monetary and fiscal accommodation that contributed to the trouble being experienced by the property sector the determination of the administration to clamp down on overleverage pushed a rising number of developers into insolvency the party now appears to deem the property market a threat to the sustainability of the one party system so they are clamping down on leverage how sustainable this parsimonious approach to a sector in dire need of liquidity is debatable the result of this policy has been to heap further pressure on the csi 300 real estate index which is pulling back from the region of the trend mean as it distributes at the lower side of the six year range the renminbi by contract has been a tower of strength amid low supply the time to tighten up on overleveraged portions of the economy is expending in a robust manner china s growth is slowing and unemployment is rising this seems an odd time to try and combat excesses in the property sector ultimately they will need to devalue the currency and pump more money into the economy or risk a recession that may not happen until next year so there is scope for a global liquidity crunch in the short term as the fed prepares to accelerate the pace of tapering the chart

2021 dec 16 newsrx by a news reporter staff news editor at insurance daily news a patent application by the inventor mcclelland dean hong kong hk filed on october 31 2018 was made available online on december 2 2021 according to news reporting originating from washington d c by newsrx correspondents this patent application has not been assigned to a company or institution the following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background information supplied by the inventors investment plans in general have existed for centuries according to wikipedia one of the oldest known investment plans to raise capital was known as a tontine pronounced as tontin a tontine is an investment plan for raising capital devised in the 17th century and relatively widespread in the 18th and 19th centuries in its original design a tonine combines features of a group annuity and lottery where each subscriber pays a sum or sums into the fund and thereafter receives a periodical payment for the rest of their life as subscribers die their share of the periodical payouts devolve to the other participants and so the value of each periodical payout increases as the number of surviving subscribers falls on the death of the last subscriber the scheme was typically wound up tontines are regulated in europe under the directive 2002 83 ec of the european parliament and are still common in france tontines life insurance policies were a major insurance category at the end of the 19th century having been pioneered by equitable life assurance society until the 1905 armstrong investigation in the united states which exposed the practices of us life insurers which had engaged in excessive fee charging misleading marketing based upon false payout projections justified by using obsolete data and investment return projections and inappropriate use of customer monies in respect of the underlying investments of the tontines whilst the armstrong commission report did not criticise the tontine principle per se it led to the introduction of rules restricting the sale of some forms of tontine linked policies it is notable that the armstrong commission records along with equitable life assurance society archive s were burned in and 1911 nevertheless in march 2017 the new york times reported that tontines were attracting fresh consideration as a scheme for people to subscribe to in return for the promise of lifetime retirement incomes the investment plan is named after neapolitan banker lorenzo de tonti who is credited with inventing it in france in 1653 although it has been suggested that he merely modified existing european investment schemes tonti put his proposal to the french royal government but after consideration it was rejected by the parliament de paris the first true tontine was therefore organised in the city of kampen in the netherlands in 1670 the key feature was that a relatively fixed payout amount which for example could be in the form of dividends or interest was shared equally among individual members of the tontine for as long as they lived which meant that in later years as the number of surviving members declined the payouts per member kept rising sometimes dramatically since their creation tontines have historically proven to be a more appealing source of lifetime income than annuities as recorded by economist adam smith in his book the wealth of nations first published in 1776 in which he stated that more money can always be raised by tontines than by annuities and as a result many variants of tontines have been used to raise capital or for retirement products or pension plans a shortcoming of the nature of a tontine is the existence of a perception that the subscribers having a financial incentive to do so might murder each other in some jurisdictions this perception may have contributed to the creation of practice or legislation that only insurance companies should be authorized to provide any type of mortality contingent products including tontines retirement investment plans are a recent and natural evolution of the industrial revolution of the last century according to wikipedia a canadian retirement savings plan rsp is a type of canadian account for holding savings and investment assets rrsps have various tax advantages compared to investing outside of tax preferred accounts they were introduced in 1957 to promote savings for retirement by employees and self employed people in the early 1970s a group of high earning individuals from kodak approached the us congress to allow a part of their salary to be invested in the stock market and thus be exempt from income taxes section 401 k was inserted into the internal revenue code making such tax exemptions plans possible and this was enacted into law in 1978 it was intended to allow taxpayers a break on taxes on deferred income in 1980 a benefits consultant and attorney named ted benna took note of the previously obscure provision and figured out that it could be used to create a simple tax advantaged way to save for retirement the client for whom he was working at the time chose not to create a 401 k plan he later went on to install the first 401 k plan at his own employer the 21st century has seen the emergence of distributed ledger technologies or blockchain technologies for immutable record keeping amongst parties that may wish to transact but which may or may not trust each other in the original paper openly published on may 24 2009 by nakamoto and titled bitcoin a peer to peer electronic cash system see url described a system where parties could transact with each other by means of pseudonymous accounts recorded on a public distributed ledger where each set of transactions which are appended into tamper proof ledger containing blocks of transactions to form a blockchain we have also seen the increasing emergence of advanced biometric identification technologies which can accurately detect whether biometric data is artificially created or is coming from a living source these technologies have enabled the creation of systems where users enter into transactions by proving their identity but with the incidental effect that these systems now have the potential to be used to prove the liveness of a particular individual and that a particular individual has not died through combining these technologies within a single system we can create a system where users can create pseudonymous accounts in a system where their transactions and status as well as the transactions and status of other pseudonymous members of the system transactions can be made wholly or partly conditional upon users interacting with the system to provide proof of life when authorising transactions and as such we can design these systems to safely permit mortality contingent transactions on a peer to peer basis thereby mitigating the need for the participation of a central counterparty such as an insurance company which typically comes with high costs which must be borne by members of the system and which on the evidence of the global financial crisis in 2008 can still expose members to the practices which were uncovered during the armstrong investigation 113 years earlier accordingly we can now use these technologies to create a system where peer to peer financial products such as tontines which can be safely operated without the significant costs and risks which can affect such products when offered by or guaranteed by governments corporations or life insurers as such the tontine system of this invention is designed around the precise needs of consumers such that groups of consumers can now safely self insure the financial risks of increasingly lengthy retirements through pooling their capital into a peer to peer longevity risk sharing system which can be constructed to offer members of the system lifetime income products such as tontines and or other annuity type products and where such peer to peer products can potentially have far lower running costs and as such would be able to offer better outcomes for the consumers than equivalent products traditionally offered by insurance companies this invention is part of a tontine system which can offer the following utility to consumers and pension providers a far more cost efficient solution for the millions of consumers across the planet currently investing an estimated 350bn per annum into annuity type products to secure suitable levels of income in retirement and a new type of commission system which will incentivize networks of financial advisors to take tontines to the global marketplace without the consumer having to bear the costs of advisor commissions out of their capital contributions rather than deducting sums from the customers capital in essence the fees and commissions can be wholly or partly settled using a medium of exchange the value of which is represented by its utility value to users including professional users of the tontine system itself an adaptive payout system which is designed to ensure that the system is always fully funded and as such eliminates the insolvency risk which affects consumers with entitlements that are or will become due from government state and corporate pension funds as well as many annuity providers and insurance companies user interfaces which can display accurate and realistic projections as to the potential payouts of the fund based upon near real time data thereby ensuring that users can make more informed investment decisions with the underlying projections being recreatable at any point in the future due to the data statistics being recorded in immutable ledgers there is additional background information please visit full patent to read further in addition to the background information obtained for this patent application newsrx journalists also obtained the inventor s summary information for this patent application the present invention is designed to overcome the shortcomings of the prior art and to provide an automated way of resolving the shortcomings of the prior art specifically for mitigating member fraud as well as the probability of human error by partially or fully automating the interaction between the tontine system the tontine members the auto actuary and the data it uses to make decisions by means of an auto actuary method to measure and fairly recalculate corrections on current and future payouts based on ever changing and evolving internal and external accessed risk data without human interaction communicating with a plurality of internal and external sources over the internet and updating by itself any required data in real time or at certain time intervals and in an automated form mathematically avoiding insolvency of the fund also referred to herein as the tontine by adapting the periodical payments to members as a result of recalculating the payouts every time any input data to the auto actuary changes the auto actuary forming part of a system and method of operating a peer to peer retirement savings system tontine system which allows for automatic correction of the longevity risk and wherein the composition but not the identities of the peer to peer retirement savings system members tontine members and the underlying assets are made publicly visible through the internet this removes the risk of double counting of assets or hidden liabilities as each tontine member will own a set of units or tokens biometrically tagged to their encrypted identity thereby ensuring that the member s share of underlying payout entitlements is tagged to her or him only during their lifetime or otherwise as prescribed by the member under the rules of the tontine to provide the ultimate security the ownership of the assets of the tontine system of this invention may be held within accounts recorded on a public block chain blockchain or through blockchain enabled remote custodians thus removing herewith the risk of insolvency through exposure to the balance sheets of any bank insurer or other centralized counterparty further to resolve the shortcoming seen in the entire prior art in that none provide an automated insolvency risk protection in one embodiment of the present invention the tontine system through the auto actuary system mitigates that risk completely by adopting a fully automated method to measure and decide corrections based on ever changing and evolving risk data accessed autonomously from internal and external sources auto actuary that auto corrects the tontine system periodic payouts amounts at any given time going forward this last method warrants the solvency of the tontines funds of tontine system for the duration of the payout period be it until the last surviving member or until a defined final payout date for distribution amongst all surviving members at such final payout date the invention does not require any human intervention for the normal operation once the tontine system initiates a tontine fund be it in any such known assets funds exchange traded funds company shares stock market index funds currencies digital assets cash governments bonds bonds or any combination as the auto actuary will take all required inputs not only from its starting databases but it will get by itself any more recent data from external sources 401 to 403 201 to 203 globally by itself though the internet and recalculate any and all outputs such as monthly payouts to the members of the tontine system fund members and performs automatically simulations to choose one case where the payout is the optimal of all the values that provide liquidity and positive cash flow until the date of the oldest member would be of an age equal to the set parameter at the start of the tontine for example 120 years old the auto actuary method or module that overcomes the shortcomings of the prior art provides an overall robust financial protection against insolvency and against potential human errors as the overall tontine system would be fully automatic running without any human intervention to keep the tontine running properly and payouts flowing until the expected end date the current invention offers through the auto actuary method a further solution to the prior art shortcoming of the necessity of manual interaction by employees or staff from a longevity risk sharing product to gather documentary evidence from heirs on the death of a member which in some cases is never provided as heirs may not even know of the member s pension fund in a further embodiment of the present invention the proprietary auto actuary interacts at certain intervals through the internet with a plurality of internal and or external sources globally to verify if any of the published deceased corresponds with a member of the tontine system and if so request an interaction with the actual member through an electronic application on the member s phone requiring a biometrical feedback eye scan and or fingerprint and or facial recognition and or any such other id confirmation method as proof of life in a further embodiment of the present invention the auto actuary requests at certain time intervals which may coincide with payout frequency set at the beginning or as decided by the auto actuary based upon the risk parameters of the tontine system fund or tontine for example every 1 or 3 months or so proof of life by a notification to the member on their smartphone tablet or other device or via an application on one of these devices if no proof of life is provided within a pre defined time the notification could repeat until a maximum number of tries for example 3 tries over a 3 month period then triggers a specific search at external sources for that specific member identity to confirm or disproof his death additionally the triggering event could send an email and or call a registered heir s phone number with a pre recorded digital voice inserting the member s name with a message to inform of a deadline to provide biometrical proof of life through the member s electronic application or otherwise interact with an oracle or other authoritative digital services whether private or civil which have the capability to certify as being dead or alive individual members must establish proof of life or otherwise and based upon the results of any of the above methods the auto actuary could then decide that the member has died and suspend payments or re allocate or cancel the validity of the expired members tokens in accordance with the conditions of how the tontine and the tontine system were established at the outset the shortcomings of the prior art have been addressed and resolved by the present invention and resolved by the novelties and different embodiments of the present invention such as but not limited to in a different embodiment of the present invention by using a combination of one or more methods or any combination thereof of modules that become operable when embedded into one or more systems or distributed systems or blockchains activating a peer to peer retirement savings system tontine system of this invention such tontine system having the ability to access multiple other distributed systems protocols oracles and other data sources through the internet in another embodiment the auto actuary becomes operable when embedded into a cloud based or a server based pension fund system or peer to peer retirement savings system tontine system of this invention such tontine system having alternatively several redundancy servers in different geographical regions in yet another embodiment of the present invention the auto actuary can interact by itself without human intervention with a plurality of asset exchanges and or third party data sources accessed through the internet such as etf exchanges bonds exchanges stock exchanges currency exchanges and so forth as to automatically change the investment composition of the tontine fund depending on the established portfolio asset allocation strategy or to make adjustments following a standardised model such as a risk parity portfolio model or other modem portfolio theory investment model or in response to pre defined risk criteria such as but not limited to valuation drop more than a prefixed valuation increase more than a pre fixed if crowd sourced news on the internet is recognised as a natural or manmade catastrophe nuclear incident or potential war that could adversely affect the valuation or return or expected mortality of one or all parts of a tontine to trigger an automated sale or additional buy if cash available if it is understood to positively affect valuation or return in a different embodiment of the present invention the auto actuary monitors meta data from the accounts or virtual wallets and interactions with the tontine members including but not limited to biometrical interactions to flag potential fraud or irregular or suspicious activities as part of risk management to reduce fraud risks in yet a different embodiment multiple tontine systems independently or interacting amongst them could form a global tontine wherein the auto actuary fully autonomously connects to a plurality of sources external databases or information accessed through the internet through the internet in each country and manage individual member payouts for example based upon the idl data international database on longevity from each of the members region or other such cohort specific data sources this allows for fairly calculated global pools of different nationalities with different longevity expectations yet with the ability to share degrees of risk between otherwise partially or completely distinct cohorts there is additional summary information please visit full patent to read further the claims supplied by the inventors are 1 a method for calculating implementing and remotely communicating accurate payout projections in or near real time with users of a peer to peer risk sharing pension fund tontine system

the respective app into the wd makes the app operable to access wd functions and also makes the app operable to communicate through the wd with the servers and the servers communicate with the wd and also to make the app detect and be operable with the hardware sensors or other biometric functionality of the wd and to transmit details of the functionality to the tontine system to confirm that the wd meets the required minimum biometric recognition functionality of the aasm and wherein b each server is adapted to upload a respective aasm over the internet and each server automatically upon upload of the respective aasm into a remote server makes the aasm operable to access server functions and also makes the aasm operable to communicate through the server with the wds and the wds communicate with the servers and wherein the aasm connects to external servers es through the internet these servers being different than the previous mentioned servers and wherein d the aasm fully autonomously interacts with the users of each wd wherein the users app receives notifications for the user to authenticate through providing data including the requested type of biometric information e g facial recognition eye recognition hand palm scan finger print scan voice recognition at regular time intervals monthly yearly e when the user accesses the app for example to respond to the notification the aasm will validate that such data being provided belongs to the userid being created and or authenticated f at the same time the aasm interacts with a server or an es capable of performing liveness detection upon the biometric information being transmitted to ensure that it is being generated in real time from the living user and thereby is neither an artificial biometric sample nor a legitimate biometric sample being used to authenticate access to system after the end of the user s life g once the user successfully authenticates their access to the tontine system whilst passing the liveness detection challenge the aasm creates and or updates the status of the users members account relating to the relevant userid to record that in the absence of any conflicting data to the contrary proof of life has been confirmed and that the user is a living member in the relevant period h the aasm updates the living members account relating to the userid to confirm that it is entitled to any upcoming relevant mortality credit mc related re allocations of tontine member units as well as any payouts in the period and transmits any new collected data including any updated facemap of the member to the tontine system to be appended to the ledgers in connection with the userid i the aasm then calculates and re allocates any tontine member units available as a result of mcs from the accounts of members who have not validated their member accounts by passing the liveness detection challenge or otherwise providing proof of life in a format recognised by the aasm before the cut off date for the relevant period of the same tontine system fund or pool j the aasm then re calculates in or near real time the predicted payouts for the relevant tontine system fund or pool using the latest data and risk factors and stores the updated forecasts on the ledgers from where the updated forecasts can be detected and downloaded to the app when the wd next connects to the internet thus enabling the users to view the updated forecasts in or near real time k at the end of any relevant period for each tontine system fund or pool the aasm communicates with and authorises and or instructs its or the tontine systems payment module or a payment module on an es to give initiate the relevant payout calculated by and predicted by the aasm for the period to each validated member of that tontine system fund or pool for the period and then updates the ledgers to record the payments made and to update the remaining predicted payout forecasts 2 the system of claim 1 wherein the wd functions accessed by the app are a biometrical authentication scanning functions as camera access and or b finger print scanner access and or microphone access and or d email contacts access and or e phone numbers contacts access wherein the previously listed accessed information by the app is send to the aasm and wherein f the aasm uses such biometrical and other information for any authentication interaction and as proof of life for the relevant period by interacting with a server or an es capable of performing liveness detection upon the biometric information being transmitted to ensure that it is being generated in real time from the living user and thereby is neither an artificial biometric sample nor a legitimate biometric sample being used to authenticate access to system after the end of the user s life and wherein g the aasm stores any relevant collected data including any detected health data of the member to its own ledgers in particular where such health or other data may be utilised in and potentially affect the ongoing risk factors calculations either for the member individually or for the tontine system as a whole and wherein h in the event of the user failing to successfully authenticate and pass the liveness detection test after a certain number of attempts in a defined period of elapsed time then the aasm may initiate a module within the aasm the tontine system or through an es to utilise the emails and phone numbers or other means of contact either for the user and or their designated contacts to deliver notifications that for automated contact if no proof of life has been is obtained for the user and to offer alternative means of providing such required proof if in fact the user is still alive or to initiate other processes including transfers of death benefits or inheritances where the user has passed away and or wherein i in the event of the aasm detecting a substantial variance in the health data or other data of the user as a result of analysing the biometric and liveness detection results and or when compared to previously saved data including health data that the aasm may initiate a module within the aasm the tontine system or through an es to utilise the emails phone numbers or other means of contact either for the user and or their designated contacts such as next of kin and or

conditions in alberta history for some bringing in comparisons to the dirty 30s hollywood couldn t have produced more horror for farmers and ranchers this year all of the precipitation came at the end

below article content for provinces like manitoba this was two years in the making and phillips said the concern is over multiple consecutive years of a lack of precipitation he pointed to regions like california that have been devastated by a decade of these types of conditions the climate specialist said producers have become much better at maximizing the moisture they do get making them more resilient but they can only weather so much lynn jacobson the president of the alberta federation of agriculture said there was a range of growing conditions across the province some producers had no crop others had a partial crop and then there were pockets of farmers who did ok but the bad outweighed the good issues were compounded for some producers who were locked into yield and were now having to buy out the majority of their deal with little grain to sell advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content livestock producers are still struggling to figure out how to make it through to the spring with many facing difficult choices about selling off breeding stock because they will not have the feed to get them through the winter jacobson said he heard reports of between 20 and 35 per cent of the provincial cow calf herd will be culled for this reason that s not just a short term impact but one that will hit producers for years to come if they decide to continue on and not retire it s going to be five years to build their herds back up if they really want to and to get the kind of animals that they want said jacobson 69 whose family has farmed near enchant alta since homesteading in 1905 it takes a while to recover from this and for some it was probably the last straw advertisement 6 story

program with the provinces combining for 322 million in funding for the 60 40 initiative 136 million of which came from the alberta government beef producers in alberta were able to apply for up to 200 per head through the program other changes were made through insurance programs that allowed farmers to open up lost crops to feed their herds without taking a penalty for the first time for many this meant their cattle fed on canola or other alternative grains advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content hay west 2021 was also activated as producers in eastern canada made their excess hay and feed available to western ranchers and farmers this built off a program created in the wake of the 2002 drought and

forward the lack of rain through the 2021 growing season means a lowered water table for next year and a potential for caps on irrigation from reservoirs the idea of more snow this winter and rain in the spring is music to jacobson s ears i think there s a lot of trepidation among producers but it s too soon to panic at this point in time he said about forecasts for 2022 there s still lots of time

and on other corporate initiatives following a successful first half of the year demand for natural gas in tanzania has again remained strong throughout the second half this strengthening in demand in 2021 is due to sustained economic growth continued demand in the industrial sector and partly due to lack of supply from hydro electric generation as a result of poor rainfall over the catchment areas of the hydro dams the company through its partnership in the mnazi bay joint venture continues to provide a reliable source of natural gas for domestic electricity generation thereby supporting tanzania to secure energy that is critical for its ongoing development and growth the average gross daily production rate from the mnazi bay gas field in december 2021 to date has been approximately 102 mmscf day and as a result of the stronger overall demand during 2021 the company expects to achieve a milestone average production rate for the calendar year of over 80 mmscf day exceeding the high end of the already upwardly revised guidance from june 2021 operational highlights the health and safety of employees remains paramount and robust precautionary measures have been and continue to be implemented to mitigate against the risk of covid 19 both in the field and in the dar es salaam office there has been no operational disruption due to covid 19 to date the company expects to achieve an annual average production rate for 2021 of more than 80 mmcf day above the high end of revised guidance for the year and significantly above the average rate in 2020 o updated guidance as of june 2021 was 70 80 mmcf day gross raised from 65 75 mmcf day gross o 2021 average daily production is approximately 23 higher than the average daily production rate in 2020 which was 65 mmcf day operational costs of production remain low due to continued focus on cost efficiencies and high degree of operational leverage at mnazi bay the mnazi bay jv partners have delivered on the 2021 work programme which was focused on ensuring reliability and sustainability of supply highlights include o slickline operations on the mb 4 mb 2 and ms 1x wells o refurbishment of the mb 1 well site superstructure which was completed significantly under budget o pre front end engineering and design feed study on installing a compressor station to the gas production facility at mnazi bay subject to regulatory approval of the 2022 budget the jv partners expect to continue with standard slickline operations to optimise the capacity of the mnazi bay field and to progress the compression project which is due for completion in 2023 as well as further evaluating opportunities to deliver additional gas supplies the company intends to explore and evaluate growth opportunities both within the mnazi bay licence and the greater geographical region to support increasing in country demand for natural gas strong and growing demand outlook tanesco announced in november that natural gas will be used to address a 345mw shortage gap of power to the national grid to compensate for the lack of capacity from its hydro electric power stations due to low water levels in the dams and rivers of the catchment areas as part of the plan tanesco intends to increase production by fast tracking maintenance of its natural gas plants at ubungo and expediting the completion of the kinyerezi i extension generation facility record financial results announced in september 2021 placing the company in the strongest financial position in its history with record revenue ebitdax and cash on hand tanzania petroleum development corporation continues to remain fully current with all invoices for gas sales tanzania electric supply company has repaid in full its outstanding arrears and is now fully up to

final dividend which would bring total capital returns for fy2021 to us 3 96 million corporate update planned board succession and refresh continued throughout the year with the appointment of tim bushell as non executive chairman and juliet kairuki as independent non executive director as part of the ongoing process of board refreshment john bentley will be stepping down at the end of this year to be replaced by an additional independent non executive director with the company in advanced stages of this search existing management team strengthened with the appointment of aaron leblanc as chief operating officer bringing extensive technical and managerial experience as well as a strong track record in tanzania growth within tanzania continues to be a key focus to capitalise on in country track record proven improving demand dynamics and operational performance sustainability priorities stakeholder engagement is key to wentworth s sustainability strategy strong relationships with in country partners including the government of tanzania and local communities are evidenced by ongoing demand growth operational performance and payment of receivables to further formalise its strategic focus on climate action and its broader esg priorities wentworth formed a board sustainability committee in september of this year with juliet kairuki appointed as chair providing greater oversight of the business esg risks and opportunities maintaining its robust esg framework remains a priority following the launch of the inaugural sustainability report this year the publication of the 2021 report is expected in april 2022 measurement and mitigation of climate related impacts is a critical component of wentworth s climate strategy in november a new agreement between wentworth and vitol sa was established to jointly develop new community focused carbon credit programmes in tanzania aligned to the un sustainable development goals o immediate objective is for wentworth to offset all scope 1 and 2 emissions and partially offset scope 3 emissions by 2022 o wentworth s emissions footprint remains one of the lowest in the uk listed e p sector on a scope 1 and 2 basis with an emissions intensity in 2020 of 0 42kg co2 boe 1 676 9t co2 e wentworth s priority is to take continuous action to reduce emissions as swiftly as possible with further progress made in 2021 on reduction initiatives to be outlined in the 2021 sustainability report katherine roe ceo commented as we reach the end of 2021 at wentworth we have been delighted to reflect on our many successes of the year our most recent being our expectation to beat our revised guidance and to achieve a milestone average production rate for 2021 of over 80 mmscf day the demand dynamics in tanzania are becoming increasingly compelling with an ambitious economic growth plan set to accelerate energy demand further over the coming years and whilst driving up energy access through our natural gas production has a transformational role to play on the socio economic outcomes for our communities in tanzania we have also used this year to ensure we are playing a responsible role in mitigating and minimising our impacts as much as we can and as quickly as we can our carbon offset partnership with vitol is evidence of this and we are excited about taking this journey with them for the benefit of our communities in country we thank john bentley for his invaluable contribution and many years of being part of our wentworth team he has been an integral part of the board during his tenure and he will be missed on both a professional and personal level looking ahead to year end we remain in the strongest position in our corporate history with half the company s market capitalisation backed by cash our robust fundamentals have ensured that we remain financially and operationally resilient allowing us to increase our returns to shareholders year on year we remain committed to our sustainable and progressive dividend policy and look forward to reporting back on full year performance in 2022 this is an outstanding operational update by any measure it ticks all the boxes that i or any investor could possibly ask for thus demand is strong with sustainable economic growth as well as in the industrial sector and the call for gas for domestic power generation set against a reduced output from local hydro electric power supply in that context mnazi bay produced 102 mmscf d in december giving average calendar production of over 80 mmscf d already up on previously upped guidance and which is a 23 increase on 2020 finances are incredibly strong tpdc is up to date with payments and tanesco has also fully paid its invoices so no receivables either the balance sheet is thus incredibly strong with the outlook as positive as could be imagined and with excellent fcf is placing the company in the strongest financial position in its history with record revenue ebitdax and cash on hand i could go on this strength has given the board the scope to be generous with the dividend if appropriate other distributions or even acquisitions are possible but the board has recently demonstrated its desire to stick to its knitting at which it is exemplary finally it also ticks the esg box its emissions footprint remains one of the lowest in the uk listed e p sector on a scope 1 and 2 basis with an emissions intensity in 2020 of 0 42kg co2 boe 1 676 9t co2 e wentworth must be one of the best value plays in the market its cash of 24m post divvi payments looks incredibly strong against a market cap of 40m and the outlook is incredibly positive investors should take another look at wentworth set against any value metrics a doubling of the share price would not make them look expensive a jewel in the sector indeed petrotal corp petrotal provides operational update oil production reaches 20 000 bopd and a pipeline settlement framework for pump station 5 petrotal has achieved a trailing 5 day unconstrained production rate ending december 15 2021 of approximately 20 200 barrels of oil per day with wells 8h and 9h producing over 6 300 bopd and 8 200 bopd respectively petrotal was able to achieve its long standing goal of exceeding 20 000 bopd much earlier than anticipated and previously guided petrotal has reached this milestone only four years after commencing operations at the bretana oil field in early 2018 an indication of operational excellence perseverance and teamwork robust production from well 9h shows that well 9h is delivering a strong initial production profile having averaged approximately 8 200 bopd over the last 10 days and trending very close to the performance of well 8h in addition well 10h commences drilling as petrotal commenced drilling well 10h on december 11 2021 this long reach horizontal well is similarly located to well 9h and is estimated to cost 13 9 million with a targeted completion date in early february 2022 ptal also announced a settlement framework reached at pump station 5 whereby it advises that a joint framework was reached between the communities ministry of energy and mines and petroperu that demonstrates trust and a commitment to ongoing dialogue which has resulted in the expected return of pump station 5 back to petroperu on december 16 2021 as a gesture of goodwill toward longer term solutions once petroperu restarts operations at pump station 5 it will take approximately one week to complete the required inspections needed to fully recommence oil throughput in the northern peruvian pipeline based on this forecast it is still likely petrotal will have to constrain production after december 16 2021 for up to two weeks to manage storage capacity at which time it expects to go back to levels near 20 000 bopd in november and december petrotal will export nearly 320 000 barrels of oil through the brazil sales route commencing in january 2022 estimated brazilian oil exports will be approximately 240 000 barrels monthly and expected to increase further in q2 2022 manuel pablo zuniga pflucker president and chief executive officer commented we are very pleased at the progress made at pump station 5 and the demonstration of trust and goodwill shown by the communities this together with the initiatives petrotal is pursuing is expected to lead to long term stability for the region at a critical time for the new talara refinery that is expected to start operation in 2022 peruvian producers the local communities and petroperu i would also like to thank our team for their dedication and perseverance over the past four years enabling petrotal to achieve our original 20 000 bopd goal i am humbled by the expertise and drive our team continues to demonstrate through unprecedented operating conditions additionally i d like to thank our shareholders for their ongoing support patience and confidence as we continue development of the prolific bretana oil field petrotal end the year on a very strong note with production smashing the target with more to come and also having a settlement at pump station 5 which assists stability in the area at a time when there is plenty of upside my 60p target is very much achievable given the gearing effect of crude going through the petrotal system 2022 looks like a good time to be a shareholder of petrotal union jack oil egdon resources union jack notes that the operator egdon resources plc aim edr of several projects in which the company holds material interests has today updated the market on their progress the wressle 1 well continues to comfortably exceed initial expectations of 500 barrels of oil per day gross since the successful completion of the proppant squeeze and subsequent coiled tubing operations on 19 august 2021 works completed to upgrade the gas incineration system production site upgrades ongoing well flowing under a highly restricted choke of 20 64 of an inch well has produced high quality oil at a constrained rate during ongoing upgrades at an average rate of 666 barrels of oil per day bopd following the upgrade of the gas incineration system 266 barrels net to union jack plus 368 000 cubic feet of gas 147 200 cubic feet net to union jack over the past seven days equating to a gross 727 barrels of oil equivalent per day zero formation water produced to date secondary separator system has been designed and manufactured and is expected to be installed before the year end to optimise gas oil separation early 2022 will see completion of testing of the full potential of the well decisions will be made in q1 2022 on the plateau production rate to match with longer term operational objectives and prudent reservoir management downhole pressure data has been acquired and is currently being interpreted to further inform these decisions focus during 2022 will move to progressing the optimal method of gas monetisation and finalising plans for the development of other hydrocarbon bearing zones to access the identified material contingent resources with particular focus on the penistone flags reservoir keddington pedl005 r union jack 55 interest an independent detailed sub surface review of the keddington oil field and the surrounding licence area has highlighted an opportunity to increase production via a new development side track well for which planning is already in place reservoir engineering work has been completed by erce confirming a target area in the south east of the licence area which would add up to 85 000 to 120 000 barrels of recoverable oil which could be produced and monetised using the existing production equipment already in place and being utilised on site well specific modelling and detailed planning will be completed in the coming period with a view to being in a position to drill the side track well during 2022 additional near field exploration opportunities have been identified at keddington south gross mean prospective resources of circa 635 000 barrels of oil 350 000 barrels net to union jack and the louth prospect gross mean prospective resources of circa 600 000 barrels of oil circa 330 000 barrels net to union jack which could be accessed from the existing well site in due course biscathorpe pedl253 union jack 45 interest on 1 november 2021 the planning application for a side track drilling operation associated testing and long term oil production at the biscathorpe site was refused by lincolnshire county council llc despite being recommended for approval by the council s planning officers the formal decision notice was issued on 6 december 2021 and the operator is currently reviewing in detail the reasons for refusal with their planning and legal advisers and considering other options which is likely to lead to an appeal north kelsey pedl241 union jack 50 interest planning applications were submitted to llc in early december 2021 to extend the existing planning consents by 12 months and amend the bottom hole target location for the planned north kelsey well the applications have now been validated and the consultation period has begun subject to receipt of planning consent the north kelsey well could be drilled later in 2022 financial update as of 16 december 2021 cash balance of 6 068 000 as of 16 december 2021 revenue and investment receivables are an additional circa 600 000 principally oil production and north sea royalty projected revenues to 31 december 2021 expected to be in excess of 1 760 000 2020 audited 241 467 net asset value as at 16 december 2021 is 20 281 000 debt free executive chairman of union jack david bramhill commented this timely operational and financial update provides tangible confirmation of the progress being made by union jack wressle is still in the infancy of its development and despite restricted flow and continuing site upgrades net revenues to union jack have been material since mid august 2021 we announced on 27 october 2021 that wressle had generated us 1 000 000 of net revenues to the company and we look forward to announcing the next net revenue milestone early in 2022 when the planned site upgrades are complete we await with anticipation the scale of the net revenues available from wressle in respect of a full year of production as we believe these contributions will be transformational for union jack keddington and fiskerton oil fields also provide additional revenue which support our projected year end 2021 net revenues this operational and financial update provides information on the assets where union jack is in joint venture with egdon resources plc it is prudent to mention our 16 665 investment in west newton of which drilling results and a series of extended well tests have confirmed the presence of substantial onshore hydrocarbon resources within the kirkham abbey formation of the west newton a 1 a 2 and b1z wells as previously announced a number of external studies are currently in process encompassing a wide range of reservoir analysis in order to offer direction on how to achieve satisfactory and commercial flow rates from these wells preliminary reports are encouraging and we would expect to be in a position to offer a comprehensive update to the market in early 2022 on this material project that represents significant value potential in our portfolio once the first phase of this work has been finalised with the planned activity across our material projects we believe that there will be a steady stream of rns announcements updates research publications and reports published throughout 2022 union jack is in a sound position both operationally and financially and we look forward to the future with enthusiasm union jack has had by pretty much any standards a very good year operationally which is by no means reflected in the share price which has underperformed significantly you only have to look at the numbers in the update above to see that as owner of a substantial portfolio of onshore uk assets some of which are throwing off meaningful cash in particular wressle which has exceeded all expectations as and when it can shake off this malaise i expect the share price to rise dramatically which would be only what they deserve petrofac petrofac issues the following pre close trading update for the year ending 31 december 2021 continued strong performance in eps but covid 19 disruption continues to impact e c project schedules and costs group net profit broadly in line with market expectations for 2021 supported by tax provision releases of us 17 million in h1 and approximately us 35 million in h2 new order intake 1 of us 2 0 billion in the year to date increased from us 0 5 billion at half year with eps on track to deliver a book to bill of 1 0x for the full year comprehensive refinancing completed following resolution of sfo investigation year end net debt 2 expected to be broadly flat versus q3 at approximately us 0 2 billion on track to deliver cost saving target of c us 250 million by year end 3 well positioned with a group pipeline of us 40 billion for award in 2022 of which 7 billion is in new energies sami iskander petrofac s group chief executive commented in 2021 petrofac has taken an important step forward closing out the sfo investigation and embedding a strategy focused on future growth during this period we have continued to deliver projects and operations safely for our clients worldwide despite the ongoing challenges of the covid 19 pandemic which continue to impact our current e c portfolio earlier this year i set out a plan to rebalance reshape and rebuild petrofac the recent refinancing has provided a long term stable capital structure for the business and largely completes the work to rebalance the group operationally we are making good progress in reshaping the organisation to consistently deliver to best in class global standards through local execution our priority is to now rebuild our order backlog we secured us 1 5 billion of new awards in the second half to date and the outlook for awards is improving in a more supportive macro environment petrofac s cost competitive model and strong client relationships mean that we are well positioned with a healthy pipeline of opportunities scheduled for award in 2022 while challenges will persist in 2022 i remain confident about the prospects for petrofac over the medium term as we capitalise on our strong positions in attractive and growing markets and accelerate our progress in new energies where we see significant near and long term growth in exciting areas such as offshore wind carbon capture waste to value and hydrogen i listened to the petrofac conference call this morning and i was pleased but not surprised to hear the management to be very upbeat since the sfo investigation ended and the new management moved in there is much upside not just in areas where they have been effectively banned but as the effects of 75 oil and a boom in the middle east should feed through to the order book the shares are exceptional value at 110p and if allowed i would be tucking in hunting hunting has today issued a year end trading update the group will be reporting its 2021 full year results on thursday 3 march 2022 trading during the final quarter of 2021 has remained in line with management s expectations with a broadly break even ebitda result anticipated for the full year us onshore activity continues to strengthen benefiting the hunting titan operating segment whose results remain ahead of expectations within the north america operating segment the us manufacturing subsea and trenchless businesses have reported improving revenues which has led to a higher absorption of fixed costs and stable operating profits during the quarter the emea operating segment continues to report subdued trading however cost management measures implemented earlier in the year are now significantly narrowing trading losses in asia pacific the segment has also seen an improvement in sales leading to a broadly break even result being reported in november the group s order book has strengthened by c 20 in the three months to 30 november 2021 with a significant uptick reported in north america and europe the order book will increase further in december following strong contract wins by hunting s subsea business coupled with a general increase in successful bidding within the group s us and asia pacific businesses overall management believe that the group has seen a notable improvement in its trading performance during the quarter supported by the current pricing of oil and natural gas which is anticipated to continue to the year end and into 2022 trading momentum is further supported by the ongoing drive to secure non oil and gas sales the group s balance sheet remains strong with a cash and bank position of 77 2 million as at 3 december 2021 capital expenditure outflows remain low and management continues to closely manage working capital as market conditions stabilise further the group is now likely to conclude the arrangements for its new asset based lending facility in the coming weeks as due diligence is completed by the lending group following further due diligence the board has also decided to postpone its plans to launch a level two american depositary receipt programme however this decision may be revisited at a later date jim johnson chief executive of hunting commented while the speed of the oilfield services recovery during the year has been hindered by covid 19 strong capital controls by our end user clients and geopolitical volatility the group exits 2021 with a more stable trading outlook supported by the strong pricing of oil and gas coupled with management s ongoing actions to address hunting s cost base we expect 2022 to show further improvements to revenue and profitability with our technology service offering and quality assured products being in demand by clients as new projects commence and activity levels improve seeing hunting produce such a positive statement and particularly the way it is weighted towards the end of the year is very exciting indeed and that s not just from a hunting geek either firstly this is a genuinely good quarter and many good things are coming together from a strong market due to 75 oil made better by the company s continuing attack on costs which must see very attractive margin growth secondly those of us followers who have over the years christened hunting as a company that goes home for christmas after thanksgiving are now pleasantly surprised at how good things are getting and might well be even better for next year as they say over there i would bet a dollar to a wet doughnut that these shares will at least double in the next few months and they will work up to christmas eve this year jim johnson has a really good team together in the woodlands and i will be asking santa to get them to do an analysts visit next year and to include me my recent visit to houston made me think the oil sector is buzzing it certainly is jadestone energy jadestone energy provide the following update on operations and company guidance for 2021 achieved the target of delivering around 20 000 boe d of production by year end 2021 driven by strong performance from the montara h6 well and initial flows from skua 11 post workover 2021 average annual production expected to be around the midpoint of the 11 500 13 500 boe d guidance range 2021 unit production cost guidance is unchanged at us 25 50 29 50 boe with unit opex at year end expected to be significantly below the lower end of this range due to the recent increase in production 2021 major spending is now expected to be toward the upper end of the previous guidance range of us 105 115 million as a result of additional work undertaken to successfully complete the montara activity programme during the fourth quarter of 2021 to date company production has averaged approximately 17 800 boe d this has been largely driven by strong performance from montara reflecting ongoing steady production from the montara h6 infill well and more recently the addition of skua 11 following its successful workover which included reperforating the heel of the well with the aim of enhancing its production potential production from montara has been impacted by some rig related downtime at the field associated with the activity programme the skua 11 workover also took longer than anticipated due to the need to replace the subsea tree while a downhole component failed to function at the later stages of the skua 10 activity however the skua 10 workover operation is now practically complete with the montara subsea wells currently shut in to facilitate the rigging down and hook up of the skua 10 well and safe departure of the rig prior to this shutdown group production averaged 20 000 boe d over a five day period and is expected to increase further once both of the skua wells are brought back onstream paul blakeley president and ceo commented we are very pleased to be concluding the montara activity programme with no safety incidents to date and with the addition of skua 11 production we have already met our target of delivering 20 000 boe d production by year end 2021 we now expect to reap the benefits of higher production and attractive pricing given ongoing oil price strength our unhedged position and recent improvements in the tapis differential i m very happy with the performance at jadestone it is based on top quality management doing what they do deliver the goods and despite the adversity of covid and various corporate shenanigans have stuck to their plans and the share price is a testament to that the only piece of bad news is that due to the management being holed up in australia and singapore they havent been seen i m looking forward to their next presentation over here orcadian orcadian energy has announce its audited results for the twelve months ended 30 june 2021 highlights primary activity was preparing for the company s admission to trading on aim following the end of the period under review orcadian admitted to aim in july 2021 raising gross proceeds of 3 million receipt of letter of no objection from the oil and gas authority oga and entry into the authorisation phase of development planning for the pilot field received three expressions of interest for the provision of an fpso for the pilot development entered into a non binding heads of terms with carrick resources limited carrick in respect of a sub area of licence p2320 which covers the carra prospect carra cash position as at 15th december 2021 of over 1 5 million selected by the oga to evaluate an approach to the electrification of north sea oil and gas platforms which will dramatically cut carbon emissions steve brown orcadian s ceo said the last financial year has been transformational for the company whilst these results record our position at the end of june 2021 the rest of this year has seen the company make significant progress in delivering its strategy we were admitted to trading on aim a market of the london stock exchange on admission we raised gross proceeds of 3m and since then we have finalised the concept select process and moved to the authorisation phase for our flagship pilot development whilst earlier this month we surpassed twenty six other companies or consortia to win funding of 466 667 in the oga electrification competition the publishing of results is often a time for reflection but from our perspective time spent resting on laurels is time wasted our focus for 2022 will be to seek to secure the financing for the pilot project and to secure a customer for the platform electrification solution we will design in the coming months we are determined to show the industry and the world that it is possible to produce the oil and gas that regular customers need in a cost effective way and with much much lower emissions we will do this on pilot and we believe our electrification system will offer an opportunity for other operators on the ukcs to reduce emissions as rapidly as possible north sea businesses can show the world how to produce oil and gas with much lower emissions helping to drive out high cost and high emissions production elsewhere in the world we are proud of the role we are playing in this we look forward to 2022 with optimism and energy and look forward to a sea change in attitudes to responsible oil and gas development projects and to the market continuing to recognise the significant value in our projects steve brown is right and it is the work that has been completed since the results date that makes orcadian such a compelling investment this is a stock for the future a lower emissions play that will make their projects world class another with a really

dolores adams 86 recently forked over a 36 copay for prescription blood thinner but she s never had to before and doesn t understand the sudden cost she s not alone in her confusion research shows that about 80 million adults in the u s have limited health literacy defined as the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions one survey the national assessment of adult literacy found that the problem more profoundly affects those 65 or older with a higher percentage considered having below basic or basic health literacy health literacy became popularized in the 1990s when the first assessment revealed that many americans are unprepared to make health care decisions in the era of covid 19 experts say health literacy has grown even more important harvard university professor rima rudd a pioneer in health literacy education and policy was one of the first researchers to study the link between patients literacy skills and health outcomes in an interview rudd said health literacy has been studied very narrowly as an attribute of the patient alone but she and other experts believe literacy develops or diminishes based on the quality of interactions between patients and health care professionals and systems she emphasized that it s the provider s responsibility to help bolster literacy not just through availability of information but also accessibility we need to approach people with dignity not talk down to them work with them to make sure that there is clarity and good access to information she said it s our responsibility to make sure that information is accessible we ve paid too much attention to availability and not enough attention to accessibility with covid 19 readily available information hasn t always clearly explained what the disease is what a pandemic declaration means how the virus that causes covid 19 spreads or whether masks are an effective deterrent covid 19 messaging is an example of what not to do said rachel roberts manager of community health engagement and strategy at the institute for healthcare advancement a nonprofit in orange county california aimed at improving health literacy older adults in particular were very confused roberts said they didn t have access in some cases to the internet or they didn t use the internet or they just were on the tv watching news roberts said that s where we really saw this big gap in terms of understanding dr cliff coleman associate professor of family medicine at oregon health and science university and an advocate for efforts to improve literacy said poor health literacy skills are a primary cause for hesitancy about covid 19 vaccines a march study published in the journal of public health found that people with a low health literacy score were more likely to be covid 19 vaccine hesitant instead of pro vaccination the covid 19 pandemic has caused all of us to really need to kind of ramp up our vocabulary coleman said for the first time the public is thinking about things like herd immunity and full vaccination or full immunity terms that we might use in public health environments that people haven t been used to for older adults navigating complex health care information is even more challenging coleman said especially for those suffering from cognitive decline or sensory problems such as vision or hearing loss that hamper communication we don t really know why older adults score lower on health literacy tests he said specifically we don t know if we as adults sort of lose health literacy skills as we get older or if formal education has changed so much in the intervening years that people just don t have the same foundational knowledge if i m 70 years old and i think back to what i learned about human biology way back when i was in school all of that science has completely changed now and it may be that my understanding is just obsolete we just don t really know adams the woman who was surprised by her medication copay acknowledged that the older she gets the less she comprehends after her husband was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis years ago she became more intentional about asking doctors questions and bringing along a younger family member to appointments i ask a lot of questions because if you don t participate they don t offer up that information not unless you really ask said adams who lives in toms river new jersey adams said she also finds frequently used medical jargon confusing that use of technical jargon helped prompt passage in congress of the plain writing act of 2010 which requires federal agencies to use clear communication in any publicly released information or documents it defines plain language as writing that is clear concise well organized and follows other best practices appropriate to the subject or field and intended audience barbra kingsley chair of the center for plain language a virginia nonprofit that assists government agencies and businesses with clear communication said the act increased support for health literacy backed by plain language plain language benefits everyone no matter what education level what level of expertise she said although the use of plain language has increased across health care the inclusion of health literacy in medical school curriculum remains limited according to a 2010 survey of 61 medical institutions 72 of respondents said health literacy was part of the curriculum but the median time spent teaching about it was only three hours out of four years of instruction none of these medical school residents have had any significant training in health literacy coleman said at least not to the degree that it s really stuck with them or changed their behaviors and the way they interact with patients because training is so limited he said many health care professionals don t even know what health literacy means or how to use it when interacting with patients the increase of misinformation on such social media platforms as facebook and twitter only further highlight the need for more education for both providers and patients coleman said and when messages are forwarded by friends and relatives he added that can convey a sense of trustworthiness in the message that i think many people will put more stock and more value in rather than hearing it from a public service message system or public health information system like rudd and other experts coleman said combating this has to begin with the provider not the patient of course we as a society could do better in educating people but that goes back to starting with early childhood education and it ll take us a long time he said training the health care workforce to provide clear communication at every point of contact with every patient is the way to do this put things into the simplest message possible with every patient every time that s going to be the solution

revenue increased 20 percent in the third quarter compared to the prior year or 17 percent on an organic basis the revenue growth was broad based across all segments with growth of 20 percent in the americas 17 percent in emea and 21 percent in the other category supply chain disruptions in the americas in the current year resulted in extended lead times shipment delays and adjustments to delivery schedules which the company estimates caused at least 35 million of revenue to shift from the third quarter into the fourth quarter compared to at least 40 million of revenue which the company estimates shifted from the second quarter into the third quarter for similar reasons revenue in the prior year was impacted by approximately 60 million due to a temporary global operations

percent in the third quarter compared to the prior year orders grew 36 percent in the americas driven by strong broad based growth orders grew 31 percent in emea driven by growth across all markets

organic revenue growth organic order growth americas 20 17 36 emea 17 17 31 other category 21 20 87 steelcase inc 20 17 40 our third quarter order growth of 40 percent was better than we expected and builds on our strong recovery momentum from last quarter said sara armbruster president and ceo however like many other industries we continue to be impacted by a significant number of supply chain disruptions causing us to extend lead times and delay some shipments which negatively impacted our third quarter revenue more than we had anticipated we remain optimistic as our strong order growth reflects the investments companies are making in their office based workplace strategies third quarter operating income of 15 9 million represented an increase compared to breakeven operating income and adjusted operating income of 11 4 million in the prior year the americas reported operating income of 11 1 million which compares to operating income of 13 8 million and adjusted operating income of 25 2 million in the prior year with the decrease due to lower gross margin in the current year emea reported operating income of 8 3 million compared to an operating loss of 3 7 million in the prior year driven by higher revenue and higher gross margin in the current year the other category reported operating income of 2 0 million compared to an operating loss of 2 2 million in the prior year due to higher revenue in the current year we are delighted with the strong results in emea and asia pacific this quarter as emea reported its most profitable quarter in over 10 years and asia pacific received orders for a significant number of large projects and rebounded strongly after a soft start to the year due primarily to the impact of covid in india said dave sylvester senior vice president and cfo our profitability improvement initiatives in emea are delivering results and our investments to drive growth in asia pacific are paying off gross margin of 27 6 percent in the third quarter represented a decrease of 120 basis points compared to the prior year which included 2 3 million of restructuring costs in the americas gross margin declined by 370 basis points in the americas improved by 500 basis points in emea and improved by 150 basis points in the other category the decline in the americas was due to approximately 27 million of higher inflation net of pricing benefits and approximately 10 million of higher freight and labor costs and inefficiencies associated with the supply chain disruptions in the current year partially offset by the benefits of higher revenue the improvements in emea and the other category were primarily due to higher revenue and favorable shifts in business mix we estimate our earnings would have been approximately three times higher this quarter if not for the year over year impact of the extraordinary inflation net of pricing benefits and the higher costs associated with the supply chain disruptions said dave sylvester senior vice president and cfo we expect the benefits from the three price increases we ve implemented this year plus the eventual moderation of supply chain challenges to become a tailwind to earnings in fiscal 2023 versus the significant headwinds we ve faced so far this fiscal year operating expenses of 187 7 million in the third quarter represented an increase of 18 9 million but a decline of 190 basis points as a percentage of revenue compared to the prior year the current year included approximately 13 million of higher marketing and sales expenses approximately 6 million of higher discretionary spending and employee costs in other functional areas and 3 5 million from acquisitions partially offset by 2 9 million of lower variable compensation expense income tax expense of 2 4 million in the third quarter reflected an effective tax rate of approximately 20 percent which included 1 2 million of discrete tax benefits in the prior year the company recorded an income tax benefit of 6 3 million which was primarily driven by benefits available under the u s coronavirus aid relief and economic security act total liquidity comprised of cash and cash equivalents and the cash surrender value of company owned life insurance aggregated to 445 2 million at the end of the third quarter total debt was 482 9 million during the third quarter the company repurchased a total of 1 8 million shares of its class a common stock for a total cost of 23 1 million a total of 7 6 million remained under the company s share repurchase authorization at the end of the third quarter the board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0 145 per share to be paid on or before january 10 2022 to shareholders of record as of december 27 2021 outlook at the end of the third quarter the company s backlog of customer orders was approximately 800 million which was approximately 47 percent higher than the prior year and approximately 13 percent higher than at the end of the second quarter on an organic basis the backlog includes a higher than historical percentage of orders scheduled to ship beyond the fourth quarter as a result the company expects fourth quarter fiscal 2022 revenue to be in the range of 740 to 765 million the company reported revenue of 677 1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 which benefited from shipment delays of approximately 60 million due to a temporary global operations shutdown in the third quarter of the prior year the projected revenue translates to growth of 9 to 13 percent compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and a similar range of organic growth when adjusted for acquisitions and currency translation effects the company expects diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 to be approximately breakeven the estimate reflects projected gross margin of between 26 5 and 27 including 1 inflation net of pricing benefits of approximately 20 million as compared to the prior year 2 supply chain disruptions and related costs similar to the third quarter and 3 unfavorable shifts in business mix compared to the third quarter the earnings per share estimate also reflects projected operating expenses of between 193 to 198 million including the viccarbe acquisition and projected interest expense investment income and other income net of approximately 5 million steelcase reported earnings per share of 0 06 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we remain optimistic about our growth prospects as companies complete projects that had been paused and work on new projects that

you for joining the call today i hope you re each enjoying this holiday season which in many ways feels closer to normal even as we remain watchful of covid developments the ongoing balance of moving forward in our new normal while continuing to remain cautious made our second quarter especially meaningful this year we ve stayed in close touch with families and educators as they navigated a new school year thankfully for the most part finally back in the classroom we ve shared these insights throughout the company while increasing our reach in fact this fiscal year to date we ve increased our parent reach through email by almost sixfold and as we ve seen throughout our 101 year history it s this deep relationship that yet again contributed to positive results because of our ability to meet real time needs and to evolve all of these efforts led to a 29 increase in revenues and an approximately 30 million improvement in operating income while ken will provide you with specific details of our second quarter results i d like to address what i expect is the upper most question in most people s minds given our experience with covid during the past 18 months or so and that s the question are our book fairs back well i m pleased to say that yes our book fairs business is coming back as with all covid impacted businesses our optimism comes with caution due to the unpredictable nature of the virus but overall we believe we have made significant steps in moving beyond the pandemic and with the confidence that while repeated wide scale school closures are unlikely we have systems in place to manage through it all we ve not yet reached pre pandemic levels of book fair bookings which was not in our outlook however we have exceeded our expectations with higher than anticipated revenue per fair significant increase in revenue per fair as well as the demand for scholastic book clubs tells us that our customers agree to getting books in the hands of kids is a priority as we all reemerge from the pandemic related to book clubs this is where we ve been most deeply affected by the industrywide labor shortage additionally affected by discrete system issue a large backlog of orders which we continue to address has been diligently worked on by our staff at our jefferson city warehouse our staff are also staying in close contact with customers to offer digital opportunities to enhance literary experiences in the classroom as they await their orders i had the pleasure of visiting our flagship warehouse myself this past quarter and i must share that

adjusted results for the second quarter excluding one time items unless otherwise indicated please refer to our press release tables and sec filings for a complete discussion of one time costs and legal settlements we started the school year with strong demand across all of our channels but most notably in our book fairs channel where the pandemic essentially shut us down at the start of the prior school year our trade channel continue to dominate best seller list and our education solutions business has strong results as well we are experiencing higher costs for labor and product in our book clubs channel the scarcity of labor led to delays in the shipment of product to our customers the pandemic continued to impact some of our foreign operations normally in asia australia and new zealand overall we are very pleased with our results which exceed our expectations revenues for the second quarter grew to 524 2 million versus 406 2 million in the prior year period operating income in the second quarter was 84 3 million versus 54 3 million last year net income was 69 million compared to 39 4 million last year and adjusted ebitda was 113 7 million compared to 77 7 million in the second quarter of last year earnings per diluted share was a 1 93 compared to 1 15 last year net cash provided by operating activities was 78 million compared to 46 1 million in the second quarter last year free cash flow for the quarter was 75 4 million compared to 30 9 million last year for the six month period net cash provided by operating activities was 141 6 million compared to 20 1 million in the prior year and free cash flow was 124 5 million in the current year compared to a free cash use of 4 million last year an improvement of 128 5 million reflecting the company s recovery from the pandemic the cost savings initiatives implemented last year and the first quarter tax refund at the end of the quarter cash and cash equivalents exceeded total debt by 286 4 million compared to 161 8 million at the end of the second fiscal quarter a year ago capital expenditures and capitalized pre publication costs in the second quarter were 30 million compared to 15 2 million last year this limited spending was focused on our technology platforms and digital products and services domestic inventory purchases for the fiscal year of 172 4 million increased 20 7 million over last year s purchases but still remain substantially below historical levels as the company was able leverage inventory on hand and continues to improve processes and tools to manage inventory levels as demand changes given the strong cash flow in october we paid down the remaining 75 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility which we renegotiated and extended during the current quarter increasing our borrowing capacity to 300 million under the facility also in the second quarter we restarted our share buyback program which we suspended at the outset of the pandemic through today we have reacquired over 134 000 shares for 5 million now turning to our quarterly segment results in children s book publishing and distribution our biggest objective for the fiscal year is the recovery of book fairs business heading out of the pandemic fortunately almost all u s schools this year are opening for in person learning and book fairs revenue of 176 2 million exceeded the prior period revenue of 47 7 million our in person fairs execute for the fall season are now approximately 70 of fall of calendar year 2019 pre pandemic levels as demand for our school fair is strong and ahead of our expectations we have also used the time during the pandemic to improve our data analytics capabilities more closely meeting our book fairs customers needs and driving higher traffic at in person book fairs accordingly as peter alluded revenue per fair has increased 12 3 on a same fair basis when compared to pre pandemic levels in the fall of calendar year 2019 we expect the spring season to increase sequentially from the fall albeit a slower pace than the sequential increase seen in the current period as we continue to closely match our capacity with our demand trade continued the strong run as revenues of 124 4 million modestly trailed the prior period revenue of 129 3 million which included the release of jk rowling s the ickabog strong performance from frontlist releases were bolstered by continued strong demand for the backlist titles and our on screen adaptations for its scholastic brand awareness and drove front and backlist product sales book clubs revenue of 51 9 million trailed the prior period reported revenue of 67 million the decline in revenue was not the result of a lack of demand as orders for the period were ahead of our expectations labor shortages at our primary distribution facility in jefferson city missouri combined with system implementation growing pains led to a backlog of orders as of november 30 2021 our back orders for book clubs stood at 21 3 million or 18 4 million higher than the same time last year our distribution facility has increased wages and incentives and now has sufficient warehouse associates and expects to work down this backlog early in the new calendar year total children s book publishing and distribution revenues for the current quarter of 352 5 million greatly exceeded the prior period revenues of 244 million and operating income of 85 2 million exceeded the prior period operating income of 35 4 million as a result of the increased revenues education solutions has strong quarter with revenues of 79 5 million exceeding the prior period revenues of 67 5 million operating income performance was stronger still but quarterly operating income of 15 6 million exceeding the prior year performance of 10 3 million magazine revenue and subscription rates have come back strong post pandemic but quarterly revenue from magazines exceeding the prior year by 2 7 million as incremental magazine subscriptions which have a digital component have low marginal costs these revenues greatly add to the bottom line digital revenues approximately budget in prior year or teaching resources which benefit from the pandemic receded to pre pandemic levels digital product gross bookings for the full year are ahead of last year s pace as peter mentioned the company continues its focus on diverse voices in our publishing with strong sales of rising voices highlighting the quarter international segment revenues of 92 2 million for the prior period revenues of 94 7 million operating income of 9 million likewise trailed the prior period of 19 5 million prior year operating income include 2 8 million of covid related government subsidies canada is rebounding well from the pandemic as schools across canada are largely open the u k operation school channels are slowly returning to normal than canada or the u s australia and new zealand saw widespread lockdowns in the current year that they did not experience earlier in the pandemic and as a result had substantially lower revenues compared to the prior year second quarter in november restrictions began to lift in australia and are now beginning to ease in new zealand as vaccination rates increased dramatically sales across asia were down from the prior period asia struggles were twofold first covid restrictions hindered the direct sales business throughout malaysia and thailand and second chinese government restrictions around tutoring and foreign content drove down revenues from china as the company its distributors and customers continue to work through these new restrictions unallocated overhead costs of 25 5 million exceeded the prior year unallocated cost by 14 6 million increased wages and related costs at the company s jefferson city missouri distribution facility result in 5 6 million of the increase over the prior period higher accrued bonuses and litigation settlement of 1 3 million also contributed to the increase in the quarter we continued our optimization of workspace by selling our office and warehouse in lake mary florida recognizing proceeds of 10 4 million and a gain on the sale of 6 2 million and also entered into an agreement to sell a company owned distribution facility in the u k with net proceeds to be realized in march of 2022 last year we were able to dramatically reduce costs in the face of the pandemic during the years preceding the pandemic we execute on our 2020 plan mostly technology driven program designed to reduce costs and allow for more efficient processes and better product and customer data analytics the 2020 plan result in the implementation of new tools and processes that enable us to save over 100 million during the year of the pandemic and an estimated 50 million annual reduction in our cost base additionally the move to cloud based systems enable to us remain connected and work seamlessly while working remotely throughout the pandemic this foundational work will continue to benefit us as we move forward we now have new variable cost challenges in the form of inflationary pressures for product transportation and labor product cost for printing paper and inbound freight have increased our per unit costs by approximately 15 for purchases made this year much of our inventory for the first half of the year was procured in prior periods at lower costs particularly for the book fairs division therefore our cost of product recognized to date do not fully reflect these higher costs additionally variable labor costs across the whole company but most notably in our primary distribution center in jefferson city missouri have increased as much as 20 or more likewise postage and outbound shipping costs have increased dramatically we are addressing these variable cost increases near and longer term through proactive resource allocation diversifying our vendor base automation pricing and product rationalization new covid variants not withstanding we are optimistic about future results we are encouraged by the success in the first half of the year like our industry peers we have cost and supply chain issues to overcome for the remainder of the fiscal year however we have more good news than challenges much of our previous work will enable us to better navigate these obstacles finally as previously announced the company approved its regular

have affected the business during our most recent quarter said thomas d hull iii kewaunee s president and chief executive officer we were successful in continuing to grow our backlog reporting a record high for the second consecutive quarter in response to this favorable market demand we have been focused on restoring and expanding manufacturing capacity we had to reduce last year because of covid 19 though it s been challenging due to the tight labor market we made progress during the quarter in adding new associates who will contribute to sustained manufacturing volume increases during the second half of our fiscal year much of the product manufactured during the quarter was priced during the peak of weak demand due to covid 19 which was also before raw material inflation began because of the global supply chain crisis these orders had fixed contracts that prevented the company from passing along and recovering the unprecedented increases in raw material costs that have occurred looking forward surcharges have been implemented on all new orders which will result in our revenue being better aligned with our costs in the second half of the current fiscal year we believe the worst of the impact of the timing lag between increased raw material costs and the associated surcharge implementation is behind us based on this we expect improved financial performance in the second half of this fiscal year and into our fiscal 2023 while november s previously disclosed cyber attack resulted in a temporary shut down of our operations we rebounded quickly and continue to ramp production levels in response to strong demand 1 ebitda is a non gaap financial measure see the table below for a reconciliation of ebitda and segment ebitda to net earnings loss the most

and appliance stores online retail sales were unchanged higher food and gasoline prices are probably curtailing discretionary spending the modest retail sales gain did not change views that the economy was regaining steam after a slowdown in the third quarter that was triggered by the covid 19 delta variant and rampant shortages in a nod to soaring inflation the federal reserve on wednesday said it would end its pandemic era bond purchases in march paving the way for three quarter percentage point interest rate increases by the end of 2022 consumers are still doing their best to keep the

increase several of the top u s retailers reported in mid november that they had noticed an earlier start to holiday shopping retail sales could remain moderate in december though higher savings and rising wages amid a tight labor market are supportive of spending trillions of dollars in covid 19 pandemic relief from governments across the globe fueled demand for goods straining supply chains the resulting shortages ranging from motor vehicles to furniture and electronics have raised goods prices consumer prices increased a solid 0 8 in november with the year on year gain of 6 8 the largest

with messages about the impact of supply shortages on the availability of holiday gifts said david berson chief economist at nationwide in columbus ohio they may well have done a lot of their holiday shopping earlier than usual stocks on wall street were mixed the dollar rose against a basket of currencies u s treasury prices fell mixed bag the moderation in retail sales which are mostly goods was

accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity rose at a 1 7 annualized rate in the third quarter we still think that real consumer spending growth will be strong in the fourth quarter on

hey there time traveller this article was published 15 12 2021 848 days ago so information in it may no longer be current atlanta ap rivian automotive was attracted to georgia s education system resources and talent when choosing a site for its 5 billion battery and assembly plant a company official said thursday as the project was officially announced the irvine california based electric vehicle manufacturer plans to eventually employ more than 7 500 workers and produce up to 400 000 vehicles a year at the plant east of atlanta construction is set to begin next summer and production is expected to begin in 2024 the company said we couldn t be more excited to be here today in georgia to announce rivian s decision to come here because that allows me and my team and rivian to capitalize on the depth and breadth of talent that resides here in georgia rivian chief people officer helen russell said during the announcement at liberty plaza across from the state capitol gov brian kemp walks past a rivian electric truck after announcing that electric truck maker rivian automotive will build a 5 billion battery and assembly plant east of atlanta projected to employ 7 500 workers thursday dec 16 2021 in atlanta ap photo john bazemore it is the largest economic development project in state history and is sure to be repeatedly touted by republican gov brian kemp as he tries to fend off both republican and democratic challengers to win reelection next year he has consistently portrayed himself as a friend to business and an excellent steward of georgia s economy we know that today is just the start of a generational partnership that will benefit not only this great company but also our great state kemp said the governor called the announcement a pivotal moment for our state one that will give countless hardworking georgians the opportunity to succeed and achieve the american dream state and local authorities didn t immediately release information about what incentives were offered to the company kemp said incentives are a significant part of any deal like this where states are competing for a major project but georgia had more to offer there s a lot of states that can give cash incentives and other things but if you don t have a good site if you don t have good logistics and if you especially don t have a good workforce none of that matters he told reporters after the announcement what i sold to them was speed to market and workforce the plant is to be located on a 2 000 acre 809 hectare site in morgan and walton counties east of atlanta along interstate 20 the company said winnipeg free press newsletter business weekly monday mornings the latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week sign up i agree to the terms and conditions cookie and privacy policies and casl agreement with cash on hand after it went public on nov 10 with an 11 9 billion stock offering rivian s 95 billion market value is greater than that of either general motors or ford it currently plans two models for consumers the r1t pickup with a base price of 67 500 and the r1s suv with a base price of 70 000 the truck was recently named motor trend s 2022 truck of the year rivian is a startup manufacturer of electric trucks and commercial delivery vans it s expanding at a breakneck pace that some analysts see as risky trying to claim electric vehicle market share before traditional automakers such as ford and gm and electric vehicle leader tesla can lock up the market georgia gov brian kemp is flanked by a rivian electric truck announces that the electric truck maker plans to build a 5 billion battery and assembly plant east of atlanta projected to employ 7 500 workers thursday dec 16 2021 in atlanta ap photo john bazemore the company argues that electric vehicle adoption is at the tipping point and it is well positioned for success because trucks and suvs have long been the most profitable vehicles sold but some analysts question whether it needs another plant besides the former mitsubishi plant in illinois that rivian bought for 16 million in 2017 rivian says it has a yearly capacity of 150 000 vehicles but is looking to expand there as well ford and gm plan to start selling their own electric pickup trucks in the next year or two while tesla also plans a new pickup that s part of a wave of electric vehicle investment with sk s 5 billion battery plant northeast of atlanta just one example ford announced in september it would spend 11 4 billion to build three battery factories and an assembly plant in kentucky and tennessee the lmc automotive consulting firm expects u s sales of new fully electric vehicles to hit nearly 400 000 this year nearly double last year s figures but they still make up only about 2 6 of sales the firm expects sales to grow to more than 730 000 next year and more than 2 million by 2025 even at 2 million ev sales still would be only about 12 of u s new vehicle sales

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video from mortgages and car loans to savings accounts and stocks here s how higher interest rates might affect everyday consumers minneapolis the united states federal reserve dropped some big news this week after two days of meetings the feds announced plans to raise interest rates to slow down inflation but what does that actually mean for us everyday consumers here s the problem they re facing the consumer price index shows inflation is up 6 8 the highest rate in nearly 40 years nearly everything is getting more expensive from groceries to gas so the federal reserve has decided to do something about it early projections suggest we could see three rate increases next year three more in 2023 and then two more in 2024 these increases will be small and gradual but experts say they could add up and really affect consumers a senior economic analyst with lendingtree told cnbc that mortgage rates could go from around 3 24 now to nearly 4 the end of next year so if you are buying a home for 300 000 with 20 down and a 30 year mortgage you might end up spending an extra 100 a month over 30 years it adds up to an extra 37 000 analysts say that could be enough to scare some home buyers out of the market but on the flipside fewer buyers in the market means less competition which could cut down on some of the bidding wars and could lead to lower prices higher interest rates would also affect car loans and credit card loans but on the plus side if you have a savings account or you own bonds you ll also earn a little more money because the interest rates will likely be higher interest rates also have a big impact on the stock market when companies want to grow their business they usually have to borrow money to hire more people buy new equipment or build new factories but if interest rates make it too expensive to borrow money some companies might decide not to do it which could affect stock prices in the coming years and possibly your retirement account the federal reserve is walking a thin line here while they want to do something to slow down this inflation they also don t want to get in the way of the covid recovery because the shutdowns and mandates last year hurt a lot of companies and american families financially and some are still recovering from it that means whatever changes we see starting next year will be gradual slow and steady so unfortunately these higher prices and inflation won t go away overnight they will follow us into the new year watch more local news watch the latest local news from the twin cities in our youtube playlist

this story is from texas monthly s archives we have left the text as it was originally published to maintain a clear historical record read more here about our archive digitization project in marfa nothing fractures the vastness of land and sky among the towns scattered across the big bend region alpine marathon terlingua shafter and fort davis none is as far removed from mountainous peaks as marfa the cuesta del burro mountains to the south and the davis mountains to the north seem from their distance like vaporous mirages still flatness never had this much character the air is gentle on the lungs the plateau is cactus spiked and well trodden by antelope and the starlit evenings are a communion with heaven marfa is a land for those who are spare of words and who wish to keep their distance tourists visit to wander through the region where giant was filmed to stroll through the spanish style paisano hotel and to search the sky at night for the bizarre marfa lights but space is the adhesive that holds marfans to their community it is a reverence for this wide open space if nothing else that the great minimalist sculptor donald judd had in common with his neighbors for judd s visionary artwork however unconventional it might appear ultimately seems perfectly placed under the endless west texas sky after dying of lymphoma at age 65 this past february donald judd was buried at his 45 000 acre ranch some fifty miles south of marfa the missouri born judd first laid eyes on the town in 1946 while on a bus bound for california twenty five years later at the height of a fabulous if controversial career the internationally celebrated artist packed his bags said good bye to new york and moved permanently to marfa like his work judd embodied both dignity and reserve photograph by laura wilson judd left new york city because he loathed its claustrophobic feeling its art sycophants and its museum directors who he felt were clueless when it came to his precise and elegant works he also moved to marfa to work in marfa judd pursued with a perfectionist s deliberate pace the art that won him international renown sleek freestanding metal and plexiglass sculptures with emphasis on industrial precision spare modernist furniture and coolly dignified architecture ranging from gallery interiors to stock tanks though he produced paintings sculptures and architectural projects in venues as scattered as manhattan basel switzerland and cologne germany it was judd s contemporary artwork in giant country that the new york times labeled among the largest and most beautiful in the world what donald judd left behind in marfa amounts to a tremendous collection of artistic treasures ranging from his own paintings and sculptures to beautiful navajo blankets avant garde works from iceland and korea and early twentieth century furniture the artist s work is carefully exhibited in several of the seventeen buildings he bought and restored as well as throughout the 350 acre fort d a russell at the edge of town some of the exhibits have been and continue to be open to the public the rest of judd s art is expected to be available for viewing after judd s estate has been sorted out judd s collection provides a rich cultural addition to the many places to visit on an extended west texas weekend which might include hiking through big bend national park stargazing at the mcdonald observatory checking out the country acts at terlingua s starlight theatre restaurant and bar and availing oneself of the creature comforts at the holland hotel in

the rough eternity of the marfa landscape photograph by laura wilson top his personal library blends stark splendor and functionality photograph by laura wilson as the following pages attest dallas based photographer laura wilson had unprecedented access to the reclusive sculptor s world this was no small feat as wilson learned when she first visited judd last november he was ornery testy and wary of people a very withdrawn man who felt uncomfortable being photographed she says judd s wariness evaporated after wilson gave him one of her photography books depicting a ninety year old west texas rancher the following day he showed up early for the shooting and allowed wilson to stay for a week judd s most striking works can be seen by any visitor he converted fort d a russell a former military post and german pow camp into a permanent exhibition space what was once the gymnasium is now a metal roofed arena and reception area with long pinewood tables and even longer zenlike gravel floors but the fort s most astounding spectacles are the two artillery sheds with quonset style roofs that house one hundred aluminum box sculptures placed in precise rows on each side of the sheds stark cement columns by replacing the brick walls with windows judd has achieved a breathtaking juxtaposition of his sleek objects with the raggedy marfa landscape in an uptown gallery the boxes might seem cold and stoic but the effect is oddly yet undeniably harmonious when poised against the plateau at dawn the sculptures radiate bronze and copper under the evening light they maintain a dimly silver glow at any time of day however the artillery sheds reflect an awe of space and proportion it becomes immediately apparent why donald judd took refuge here though he had a circle of friends in marfa judd was not an easy man to get to know one friend big bend sentinel editor robert halpern observes don was a very shy man as well as a very purposeful artist so a lot of folks viewed his shyness and his single mindedness and misinterpreted him as being standoffish it did not help matters that judd plastered the windows of one of his buildings the old marfa bank with butcher paper to ward off the curious or that he maintained a long running feud with his next door neighbor whose ice making machine judd found infuriatingly noisy to this day many in the region know donald judd only as the man who bought the popular kingston hot springs and promptly closed them to the public judd bought restored and worked in the old marfa national bank the butcher paper on the windows deterred

sheds into galleries where the west texas sunlight plays against his exquisite aluminum sculptures photograph by laura wilson the sculptor s generosity was real but measured every october judd threw an expensive weekend long party that was well attended by marfans yet he was a reserved host and shied away from the meeting and greeting to the townsfolk judd was a wealthy landowner but he had two additional strikes against him he was an outsider and his artwork was forbidding to the average resident halpern believes that most of the local judd critics never took the time to see his work some of those who did gained a new outlook on the man while others shook their heads in bewilderment both the artist and his art had to be taken on their own terms because of his low profile few marfans knew how deeply judd cared about their town he was an active follower of local issues and enjoyed talking marfa politics with his friends deeply committed to preserving the area s environment judd considered hiring an attorney to fight the city of el paso when the latter bought a farm in nearby valentine that sat over a precious aquifer he purchased the 45 000 acre ayala de chinati ranch in large part to rule out the possibility of development in the chinati mountains among the numerous projects he contemplated were plans to boost the marfa economy such as marketing highland hereford beef bottling and selling the local water propagating chemical free agricultural products and renovating several vacant homes for use as a subsidized retirement community the chianti foundation also showcases works by judd s famous friends such as claes oldenburg s monument to the last horse inspired by an aging calvary steed that was shot to death at the fort photograph by laura wilson fortunately judd s chinati foundation not only remains in operation but continues to develop new artistic projects his children flavin and rainer judd say that many more of judd s art objects exhibited and stored throughout the world will be moved to marfa making this dusty town an astonishing repository of modern art though such additions would give a boost to marfa s hobbled economy and prompt warmer sentiments among local judd detractors no one need fear that the money of donald judd will be used to clutter the town s landscape this is after all minimalist country the chinati foundation located at fort d a russell on the southern end of town is available for touring every thursday friday and saturday from 1 p m until 5 p m however the friendly and knowledgeable foundation staff members are willing to conduct tours during off hours as well if notice is given by calling the foundation at 915 729 4362 and leaving a message the tour also extends to the chamberlain exhibit hall in marfa proper across the street from the old marfa bank the chinati foundation staff members will be glad to point out the other judd properties which for now are closed to the public
just in time jit production is a management philosophy that aims to minimise the time between orders originating in japan with toyota s kanban system ohno 1988 jit has been adopted worldwide over the last several decades the primary appeal of jit is that it allows firms to cut costs by placing small and more frequent order batches rather than carrying large stocks of inventories do improvements in inventory management matter for macroeconomics theoretically inventories have been found to be neither a stabilising nor a destabilising force in general equilibrium e g khan and thomas 2007 these studies suggest that improvements in inventory management are broadly inconsequential at the macro level more recently supply chain disruptions have garnered considerable attention amid the covid 19 pandemic e g baldwin and freeman 2020 pisch 2020 motivated by this in a recent paper ortiz 2021 i offer a new perspective on the role of inventories in driving aggregate fluctuations finding that jit production engenders macro fragility in the face of large adverse tail events facts about just in time firms empirically i measure leanness among publicly traded us manufacturers from 1980 to 2018 by recording the years in which firms announce the adoption of jit production this approach follows kenney and wempe 2002 and gao 2018 based on this measure i document two sets of facts about jit producers which jointly suggest that jit firms enjoy higher profits yet they are more exposed to external events first jit producers appear to be more profitable i find that firms experience a 9 increase in sales and a 13 decline in inventory holdings following jit adoption in addition jit producers experience a roughly 7 decline in employment and sales growth volatility relative to their non jit counterparts my macroeconomic model is able to replicate these endogenous patterns in the model more productive firms adopt jit production and subsequently enjoy lower inventory management costs thereby raising sales in addition through jit adoption these firms mute their respective inventory cycles leading to a dampening of firm level fluctuations second jit firms exhibit more volatility conditional on external events for instance relative to non jit firms sales growth and employment growth among jit producers co move more closely with gdp growth indicating that these producers are more exposed to the business cycle moreover using data from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa i find that jit producers experience sharper sales and employment declines relative to non jit firms amid the onset of a weather events in the zip codes in which they are headquartered these firms exhibit similar excess exposures to upstream weather events affecting their suppliers quantifying the trade off in a model of lean production figure 1 deeper crisis with more jit production taken together the empirical patterns provide motivating evidence suggestive of a trade off ultimately my focus is on the interaction between jit production and aggregate shocks as a result i extend a macroeconomic model of inventory investment to feature jit production with a focus on unanticipated supply disruptions as in khan and thomas 2007 firms in the model pay a fixed cost whenever they place an order this leads firms to place relatively larger orders and to carry unused materials i e inventories across time to avoid paying the fixed order cost in every period jit producers in the model benefit from lower order costs which cause them to carry fewer inventories on average consistent with jit practices in reality after building the theoretical model i take it to the data estimating the firm level productivity process as well as costs associated with ordering materials storing inventories and adopting jit production i then compare the estimated jit model to a no jit counterfactual focusing on the long run outcomes across the two models i find that the jit economy exhibits about a 40 decline in the aggregate inventory to sales ratio consistent with the decline in nonfarm inventory to sales in the us since 1980 in addition when moving from the no jit economy to the jit economy output rises by about 10 firm value rises by 1 3 and welfare rises by 1 4 the efficiency gains come from the fact that jit firms are better able to align their firm s productivity with material input usage without being burdened by carrying idle stocks of inventories the other side of the trade off relates to the vulnerabilities that jit exposes to examine this i consider an unexpected supply shock that raises the marginal cost of orders the supply disruption is calibrated such that it generates a 3 4 contraction in the jit economy in line with the decline in us economic activity in 2020 i then feed the same unexpected shock into the no jit counterfactual and find that the crisis is shallower with an output contraction of 3 1 the roughly 15 excess output contraction which is attributed solely to jit adoption amounts to about a 100 billion gap and is comparable to the funds allocated for state and local governments with the passage of the cares act 2 the deeper contraction in the jit economy is attributable to 1 more stockouts and 2 a slower drawdown of inventories due to the spike in the marginal cost of orders firms in the jit economy are more likely to find themselves in a scenario in which they have exhausted their inventories and are unable to procure more materials amid the disaster this leads to the relative spike in stockouts at the same time firms that have not stocked out opt to deplete their inventories more slowly in an effort to not have to source new materials amid the supply disruption put another way these firms choose to reduce their material input usage leading to a sharper drop in sales relative to the no jit benchmark i proceed to quantify the trade off for a range of counterfactual economies each with a different level of jit adoption figure 2 traces out this frontier the vertical axis plots the firm value gains to jit production in normal times while the horizontal axis plots the excess output contraction in percentages amid the unexpected supply disruption as the arrow indicates moving up and to the right along the frontier amounts to considering counterfactual economies with more jit production the red

on wednesday german chancellor olaf scholz social democrats spd gave his first formal address in the german bundestag it confirmed the assessment of the wsws that the programme of the so called traffic light coalition of spd red liberals fdp yellow and greens is a declaration of war on the working class chancellor olaf scholz spd delivering his initial governmental address ap photo michael

outgoing grand coalition spd and conservatives cdu social cuts armament of the police and military and mass infection with the coronavirus scholz who was labour and then finance minister before becoming vice chancellor under merkel began with a defence of the government s coronavirus policies to date he stressed that his government will not slacken its fight against the virus behind such platitudes as we will fight the battle with the utmost determination and we will win this fight he focused exclusively on expanding the national vaccination drive claiming that if everyone were to pitch in the stated goal of 30 million vaccinations by the end of the year was achievable then we ll have come a decisive step forward by the end of the month but this is demagoguery and intentional deception a broad based vaccination campaign is necessary but not sufficient to protect the population and eliminate the virus the scientists of many nations have demonstrated this clearly with the rapid spread of the omicron variant further measures especially a comprehensive lockdown of retail stores schools nurseries and businesses become all the more urgent last week the pharmaceutical company pfizer biontech announced the result of preliminary studies showing that antibodies from doubly vaccinated individuals showed significantly reduced efficacy fully vaccinated individuals apparently do not have the same degree of antibody protection against the omicron variant as they do against earlier variants of the virus according to a press release from the company scholz s claim that by expanding the vaccination campaign germany will manage to leave the wave behind is thus demonstrably false it serves to implement the demands of business associations which since the beginning of the pandemic have strictly rejected any lockdown that restricts production and trade cost what it will in health and lives scholz s administration is only intensifying this profit before lives policy scholz announced a hard line against a hateful minority of vaccination opponents whom he blames for the low vaccination rate in germany he claimed that part of the truth of this pandemic is that currently every adult in germany could have been vaccinated twice long ago and at least all particularly at risk citizens could have been boosted we would have had the pandemic under control by now then we would all now be having a tranquil pre christmas period with our old freedoms and our families and friends in reality the right wing opponents of vaccination are a small minority whose demonstrations and protests are played up beyond all measure by politicians and the media the coronavirus catastrophe which has already claimed more than 105 000 lives in germany was not caused by some cantankerous contingent of the population but by the german government in which scholz was vice chancellor part of the truth of this pandemic is that the grand coalition downplayed the coronavirus crisis from the beginning made light of the danger for months sabotaged and denied a systematic vaccination campaign closed vaccination centres in september ended the epidemic emergency of national scope at the end of november and ruled out life saving lockdowns scholz defended those policies as he heaped praise on his predecessor angela merkel dr merkel has served the federal republic of germany in an impressive manner as chancellor for 16 years at all times oriented to the matter and to the facts always completely unpretentious and never putting on airs always with courage and with wisdom with pragmatism and with prudence the social democrat exclaimed to applause from the greens fdp and the left party scholz was full of praise for merkel and himself as vice chancellor because the merkel era witnessed an enormous shift to the right never since the 1930s has germany been as deeply socially divided as it is today while stock prices shoot up inexorably and billionaires enrich themselves uninhibited ever more people live in naked poverty never before have so many people in germany worked for so long in low wage jobs even full time work is often insufficient to make a decent life in 2019 every fifth child and every sixth inhabitant of germany lived in poverty a total of 13 2 million people that was before the pandemic which has dramatically exacerbated the social divide but scholz simply denied that there ever was such a division much is said at the moment about the supposed division within our society to this i declare our society is not divided in order to suppress growing social resistance scholz announced a massive arming of the police those who work in the police force or in customs in security agencies or public order offices deserve our respect ladies and gentlemen he exclaimed on behalf of the entire federal government i thank all those who day and night on the streets and in difficult situations ensure the safety of citizens and the order of our community this recognition however must also have substance said scholz that s why we will ensure that the federal police are well staffed and well equipped and make them more attractive as a service the foreign policy part of his speech also seamlessly tied in with the policies of merkel s government which strove for years to develop germany into a political and military great power to make europe more able to act scholz wished to turn qualified majority decisions into the rule in the eu even in areas where that is not the case today this would enable germany to impose its will on other eu members scholz desires to further strengthen fortress europe and seal it off from refugees more hermetically than even now i just spoke with the polish prime minister about the situation on the border with belarus and assured him of our solidarity he reported borders must remain inviolable and the cynical abuse of refugees for hybrid attacks on our eastern neighbours must stop we will reaffirm that at the european council tomorrow the new chancellor emphatically declared his support for strengthening nato and arming the bundeswehr german armed forces accordingly he said the eu summit which began thursday in brussels would for the first time discuss a new basic security policy document the so called strategic compass germany he said would actively participate in this discussion and invest to achieve nato s capability goals like merkel before him and new foreign minister annalena baerbock green party just days ago scholz also threatened russia let me repeat here in case everyone has not yet understood what my predecessor in office said scholz said any violation of territorial integrity will have a high price foreign minister baerbock expelled two russian diplomats from germany that same day at the same time scholz called on moscow to engage in constructive dialogue he added but this must not be misunderstood as a new german ostpolitik former chancellor willy brandt s ostpolitik had initiated détente with the soviet union in the early 1970s scholz accused russia of grievously violating the principles of international law and the peace of europe by annexing crimea scholz continued germany and europe wish to act in their interests vis à vis china with self confidence and engagement no one can close one s eyes to critical human rights situations and must call out violations of universal norms scholz offered china fair economic competition for mutual benefit with a level playing field for all while rattling his sabre we are using the strength of a united europe and the single market to assure fair competitive conditions for our companies to compete globally the most important partner in this he said is the united states which unsaid by scholz is preparing for war against china the socialist equality party sgp is the only party to oppose the traffic light coalition with a socialist programme its party congress resolution from late november states the working class will inevitably come into conflict with the new coalition and all the parties in the bundestag the sgp has prepared the working class politically for this confrontation in the election campaign we decisively opposed the all party coalition and fought as the only party for an international socialist programme in our election appeal we stressed no social problem can be resolved without expropriating the banks and major corporations and placing them under the democratic control of the working class their profits and wealth must be confiscated and the trillions given to them over the past year must be returned the world economy must be reorganised on the basis of a scientific rational plan in the inevitable and nascent conflict between the working class and the traffic light coalition this programme becomes crucially important
