according to federal data grocery prices have risen nearly 12 percent since last year straining college students budgets ramen it s a staple of a college student s diet it s quick filling and has at least some flavor and most importantly it s cheap but that s changing as william ulloa a senior studying education at colorado state university has discovered as inflation takes hold of people s pocketbooks the price of nearly all food is increasing and salty dry noodles aren t immune gotta love the ramen ulloa said while grocery shopping at a walmart oh man it did go up this used to be a dollar now it s a dollar and 12 cents according to federal data grocery prices have risen nearly 12 percent since last year a first generation student from an el salvadoran family ulloa is already financially independent on top of being a full time student studying education he also works a part time job in retail to help make ends meet and while prices have gone up wages have typically remained stagnant i get two paychecks a month cause i get paid every other week one check goes straight to paying my rent and utilities ulloa said the other check is for everything else which would be groceries gas bills so realistically i have a little over 500 that i could use throughout the month despite living within walking distance from a king soopers ulloa drives 15 minutes to a walmart because prices there are cheaper while he s shopping he s strategic about what he picks up on a recent visit he considered a number of factors when placing things in his cart its cost its longevity its tastiness and how easy it is to cook at one point ulloa stopped to look at nuts and trail mix an aisle he admits to skipping most of the time he picked up a can of cashews but staggered at the price i love cashews but 10 for a jar of cashews not gonna happen ulloa said ulloa didn t even bother stopping in the vegetable section he said grocery vegetable portions are too big and often go to waste because he and his roommates don t have the time to cook we bought a big pack of strawberries i think we only got through half of it and then the rest went to the trash at the end of the trip ulloa s giant walmart cart was barely full he took home a couple ramen packs pasta sauce frozen breakfast meals toothpaste and a gallon of orange juice among other items the total nearly 40 almost 10 percent of his monthly budget i get scared every month cause i m like am i gonna have enough to pay my bills and whatnot ulloa said the state is taking college food insecurity seriously food insecurity is a major concern across college campuses nationwide a study from temple university found that 38 percent of college students are impacted by food insecurity it can lead to a lower gpa poor mental health and other effects the rise of food insecurity among college students has led colorado s department of higher education to introduce the hunger free campus checklist a list of goals that state universities are encouraged to meet to reduce food insecurity on campus the goals include opening a free campus food pantry providing food stamp program enrollment assistance raising awareness and collecting data on the scope of food insecurity fabian sigala orozco oversees the campus food pantry at csu pueblo he said a big part of his job is raising awareness among students about the free program s existence probably 35 40 percent of the students are using it but it would be more if we can get more promotion making sure that the students know this orozco said several campuses across the state have recently opened food pantries students are welcome to visit and receive free grocery items oftentimes fresh fruit and shelf stable products like cans of soup or beans many of these food pantries like csu pueblo s pack pantry are reliant on outside donations to stock the shelves orozco said that while demand has been higher this year donations from other food banks organizations and even regular people are down due to the cost of the food the inflation that is happening we are kind of having a little bit more limited inventory in regards to what we can get orozco said salina edwards a graduate student at colorado mesa university in grand junction helped her college establish initiatives to address food insecurity including opening a food pantry she said donations to the pantry have remained steady but she s still feeling the effects of inflation as a grad student edwards is basically a seasoned pro at eating on a budget she s developed strategies to make her dollar stretch as much as it can while eating tasty nutritious food the biggest thing for me is like i never go to the grocery store hungry cause that is my biggest weakness edwards said and then making a list is definitely the way to go edwards doesn t like the stereotypical image of a college student eating ramen to survive she said that with the help of the state program and food pantries at their colleges there s more than enough food to go around so that students like her and ulloa don t need to worry about how they ll afford groceries we re kind of debunking that stereotype and saying no that s not something that you have to go through during your college career she said you deserve to be well and have the access to food that you need so you can be successful while you re at college so far about a dozen colorado universities have completed the state s hunger free campus checklist to read more stories from colorado public radio visit www cpr org

everyone is talking about gray wolves it could be because miley cyrus recently said she ll use her fame to fight for wolves or because of montana s controversial push to dramatically expand wolf hunting in the state but it could also be because of a developing storyline in season 5 of the hit tv series yellowstone for those who haven t watched i ll get you quickly up to speed image the show follows john dutton played by kevin costner and his ranch the yellowstone the ranch employs several cowboys who are charged with taking care of the ranch and its cattle and face immense and sometimes ridiculously dramatic obstacles along the way there s murder of course and romance and all the other hollywood written scenes that garner the attention of roughly 10 million viewers a week this season the show s events hit close to home for defenders of wildlife while out riding in episode 2 the sting of wisdom the cowboys find a mother cow that s been killed by wolves or so it seems later that night two of the cowboys are sent to hunt the wolves and find them lurking around more yellowstone cattle the cowboys shoot them from far away using thermal goggles as the cowboys approach the dead wolves they discover that some of the pack is wearing gps collars image william c campbell usfws a collared gray wolf in yellowstone national park the gps collars mean these are yellowstone national park wolves if the public finds out that dutton cowboys have killed national park wolves john dutton and his cowboys could be in big trouble these wolves have facebook pages one of the cowboys exclaims this closely mirrors wolf conservation in the yellowstone area today the wolves are held in high esteem by the public as a great american conservation success story they re fully protected within the park but open to hunting and trapping when they roam beyond the park s boundaries when congress first established yellowstone national park in the late 19th century gray wolves thrived across the landscape but due to a concerted effort to eradicate them by the mid 1900s wolves had been almost entirely eliminated from the lower 48 states image defenders of wildlife volunteers with wolf cages before the yellowstone wolf release in 1995 the reintroduction of wolves to yellowstone happened in 1995 our ceo at the time was there since the initial reintroduction defenders has remained committed to restoring wolves to additional suitable places throughout their historical range and to promoting coexistence in these places though we are excited to see some of the intricacies of our everyday work play out onscreen to a large audience we want to make sure viewers and fans have all the facts about the history of gray wolves and what really goes on in montana myth ranchers can t coexist with wolves a primary conflict some ranchers have with wolves pertains to the loss of livestock even though far less than one tenth of one percent of livestock in wolf occupied areas are lost to wolves though very few ranchers actually experience livestock losses to wolves it can be significant for the ranch being impacted defenders has extensive experience in coexistence promoting and implementing effective nonlethal tools and techniques to reduce conflicts between wildlife and livestock throughout the country for example by training mother cows to stay with their calves and to find security in the herd when threatened it is possible to rekindle the herd instincts of cattle instincts which keep them safer from predators because wolves are fearful of humans an active human presence on the range can also be invaluable range riders patrol where livestock graze deter predators and keep tabs on the herd to ensure its health and well being image russell talmo dow turbo fladry fencing in montana additional tools include the use of specialized fence flagging called turbo fladry randomized strobe lights like foxlights and noise makers to discourage wolves from getting too close to livestock more information on these strategies to reduce conflicts can be found in defenders own livestock and wolves guide to nonlethal tools and methods to reduce conflicts fact the reintroduction of wolves benefited yellowstone the changes in the park since wolves were reintroduced on january 12 1995 have been exciting and significant wolf reintroduction helped to rebalance elk and deer populations and caused them to move across the landscape more allowing willows and aspen to rebound on the landscape the reduced overgrazing stabilized riverbanks improving water quality songbirds benefited from these changes as did beavers eagles foxes and badgers and while the restoration of wolves in yellowstone has cost about 30 million total wolf ecotourism brings in 82 million annually myth wolves have more protections now than in 1995 over the past decade the federal government has slowly removed federal protections for gray wolves starting with wolves in the northern rocky mountains in 2011 in november 2020 the u s fish and wildlife service announced its decision to remove federal protections for gray wolves throughout the remaining lower 48 states despite a dearth of scientific evidence to justify the move image keith szafranksi istock the decision which took effect on january 4 2021 affected gray wolves in at least 44 states most prominently in the western great lakes the central rockies and pacific coast the removal of protections had immediate consequences for wolves leaving them vulnerable to unsustainable hunting trapping and other lethal measures wolf protections were reinstated earlier this year for wolves except for the northern rocky mountains area of montana idaho and wyoming including the areas surrounding yellowstone national park during the 2021 2022 hunting season 24 wolves from the park were killed in neighboring states hundreds more were killed across all three states roughly 270 in montana 500 in idaho and 30 in wyoming sadly montana and idaho have been actively producing new laws to remove protections for wolves fact montana recently passed laws encouraging more killing of wolves montana was given authority to manage wolves throughout the state upon the federal delisting of the rocky mountain gray wolf population from the endangered species act in 2021 the montana legislature passed four aggressive wolf management bills that authorized reimbursement for wolf hunters and trappers increased the season length for trapping increased bag limits and permitted formerly banned hunting and trapping methods such as neck snares use of bait and hunting at night with spotlights last year s wolf hunt one of the most aggressive in modern montana history culminated in the deaths of one fifth of yellowstone national park s entire wolf population with some three quarters of those killed in montana image john morrison istock in contrast colorado is preparing to reintroduce gray wolves to the state thanks to a voter approved initiative to begin reintroduction of the species no later than the end of 2023 this marks the first time a state s voters not federal wildlife managers have directed the return of wolves the state wildlife agency also lists wolves as endangered with full protections unfortunately in november of this year three wolves believed to be pups from the north park pack in colorado were killed when they crossed state lines into wyoming where it is legal to kill wolves the north park pack produced six pups in late april or early may 2021 in jackson county the first to be born in colorado in around 80 years not far from the wyoming border it is not uncommon for the north park pack to travel into and out of wyoming wolf packs usually hunt within a specific territory sometimes these territories can be as large as 50 square miles but they may even travel more than 1 000 miles in areas where prey is scarce wolves need to be able to travel freely throughout their range in order to survive and thrive their livelihood shouldn t depend on state boundaries fact radio collared wolves are important for research and tracking since the reintroduction of gray wolves to yellowstone radio collars have been used as the main tool for research and monitoring the whereabouts of the species now more than 25 years later radio collaring remains an important method to collect all kinds of data collared wolves can also provide important information to wildlife managers and help provide tools for conflict deterrence with livestock operations wolves wearing radio collars do not act any differently than wolves without radio collars there s no evidence suggesting collars influence rates of dispersal mortality survival breeding success and leadership image wesdotphotography alamy stock photo the fate of the dutton cowboys is still unknown but we hope you have a better understanding of why their actions may have serious consequences in the real world the fate of gray wolves is in the hands of the u s fish and wildlife service fws the agency is currently conducting a review to weigh reinstating federal endangered species act protections for gray wolves in the northern rockies in september 2021 fws announced it would be exploring relisting after finding substantial credible information indicating that a listing action may be warranted in an initial assessment the agency is overdue in issuing that review which was supposed to be completed within a year

the automotive financing market may be under stress as several experts call for a massive wave of repossessions in early 2023 with prominent figures such as tesla founder elon musk and ark invest s cathie wood sounding the alarm about the potential effects on financial markets potentially the biggest financial crisis ever musk posted on twitter on dec 16 in response to a tweet by wood and a series of tweets from the ceo of a car dealer group about the potential auto loan crisis reports by the anonymous twitter account cardealershipguy revealed an extremely alarming trend among auto lenders the ceo behind the account claimed that many lenders are ignoring red flags associated with loan applicants who are already underwater on a prior auto loan this morning i discovered something extremely alarming happening in the car market specifically in auto lending cardealshipguy who authors a newsletter for auto market insights wrote on twitter catching many people s attention i m now convinced that there is a massive wave of car repossessions coming in 2023 he went on to explain that many people had no choice but to buy a costly car during the pandemic he said car values have been falling recently with some dropping by nearly 30 percent year over year and these same people that took out these big loans are now underwater basically they owe banks more on these cars than they are worth he stated adding that the banks are well aware of the problem cardealershipguy who wished to remain anonymous told the epoch times that many of these underwater borrowers are attempting to purchase additional vehicles despite having unpaid debts on their prior auto loans he is hearing that 35 to 40 percent of new subprime applicants already have outstanding debt he said normally banks would consider this a warning sign and refuse the loan but the dealer said that 65 percent of his associated lenders are issuing the loans anyways i ve been in the business for a decade and this is completely unprecedented when asked about whether large institutional banks are involved in this lending he said some of the big household names that you and i know are participating in this he described the dynamic further on twitter the lender lets the consumer buy the car knowing that they already have an open auto loan with another bank the dealer wrote he suggests that banks are making this choice strategically assuming that customers will default on their previous loan issued by a competing bank but continue making payments on the more recent one declining values cardealershipguy s twitter thread caught the attention of cathie wood head of the investment management firm ark invest who he referred to the dynamic between competing banks as dog eat dog style cardealershipguy s twitter thread caught the attention of cathie wood head of the investment management firm ark invest who expressed concerns about the impact of declining residual values on the 1 trillion auto loan market wood who manages assets of more than 14 billion as of september added that this crisis might be exacerbated as more consumers opt to purchase electric vehicles further diminishing the prices of gas powered cars musk responded to wood s tweet echoing the same concerns ticking time bomb as the epoch times reported in november the post covid boom and corresponding semiconductor shortage caused car prices to musk has been an outspoken critic of the federal reserve s hawkish interest rate policy posting on twitter last month that the fed needs to cut interest rates immediately since the start of the year the u s central bank led by chairman jerome powell has raised its overnight lending rate from near zero to more than 4 percent as the epoch times reported in november the post covid boom and corresponding semiconductor shortage caused car prices to explode throughout 2020 and 2021 car dealers were forced to overpay for their merchandise and in turn overcharged banks that were providing auto loans lucky lopez a las vegas based auto loan broker told the epoch times that loans originated throughout 2021 far exceeded the values of the underlying vehicles the dealers started calling banks hey man i got to sell this for 150 percent 160 percent of ltv can you do this and banks that traditionally wouldn t started doing it lopez said paraphrasing the industry dynamics he had witnessed for perspective the online loan broker lendingtree quoted the average ltv ratio for an auto loan in 2019 at 87 percent lopez is also calling for a massive wave of lender repossessions which could spell trouble for the automotive market after repossession cars typically go to auction but banks are reluctant to commit to an auction sale where it s difficult to fetch even 100 percent of a car s value as a result banks have largely refused sales and continue to delay the auction process according to lopez the lack of sales is causing a supply glut which is a ticking time bomb according to danielle dimartino booth a former adviser to the federal reserve bank of dallas this massive overhang of inventory continues to grow on a weekly basis because the lenders don t want to recognize the loss on the loans booth said in an interview on the forward guidance podcast she predicts that regulators will step in at some point and question why lenders haven t liquidated the cars and force them to sell booth added that this is what regulators did in the housing crisis they re going to make them clean those loans off their books and then we ll see used car prices fall

total score at week eight over placebo adt but did not meet statistical significance about vraylar cariprazine vraylar is an oral once daily atypical antipsychotic approved as an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of major depressive disorder mdd in adults 1 5 or 3 mg day for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar i disorder bipolar depression in adults 1 5 or 3 mg day and for the acute treatment of adults with manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar i disorder 3 to 6 mg day vraylar is also approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults 1 5 to 6 mg day while the mechanism of action of vraylar is unknown the efficacy of vraylar is thought to be mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at central dopamine d₂ and serotonin 5 ht 1a receptors and antagonist activity at serotonin 5 ht 2a receptors pharmacodynamic studies with vraylar have shown that it may act as a partial agonist with high binding affinity at dopamine d 3 dopamine d 2 and serotonin 5 ht 1a receptors vraylar demonstrated up to 8 fold greater in vitro affinity for dopamine d 3 vs d 2 receptors vraylar also acts as an antagonist at serotonin 5 ht 2b and 5 ht 2a receptors with high and moderate binding affinity respectively as well as it binds to the histamine h 1 receptors vraylar shows lower binding affinity to the serotonin 5 ht 2c and α 1a adrenergic receptors and has no appreciable affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors 8 the clinical significance of these in vitro data is unknown vraylar is developed jointly by abbvie and

o t r reporter we sat down the wofer governor elect as the school s superintendent to be the state s education secretary and revealed about the mnbta only on 5 sitting down and revealing more about her search for a general manager to take over we are going to have a new general manager we are in the midst of a search i expect there to be an interim g m and then there will be a g m reporter she tawld the t a top priority and said they need to boost hiring we don t have enough to operate the trains buses and rails reporter we are learning about her latest appointment a new education secretary and lynn school superintendent to the top job the mental health needs has never been greater pat understands that he is a collaborator and educator reporter she wants to make school buildings more modern governor elect healey wants early college this is the ability of students to get a jump start on college credits when patrick w advertisement gov elect maura healey outlines her developing plans for education mbta housing climate see the full interview sunday at 11 a m on wcvb s on the record share copy link copy massachusetts gov elect maura healey revealed details about her approaches to several significant challenges facing the state and her upcoming administration on friday it was her first sit down interview since her historic election win the interview recorded at newscenter 5 s studio will be broadcast in its entirety on sunday s episode of on the record during that exclusive interview healey went into detail about her latest cabinet level hire she said lynn schools superintendent pat tutwiler was selected to be the next education secretary because of the experience he brings to the job specifically she cited his resume which ranges from high school history teacher to the head of a large school district the mental health needs of our students has probably never been greater and i know that pat understands that he is a collaborator he s a communicator and i m anxious to get to work with him she said the future governor said tutwiler and her administration will prioritize strategies to help students who are still struggling in the wake of pandemic related disruptions we do have some losses that have occurred during covid the stress on educators the stress on families the stress on our students i m excited that pat tutwiler is coming on board because i know he will bring the urgency and the attention and the focus to this healey said in response to the selection the massachusetts teachers association said it is pleased with the choice healey said other top education priorities include diversifying the workforce and modernizing school buildings she also wants more high schoolers to have access to college level courses this is the ability of young people in high school to actually attend a community college and get a jump start on college credits in fact when pat was in lynn they had the highest rate of early college enrollment she said with about three weeks until her inauguration the announcement of tutwiler s appointment comes days after healey announced her first cabinet pick on tuesday beacon hill veteran matthew gorzkowicz for administration and finance secretary the governor elect also spoke to otr about her search for the next general manager of the mbta she called the search a top priority but said she does not expect to name an appointee before taking office with the t s current boss steve poftak scheduled to step down two days before healey takes office that means temporary leadership will be necessary i expect there to be an interim general manager for some time and then there will be a gm she said healey said she will take her time with the decision but called the mbta a top priority for her administration specifically she commented on the need to increase the pace of hiring at the agency we don t have enough workers right now for the jobs that we need to operate the workers and the buses and the rail and the way that residents deserve she said reiterating a point she made during her campaign healey said her administration would be differentiated from her predecessor by the creation of some new high level roles including a cabinet level climate chief and a secretary of housing she explained that her administration would prioritize driving new housing production around the state healey called it a critical point in the state s competitiveness strategies would include investing in the preservation and rehabilitation of existing housing stock while also incentivizing communities to improve zoning procedures and boost production rents are out of reach for so many people and the ability to purchase homes is so difficult right now so we are about driving production around the state through a secretary of housing through more dense housing particularly around our transportation hubs we re also going to look at state public lands and how they can be converted to housing and we re committed to streamlining the process for permitting so we can actually help developers create the housing that we need all across the state healey said the new climate chief would be tasked with keeping climate issues in focus across the other cabinet level categories she said massachusetts can make itself a leader in climate technology and compared the opportunity to what the state has already achieved in life sciences because i know we will not get to where we need to be as a state as a region unless we bring that intentionality she said healey is scheduled to take over the corner office on jan 5

america s official time is kept at a government laboratory in boulder colo and according to the clock at the entrance i was seven minutes behind schedule i rush across the campus of the national institute of standards and technology nist and arrive at the end of a long hallway where physicist jeff sherman was waiting patiently sorry i m running late i tell him it s ok we only measure the nanoseconds sherman jokes it s never been easier to know what time it is nist broadcasts the time to points across the country it s fed through computer networks and cellphone towers to our personal gadgets which tick in perfect synchrony humanity s ever improving agreement on the time smooths communication and transportation and it lubricates our economy but time has another side to it one that the clocks don t show a lot of us grow up being fed this idea of time as absolute says chanda prescod weinstein a theoretical physicist at the university of new hampshire but prescod weinstein says the time we re experiencing is a social construct real time is actually something quite different in some of the odder corners of the universe space and time can stretch and slow and sometimes even break down completely for many people this unruly version of time is radical she says but as technology to better count the time grows ever more sophisticated our everyday understanding of time itself may need to start changing a sisyphean task to get a sense of where the rigid time that governs most of our lives comes from sherman takes me into a beige colored laboratory crammed with experimental equipment and computers there are three big boxes looming above lab benches holding three high precision atomic clocks each box is labeled with a name one s called george another fiona and the third is elvis time is not an absolute and that s radical they all have quirks and personalities sherman explains when they fail at 2 a m you want to have a little bit of compassion for them so you give them names george fiona and elvis are just part of the 21 clock ensemble nist uses to generate the official time these three clocks tick using hydrogen atoms the atoms are excited using radiofrequency energy and then sent into a chamber once inside they decay emitting a specific frequency of light think of it as striking an atomic tuning fork sherman says the excited hydrogen emits a tone of light he says the rest of the clock is an instrument that tries to sample tries to listen to a little bit of that light and count the cycles of oscillation in that light those light cycles are the tick of the clock by averaging a subset of the 21 clocks together nist has created a system that can count the time to within one quadrillionth of a second that means the government s clock can keep time to within a second over the course of about 30 million years in another room that timing signal is sent out across the united states and via satellite to other government laboratories in other parts of the world with clocks of their own it s an impressive system but there s a catch you ve got to keep counting if you stop if you blink you don t know the time anymore in exchange for this wonderful idea sherman says you re now beholden to count forever and not lose track the man in time management the ever advancing nist clock is one way to understand time but theoretical physicist prescod weinstein bristles at that definition she says this version of time is just the time the government wants you to think about the management of what counts as correct time and what time it is in any given place is deeply related to authority she says the time from this lab is used to run our lives it says when planes take off and land when markets open and close when schoolchildren arrive at class it controls computer networks navigation tools and much much more governments around the world aren t just providing the time as an altruistic service to citizens prescod weinstein argues it s about keeping society organized and efficient it s about increasing economic productivity and this is why people feel so tense about the time it s actually a technology being thrust upon them capitalism sucks and i think a lot of people s relationship to why time is not cool is structured by the resource pressures that we feel she says wibbly wobbly timey wimey true time is actually much more flexible than most people realize prescod weinstein says according to einstein s general theory of relativity space and time are tied together and space time can bend and curve the way to think about it is that that curvature is stretching out time she says as time stretches it slows the best known force that stretches time is gravity the more gravity somebody experiences the slower time passes for them when compared to someone in a lower gravitational field the effect is minuscule compared to a human lifespan but it is real and measurable boulder colo is a mile above sea level that means the gravitational field is slightly weaker and time ticks by a little faster but modern technology can t deal with flowy time like this as a result the timekeepers at boulder and elsewhere make corrections to ensure these different flows of time look like they re ticking in lockstep the same goes for satellites farther from earth like those that make up the global positioning system the system works by measuring the time difference between several satellites carrying clocks in space to the time that people measure on the ground without correctly calibrating for the difference of the ticking clocks inside the gps satellites the system wouldn t be as accurate prescod weinstein says any kind of system that uses gps requires general relativity she says you have to understand what time flow of the satellite is like and how that is different from time flow from earth far out time even farther from earth time gets really freaky in places where gravity is very strong time as we understand it can break down completely at the edge of black holes for example the powerful gravitational pull slows time dramatically says prescod weinstein and upon crossing the black hole s point of no return known as its event horizon she says space and time flip you end up in a region where space now has an arrow and it s one direction and time doesn t have an arrow like it did before she says there s really no sense of time at the edge of the observable universe there s something else happening according to katie mack an astrophysicist at the perimeter institute for theoretical physics in canada the universe is expanding from the big bang and that expansion is stretching time too when you see things in the really distant universe because of the expansion of the universe it takes longer for things to happen she says the effect is known as cosmological time dilation and it s far more powerful than the tiny time changes seen near earth compare for example two identical stars that explode one nearby and one far away if we see a star exploding and that star takes about 10 days to go from the brightest part of the explosion to dim again if we look at it in the very distant universe it might take 20 30 days mack says the far away star isn t exploding more slowly time is ticking more slowly at least from our perspective space time is doomed mack who s written a book called the end of everything astrophysically speaking says that many billions of years into the future time could get stranger still the universe is expanding and because of entropy energy and matter are becoming more and more evenly spread out across the ever growing void in its final state the universe may end up as an inert cloud of energy and matter where everything is evenly distributed in this gray nothingness there is no future there s no arrow of time anymore she says at that point time has no real meaning she says it has no direction subatomic madness so time as we understand it has some really big problems but it also has some really tiny ones too in fact some scientists who study the microscopic interactions of fundamental particles are questioning the idea of time itself space time is doomed says nima arkani hamed a physicist at the institute for advanced study in princeton n j arkani hamed has reached this conclusion over the past decade as he s tried to gain a better understanding of what s happening inside the world s most powerful atom smashers these giant devices use huge amounts of energy to collide together subatomic particles calculating each collision as it happens should according to quantum mechanics require hundreds of pages of complex mathematics yet inexplicably a much simpler equation can work just as well max brice cern cern some theorists believe that collisions within the world s most powerful particle accelerators can only be explained by something other than space time arkani hamed believes the concept of time itself may be behind the discrepancy in physics equations time is used to keep track of the sequence of things as events unfold but he has come to believe that organizing particle collisions according to when unnecessarily complicates the mathematics instead he s experimenting with abstract geometric shapes that can describe events without using time arkani hamed says that these shapes can t yet replace the idea of time but he believes that at some point time itself will be supplanted by some other theory of what makes the universe tick it s unlikely to survive in the fundamental principles of an even deeper understanding of physics he says ticktock ticktock the scientists back at nist are well aware of all the problems with time we are really focused on measuring time but it s pretty hard to really define it in a satisfactory way says john kitching who heads the atomic devices and instrumentation group at nist kitching takes me to a lab where his team is developing their latest marvel an atomic clock that can be mass produced and put on a microchip the vision for this type of clock is to essentially enable atomic timing to be used everywhere he says imagine an atomic clock in every computer and in every cellphone just as humans keep improving their maps they must improve their clocks kitching says better clocks can make gps more accurate computer networks faster and enable new technologies in everything from stock trading to astronomy and that s important because in the end kitching says he actually agrees with chanda prescod weinstein the theoretical physicist who believes that time as we experience it is a technology rather than a fundamental part of the universe he too sees time is a human affair a result of neurons firing and memories formed and books written it s my belief that the forward passage of time is mostly a human construct he says from a physics sense it doesn t have that much value and yet he adds the nist lab s relentless counting of seconds minutes hours and days is being used for everything from navigation to power production for humans there is enormous social value in trying to tame nature s unruly sense of time we need to arrange to meet at a certain place at a certain time he says if we don t have those two pieces of information then we re going to miss each other this story is part of our periodic science series finding time a journey

a new report suggests popular dark chocolate bars may contain high levels of cadmium and lead heavy metals linked to health problems washington is dark chocolate a healthier alternative a consumer reports investigation says otherwise aside from its richer and bittersweet flavor people tend to reach for dark chocolate thanks to its suggested ties to heart health however consumer reports research suggests popular dark chocolate bars contain high levels of cadmium and lead heavy metals linked to health issues in a report published thursday the nonprofit advocacy organization found levels of cadmium and lead in dark chocolate from popular brands like hershey s trader joe s and godiva the national confectioners association the industry s trade group pushed back on the findings saying chocolate and cocoa are safe to eat and can be enjoyed as treats as they have been for centuries all 28 brands tested by consumer reports scientists had heavy metals in them according to the report scientists used california s standard of maximum allowable dose level for lead and cadmium as the determining factor for risk we used those levels because there are no federal limits for the amount of lead and cadmium most foods can contain and cr s scientists believe that california s levels are the most protective available experts said in the report according to the report 23 of the 28 bars tested would put an adult over the public health level for at least one heavy metal by eating just one ounce a day five of those 28 bars had the highest cadmium and lead levels long term exposure to heavy metals contributes to a variety of health problems experts said in the report however the largest affected groups are pregnant people and children as it can cause developmental issues and affect brain development the national confectioners association issued a statement friday in response to the consumer reports investigation citing that california s dose levels used in the study are not food safety standards citing an investigation through the california proposition 65 settlement the association explained that cadmium and lead levels are found in cocoa and chocolate due to the soil the confectioners association added that bean cleaning during processing is one possible solution to reduce cadmium and lead in chocolate products in august it published the results of a three year study on ways to help reduce lead and cadmium in chocolate the products cited in this study are in compliance with strict quality and safety requirements and the levels provided to us by consumer reports testing are well under the limits established by our settlement the association said in a statement food safety and product quality remain our highest priorities and we remain dedicated to being transparent and socially responsible consumer reports found five of the 28 chocolate bars including from ghirardelli had the lowest of heavy metals that shows it s possible for companies to make products with lower amounts of heavy metals and for consumers to find safer products that they enjoy tunde akinleye the food safety researcher who led the project said consumer reports list of safer choices for dark chocolate note california s maximum allowable dose level for lead is 0 5 micrograms and 4 1mcg for cadmium

month his parents went to a central indiana walgreens right away to fill a prescription for antibiotics the only thing that ethan s mother katie swaney got from the drugstore that friday though was a text telling her the pharmacy was out of the antibiotic and her prescription would be ready saturday afternoon on saturday a similar text arrived followed by another on sunday by monday as ethan s fever of 103 and pain continued swaney and her husband started calling pharmacies near their carmel ind home to locate amoxicillin after hours on the phone they found the drug at a northside meijer and were finally able to treat ethan within 24 hours the second grader felt much better and was fever free across indiana parents with sick children have been searching for the medicines they need to ease hacking coughs and feverish chills while amoxicillin has been in short supply since the fall parents are also struggling to find liquid tylenol or ibuprofen for children fighting the flu covid 19 or a host of other circulating viruses i know so many people that are sick right now that have kids that need medicine that aren t able to find it and are jumping through hoops just to get comfort care swaney said patients have been flooding pediatrician offices as a so called tripledemic of rsv respiratory syncytial virus covid 19 and early flu season hits as of the first week in december indiana had seen 24 deaths from flu and its first pediatric flu death according to the indiana department of health last year at this time indiana had reported only one influenza death a flood of patients respiratory illnesses fill children s hospitals the state s hospitals are also seeing more patients than they did last year at this time when the covid 19 omicron wave started to swell according to the indiana hospital association as of earlier this week inpatient volume had jumped 15 with more than 11 000 hospitalized people across the state association officials said in an news release last month the american academy of pediatrics and the children s hospital association asked the federal government to declare the surge in pediatric illnesses a national public health emergency fortunately most of the children falling ill with these diseases do not require hospitalization but outpatient pediatricians have been hearing from more concerned parents in a year that s shaping up to be busier than in a typical pre pandemic year over the past two winters covid concerns led people to social distance and mask when in groups or in school decreasing the spread of multiple respiratory diseases this year many have stopped those behaviors allowing some viruses to flourish and parents to head to pharmacies for drugs to combat those germs and in the wake of viral infections some children will go on to develop bacterial infections that require antibiotics it s not that people are getting sicker than they normally would it s just that it s three years of kids getting sick all at once said dr shannon dillon a pediatrician with riley primary care there aren t supply chain issues it s just because there are so many more sick kids than there would be normally at this time of year since thanksgiving dr sarah stelzner has seen far more children in her marion county practice ill with flu than with covid 19 most of whom have not had their flu shots a past president of the indiana chapter of the american academy of pediatrics stelzner said she s heard of local schools where about 40 of students are absent due to illness demand for children s medications outpaces supply drug shortages are not necessarily uncommon right now there are about 260 medications in limited supply but most of those drugs tend to be medications used in hospitals said erin fox senior senior director of the university of utah health s drug information service which tracks drug shortages usually drug shortages stem from problems with manufacturing but this time appears to be different said veronica vernon an assistant professor of pharmacy practice at butler university college of pharmacy and health sciences while the lack of liquid children s tylenol is not officially a shortage vernon said she knows firsthand how difficult it can be to find it when her 2 year old had croup recently her husband stopped by a local pharmacy to buy acetaminophen he got the last bottle more as flu activity rises marion county hospitals implement visitor restrictions demand is outpacing the supply this really is demand based which is very interesting she said it s really just that we can t keep things on the shelves each year drug manufacturers calculate how much of the supply to make based on how much they sold the previous year fox said because no one predicted that this winter would see so many people fall ill the drug companies did not correctly gauge how much medicine to make i ve been a pharmacist for 12 years now and this isn t the first time we ve had shortages on medications and it will certainly not be the last time on a national level gingerich said what i would love for people to understand is that there are alternatives a lot of times to maybe the first medicine a person would reach for how parents are coping with the medicine shortage without a free flowing supply of the medicines on which they rely to keep sick children comfortable and heal parents and pharmacists have had to get creative gingerich recommends consulting with a pharmacist or other local health care provider for their guidance on navigating alternatives with medications there are side effects and there are reasons to select one over the other and your pharmacist is going to be your best resource for navigating those concerns she said there s no one size fits all in the world of medications even before other parents started talking about a children s liquid tylenol shortage kate onus ka noticed the empty medicine shelves her 7 year old daughter has asthma so onus ka likes to get ahead of any cold she develops treating her with tylenol and albuterol lest the cold lead to more serious health problems about a month and a half ago though when she added liquid tylenol to her curbside grocery order it kept coming up unavailable she started hunting in person but still no luck i thought i was just going to all the wrong places at all the wrong times onus ka said then i saw there was a shortage and gave up instead of the liquid medicine onus ka purchased chewables which she does not feel work as effectively for her daughter still she said she feels fortunate that her daughter can take the chewables she can t imagine how parents with younger children or teething infants are navigating the shortage no antibiotics were available last month when kristi howard shultz s 9 year old henry was diagnosed with strep throat her local pharmacist in bloomington ind called around to other drugstores but no one had the medicine in stock for the next seven days henry subsisted on popsicles and ran a fever consistently above 103 each day howard shultz called the pharmacy and asked the pharmacist if he had found antibiotics eventually close to tears howard shultz said she was concerned her son might develop kidney failure from the high fever the pharmacist called drug stores in other counties and on day seven he had rustled up three tiny bottles from pharmacies in monroe bartholomew and brown counties enough to fill the prescription twelve hours after the first dose henry s fever finally broke after all these years of the pandemic you really take for granted that is a first world problem never did i think we would not be able to get ahold of typical antibiotics howard shultz said many of these companies have told the food and drug administration they will increase production so the shortages will hopefully ease in the coming months in the meantime there are two things you can do to help prevent finding yourself in need of medicine in the first place experts say get your annual flu shot and make sure you are up to date with your covid vaccinations both of these vaccines can prevent severe illness and stave off the virus gingerich recommends families make an effort to plan ahead in case someone does fall ill it may be appropriate to keep one bottle of medicine available at home to avoid encountering shortages later on when that medicine is most needed she also advises that families be comfortable rescheduling plans this holiday season if is sick south bend tribune reporter carley lanich contributed to this story contact indystar reporter shari rudavsky

video game makers in kentucky are cranking four days a week on a new title based on the classic slasher movie the texas chainsaw massacre the twist workers making the horror game are being paid the same salaries they used to get for working five days a week as disruptions to standard workplace practices caused by the pandemic continue to ripple through the economy some companies are adopting 32 hour workweeks at formerly 40 hour pay which effectively makes every friday a paid holiday advertisement advertisement the shortened week has been a winner for gun interactive chief executive wes keltner said as employees stay focused to complete their tasks on time and return to the office on monday with a full head of creative steam because they ve had sufficient downtime you have a finite well of creativity in your body when it s tapped it s tapped he said after that you do subpar work a four day workweek at five day pay sounds exotic because so far it is few companies have formally adopted the practice but it s on the menu for some as employers cast about for ways to set up hybrid work schedules that will appeal to pandemic weary workers they want back in the office or at least fully engaged in their jobs many white collar companies are already partaking in what look like four day weeks even if bosses are expecting workers to put in 40 hours of work at times of their choosing fewer than 20 of u s workers come to the office on fridays these days said mark grinis leader of ey s real estate practice in the americas the weekly average is nearly 50 advertisement advertisement you are already edging toward a vacancy on fridays he said it s not a big leap to block them off the work calendar more than 20 of companies are already implementing some version of a four day workweek and an additional 46 are planning or considering the shorter week ey reported after a november survey ey didn t attempt to break out which companies are committed to 40 hour pay for 32 hours of work and the number of such companies still appears to be small but historic notions about how workers should perform their jobs have been upended before and will be again the accepted number of hours people should work in a week has evolved over time with factory laborers in the industrial revolution clocking as much as 100 hours a week henry ford popularized the eight hour day in the 1920s but 40 hour weeks didn t become the norm until the great depression when the government saw shorter workweeks as a way to spread jobs among more people that standard has stood strong for more than 80 years advertisement advertisement but the pandemic was a strikingly disruptive event that forced companies to find new paths to get their business done and tangibly demonstrated alternatives workplace experts say covid 19 supercharged use of technological advances made in recent decades that made it possible to work anywhere executives knew remote work was feasible but the pandemic forced them to put it into practice at a wide scale the limits of technology once kept workers like these midcentury secretaries bound to their desks h armstrong roberts getty images few workers want to go back to office practices built around landlines typewriters and snail mail that chained people to their company workstations as the world war i doughboy song goes they have seen par ee and don t wanna return to the family farm advertisement advertisement we broke the mold on how it s supposed to work grinis said and we re not going back the government is unlikely to make four day weeks a rule for employers any time soon a bill that would have changed the definition of a workweek from 40 hours to 32 hours for companies with more than 500 employees stalled in the california legislature last spring people who worked more than 32 hours would have received overtime pay opponents said a four day workweek would stunt job growth in the state and could create untenable conditions for employers the california chamber of commerce included the bill on its job killer list writing that it would significantly increase labor costs expose employers to litigation and impose requirements that would be impossible to comply with national legislation introduced in congress last year to mandate overtime after 32 hours of work also failed but its sponsor rep mark takano d riverside has vowed to try again advertisement advertisement people continue to work longer hours while their pay remains stagnant he said in a statement we cannot continue to accept this as our reality a recent pilot study of four day workweeks for five day pay unsurprisingly found that workers loved the concept but also found that many bosses ended up on board too in the international study by new zealand nonprofit 4 day week global 33 companies with nearly 1 000 workers agreed to a six month tryout of shortened workweeks the study was done through an international collaboration with researchers at boston college university college dublin and cambridge university most of the study participants were in the u s and ireland advertisement advertisement the companies are extremely pleased with their performance productivity and overall experience the report said they reported that revenue rose over the course of the trial sick days and absenteeism were down and resignations fell slightly stress burnout fatigue and work family conflict all declined while physical and mental health positive affect work family and work life balance and satisfaction across multiple domains of life increased the report said none of the 27 companies that completed the final survey said they were leaning toward going back to five day weeks and 18 said they would definitely continue their four day schedules identities of the participants were not revealed but three small companies reached by the times also said their experiments with four day weeks were successful and that they won t go back to five day schedules advertisement advertisement the benefits are significant gun interactive s keltner said i have yet to see a prominent con gun interactive has been on the program since early 2021 he said we haven t looked back since employees work together monday through thursday in their office in lexington keltner acknowledges that there is the occasional friday when i need a couple of people but it s rarely a full day s worth of work most fridays he goes fishing or hiking to unwind he said young employees at design firm halftone digital in minneapolis like to go out on thursday nights because they have fridays off founder michael arney said advertisement advertisement arney removed fridays from the company workweek without reducing salaries early this year after he lost a designer to a firm that offered the employee a 50 raise for me that was really the straw because i thought to myself i can t afford to compete with that type of salary but what i can compete on is lifestyle and culture his employees were at first subdued when he announced the four day plan as an experiment i thought i would hear more cheering he said perhaps they were waiting for another shoe to drop he said with employees wondering is this for real or is it just lip service is it just 50 of the time there were a lot of unknowns from folks advertisement advertisement the company s digital design business lends itself to remote work and flexible hours he said and it no longer has a physical office employees also get unlimited paid time off clients sometimes give arney some jealous ribbing about his company s schedule but i have not heard or sensed any ill will about halftone digital s performance he said occasional hours on fridays are required to meet client needs but none of his eight employees have left since the policy was put in place arney said he often spends his fridays playing pickleball and lunching with his mother in her retirement home while shorter workweeks are being embraced by some companies bucking the established 40 hour standard is not without peril said edward walker a sociology professor at ucla what if i m the only company that does this when my competitors don t he said that could create a competitive disadvantage when most people live in the 40 hour world and expect to do business all week how would customers respond for instance to learn the service desk they want to contact is closed fridays can employees really finish what needs to be done for the week in 32 hours or would employers need to take on additional help or pay overtime as chamber of commerce opponents fear raising labor costs what about startups that offer stock as sweat equity to employees in exchange for round the clock commitments edward walker is a professor of sociology at ucla who studies the social movement of companies myung j chun los angeles times there are many interlocking systems and expectations built around the 40 hour standard walker said and changing the status quo might require the force of a labor movement for now it s pioneers such as kale flax that are cutting workers hours without reducing their pay the design company that helps clients launch new brands started working 32 hour weeks in 2018 when creative principal tarik nally was looking for ways to make his louisville ky business more competitive at attracting and retaining talent he said employees are on call fridays to respond to client emergencies but the need doesn t arise often enough to diminish the benefits of more time off he said we give people 52 days back a year and maybe on six of those fridays put in 45 minutes to help with a quick emergency when company revenue fell during the pandemic kale flax contemplated working fridays but stuck with four days and went on to recover financially the trick is to stay focused every day nally said even when you re not feeling like it there are days where i wish i could be lazy and then make it up on friday since adopting the 32 hour week though we ve doubled in team size we also doubled our revenue in the last three years the company has 14 people and he is looking to hire two more he said we ve never had anyone we offered a job to decline time to unwind is more important to employee satisfaction than petty perks he said are your perks a pingpong table and free beer or is it giving people the space to invest in themselves and their families americans relationships with their employment may be in flux but the country s long standing work ethic finds virtue in plugging away as hard and as long as it takes to get the job done said roy bahat head of bloomberg beta an early stage venture firm backed by bloomberg that invests in startups intended to make work better and a lecturer at uc berkeley in america we associate value at work with intensity he said that can be confused with hours of work and be rewarded too he said get in the office before everybody and leave after everybody else is a common piece of advice that you hear and the truth is it can work really well but business owners are willing to try new ways of operating that wouldn t have occurred to them before the pandemic he said the genie is out of the bottle experimentation might slow next year if the economy slows he said but employers will keep trying new ways to achieve productivity outside the 40 hours in the office template absolutely more companies are going to try 32 hour weeks because more companies are going to try lots of different things to see what works bahat said i think the next 10 years are going to be years of trial and error this story originally appeared in los angeles times

the american car industry has been pumping out some insanely good cars for the past century from the big luxury cruisers to the legendary muscle cars we grew to love these bald eagle machines but among this list of tire smoking hooligans and land yachts we also got some boring shoulder sagging cars and the jeep grand wagoneer is one of them don t get me wrong it s a really good car but there just isn t anything exciting about it from the beginning this wood panel ocean liner was nothing more than the family hauler and there s nothing particularly wrong with that it s just that this is an american vehicle so we expected an absolute monster under the hood yes it got a v8 but it wasn t anything out of the ordinary and with styling that would make even your grandma sigh it flew under the radar of a lot of car enthusiasts but with that said there are a select few petrolheads out there that love this platform and throw mods at them to finally bring them justice for example here is one listed on bring a trailer at first glance you wouldn t look twice at it but pop the hood and the story changes yes it s a sleeper making it way cooler than a 69 mustang powering this grandpa mobile is arguably the most american engine out there the ls i think the saying ls swap the world is a little too much but the ls3 fits this thing like a glove we don t know a power figure for the so called grand frankeneer but you can be more than certain that it is more than enough to take teenagers in their 240sx builds by surprise not to leave you hanging about the power number this ls3 looks mostly stock but is still enough to put down 495 hp 502 ps according to chevrolet it also has a few supporting mods like a lift kit and a gm 4le65e gearbox but that s about it because you know it s a sleeper it s not supposed to be shouty there are a lot of american cars that get easily overlooked in favor of their popular siblings but that doesn t mean they can t be cool so give them a chance

at a hospital in a chicago suburb last winter there were so few nurses that psychiatric patients with covid 19 were left waiting a full day for beds and a single aide was on hand to assist with 32 infected patients nurses were so distraught about the inadequate staffing that they banded together to file formal complaints every day for more than a month at a hospital outside flint michigan chronic understaffing meant that patients languished in dried feces while robots replaced nursing assistants who would normally sit with mentally impaired patients both hospitals are owned by one of the country s largest health systems ascension it spent years reducing its staffing levels in an effort to improve profitability even though the chain is a nonprofit organization with nearly 18 billion of cash reserves since the start of the pandemic nurses have been leaving hospitals in droves the exodus stems from many factors with the hospital industry blaming covid staff burnout and tight labor markets for acute shortages of staff but a new york times investigation has found that hospitals helped lay the groundwork for the labor crisis long before the arrival of the coronavirus looking to bolster their bottom lines hospitals sought to wring more work out of fewer employees when the pandemic swamped hospitals with critically ill patients their lean staffing went from a financial strength to a glaring weakness more than half of the roughly 5 000 hospitals in the united states are nonprofits in exchange for avoiding taxes the irs requires them to offer services such as free health care for low income patients that help their communities ascension which runs 139 hospitals is emblematic of the industrywide movement to keep labor costs low as recently as 2019 ascension was trumpeting its success at reducing its number of employees per occupied bed a common industry staffing metric at one point executives boasted about how they had slashed 500 million from the chain s labor costs in the years before the pandemic they refused requests to hire more medical workers or fill open jobs according to current and former hospital administrators and employees the yearslong effort a combination of widespread layoffs and attrition left ascension flat footed for covid to understand how ascension s strategies affected patients the times focused on two hospitals st joseph in illinois and genesys in michigan where nurses belonged to unions that tracked staffing cuts and kept detailed logs of what they said were unsafe conditions the times reviewed more than 3 000 pages of those logs and interviewed 70 current and former nurses executives and other employees at ascension hospitals nurses said that ascension s downsizing had stark consequences patients lingered for hours on gurneys with serious time sensitive problems surgeries were delayed other patients developed bedsores because they were not repositioned often enough you feel awful because you know you re not turning these patients said jillian wahlfors a nurse at genesys you know they re getting their meds late you don t have time to listen to them they re having accidents because you can t get in fast enough to take them to the bathroom nick ragone an ascension spokesperson denied that cost cutting contributed to staffing shortages during the pandemic such a claim he said is fundamentally misguided misleading and demonstrates a lack of understanding of the impact of covid 19 on the health care workforce he also said ascension offers superior care that has been improving over time and that the hospital provides free treatment for many low income patients ascension operates in 19 states mostly in the south and the midwest it serves about 6 million patients by many measures ascension is rich in addition to its billions in cash it runs an investment company that manages more than 41 billion last year it paid its ceo joseph impicciche 13 million because of its nonprofit status ascension avoids more than 1 billion a year in federal state and local taxes according to the lown institute a health care think tank until the pandemic ascension was consistently profitable earning hundreds of millions a year the past year was a rare exception because of the stock market downturn and soaring labor costs ascension lost 1 8 billion ascension and its executives have powerful incentives to be as profitable as possible the more money the chain makes the more its executives get paid ragone said that a larger proportion of executives pay is based on other factors like delivering high quality care and stronger financial metrics allow the chain to borrow money at lower interest rates enabling it to buy new hospitals and add services four former executives who joined ascension from other nonprofit hospital systems said the profit driven culture surprised them the pressure to reach financial targets struck them as more befitting a for profit company their whole approach to the finances was right out of the wall street playbook said william weeks who until his retirement in 2019 was the chief operating officer of a five hospital chain that ascension owns in oklahoma when the pandemic hit nurses at st joseph the only hospital in joliet illinois were overwhelmed and feared for the safety of patients according to state inspection records and thousands of pages of formal complaints that nurses filed with the hospital warning about unsafe conditions every day it s unsafe staffing one nurse wrote in june 2020 nurses said they had been finding themselves in such situations more and more since 2018 when ascension took over st joseph shortly after the acquisition st joseph employed 791 nurses that number has since dropped by 23 according to the illinois nurses association which represents the hospital s nurses and has clashed with ascension s management over pay and other issues ragone said that st joseph s number of employees per occupied bed went up 6 between 2018 and 2021 but that figure partly reflects ascension having reduced its capacity the data also includes many employees who do not treat patients ragone would not provide data specific to nurses some of the nurses grievances have been substantiated by state authorities in april 2021 illinois health inspectors cited st joseph for failing to care for patients who needed to be regularly repositioned the inspectors found that some patients developed bedsores after they were not moved for as much as 20 hours despite doctors orders that they be shifted often since then the problems have intensified in january as the omicron wave pummeled the chicago area groups of nurses signed the formal complaints on more than 130 occasions at the beginning of the month an entire shift of eight nurses in one unit signed a complaint that there was only one nurses aide available for 32 patients with covid most of them on oxygen at the end of the month no one showed up to staff the surgical supply room when two patients needed emergency surgery nurses were left to gather instruments themselves one surgery was delayed and a nurse had to abandon a 100 year old patient to run for supplies one night in october nurses in st joseph s intensive care unit learned that they would have to care for four patients each double the industry standard the hospital had to divert ambulances from delivering patients until more nurses arrived four nights later nurses in the emergency room refused to clock in because they were being asked to care for 11 patients each instead of the recommended four it was inevitable said jillian moffett who was among the nurses who protested the staffing levels one of these days someone was going to put their foot down and say i m not taking this anymore in 2019 ascension received an award from a company called avasure the avaprize was bestowed upon the hospital chain because of its embrace of a new cost cutting innovation robots traditionally ascension like other hospitals sent nurses aides into the rooms of patients who needed close supervision left untended these patients many with dementia or psychiatric illnesses might get out of bed and hurt themselves but in the years before the pandemic some ascension hospitals switched course going forward they would generally assign nurses aides only to patients who were deemed at high risk of dying by suicide for other patients aides would be replaced by avasure s telesitters by 2019 ascension had installed 450 of the robots in more than 50 of its hospitals the devices essentially a video camera mounted on a metal pole send live footage to an off site command center where workers talk to patients through speakers in the machine but at ascension s genesys hospital in michigan nurses said patients were confused by the disembodied voices coming from telesitters there were sometimes not enough robots to go around and when workers at the command center called the hospital about wayward patients there were often no secretaries at genesys available to answer the phones ascension had cut those jobs in 2018 ascension had laid off workers including at least 500 in michigan even as the chain that year reported profits of 2 2 billion genesys one of a handful of unionized ascension hospitals avoided those layoffs instead administrators froze hiring since the hiring freeze was imposed the number of permanent nurses working at genesys has fallen by roughly 30 according to the teamsters union that represents the nurses ascension partially filled that gap by hiring temporary nurses and ragone said genesys employees per occupied bed increased 12 between 2018 and 2021 like st joseph genesys reduced its patient capacity which contributed to the rise in the staffing ratio and ragone would not provide data about the hospital s nursing staff yet nurses said that to keep things running genesys demanded they work 16 hour shifts threatening to fire some who refused because of exhaustion or child care commitments on at least four occasions this year managers have written in nurses employment files that refusing to work 16 hour shifts is not in line with our value of dedication according to internal disciplinary records reviewed by the times even as the pandemic has waned nurses at st joseph and genesys said there remained so many unfilled positions that they felt like they were working in a perpetual crisis as of this month 24 of the 52 night shift positions in genesys medical and surgical intensive care units were listed as unfilled and 17 of the open jobs had yet to be advertised according to the hospital s internal tally which the times reviewed nurses at st joseph in illinois also were at their breaking point make this better ascension shame on you one nurse wrote in a formal complaint in june the nurse described a chaotic scene in the emergency room where there were not enough nurses or beds for seriously ill patients someone is going to die if this continues another nurse wrote in july and there is no indication that anyone is concerned c 2022 the new york times company

brussels afp russia is readying for a protracted war in ukraine and kyiv s nato backers must keep sending weapons until president vladimir putin realises he cannot win on the battlefield alliance chief jens stoltenberg told afp on friday advertising read more almost 10 months into moscow s invasion kyiv s forces have inflicted a succession of defeats on the kremlin that have seen swathes of territory liberated but nato secretary general stoltenberg warned there was no sign putin had given up his overall goal of controlling ukraine we should not underestimate russia russia is planning for a long war stoltenberg said in an interview we see that they are mobilising more forces that they are willing to suffer also a lot of casualties that they are trying to get access to more weapons and ammunition he added we have to understand that president putin is ready to be in this war for a long time and to launch new offensives nato allies led by the united states have sent billion of dollars of weaponry to ukraine that have helped it turn the tables in the conflict and put moscow on the back foot most likely this war will end at the negotiating table as most wars do stoltenberg said insisting any solution should ensure ukraine prevails as a sovereign independent nation the fastest way to achieve that is to support them militarily so president putin understands that he cannot win on the battlefield but has to sit down and negotiate in good faith ramping up production in response to its setbacks on the battlefield moscow has unleashed waves of missile and drone strikes against ukraine s civilian energy infrastructure us reports say washington is finalising plans to send its most advanced patriot missile batteries to ukraine to add to other western air defence systems provided to kyiv stoltenberg said there was a discussion going on about delivering patriots but pointed out that nato allies had to make sure there was enough ammunition and spare parts to keep weapons sent so far working we have a dialogue among allies on additional systems but it becomes more and more important to ensure that all the systems that are delivered are functional ukraine s demands for more weapons and a huge flow of ammunition have drained the stockpiles of nato members and sparked fears the alliance s defence industries may not be able to produce enough we are ramping up production to do exactly that to be able both to replenish our own stocks for deterrence and defence and to continue to provide support to ukraine for the long haul stoltenberg said in the short term that means more shifts at factories to maximise output and over time bolstering joint purchases of weapons and giving industry long term demand signals so they can invest more he said pivotal moment putin s full scale invasion of ukraine has been a seismic shock for the west it has forced nato to carry out its biggest adaptation since the end of the cold war by massively bolstering its eastern flank and it has seen finland and sweden push to enter the alliance this is the most dangerous security crisis we have been in in europe since the second world war stoltenberg said this is a pivotal moment for security stoltenberg said that while there had been a drop off recently in nuclear threats from putin the alliance remained vigilant and will constantly monitor what they do nuclear rhetoric in reference to potential use of nuclear weapons is reckless is dangerous the nato chief said his aim is of course to deter us from supporting ukraine but he will not succeed in doing that stoltenberg s current term as nato head is set to expire towards the end of 2023 after allied leaders in march extended his tenure for an extra year because of the war raging in ukraine the former norwegian prime minister 63 remained non committal on whether he would definitely leave the post next year saying only i have no other plans he would not be drawn on calls from some for a woman to succeed him as nato s first female secretary general my focus is on fulfilling my responsibilities as secretary general of nato in a way that ensures that this alliance continues to stand together he said that s my only focus and then i leave it to the heads of state and government to decide what happens after my term 2022 afp

one of the first things to happen when the pandemic rolled into the united states in march of 2020 was the sudden shortage of some common items toilet paper hand sanitizier pasta canned goods etc people were panic buying for most of us it was kind of shocking with the exception of the old none of us had ever dealt with shortages over the last few years as we have dealt with the pandemic an economic downturn supply chain issues etc occasional shortages have become a lot more common even though they are more common the shortages seem to be a lot less extreme the shortages tend to be on a random item here or a random item there it looks like we could soon be dealing with another shortage this shortage on a common grocery store item may affect how you enjoy breaking or how you enjoy vodka according to cnn we can expect to see a drop in the number of oranges produced by the state of florida because of poor weather and disease the state is only expected to grow about 20 million boxes of oranges during the 2022 2023 season that is about half of what the state produced in the previous season as a result of this shortage consumers can expect the price of oranges and products made with real oranges to go up in the first part of 2023 so you may want to stock up on frozen oj or get the kids used to drinking sunny delight and tang according to the executive director of the florida department of citrus shannon shepp the paltry crop is a result of the ongoing problem of citrus greening a disease that has plagued florida orange trees and squeezed supply for years combined with a january freeze and the dual blows of hurricanes ian and nicole so when will we start to see a price increase so far futures prices have already gone up 42 we can expect to see those increase passed on to the customers sometime in the next three to six months fortunately it looks like help is on the way from central america and south america the plan is to import oranges from places like costa rica and brazil
it s a bank it s a starbucks it s a produce stand locally owned rainier fresh has launched their produce stand and seasonal goods store at the former site of the columbia bank in buckley aiming to give local residents a much needed new place to get fresh fruits veggies and dairy products the fate of the building had been up in the air for years since columbia bank pulled out in 2019 arizona based avalon development applied with the city in the spring last year to retrofit the building for a starbucks coffee shop but those plans fell through occupying the building instead is a soon to be produce stand run by local residents taylor and derek muirhead the store which had its grand opening nov 25 is currently selling christmas goods like trees wreaths and seasonal gifts winter is after all a hard time to sell solely fruits and vegetables but by february they hope to be selling local produce they ll also likely be looking for employees around then with three kids including one born just days after they got the keys to the place the muirheads hope to make rainier fresh a family business that can feed residents in buckley who don t want to make the trip to bonney lake or enumclaw we ve lived here our whole lives and we feel there needs to be more of a grocery store or something where if you can t go into town you have a place to go to get what you need taylor muirhead said located at 29290 wa 410 rainier fresh is perched in a coveted corner of the city the intersection of highways 410 and 165 connects buckley bonney lake south prairie and wilkeson and it shares a parking lot with butchery blue max meats so while buckley doesn t have a true full scale department store residents will soon be able to cobble together dinner with a visit to the 410 165 intersection buckley foods another small grocer sits on the other side of 410 the obvious synergies of the location aren t lost on the muirheads they already have an agreement to share the parking lot with blue max we linked up right away derek said the relationship just sparked instantly we re helping each other out all the time things like summertime big tent sales in the parking lot and that relationship doesn t hurt buckley s small town feel either as the city continues to grow with numerous specialty stores we previously reported on fellow up and coming shop rainier creamery though we incorrectly referred to it as the new tenant at the columbia bank building instead of rainier fresh the muirheads who met at as students at white river high school would help fill a gap that many cities would plug with a safeway fred meyer or walmart as far as bringing a meal to your family table i think between the creamery us and blue max i feel like we could absolutely provide everything you need derek said we re not going to have stuff like top ramen but anything you could need to make a meal for your family i d say you could get right here in town fresh ideas the muirheads are locals but they lived in puyallup for a year where they launched a produce stand of their own around 2015 the business was successful but became a challenging time sink so they switched back to regular jobs for a time prior to launching rainier fresh they d both been working at aa asphalting for 8 or 9 years derek was commuting to seattle everyday for work and the couple was looking for an opportunity to have more time with their three kids and to run their own business they wanted to model that dream after the tacoma boys markets an expansive local produce shop that served much of the variety you d find at a larger grocery store one lesson they learned from their puyallup fruit stand we wanted an indoor location derek said with their previous location when it s windy you re cold if it s cold you re cold by 2019 they were starting to look for a location the empty columbia bank building fit the bill so they called property owner tom dantzler and figured they d toss their hat in the ring eighty four year old dantzler who also owns blue max meats liked what he saw he shared high praise for both businesses i did my first mobile home park in 1968 so i ve been in the development and real estate business for years he said in a phone interview the blue max and rainier fresh owners are the classiest entrepreneurial people i ve met in my life they re so honest so energetic so ethical i m just thrilled to be their landlord the starbucks plan fell through due to conflicts with city parking code according to building and planning director emily terrell city code requires parking spaces to correlate to the size of the building they re using starbucks said most of the columbia bank building would be used for storage since they didn t need a building that big the city concurred and said that starbucks then shouldn t need as much parking the city s hearing examiner stuck to the code terrell said and denied avalon development s request in october starbucks took the denial and didn t appeal but may be looking at another spot on highway 410 she said concerns over the traffic also complicated the proposal dantzler said putting the coffee company on that block could have cranked up traffic at an already busy intersection the property also got interest from financial companies and a food supplier dantzler said but a bank considering the property wasn t sure the location could generate enough profit and the food supplier got taken over by a bigger company which wasn t interested in launching a satellite store in buckley in the meantime the muirheads had this dream they re doing now to sell fresh produce and christmas trees dantzler said we met with them instantly we effectively couldn t find finer people a family business in the making the muirheads signed their lease in august and started tearing out tiled flooring carpeting and other remnants of the bank and bringing in produce shelves and refrigerators they spent around 50 000 to 60 000 in construction alone derek said not to mention the months of work that went into turning a bank into a produce stand they said that aside from hiring two contractors to work on the sign out front and the sliding door they did all the work themselves we ve had a lot of family help taylor said it s kind of become a family business that s what we re hoping anyway the goal is to keep the food as local as possible though planned goods like bananas and pineapples are obviously not quite amenable to growing in the pacific northwest in the future derek plans to open up a room near the front to offer local dairy like eggs and cheese and bread pies cakes all sorts of stuff starting in march or april they hope to have bins of corn from yakima watermelon apples peaches derek said and knowing it just got picked the night before or even that morning that s pretty cool but that will all take time so the muirheads are selling christmas cheer in the meantime the store is currently stuffed with holiday items like christmas plants for table centerpieces garlands ornaments wreaths in sizes from 20 to 32 inches and poinsettias along with stocking stuffers like biscotti toffee and chocolate covered cherries from around washington they also stock kettle corn from local blue barn outside they re selling noble douglas fir fir nordmann fir and grand fir christmas trees sourced from chehalis sundays from 1 to 6 p m they re offering pictures with santa at the store the store is hard to miss just look for the sign with the big blue r by the highway for more information follow the store at facebook com rainierfresh and

at a hospital in a chicago suburb last winter there were so few nurses that psychiatric patients with covid 19 were left waiting a full day for beds and a single aide was on hand to assist with 32 infected patients nurses were so distraught about the inadequate staffing that they banded together to file formal complaints every day for more than a month at a hospital outside flint michigan chronic understaffing meant that patients languished in dried feces while robots replaced nursing assistants who would normally sit with mentally impaired patients both hospitals are owned by one of the country s largest health systems ascension it spent years reducing its staffing levels in an effort to improve profitability even though the chain is a nonprofit organization with nearly 18 billion of cash reserves since the start of the pandemic nurses have been leaving hospitals in droves the exodus stems from many factors with the hospital industry blaming covid staff burnout and tight labor markets for acute shortages of staff but a new york times investigation has found that hospitals helped lay the groundwork for the labor crisis long before the arrival of the coronavirus looking to bolster their bottom lines hospitals sought to wring more work out of fewer employees when the pandemic swamped hospitals with critically ill patients their lean staffing went from a financial strength to a glaring weakness more than half of the roughly 5 000 hospitals in the united states are nonprofits in exchange for avoiding taxes the irs requires them to offer services such as free health care for low income patients that help their communities ascension which runs 139 hospitals is emblematic of the industrywide movement to keep labor costs low as recently as 2019 ascension was trumpeting its success at reducing its number of employees per occupied bed a common industry staffing metric at one point executives boasted about how they had slashed 500 million from the chain s labor costs in the years before the pandemic they refused requests to hire more medical workers or fill open jobs according to current and former hospital administrators and employees the yearslong effort a combination of widespread layoffs and attrition left ascension flat footed for covid to understand how ascension s strategies affected patients the times focused on two hospitals st joseph in illinois and genesys in michigan where nurses belonged to unions that tracked staffing cuts and kept detailed logs of what they said were unsafe conditions the times reviewed more than 3 000 pages of those logs and interviewed 70 current and former nurses executives and other employees at ascension hospitals nurses said that ascension s downsizing had stark consequences patients lingered for hours on gurneys with serious time sensitive problems surgeries were delayed other patients developed bedsores because they were not repositioned often enough you feel awful because you know you re not turning these patients said jillian wahlfors a nurse at genesys you know they re getting their meds late you don t have time to listen to them they re having accidents because you can t get in fast enough to take them to the bathroom nick ragone an ascension spokesperson denied that cost cutting contributed to staffing shortages during the pandemic such a claim he said is fundamentally misguided misleading and demonstrates a lack of understanding of the impact of covid 19 on the health care workforce he also said ascension offers superior care that has been improving over time and that the hospital provides free treatment for many low income patients ascension operates in 19 states mostly in the south and the midwest it serves about 6 million patients by many measures ascension is rich in addition to its billions in cash it runs an investment company that manages more than 41 billion last year it paid its ceo joseph impicciche 13 million because of its nonprofit status ascension avoids more than 1 billion a year in federal state and local taxes according to the lown institute a health care think tank until the pandemic ascension was consistently profitable earning hundreds of millions a year the past year was a rare exception because of the stock market downturn and soaring labor costs ascension lost 1 8 billion ascension and its executives have powerful incentives to be as profitable as possible the more money the chain makes the more its executives get paid ragone said that a larger proportion of executives pay is based on other factors like delivering high quality care and stronger financial metrics allow the chain to borrow money at lower interest rates enabling it to buy new hospitals and add services four former executives who joined ascension from other nonprofit hospital systems said the profit driven culture surprised them the pressure to reach financial targets struck them as more befitting a for profit company their whole approach to the finances was right out of the wall street playbook said william weeks who until his retirement in 2019 was the chief operating officer of a five hospital chain that ascension owns in oklahoma when the pandemic hit nurses at st joseph the only hospital in joliet illinois were overwhelmed and feared for the safety of patients according to state inspection records and thousands of pages of formal complaints that nurses filed with the hospital warning about unsafe conditions every day it s unsafe staffing one nurse wrote in june 2020 nurses said they had been finding themselves in such situations more and more since 2018 when ascension took over st joseph shortly after the acquisition st joseph employed 791 nurses that number has since dropped by 23 according to the illinois nurses association which represents the hospital s nurses and has clashed with ascension s management over pay and other issues ragone said that st joseph s number of employees per occupied bed went up 6 between 2018 and 2021 but that figure partly reflects ascension having reduced its capacity the data also includes many employees who do not treat patients ragone would not provide data specific to nurses some of the nurses grievances have been substantiated by state authorities in april 2021 illinois health inspectors cited st joseph for failing to care for patients who needed to be regularly repositioned the inspectors found that some patients developed bedsores after they were not moved for as much as 20 hours despite doctors orders that they be shifted often since then the problems have intensified in january as the omicron wave pummeled the chicago area groups of nurses signed the formal complaints on more than 130 occasions at the beginning of the month an entire shift of eight nurses in one unit signed a complaint that there was only one nurses aide available for 32 patients with covid most of them on oxygen at the end of the month no one showed up to staff the surgical supply room when two patients needed emergency surgery nurses were left to gather instruments themselves one surgery was delayed and a nurse had to abandon a 100 year old patient to run for supplies one night in october nurses in st joseph s intensive care unit learned that they would have to care for four patients each double the industry standard the hospital had to divert ambulances from delivering patients until more nurses arrived four nights later nurses in the emergency room refused to clock in because they were being asked to care for 11 patients each instead of the recommended four it was inevitable said jillian moffett who was among the nurses who protested the staffing levels one of these days someone was going to put their foot down and say i m not taking this anymore in 2019 ascension received an award from a company called avasure the avaprize was bestowed upon the hospital chain because of its embrace of a new cost cutting innovation robots traditionally ascension like other hospitals sent nurses aides into the rooms of patients who needed close supervision left untended these patients many with dementia or psychiatric illnesses might get out of bed and hurt themselves but in the years before the pandemic some ascension hospitals switched course going forward they would generally assign nurses aides only to patients who were deemed at high risk of dying by suicide for other patients aides would be replaced by avasure s telesitters by 2019 ascension had installed 450 of the robots in more than 50 of its hospitals the devices essentially a video camera mounted on a metal pole send live footage to an off site command center where workers talk to patients through speakers in the machine but at ascension s genesys hospital in michigan nurses said patients were confused by the disembodied voices coming from telesitters there were sometimes not enough robots to go around and when workers at the command center called the hospital about wayward patients there were often no secretaries at genesys available to answer the phones ascension had cut those jobs in 2018 ascension had laid off workers including at least 500 in michigan even as the chain that year reported profits of 2 2 billion genesys one of a handful of unionized ascension hospitals avoided those layoffs instead administrators froze hiring since the hiring freeze was imposed the number of permanent nurses working at genesys has fallen by roughly 30 according to the teamsters union that represents the nurses ascension partially filled that gap by hiring temporary nurses and ragone said genesys employees per occupied bed increased 12 between 2018 and 2021 like st joseph genesys reduced its patient capacity which contributed to the rise in the staffing ratio and ragone would not provide data about the hospital s nursing staff yet nurses said that to keep things running genesys demanded they work 16 hour shifts threatening to fire some who refused because of exhaustion or child care commitments on at least four occasions this year managers have written in nurses employment files that refusing to work 16 hour shifts is not in line with our value of dedication according to internal disciplinary records reviewed by the times even as the pandemic has waned nurses at st joseph and genesys said there remained so many unfilled positions that they felt like they were working in a perpetual crisis as of this month 24 of the 52 night shift positions in genesys medical and surgical intensive care units were listed as unfilled and 17 of the open jobs had yet to be advertised according to the hospital s internal tally which the times reviewed nurses at st joseph in illinois also were at their breaking point make this better ascension shame on you one nurse wrote in a formal complaint in june the nurse described a chaotic scene in the emergency room where there were not enough nurses or beds for seriously ill patients someone is going to die if this continues another nurse wrote in july and there is no indication that anyone is concerned c 2022 the new york times company

in recent years companies have paid significant attention to corporate board diversity many corporations have done so on their own initiative as part of their broader commitment to diversity equity and inclusion dei while others have acted to comply with state mandates requiring a certain number of board members from underrepresented groups pressure from investors has also focused attention on board representation research supports a strong business case for board diversity which can counteract groupthink enhance decision making and lead to improved corporate governance and performance at the same time concrete efforts to diversify corporate boards have come increasingly under attack for example private litigants have successfully challenged under the state constitution california laws that mandate a particular number of diverse board members for california based companies the fifth circuit court of appeals recently heard argument in a challenge to a nasdaq rule that requires listed companies to disclose board level diversity statistics and if they do not have at least two diverse directors to explain why most recently in a decision issued last month a new jersey state court struck down the new jersey state bar association s system of reserving board seats for members of particular underrepresented groups holding that it violated the state s anti discrimination law this challenge to a group s voluntary effort to increase board diversity is particularly notable and may foreshadow similar lawsuits against private companies together these challenges underscore the legal risk that many types of organizations face under federal and state law when they endeavor to diversify their boards to be sure not every private company and voluntary program is equally susceptible to legal challenge board members typically are not considered employees and thus not subject to title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 which is a common hook for reverse discrimination claims challenging dei programs that said race conscious board initiatives might run afoul of other federal statutes like section 1981 of the civil rights act of 1866 which prohibits race discrimination in the making and enforcing of contracts and companies that receive federal funds may face additional liability under other federal laws furthermore as explained below many state antidiscrimination laws have broader coverage than federal law and therefore present additional risk even for private companies as companies seek to balance their diversity objectives with mounting legal risk we urge them to consider the following best practices consider strategies that expand opportunities rather than quotas quotas or numerical targets that aim to set aside a certain number of board seats for members of underrepresented groups have attracted the most judicial scrutiny and bring the greatest risk of private litigation many companies can avoid this potential problem by relying on strategies that expand opportunity in lieu of quotas such efforts might include increasing the number of board seats establishing shorter and fixed terms and perhaps most importantly looking to a broader base of individuals as candidates for board seats companies might consider leaders in government and nonprofits and those who have served in a broader set of roles within corporations as potential candidates rather than the more limited set of c suite executives who have historically populated corporate boards companies can mitigate the harm of likeness bias which often occurs when existing board members rely on their own networks to recommend candidates by using more formal processes by which to create a candidate pool and ultimately interview and select candidates in recent years many corporations have adopted a version of the rooney rule in which they commit to considering at least one diverse candidate for an open board seat while this strategy is not without legal risk it may withstand challenge better than a strict numerical quota for board seats themselves and while studies suggest that the rooney rule has not had the impact on outcomes that proponents hoped companies can and should continue to explore thoughtful approaches to expanding the pipeline for board seats to ensure that it includes qualified diverse candidates pay attention to state anti discrimination laws when companies consider their legal risk under anti discrimination laws they often have federal law in mind yet state law can be especially important in this context state antidiscrimination laws often have a broader reach than their federal counterparts covering more types of organizations relationships and protected characteristics in the new jersey case discussed above for instance the court explained that the state s antidiscrimination law applied to the private state bar association because of a specific amendment to the law that makes it unlawful for a private club or association to discriminate against any member on the basis of listed protected characteristics including race and sex in addition some states have relaxed standing requirements as compared to the requirements in federal court for example in a challenge brought in california state court to the board quota system the state court allowed the challenge to proceed despite the lack of any injured plaintiff based on a taxpayer standing theory that is not cognizable in federal court employ a broader definition of diversity that does not rely solely on protected characteristics in order to realize the fullest benefits of diversity corporations should strive to include various perspectives backgrounds and expertise on their boards holistic processes that evaluate candidates as individuals are far less vulnerable to the types of claims brought against quotas or numerical targets companies should consider using evaluation and selection criteria that prioritize diversity along the full range of human experiences which can protect against allegations that they are making decisions solely based on race gender or any other protected characteristic further companies can also consider factors such as a demonstrated commitment to diversity experience working with diverse populations and stakeholders and past involvement in dei programs as they look to seat new board members given this evolving legal landscape companies should consider taking proactive steps to protect their existing efforts to increase board diversity and should craft any new board diversity initiatives with the above considerations in mind footnotes

at a hospital in a chicago suburb last winter there were so few nurses that psychiatric patients with covid 19 were left waiting a full day for beds and a single aide was on hand to assist with 32 infected patients nurses were so distraught about the inadequate staffing that they banded together to file formal complaints every day for more than a month at a hospital outside flint michigan chronic understaffing meant that patients languished in dried feces while robots replaced nursing assistants who would normally sit with mentally impaired patients both hospitals are owned by one of the country s largest health systems ascension it spent years reducing its staffing levels in an effort to improve profitability even though the chain is a nonprofit organization with nearly 18 billion of cash reserves since the start of the pandemic nurses have been leaving hospitals in droves the exodus stems from many factors with the hospital industry blaming covid staff burnout and tight labor markets for acute shortages of staff but a new york times investigation has found that hospitals helped lay the groundwork for the labor crisis long before the arrival of the coronavirus looking to bolster their bottom lines hospitals sought to wring more work out of fewer employees when the pandemic swamped hospitals with critically ill patients their lean staffing went from a financial strength to a glaring weakness more than half of the roughly 5 000 hospitals in the united states are nonprofits in exchange for avoiding taxes the irs requires them to offer services such as free health care for low income patients that help their communities ascension which runs 139 hospitals is emblematic of the industrywide movement to keep labor costs low as recently as 2019 ascension was trumpeting its success at reducing its number of employees per occupied bed a common industry staffing metric at one point executives boasted about how they had slashed 500 million from the chain s labor costs in the years before the pandemic they refused requests to hire more medical workers or fill open jobs according to current and former hospital administrators and employees the yearslong effort a combination of widespread layoffs and attrition left ascension flat footed for covid to understand how ascension s strategies affected patients the times focused on two hospitals st joseph in illinois and genesys in michigan where nurses belonged to unions that tracked staffing cuts and kept detailed logs of what they said were unsafe conditions the times reviewed more than 3 000 pages of those logs and interviewed 70 current and former nurses executives and other employees at ascension hospitals nurses said that ascension s downsizing had stark consequences patients lingered for hours on gurneys with serious time sensitive problems surgeries were delayed other patients developed bedsores because they were not repositioned often enough you feel awful because you know you re not turning these patients said jillian wahlfors a nurse at genesys you know they re getting their meds late you don t have time to listen to them they re having accidents because you can t get in fast enough to take them to the bathroom nick ragone an ascension spokesperson denied that cost cutting contributed to staffing shortages during the pandemic such a claim he said is fundamentally misguided misleading and demonstrates a lack of understanding of the impact of covid 19 on the health care workforce he also said ascension offers superior care that has been improving over time and that the hospital provides free treatment for many low income patients ascension operates in 19 states mostly in the south and the midwest it serves about 6 million patients by many measures ascension is rich in addition to its billions in cash it runs an investment company that manages more than 41 billion last year it paid its ceo joseph impicciche 13 million because of its nonprofit status ascension avoids more than 1 billion a year in federal state and local taxes according to the lown institute a health care think tank until the pandemic ascension was consistently profitable earning hundreds of millions a year the past year was a rare exception because of the stock market downturn and soaring labor costs ascension lost 1 8 billion ascension and its executives have powerful incentives to be as profitable as possible the more money the chain makes the more its executives get paid ragone said that a larger proportion of executives pay is based on other factors like delivering high quality care and stronger financial metrics allow the chain to borrow money at lower interest rates enabling it to buy new hospitals and add services four former executives who joined ascension from other nonprofit hospital systems said the profit driven culture surprised them the pressure to reach financial targets struck them as more befitting a for profit company their whole approach to the finances was right out of the wall street playbook said william weeks who until his retirement in 2019 was the chief operating officer of a five hospital chain that ascension owns in oklahoma when the pandemic hit nurses at st joseph the only hospital in joliet illinois were overwhelmed and feared for the safety of patients according to state inspection records and thousands of pages of formal complaints that nurses filed with the hospital warning about unsafe conditions every day it s unsafe staffing one nurse wrote in june 2020 nurses said they had been finding themselves in such situations more and more since 2018 when ascension took over st joseph shortly after the acquisition st joseph employed 791 nurses that number has since dropped by 23 according to the illinois nurses association which represents the hospital s nurses and has clashed with ascension s management over pay and other issues ragone said that st joseph s number of employees per occupied bed went up 6 between 2018 and 2021 but that figure partly reflects ascension having reduced its capacity the data also includes many employees who do not treat patients ragone would not provide data specific to nurses some of the nurses grievances have been substantiated by state authorities in april 2021 illinois health inspectors cited st joseph for failing to care for patients who needed to be regularly repositioned the inspectors found that some patients developed bedsores after they were not moved for as much as 20 hours despite doctors orders that they be shifted often since then the problems have intensified in january as the omicron wave pummeled the chicago area groups of nurses signed the formal complaints on more than 130 occasions at the beginning of the month an entire shift of eight nurses in one unit signed a complaint that there was only one nurses aide available for 32 patients with covid most of them on oxygen at the end of the month no one showed up to staff the surgical supply room when two patients needed emergency surgery nurses were left to gather instruments themselves one surgery was delayed and a nurse had to abandon a 100 year old patient to run for supplies one night in october nurses in st joseph s intensive care unit learned that they would have to care for four patients each double the industry standard the hospital had to divert ambulances from delivering patients until more nurses arrived four nights later nurses in the emergency room refused to clock in because they were being asked to care for 11 patients each instead of the recommended four it was inevitable said jillian moffett who was among the nurses who protested the staffing levels one of these days someone was going to put their foot down and say i m not taking this anymore in 2019 ascension received an award from a company called avasure the avaprize was bestowed upon the hospital chain because of its embrace of a new cost cutting innovation robots traditionally ascension like other hospitals sent nurses aides into the rooms of patients who needed close supervision left untended these patients many with dementia or psychiatric illnesses might get out of bed and hurt themselves but in the years before the pandemic some ascension hospitals switched course going forward they would generally assign nurses aides only to patients who were deemed at high risk of dying by suicide for other patients aides would be replaced by avasure s telesitters by 2019 ascension had installed 450 of the robots in more than 50 of its hospitals the devices essentially a video camera mounted on a metal pole send live footage to an off site command center where workers talk to patients through speakers in the machine but at ascension s genesys hospital in michigan nurses said patients were confused by the disembodied voices coming from telesitters there were sometimes not enough robots to go around and when workers at the command center called the hospital about wayward patients there were often no secretaries at genesys available to answer the phones ascension had cut those jobs in 2018 ascension had laid off workers including at least 500 in michigan even as the chain that year reported profits of 2 2 billion genesys one of a handful of unionized ascension hospitals avoided those layoffs instead administrators froze hiring since the hiring freeze was imposed the number of permanent nurses working at genesys has fallen by roughly 30 according to the teamsters union that represents the nurses ascension partially filled that gap by hiring temporary nurses and ragone said genesys employees per occupied bed increased 12 between 2018 and 2021 like st joseph genesys reduced its patient capacity which contributed to the rise in the staffing ratio and ragone would not provide data about the hospital s nursing staff yet nurses said that to keep things running genesys demanded they work 16 hour shifts threatening to fire some who refused because of exhaustion or child care commitments on at least four occasions this year managers have written in nurses employment files that refusing to work 16 hour shifts is not in line with our value of dedication according to internal disciplinary records reviewed by the times even as the pandemic has waned nurses at st joseph and genesys said there remained so many unfilled positions that they felt like they were working in a perpetual crisis as of this month 24 of the 52 night shift positions in genesys medical and surgical intensive care units were listed as unfilled and 17 of the open jobs had yet to be advertised according to the hospital s internal tally which the times reviewed nurses at st joseph in illinois also were at their breaking point make this better ascension

at a hospital in a chicago suburb last winter there were so few nurses that psychiatric patients with covid 19 were left waiting a full day for beds and a single aide was on hand to assist with 32 infected patients nurses were so distraught about the inadequate staffing that they banded together to file formal complaints every day for more than a month at a hospital outside flint michigan chronic understaffing meant that patients languished in dried feces while robots replaced nursing assistants who would normally sit with mentally impaired patients both hospitals are owned by one of the country s largest health systems ascension it spent years reducing its staffing levels in an effort to improve profitability even though the chain is a nonprofit organization with nearly 18 billion of cash reserves since the start of the pandemic nurses have been leaving hospitals in droves the exodus stems from many factors with the hospital industry blaming covid staff burnout and tight labor markets for acute shortages of staff but a new york times investigation has found that hospitals helped lay the groundwork for the labor crisis long before the arrival of the coronavirus looking to bolster their bottom lines hospitals sought to wring more work out of fewer employees when the pandemic swamped hospitals with critically ill patients their lean staffing went from a financial strength to a glaring weakness more than half of the roughly 5 000 hospitals in the united states are nonprofits in exchange for avoiding taxes the irs requires them to offer services such as free health care for low income patients that help their communities ascension which runs 139 hospitals is emblematic of the industrywide movement to keep labor costs low as recently as 2019 ascension was trumpeting its success at reducing its number of employees per occupied bed a common industry staffing metric at one point executives boasted about how they had slashed 500 million from the chain s labor costs in the years before the pandemic they refused requests to hire more medical workers or fill open jobs according to current and former hospital administrators and employees the yearslong effort a combination of widespread layoffs and attrition left ascension flat footed for covid to understand how ascension s strategies affected patients the times focused on two hospitals st joseph in illinois and genesys in michigan where nurses belonged to unions that tracked staffing cuts and kept detailed logs of what they said were unsafe conditions the times reviewed more than 3 000 pages of those logs and interviewed 70 current and former nurses executives and other employees at ascension hospitals nurses said that ascension s downsizing had stark consequences patients lingered for hours on gurneys with serious time sensitive problems surgeries were delayed other patients developed bedsores because they were not repositioned often enough you feel awful because you know you re not turning these patients said jillian wahlfors a nurse at genesys you know they re getting their meds late you don t have time to listen to them they re having accidents because you can t get in fast enough to take them to the bathroom nick ragone an ascension spokesperson denied that cost cutting contributed to staffing shortages during the pandemic such a claim he said is fundamentally misguided misleading and demonstrates a lack of understanding of the impact of covid 19 on the health care workforce he also said ascension offers superior care that has been improving over time and that the hospital provides free treatment for many low income patients ascension operates in 19 states mostly in the south and the midwest it serves about 6 million patients by many measures ascension is rich in addition to its billions in cash it runs an investment company that manages more than 41 billion last year it paid its ceo joseph impicciche 13 million because of its nonprofit status ascension avoids more than 1 billion a year in federal state and local taxes according to the lown institute a health care think tank until the pandemic ascension was consistently profitable earning hundreds of millions a year the past year was a rare exception because of the stock market downturn and soaring labor costs ascension lost 1 8 billion ascension and its executives have powerful incentives to be as profitable as possible the more money the chain makes the more its executives get paid ragone said that a larger proportion of executives pay is based on other factors like delivering high quality care and stronger financial metrics allow the chain to borrow money at lower interest rates enabling it to buy new hospitals and add services four former executives who joined ascension from other nonprofit hospital systems said the profit driven culture surprised them the pressure to reach financial targets struck them as more befitting a for profit company their whole approach to the finances was right out of the wall street playbook said william weeks who until his retirement in 2019 was the chief operating officer of a five hospital chain that ascension owns in oklahoma when the pandemic hit nurses at st joseph the only hospital in joliet illinois were overwhelmed and feared for the safety of patients according to state inspection records and thousands of pages of formal complaints that nurses filed with the hospital warning about unsafe conditions every day it s unsafe staffing one nurse wrote in june 2020 nurses said they had been finding themselves in such situations more and more since 2018 when ascension took over st joseph shortly after the acquisition st joseph employed 791 nurses that number has since dropped by 23 according to the illinois nurses association which represents the hospital s nurses and has clashed with ascension s management over pay and other issues ragone said that st joseph s number of employees per occupied bed went up 6 between 2018 and 2021 but that figure partly reflects ascension having reduced its capacity the data also includes many employees who do not treat patients ragone would not provide data specific to nurses some of the nurses grievances have been substantiated by state authorities in april 2021 illinois health inspectors cited st joseph for failing to care for patients who needed to be regularly repositioned the inspectors found that some patients developed bedsores after they were not moved for as much as 20 hours despite doctors orders that they be shifted often since then the problems have intensified in january as the omicron wave pummeled the chicago area groups of nurses signed the formal complaints on more than 130 occasions at the beginning of the month an entire shift of eight nurses in one unit signed a complaint that there was only one nurses aide available for 32 patients with covid most of them on oxygen at the end of the month no one showed up to staff the surgical supply room when two patients needed emergency surgery nurses were left to gather instruments themselves one surgery was delayed and a nurse had to abandon a 100 year old patient to run for supplies one night in october nurses in st joseph s intensive care unit learned that they would have to care for four patients each double the industry standard the hospital had to divert ambulances from delivering patients until more nurses arrived four nights later nurses in the emergency room refused to clock in because they were being asked to care for 11 patients each instead of the recommended four it was inevitable said jillian moffett who was among the nurses who protested the staffing levels one of these days someone was going to put their foot down and say i m not taking this anymore in 2019 ascension received an award from a company called avasure the avaprize was bestowed upon the hospital chain because of its embrace of a new cost cutting innovation robots

after a sharp downturn global initial public offering ipo activities are expected to regain momentum in 2023 on more favourable economic conditions in 2022 the stock market saw its worst drop in companies going for listing since the financial crisis as companies shelved deals amid rising geopolitical tension surge in equity volatility and interest rate increases click to enlarge throughout this year there were only 1 333 ipos raising us 179 5bil rm794bil according to ernst young ey in a report published this week it notes that global ipo activity dipped 45 and 61 by number of deals and proceeds respectively year on year a record year for ipos in 2021 gave way to increasing volatility from rising geopolitical tensions inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes weakened stock markets valuations and post ipo performance have further deterred ipo investor sentiment ey s global ipo leader paul go says new listings shrank in key markets such as london hong kong and new york but compared to pre pandemic times the number of deals was up 16 asia pacific markets performed relatively better due to record ipo proceeds raised in mainland china and active ipo markets in indonesia and malaysia says the audit and advisory firm go says that while the russia ukraine war sparked an energy supply shock it also created a more favourable ipo window for energy companies to go public boosting ipo activities in the middle east china and some asean countries as the global market has started to show signs of lower volatility and together with the general expectation that the interest rate hikes should slow down and end during 2023 more favourable conditions seem to be set in place for the global ipo activities to regain greater momentum by the second half of 2023 he adds however companies should be prepared to articulate their environmental social and governance esg strategies to investors because there is a positive correlation between companies post ipo share price performance and the communication of their esg strategies says ey additionally they should be realistic and flexible about a lower valuation given the poor post ipo share price performance and increasing interest rates and be well prepared to seize the windows of opportunity when they open companies are also advised to conduct extensive pre marketing and pre ipo funding complete with cornerstone investors to mitigate uncertainty and improve pricing leverage among asia pacific countries ey says mainland china raised record amounts of proceeds in 2022 with some of its largest state owned enterprises completing a secondary listing on the mainland exchange meanwhile south korea saw the largest global ipo completed at the beginning of the year on the back of strong momentum carried from 2021 the listing of the south korean battery maker lg energy solution had raised us 10 8bil rm47 8bil however excluding lg energy proceeds in seoul had slumped 85 according to a recent bloomberg report for 2023 new listing prospects in the country look dim as investors question prospective companies inflated valuation amid the rising interest rate environment within asean the two blockbuster ipos were indonesia s pt goto gojek tokopedia tbk and thai life insurance in thailand goto which is one of indonesia s largest tech companies raised us 1 1bil rm4 9bil while thai life s listing in july raised 34 4 billion baht or rm4 3bil on bursa malaysia dairy producer farm fresh bhd which is backed by khazanah nasional bhd made its debut in march raising rm1 1bil indonesia and malaysia markets have also done well by deal numbers and or proceeds however the rest of the apac markets were more affected amidst the global economic and geopolitical backdrop and recorded lessened ipo activities at different levels says ey energy and technology led the issuances of large ipos this year it notes while the deal pipelines are expected to pick up in 2023 headwinds remain for the global economy jp morgan in its report on the outlook for 2023 believes recessions are likely in the united states and europe but it says stock markets could stabilise next year even as the economic growth deteriorates as for china it sees a pivot toward reopening but one that is likely to be staggered and careful in 2023 we believe equities are well positioned to deliver positive returns any material decline from current levels could represent a good buying opportunity the bank adds according to jp morgan the interest rate hikes are seeing their intended impact globally we think inflation will continue its downward trajectory throughout 2023 reaching levels consistent with most central bank targets by 2024 it adds as for malaysia uob kay hian uobkh research expects a less turbulent year for local equities contrasting with expectations for a lower gdp growth in 2023 in its outlook for the first half of 2023 1h23 the research firm anticipates the uptrend on bursa malaysia since october in tandem with global markets to continue through part of the first quarter of next year 1q23 however the stock market should cool off mildly in 1q23 before warming up before 2h23 we envision a mild consolidation period in 1q23 for global markets as investors pause to assess the cumulative impact of rate hikes on corporate earnings the severity of winter in the eurozone and its implications for global energy prices and the ongoing russia ukraine war uobkh has an end 2023 fbm klci target of 1 640 points based on 15 2 times 2023 earnings it says this target factors in the political risk premium and potential earnings downgrades however the research firm expects improving foreign fund flows in 1h23 in line with the consensus view that the us policy rate would peak in 1q23 locally it expects the overnight policy rate to be raised twice or cumulatively 50 basis points to its terminal rate of 3 25 in 1q23 similarly rhb research feels there are reasons for less pessimism with expectations that the pace of monetary policy tightening is close to peaking while domestic political risks have abated but it cautions that equity markets will retain a propensity for volatility in 1h23 the market catalysts being observed will be offset by a bumpy china re opening process domestic regulatory worries investor reactions to weaker macroeconomic and corporate data points and persistent foreign fund outflows rhb research points out in its strategy report released yesterday that said it notes forward valuations are not demanding with the fbm klci now at 13 2 times fy24 earnings investors should still approach 2023 with caution but have a predisposition to build positions for the medium term and buy on weakness says rhb research some of the potential mega ipos in asean are e wallet service provider linkaja and logitech unicorn j t express in indonesia over at malaysia there has been talk about the listing of qsr brands m holdings bhd which is the operator of kfc and pizza hut restaurants in south east asia the company backed by private equity firm cvc capital partners and johor corp had reportedly shelved its ipo plans this year after key investors deemed its valuations to be on the high side when it does come to the market qsr would be one of malaysia s largest ipo in recent years

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video tracking the coldest christmas in two decades tyler texas get ready for what could be the coldest christmas in more than two decades here in east texas it won t challenge any record cold temperatures but christmas air will definitely have a winter sting will we have a white christmas at this time it s not looking good christmas is more likely going to be cold and dry but let s talk about the arctic air headed our way the north pole is currently experiencing about 24 hours of darkness the sun dips below the horizon in late september and doesn t rise again until mid march the absence of sunlight can contribute to some brutally cold air developing over the arctic circle and the north pole that is the case right now where a strong area of high pressure associated with some very cold has developed over siberia a chunk of this dangerously cold air will dislodge and move south across canada and into the united states computer guidance is in agreement the cold air will descend into the northern united states some guidance has suggested the coldest of this air will move through the great lakes and to the east coast bringing places such as chicago new york and washington d c the worst of the cold air but there is some computer modeling out there that suggests this large movement of air will follow the upper level winds that oriented more north to south that means texas would be in line for a shot of some brutally cold air late next week and through christmas weekend this year s cycling weather pattern suggest an area of high pressure off the west coast will push the cold air into the central and southern plains past cycles have also included a large storm think back to what happened november 4th when we had a severe weather outbreak here in east texas we had temperatures well below average right after that storm passed to our east that part of the pattern is coming back next week and we are seeing indications our temperatures could be 20 to 25 degrees below average if the average high is 58 and the average low is 38 it means our highs christmas weekend will be in the upper 30s and our morning lows will be in teens or low 20s that would easily make it the coldest christmas weekend since 2000 if not 1998 in other words if you have a fireplace now might be a good time to stock up on some wood one more note when cold air outbreaks like this move into the middle part of the united states the jet stream becomes more energized and that can lead to waves in the jet stream that turn into storms with this amount of cold air around that would mean snow or ice if any storm can form we might still be unsure about a storm but our confidence is high it s about to get really cold

teucrium s suite of exchange traded products has revolutionized the way commodity etfs are structured teucrium s products are widely available to investors and advisors in traditional brokerage accounts prospectus www teucrium com the teucrium aila long short agriculture strategy etf is effective but not yet operational no orders are being accepted at this time it is anticipated the fund will become operational on or about 12 20 2022 investments involve risk principal loss is possible oaia is a non diversified fund and because it can invest a greater percentage of its assets in particular securities including agricultural commodities changes in the market value of a single investment could cause greater fluctuations in share price than would occur in a diversified fund agricultural commodities are affected by consumer tastes demand government economic conditions weather and seasonal factors and demographic trends oaia is a commodity pool regulated by the cftc oaia is new and has a limited operating history to evaluate commodities and futures generally are volatile and instruments whose underlying investments include commodities and futures are not suitable for all investors futures investing is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk an investor may lose all or substantially all their investment investing in commodity interests subject each fund to the risks of its related industry these risks could result in large fluctuations in the price of a particular fund s respective shares funds that focus on a single sector generally experience greater volatility futures may be affected by backwardation a market condition in which a futures price is lower in the distant delivery months than in the near delivery months as a result the fund may benefit because it would be selling more expensive contracts and buying less expensive ones on an ongoing basis and contango a condition in which distant delivery prices for futures exceeds spot prices often due to costs of storing and inuring the underlying commodity opposite of backwardation as a result the fund s total return may be lower than might otherwise be the case because it would be selling less expensive contracts and buying more expensive one the fund s short selling involves the sale of commodities the short seller profits if the commodity s price declines if a shorted commodity increases in value a higher price must be paid to cover the short sale resulting in a loss the amount the fund could lose on a short sale is theoretically unlimited the fund employs a passive management approach that seeks investment results that correspond before fees and expenses generally to the performance of its underlying index there is no guarantee that the fund will achieve a high degree of correlation to the underlying index and therefore achieve its investment objective differences in timing of trades and valuation as well as fees and expenses may cause the fund to not exactly replicate the index known as tracking error etfs are subject to capital gains tax and taxation of dividend income however etfs are structured in such a manner that taxes are generally minimized for the holder of the etf however capital gains tax may be incurred by the investor after the etf is sold sharpe ratio a risk adjusted measure calculated using standard deviation and excess

associated press seattle cooke aquaculture has filed an appeal against washington state s decision to end its leases for fish farming in state waters with net pens in court documents filed wednesday the new brunswick canada based seafood giant said that the decision was arbitrary politically motivated and contrary to science knkx reported in a statement cooke said it has a state supreme court ruling and legislative mandate on its side that supports the farming of native species it also said that the 30 day deadline to harvest fish and to remove all farm equipment from two sites was unreasonable state public lands commissioner hilary franz last month issued an executive order banning the aquaculture method which involves raising fish in large floating pens anchored in the water citing danger to struggling native salmon the company had been told the previous week that their remaining leases wouldn t be renewed the state department of natural resources originally set a deadline of dec 14 for cooke to remove its facilities from leased areas at rich passage near bainbridge island and hope island in skagit bay but the agency has since extended the deadline for removal of fish to jan 14 and removal of cooke s net pens to april 14 in response to wednesday s filing franz said that cooke had ample time to prepare operationally and financially for this decision my denial of cooke s application is well supported by the law and their long track record of violating the terms of their leases she said in a statement in 2017 tens of thousands of the company s nonnative atlantic salmon escaped after a pen break near the san juan islands that sparked calls to end nonnative fish farming in washington with 20 western washington treaty tribes at the forefront citing that the method undermines tribal treaty fishing rights cooke pivoted to raise steelhead trout but department of natural resources officials determined that cooke s operations could pose risks to the state s environment california oregon and alaska have outlawed net pen aquaculture and canada is working on a plan to phase it out of british columbia s coastal waters by 2025 supporters say fish farming is an environmentally safe way to feed the world s growing population critics argue that it can spread disease to native stocks and degrade the environment

triblive s daily and weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need right to your inbox elon musk s abrupt suspension of several journalists who cover twitter is adding to a growing rift between the social media site and media organizations that have used the platform to build their audiences accounts of reporters with the new york times washington post cnn voice of america and other publications went dark thursday the suspension of journalists continued friday with the account of a business insider columnist who published a series of articles between 2018 and 2021 highlighting what she called dangerous tesla manufacturing shortcomings there was an exodus of advertisers shortly after the billionaire s 44 billion acquisition of twitter in october over content moderation and musk now risks a rupture with media organizations among the most active on the platform the company hasn t explained to the journalists why it took down the accounts and made their profiles and past tweets disappear but musk took to twitter on thursday night to accuse journalists of sharing private information about his whereabouts that he described as basically assassination coordinates he provided no evidence for that claim business insider s linette lopez told the associated press that she was given no explanation for the suspension shortly before being suspended she said she had posted court related documents to twitter that included a 2018 musk email address that address is not current said lopez because he changes his email ever few weeks if he wants to call that doxxing fine on tuesday she posted a 2019 story about tesla troubles commenting now just like then most of elonmusk s wounds are self inflicted the same day she called reports of musk reneging on severance for laid off twitter employees threatening workers who talk to the press and refusing rent payments classic elon going for broke behavior alarm over the suspensions extended beyond media circles however from our standpoint the move sets a dangerous precedent at a time when journalists all over the world are facing censorship physical threats and even worse and we are remaining in touch with officials said u n spokesman stephane dujarric the sudden suspension of news reporters followed musk s decision wednesday to permanently ban an account that automatically tracked the flights of his private jet using publicly available data that also led twitter to change its rules for all users to prohibit the sharing of another person s current location without their consent several of the reporters suspended thursday night had been writing about the new policy and musk s rationale for imposing it which involved his allegations about a stalking incident he said affected his family on tuesday night in los angeles the official account for mastodon a decentralized social network billed as an alternative to twitter was also banned the reason was unclear though it had tweeted about the jet tracking account same doxxing rules apply to journalists as to everyone else musk tweeted thursday he later added criticizing me all day long is totally fine but doxxing my real time location and endangering my family is not doxxing refers to disclosing online someone s identity address or other personal details the washington post s executive editor sally buzbee called for technology reporter drew harwell s twitter account to be reinstated immediately the suspension directly undermines elon musk s claim that he intends to run twitter as a platform dedicated to free speech buzbee wrote harwell was banished without warning process or explanation following the publication of his accurate reporting about musk cnn said in a statement that the impulsive and unjustified suspension of a number of reporters including cnn s donie o sullivan is concerning but not surprising twitter s increasing instability and volatility should be of incredible concern for everyone who uses twitter cnn s statement added we have asked twitter for an explanation and we will reevaluate our relationship based on that response the u n is also reconsidering its involvement in twitter according dujarric another suspended journalist matt binder of the technology news outlet mashable said he was banned thursday night immediately after sharing a screenshot that o sullivan had posted before his own suspension the screenshot showed a statement from the los angeles police department sent earlier thursday to multiple media outlets including the associated press about how it was in touch with musk s representatives about the alleged stalking incident i did not share any location data as per twitter s new terms nor did i share any links to elonjet or other location tracking accounts binder said in an email i have been highly critical of musk but never broke any of twitter s listed policies late thursday musk briefly joined a twitter spaces chat hosted by journalist kate notopoulos of buzzfeed musk stood by the suspensions saying you doxx you get suspended end of story he abruptly left the conversation and a short time later all of twitter spaces went offline some of the journalists who had been suspended and also the creator of the elon jet twitter account were on the spaces chat with musk despite the suspension of their twitter accounts due to what appears to be a technical quirk musk later tweeted that we re fixing a legacy bug and that the service should be up and running again friday it remained dormant friday afternoon the suspensions come as musk makes major changes to content moderation on twitter he has tried through the release of selected company documents dubbed as the twitter files to claim the platform suppressed right wing voices under its previous leaders he has promised to let free speech reign and has reinstated high profile accounts that previously broke twitter s rules against hateful conduct or harmful misinformation but also has said he would suppress negativity and hate by depriving some accounts of freedom of reach the nonprofit committee to protect journalists which defends journalists around the world voiced concern if confirmed as retaliation for their work this would be a serious violation of journalists right to report the news without fear of reprisal the group said if suspensions lead to the exodus of media organizations that are highly active on twitter the platform would be changed at the fundamental level said lou paskalis longtime marketing and media executive and former bank of america head of global media cbs briefly shut down its activity on twitter in november due to uncertainty about new management but media organizations have largely remained on the platform we all know news breaks on twitter it has been stock and trade since i ve been using twitter and to now go after journalists really saws at the main foundational tentpole of twitter paskalis said driving journalists off twitter is the biggest self inflicted wound i can think of the suspensions may be the biggest red flag yet for advertisers paskalis said some of which had already cut their spending on twitter over uncertainty about the direction musk is taking the platform it is an overt demonstration of what advertisers fear the most paskalis said retribution for an action that elon doesn t agree with that would be the no 1 reason to pause advertising on twitter if i haven t done so already advertisers are also monitoring the potential loss of twitter users twitter is projected to lose 32 million of its users over the next two years according to a forecast by insider intelligence they re projecting a nearly 4 drop in 2023 and another 5 drop in 2024 as technical issues and the return of accounts banned for offensive posts return under new twitter rules

freeze is looming over north america and parts of western europe expected to plunge temperatures well below the seasonal average beginning around dec 22nd in north america the epoch times is reporting that nerc north american electric reliability council is expecting power blackouts across vast regions including texas the great lakes and new england adding meanwhile a â large portionâ of the u s power grid is at risk of insufficient electricity supplies during peak winter conditions the agency concluded in the same analysis in other words it s about to get cold and dark all while vegetable prices have exploded by 38 in just the last month and 80 in the last year according to the us bureau of labor statistics prepare now and beat the rush beginning in about six days or so things are

but listen to the full podcast below for more detailed advice head to the stores in advance of the storm to stock up on food and supplies beat the rush understand that extreme weather will also likely cause disruptions in restock deliveries at retailers so shelves may be partially empty for many days both during and after the freeze wave prepare for pipes to burst and make a plan to shift away from pvc or copper pipes to pex pipes which are far easier to repair and can handle the expansion of water freezing without bursting stockpile some pex pipe repair tools couplers rings bands crimpers etc and you ll beat the post freeze rush which may wipe out plumbing supplies at local hardware stores have backup communications for when the power grid fails cell towers only have a few hours of power from local generators and those generators run on gas when the power grid fails gas stations can t pump gas so no one can get gas to the generators to run the cell towers this is why satellite phones

generic name for isopropyl alcohol note that it s being used indoors and it needs no smokestack the top can even be used as a warming surface be aware that trying to heat your house all the time with this kind of solution will be exceedingly expensive due to the cost of ethanol but as a backup heat source in emergencies it s ideal the description claims it heats a large space of up to 470 square feet and requires zero electricity gas chimney flue or costly ventilation system i haven t personally used this item so can t vouch for its quality but it s one of many worth considering have a battery boost device to help you start vehicles with weak batteries that get even weaker in the cold after buying and trying lots of these devices i ve come to appreciate the noco boost pro series not

taking stock of wa state s decade of legal cannabis and what to expect next november 2022 marked a decade since washington voted to legalize recreational cannabis there was a lot of fanfare and uncertainty when voters set the state on this path back in 2012 so what are the big takeaways about our legal cannabis market so far most wa consumers buy their cannabis at state licensed retail stores officials at the state s liquor and cannabis board said in the decade since voters approved initiative 502 the recreational cannabis industry has logged over 1 billion in sales and the state has collected 511 million in excise taxes over the years that s risen and risen fallen a little bit in this last year for the first time probable has to do with issues all businesses are having with respect to supply and inflation board director rick garza said garza said the cannabis industry employs 100 000 people statewide and the amount people in our state spend on cannabis rivals what we spend on alcohol garza said policymakers draw two positive conclusions from washington s regulated cannabis industry so far one is that surveys indicate cannabis use has not increased among kids 18 and under as some feared and garza said the vast majority of cannabis users have embraced the state regulated system as high as 77 80 percent of those who consume in washington do so through the legal market garza said in some of the other states and states that are illegal you ll see it as low as 44 and 57 percent garza said in part that s because prices in the licensed retail stores are really competitive he said that benefits state tax proceeds as well as consumers since there are more safeguards around regulated products consumption of cannabis has increased among wa adults since legalization including frequent use julia dilley is a senior research scientist with the multnomah county health department she and other researchers recently presented their cannabis research to the liquor and cannabis board we have seen increases in cannabis use among adults she said dilley said she s also finding increased cannabis consumption among certain categories one of them is teenagers who work part time dilley also found that perhaps unsurprisingly the odds of cannabis use for people living near the licensed retail stores increased more than 40 percent for the adults living close to i think it s within one mile of cannabis retailers we did see in those populations increases in any cannabis use and then frequent cannabis use so 20 or more days in the past month dilley explained but dilley also said washington has had some success stories in terms of tackling issues that arose under legalization she said after the washington poison center raised concerns about children being harmed by ingesting cannabis infused gummies the state acted to require warning labels and single serve packaging for those edibles what we found was this change in packaging rules in washington state was associated with a 25 percent reduction in edible poisoning reports in children under 10 dilley told the liquor and cannabis board researchers are concerned about shift to high potency thc products researchers say some of the highly processed products in today s licensed retail stores weren t envisioned when voters legalized cannabis they re calling for new measures to prevent consumer harm they said customers are shifting toward consuming more of those high potency products like edibles oils and drinks which contain 50 80 percent or sometimes even 90 percent thc thc is the psychoactive compound in cannabis dried flower typically contains between 10 25 percent thc beatriz carlini is director of the cannabis education and research program at the uw s addiction drug alcohol institute carlini finds that there s disproportionate use of these high potency products among certain populations including people who self report having mental health issues carlini said people with psychosis are particularly at risk they have much worse outcomes when they use cannabis in terms of their symptoms and adherence to medication you also see historically marginalized groups in the case of our study we found latinos were more likely to use these products she said carlini said the cannabis industry and regulators should act to disincentivize consumption of high potency concentrates especially in more vulnerable populations and educate consumers about portion size just as there s been public education about the differences between beer wine and hard alcohol you cannot have the same amount of whiskey as you have for beer and have the same buzz it s going to be completely different she said carlini said she supported legalization but she says the regulatory framework didn t anticipate these new products and she wants legislators to take action to curb their use through public education and higher taxes for example i m proud to live in a state that had the courage to try something new she said and the time for correcting these issues is now this is the time we can change things cannabis industry could back higher taxes on high thc products the washington cannabusiness association rejects calls for any kinds of prohibitions on high potency products they say that will have unintended consequences and fuel a black market but they are discussing how to discourage some of the consumption of high potency products with higher taxes most interesting and not fully formed yet but a lot of folks have talked about is potentially differential tax rates for higher potency products versus lower potency and that s a conversation that we re starting to have with legislators explained vicki christophersen who heads the washington cannabusiness association social equity licenses and new restrictions on hemp derived thc
while jerome h powell co hiked the target for the fed funds rate yet again this week the current benchmark lending rate of 4 5 is still below the average rate of 4 92 since 1971 and despite all of the handwringing about the fed the futures market is presently suggesting that the fed funds rate will peak next year slightly below that long term average as a result i am not losing much sleep over the jump in rates even as i understand that yields on money market funds and bonds are now far more interesting than they have been in years of course students of market history likely understand that about the only conclusion we can draw about rising interest rates is that they are a headwind for bonds kovitz the prudent speculator special report inflation 101b value the place to be certainly it is little secret that stocks of all stripes have struggled this year despite data cited above but value has held up far better than growth indeed the less expensive russell 3000 value index has outperformed its more richly valued growth counterpart by more than 19 full percentage points in 2022 as of this writing to be sure there is little to celebrate this year with red ink for value as well as growth but i think this magnifies the potential returns available over the next three to five years i continue to find that the prospects for undervalued equities remain bright even as many warn that a recession may be lurking around the bend like most i think a recession is likely to be mild and short lived so i believe those that share my long term time horizon should be steering their money into banks and i don t mean bank accounts i mean bank stocks well capitalized i agree with jpmorgan chase jpm ceo jamie dimon who said last week when asked about the anticipated economic downturn i don t know whether there will be a mild or harsh recession but if it happens we re going to be fine backing up that assertion is the positive result of the federal reserve s annual stress test which had the nation s largest 33 banks clear the minimum hurdle 4 5 tier 1 common equity ratio the test evaluates hypothetical negative scenarios such as unemployment rate as high as 10 a real gdp decline of 3 5 and a 55 drop in equity prices and computes the ability of each bank to withstand those adverse conditions the 2022 test was performed less than six months ago and the worst case which the regulator deemed the severely adverse scenario featured a severe global recession accompanied by a period of heightened stress in commercial real estate and corporate debt markets we were happy to see each of the banks tested clear the simulation but were not surprised given capital ratios are currently much higher than they were before the great financial crisis certainly the banks are well capitalized and thus far nonperforming assets virtually have been nonexistent obviously this will change should the economy weaken but bank of america bac ceo brian moynihan has repeatedly argued that the financial health of consumers is strong true mr moynihan conceded last week that deposit balances were starting to ebb but borrowing and credit quality have yet to meaningfully deteriorate beyond historical norms back in november robert reilly ceo of regional banking powerhouse pnc financial services group pnc stated from a financial perspective our balance sheets in good shape capital is in excess capital position our liquidity we bolstered our liquidity we re in good shape there and from a credit perspective we re well reserved he added pnc is a high credit quality shop we focus on investment grade corporates prime consumer borrowers and consumer lending is smaller than our commercial side and we ve been added a long time so no matter what is ahead of us we ll be well positioned banks are interest ing despite solid earnings in 2022 from the aforementioned favored banking names the kbw bank index a benchmark stock index for the banking sector representing large u s national money center banks regional banks and thrifts is off by more than 24 this year even as higher interest rates will likely continue to be a positive for the industry yes more loans will go sour but the spread on interest received on borrowings versus what banks must pay for deposits is likely to remain attractive and is far wider than it has been in recent years as a result current consensus eps projections for jpm bac and pnc for 2023 now stand at 12 88 3 67 and 16 05 putting p e ratios for the trio in the 9 to 11 range what s more dividend yields range from 2 8 to 4 0 warren buffett says whether it is socks or stocks i like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down and i think jpmorgan bank of america and pnc fit that bill follow me on twitter check out my my website

north atlantic treaty and america nato in eastern europe in a press briefing on friday the white house condemned russia s strikes targeting largely civilian infrastructure kirby said that the attacks showed that moscow was again trying to put fear into the hearts of the ukrainian people and to make it that much harder on them as winter is now upon them he declined to announce any details on the next security assistance package for ukraine but said that there will be another one and that additional air defense capabilities should be expected the us and nato countries have been grappling in
