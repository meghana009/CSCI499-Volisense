princeton the resignation of liz truss the united kingdom s shortest serving prime minister completes a powerful case study of how not to make fiscal policy but the lesson goes deeper than the idea that british politics was torn apart by a traumatic struggle pitting the government and the treasury against the bank of england boe the real failure was overlooking major risks built long ago into the plumbing of the financial system the fiscal policy lesson is powerful because it is so easily personalised truss will go into history books alongside lady jane grey the nine day queen who died by execution in the religious turmoil of sixteenth century england in fact the modern uk is facing the equivalent of a sectarian clash of its own the mistake on the face of it was the government s announcement of a 45 billion 50 billion unfunded tax reduction amounting to 2 per cent of gdp which included a small cut in the basic rate and the removal of the higher income band the originators of the scheme believed probably erroneously that it would stimulate initiative investment and thus growth there was also a more expensive package to subsidise energy consumers at the time the most generous such program in europe amounting to some 200 billion or 9 per cent of gdp these are large figures of course but the uk s public debt level was well below that of the united states not to mention italy or the even more extreme case of japan the new expenditures and income shortfalls should not by themselves turn the uk into a new greece or argentina truss s real mistake may have been to take seriously loose talk about how the era of cheap money and effectively negative interest rates made any kind of public spending a free lunch since the debt would not have to be paid off and the cost of servicing it was falling for a while modern monetary theory mmt which used a balance sheet approach to show that government debt was really an asset of citizens captivated markets but then rising inflation owing to pandemic fiscal packages supply chain disruptions and soaring food and energy prices obliged central banks with a legal price stability mandate to tighten monetary policy and consequently to increase the cost of government funding that cost brought truss down in the interwar period the central banks in britain and france pressed left wing governments running relatively small deficits generating a widely believed story about a bankers ramp what the french called the wall of money the term was used by the center left coalition of édouard herriot in 1924 when it was shaken by financial instability and eventually collapsed ramsay macdonald s labour government met a similar fate in 1931 in the middle of the world depression the equivalent story for today is already circulating action by the central bank as well as the advice of international financial institutions destroyed a conservative government that promised to revive growth by fiscal stimulus the bankers ramp and international finance now brings down the right not the left the countdown to disaster for the truss government was given when the bank of england announced that it would end the support scheme for government debt gilts on october 14 it was entirely predictable that that would be the day when the government had to promise to rethink its fiscal stance which truss did by sacking her chancellor truss s fall thus appears to have resulted from a clash between what economists call fiscal dominance the government s spending promises and monetary dominance the central bank s price stability mandate and this time monetary dominance won out because a new narrative about government profligacy and political responsibility has gripped financial markets replacing the mmt infused narrative about the beneficence of public spending and deficits but thinking about what happened to truss in terms of clashing fiscal and monetary policies misses an important and surprising part of the story the vulnerability of a key part of the uk financial sector to rising interest rates and falling bond prices the pension funds industry committed to paying out on defined benefits policies had leveraged its holdings of government debt in order to chase higher returns if the price of public debt fell because of a rise in interest rates the funds faced collateral calls and now uk pension funds holding some 1 5 trillion in this kind of scheme faced a shortage of bonds that could be easily sold the boe s intervention explains the odd shift in government debt prices with prices for index linked or inflation proofed securities falling more than those for regular securities simply because pension funds held so many indexers rather than fiscal or monetary dominance this was financial dominance with pension obligations paralysing policy choices this trap had been set a generation ago by the uk pensions act of 2004 which was intended to provide greater security or protection for pension holders by making it harder for pension funds to hold equities the funds thus had to move into bonds and into the leveraging strategies which depended on the bond markets always being liquid the risk and policy constraints that this created are a much more compelling rebuke to central bankers and financial regulators than the idea of a politicized intervention in october 2022 the fact that the boe was not directly responsible for financial regulation back in 2004 is a rather feeble excuse there was a clear failure by regulators and the broader policy community to identify a mechanism that laid a trap for governments truss triggered a peculiarly british mine that might have detonated at any point over the past decade there may well be other mines out there in other financial systems truss s failure means that fiscal populism shared by her predecessor boris johnson is now ruled out in britain but it is also now more dangerous elsewhere politicians are no longer

one of the most significant and confusing parts of being an adult is planning for retirement retirement savings and concerns are regularly talked about issues in the news and frankly the talk is not often brimming with encouraging updates in truth most americans aren t anywhere near as on track for retirement as they think they are while this is a scary thing to consider there is good news some changes you can make right away will help steer you toward a more comfortable future why save for retirement many young americans live under the misguided belief that public services are available for the elderly so saving for retirement isn t as urgent a situation as the media portrays or as older generations warn there are several reasons behind this 1 retirement might last longer than expected we rarely consider the possibility of retiring earlier than planned however this is the case for many americans chronic illnesses and other health concerns are leading contributors to early retirement which means less money saved overall it also means you have to spread out the little money you saved across more time when planning for retirement you should also have a clear backup plan in place in case life happens and throws you an unforeseen obstacle to navigate before retirement comes 2 you re not paying off bad credit bad credit refers to any high interest loan that doesn t provide a return on your investment and is therefore a money sink that drains your wallet examples of bad credit are car loans unless you re using the car to generate revenue and offset the high interest and most credit card balances if you don t pay them in full at the end of your billing cycle if you re not prioritizing getting rid of high interest loads first then you re leaving money on the table every month even if we re talking about purchases made with a low interest credit card 3 social security is rarely enough to cover expenses social security was once thought of as a way of ensuring every older adult and disabled person in america had the means to survive now it can only be considered supplemental at best and it s likely to decrease in value as time goes on as the baby boomers age into retirement social security will be operating at a greater deficit paying out more money than they will be taking in from the younger generation s social security contributions according to the social security administration s own website in fact there is a prediction that benefits may start decreasing in 2034 to make up some of the difference 4 many americans don t have a retirement plan this year the anytime estimate retirement finances survey found that 37 percent of american adults surveyed had no plans for retirement not only that but 39 percent of americans surveyed don t have any savings accounts at all sadly the survey also found that 10 percent of americans don t believe they will ever be financially stable enough to retire comfortably this is a startling statistic but it is easily avoidable by taking necessary action now to create a more stable future 5 medicare won t cover comfortable senior living many assume that if they go into senior living as elderly adults they will have medicare to look out for them they don t realize that medicare does not cover senior living at all and government subsidies that help cover the cost are limited most individuals who get their senior living or nursing home care expenses paid by the government do so through state funded medicaid programs rather than medicare these programs are great for those who need them but using them often involves having little choice about living accommodations and often sharing a room with another facility resident now that we have a better understanding of why it is necessary to consider your retirement even decades before the time to retire comes let s take a look at some of the ways you might already be sabotaging your retirement efforts 12 ways you re sabotaging your retirement many think they re doing fine in terms of retirement plans but may not realize that they are doing small things that are adding up to big problems these little things have a significant impact on your nest egg here are some of the most common things to avoid if possible on the road to retirement 1 not negotiating pay people are often nervous about negotiating pay with their employers this is especially true among young people who are just getting started in their field however by not negotiating your pay rate you are cheating yourself out of some of the money you could already be saving for a comfortable retirement don t be afraid to negotiate with employers during the interview process now is a perfect time to insist on what you are worth considering that many businesses are complaining of a worker shortage 2 not saving at all if you aren t saving for retirement you are dooming yourself to a later retirement or no retirement at all without the help of government funded subsidies which are unstable and cannot be relied upon often people think that they cannot afford to save money for retirement because they are already living paycheck to paycheck and having difficulty managing their bills think about it this way would you rather sacrifice some small luxuries now as a young person or be destitute as an old one 3 borrowing from your retirement accounts sometimes we all have to do things we don t want to however there is a growing trend of treating retirement accounts more like emergency funds when obstacles or opportunities in life present themselves if you want a leisurely retirement you should not borrow from your retirement accounts for things like buying a new car or renovating your home instead try to save for these expenses separately and allow your retirement money to stay put in your account where it will have the opportunity to gain interest and grow in addition you ll also avoid paying hefty early withdrawal fees that will eat into your savings 4 not working long enough whether you are late joining the workforce or leaving the workforce early shorting your working years can create major problems in terms of saving for a comfortable retirement this is also true for individuals who take time off of work to be stay at home parents or pursue other interests experts recommend working at least 35 years before you retire this is largely based on how the social security administration calculates benefits the social security administration will value your retirement based on your 35 highest salary years for every non working year you will get a 0 averaged in 5 withdrawing early some retirement plans involve owning and managing stocks or bonds the performance of these stocks can vary year to year so you should never begin withdrawing early because of a belief that the stocks are performing well enough for you to do so for example if you invested 500 000 in stocks and the markets are doing well within a few years you ll probably have more than your original half a million even if you withdraw say 4 percent annually this might make you feel you can withdraw even more because your stocks are doing well suddenly you re withdrawing 6 percent annually then 7 percent and so on but doing this severely impacts your compounding and could mean the difference between doubling your investment in 10 years and doubling it in 20 6 prioritizing college accounts over retirement savings every parent s natural instinct is to help their kids first so it s not uncommon for parents to invest in college savings for their children before they tackle their own retirement savings it s important to remember that your kids have more time to pay off student loans than you do also they have other opportunities to get their education paid for including scholarships pell grants and work studies 7 suffering lifestyle inflation it s not uncommon for individuals to trick themselves out of increased earnings that could help them retire comfortably later on when people get a raise or find employment that pays more their first instinct is to splurge and treat themselves to luxury you might feel tempted to buy a new car or take on more bills to sustain a more comfortable and lavish lifestyle with your new salary increase you d be much wiser to fold at least half of that new surplus money into your retirement account 8 carrying too much bad debt recently a group of oblivious car salesmen went viral on tiktok for all the wrong reasons one by one they each disclosed the amount of money they were paying monthly on their car payments for some the total was over three grand this led many commenters to criticize the dealership for trying to normalize high amounts of debt to line their own pockets 9 not taking risks while all of these hints are about ensuring a this is a classic example of bad debt because it implies high interest rates and the money you put in doesn t generate any value in fact a large chunk of the car s value is lost the second you drive it out of the dealership think about the debt you take on in your life and ask yourself if it is really worth the risk of having less money to live on later in life while all of these hints are about ensuring a comfortable future there are times when you should take risks often people fixate on retirement at the expense of giving up better opportunities that could help them save more later for example you might be tempted to stay with your current employer because you have already done the math and know that you will be able to retire with x amount at a certain age this is security and stability however the desire to maintain this stability will often make you turn down job opportunities that can pay a higher salary or offer a better retirement plan by not taking on this bit of extra risk you may be missing out on the dream retirement that everyone wants 10 renting owning property provides another nest egg for retirement you can sell your property and downsize when the time is right if you are currently renting instead of paying a mortgage toward your home and property ownership you are essentially throwing those monthly payments away another added benefit of owning property even just a tiny home and lot is that you will save yourself from paying rent and risking eviction in your later years 11 not seeking or accepting financial advice according to a recent study by tiaa cref many affluent americans agree that even in their own place of financial security they still need advice for managing their finances and securing their future wealth this is a great habit for anyone in any tax bracket to adopt by seeking the advice of experts and studying the financial habits of those who have found the key to financial success we can identify our shortcomings and re strategize for a better and more lucrative future 12 trading instead of investing we have all heard the stories of savvy traders who have made millions playing the stock market the stories might have fooled you into thinking this is an easy way to rack up retirement cash in a short amount of time you d be disappointed to know though that most who attempt to grow their savings by trading ultimately lose money this is because trading isn t easy it requires knowing how markets work choosing the right broker doing fundamental and technical analysis and more research consistently shows that buy see strategies for retirement savings frequently underperform the less risky buy and hold method of investing the bottom line most americans think they are well on their way to a comfortable retirement when in fact they re not in some cases it s because they didn t start saving soon enough in others it s because they want to retire early for some the reason lies in choosing the wrong investment strategy for their savings misinformation an unstable economy and higher inflation have all contributed to making the act of saving for retirement more difficult however there are several things you can avoid doing now that will provide you with a safety net in terms of setting yourself up for comfort in the twilight years of your life owning property not borrowing from your retirement accounts investing wisely and negotiating the terms of your retirement savings is an excellent place to start by jordan bishop the epoch times copyright 2022 the views

hamish mcrae uk facing a slog to rebuild trust fiscal orthodoxy will be norm everywhere we didn t know that a few weeks ago now we do it is a strange time there is political chaos for sure but there is also a measure of financial clarity consider this after what has happened to liz truss no government in the developed world is going risk any policy that ends up with large increases in borrowing fiscal orthodoxy will therefore be the norm here and everywhere else we didn t know that a few weeks ago now we do we also know that monetary orthodoxy will be the norm for the foreseeable future we don t know quite how fast the central banks will push up interest rates but on friday several landmarks were passed in the bond markets german 10 year government bond yields went above 2 5 per cent for a few minutes the highest since 2011 the equivalent french yields went above 3 per cent and uk gilts were back above 4 per cent us treasuries ended the day at 4 22 per cent pull these two points together that the developed world will have tight or at least fairly tight fiscal and monetary policies and that gives some clues as how the economic cycle will play out and that in turn helps us think about the implications for asset prices worldwide as far as the cycle is concerned it probably means a deeper dip next year than seemed likely a few weeks ago it need not be particularly dreadful but already you can see consumers tightening their belts here in britain and elsewhere as higher energy costs and higher interest rates curb demand if the combination of tighter money and an economic downturn exposes financial weaknesses that haven t yet come to light then there will be more disruption which in turn will lead to a deeper dip there will eventually be a recovery but it may be hard to see it for some months against this sombre background the hunt will be on for safety and for value they are not at all the same safety is america and the dollar value is the uk and europe us asset prices have come down a long way if you take equities the s p500 index of the largest us corporations is down 23 per cent this year the nasdaq index of high tech enterprises down 33 per cent and the dow jones down 16 per cent but they may have further to fall for even at these levels they are overvalued on most measures against european and uk stocks the general feeling in new york is that equities have not yet hit bottom on the other hand the dollar does offer safety its weighted value is up about 17 per cent this year so foreign investors have some compensation in local currency terms for any loss on their investments the us economy despite its weaknesses does not face the energy stresses that europe and the uk are having to plan for this winter if you really want value the uk gives you that the price earnings ratio of the ftse100 companies is around 14 and the dividend yield of 4 2 per cent is covered 1 8 times the footsie companies earn some 80 per cent of their profits from abroad so what you are buying is a sterling denominated bet on the world economy but there are obvious political risks including windfall taxes on two key sectors energy and finance the uk does not offer investors safety except in the sense of a decent flow of income from dividends i had expected confidence in the uk gradually to return but the reverse has happened whoever ends up running the show has a long slog ahead to rebuild trust meanwhile any foreign investor who is prepared to take a long view can buy uk assets on the cheap the flow of opportunistic bids will continue on friday the pound dipped below 1 11 before scrambling back towards 1 13 for a us based investor having the pound anywhere below 1 15 is the sort of opportunity that comes only once or twice in a career for the pound has not been in this vicinity since 1985 it does however take someone with a very long perspective to grasp it whenever there are huge uncertainties as there are now the important thing to do is to bolt down what you do know and be honest about what you don t i do take comfort from the fact that the world has returned to fiscal orthodoxy and monetary common sense we know that for sure of the rest well for the uk at least the uncertainties will not last forever even if the next few days are bumpy indeed

at the recently concluded meetings of the international monetary fund and the world bank held in washington dc united states several issues affecting the nigerian economy including oil subsidy oil theft lack of accountability and excessive borrowing came to the front burner in this interview with funke olaode the executive director of civil society legislative advocacy centre cislac auwal musa rafsanjani stressed the urgent need for a strong economic team to navigate the nigerian economy through its existential challenges h ow important are the imf world bank meetings to the nigerian economy the annual event is very important to us as a nation because it provides avenues for civil society organisations to draw the federal government s attention to unnecessary wastage that might have emanated through its budget if you recall president muhammadu buhari on october 7 2022 presented the 2023 national budget and appropriation bill to the national assembly the budget estimates as contained in the bill total n20 5trillion with expected revenue of n9 7 trillion and expected additional borrowing to the tune of n8 8 trillion if proposed budget scales through nigeria s debt stock will be at n50 8 trillion this is not just worrisome but also scary considering the state of our economy that we are already in this situation looks like nothing but escalated poverty and exacerbated austerity so we consider this imf world bank annual meeting as a very important forum for civil society to deepen their engagement with the financial institutions i remember that cislac in 2019 or 2020 when covid 19 erupted and the nigerian government sought an emergency loan from the imf to facilitate or mitigate the effect of the pandemic cislac was worried and concerned about the influx of money without accountability so when the nigerian government approached the imf for loan facilities cislac wrote to the imf to insist that while we are not against the granting of the loan there must be certain transparency clauses in whatever mou that the nigerian government was going to sign with the imf this was to ensure that there would not be room for the diversion of the funds that are meant to mitigate the effect of covid 19 and we also wanted safe reporting for nigerian journalists and other nigerians to be able to expose and monitor the use of the money we also wanted to make sure that the emergency procurement is also properly spelled out besides based on our engagement with the world bank and imf for the first time imf and world bank responded positively and they constituted a regular call with select civil society organisations clslac is one of the organisations in africa that the world bank always does call with the directors this has not happened before and it was as a result of this engagement that cislac brokered with the imf on the covid 19 money so now that the nigerian government has presented a budget that we consider a very disturbing figure we also felt that this is also a good forum because almost half of the money projected would also be borrowed and we felt that there is a need since all financial institutions are here and nigeria is talking about debt forgiveness nigeria is still borrowing money and this money is not utilised according to the fiscal responsibility act we thought that it is important to make use of this meeting to draw the attention of global financial institutions to the state of the financial or economic crisis in nigeria occasioned by corruption diversion of public funds mismanagement and lack of ability to block leakages like issues as oil theft issues about illicit financial flow and money laundry so we thought it is important to draw the attention of nigeria and the financial institution to ensure that the country s economy does not collapse we have already witnessed several recessions and the country has still not gotten its stand we still need to do a lot to ensure that the economy is restored our foreign exchange rate has completely gone down the lack of an effective and efficient economic management team is also part of the reasons why we are not having good policy choices in terms of our economy and this is very worrisome because there is no way a country can be governed without an effective and efficient economic management team that will do that are you not worried about the country s indebtedness of course we are worried as csos you know the way and manner in which money is being borrowed recklessly is a grave concern our income is not even enough to pay the servicing of the debt not to talk of paying the debt itself and yet now and then the national assembly is approving fresh loans to the government this is worrisome because there are other ways in which nigeria could intensify efforts to raise more money rather than resolving to borrow because borrowing has become a lazy and easy way to get this money and unfortunately they misapply it or divert it or waste it or do things that are not meant to regenerate the money back as envisaged in the fiscal responsibility act that spells out that loans should be collected but the loan should be paid back from whatever source that it has been taken that has not been the case and that explains why poverty is increasing austerity measure is going to be harder now with this budget presented by mr president and i think it is important that as a civil society we continue to draw the attention of the government so that it can look inward for other areas where revenue can be raised and waste diversion and stealing can be minimised so that the economy can come back it is generally believed that lack of accountability is majorly responsible for the current economic mess how can this be addressed it is simple by holding officeholders accountable part of the challenges that we have in nigeria at local state and national levels is the inability to instill and ensure accountability in governance so people believe that it is their birthright to squander or mismanage or loot public money and nothing will happen to them so there is also a gross misunderstanding of democracy some people assume democracy is a luxury for them to use public taxpayer s money and get away with it and also the political corruption we are witnessing is what is exacerbating the kind of crisis we are seeing so when you loot when you belong to the ruling party a kind of soft landing is given to do whatever you are doing until you have probably political clash then that is when they will begin to think that you have deviated but i think if we are talking about building systems and building institutions it doesn t matter whether you belong to a particular group religious group political group and whatever identity if you break the law the law should take its course on you are you worried about the issue of oil theft in nigeria the oil theft is a conscious and deliberate effort by some people who are also in power in government who are being given the trust to ensure that they secure the economy they secure the oil facilities but because of a few or small gains they make out of it they allowed oil theft to be a very very lucrative business against the interest of the nation to the extent that more and more discoveries are coming on this prolonged deliberate effort to continue to siphon the oil and destroy the facilities as i speak to you today after several years of oil exploration nigeria did not have one genuine metering system so apart from oil theft which is a result of that we are not even able to meet our quota offered by opec there is also another fraud which is giving a huge amount of money to some militants or ex militants to guide the oil pumps when you have the navy the police you have the dss you have all sorts of security apparatus in the country so this means that nigeria is promoting militancy and criminality if she would have to give this huge amount of contracts for now it has not even stopped the oil theft it has not also stopped other vandalism that we are seeing so it is a cartel it is a properly organised local and international crime that is perpetuated in collaboration with local collaborators to continue to undermine the economy and destroy the economic base of nigeria and this is because corruption has been taken as a joke the fight against corruption has not been institutionalised and it has not been taken seriously because if you have a system and you have proper anti corruption in place you will not see the kind of rampant and reckless way of doing things in nigeria so it is a serious crisis that we are facing and government must rise nigeria s economy has gone comatose how do you think it can be saved the public finance integrity in nigeria is probably at its lowest state the debt profile has defied all economic prudence frameworks that exist in the laws during interaction with the media i mentioned many contributors to the non existent solution to the issue the number one is tax administration i said this because the leakages that exist within the financial architecture of nigeria as a country create a default opportunity for ineffective taxation and consequently failure in optimising our revenue that is required for national development and this must be addressed also the extractive sector must be looked into as mentioned earlier organised corruption in the oil and gas sector is a major issue that is expressed in several ways including oil theft and all other forms of sabotage within the trade value chain fuel subsidy and other unproductive incentives this trend has consistently left us in a situation where this revered sector is rather sapping revenue from the government instead of contributing substantially to fund developmental projects in nigeria another one is the absence of an economic team as the saying goes if you fail to plan then you are planning to fail every government should constitute an economic team of technocrats saddled with the responsibility of advising the president on economic issues at any given time in the life of every regime the absence of such a critical team leaves room for a knee jerk approach to economic policies and interventions which a lot of times fail to make any serious impact although this essential spending is being made by our governments today the debate over how to deal with the debt generated by the covid 19 crisis will be of vital importance to nigerians also policy actions that choke the middle class and informal sector and public procurement issues have been issues with numerous irregularities that are alleged within the process and finally misplaced economic priorities i said this because the legislature s primary mandates are oversight law making and representation the legislator is never saddled with the responsibility of implementing projects at any level of government this is arguably putting the constituency project concept as an economic misplaced priority also these funds have never been accounted for nor have they ever had any resemblance of proper management in the past we believe that the lawmaker should concentrate on his her primary mandates but ensure that the executive implements any project as provided by the appropriation act within the fiscal of the government the imf has been clamouring for the removal of oil subsidies but its critics believe the masses will be at the receiving end if it is removed what is your stand on this before the imf we as csos have been advocating that government should stop this fraudulent oil subsidy there is nothing like an oil subsidy except oil stealing we are also in agreement with the so called oil subsidy that should be removed and utilised for other social development like the healthcare system like an educational system that has collapsed these are visible areas where we can see revitalisation but there is a belief that if the subsidy is removed it is going to affect the masses the masses are already affected because the majority of the masses don t even benefit from anything called fuel subsidy there is nothing that has been subsidised in every city you go to every state you go to in nigeria it is the black market they are buying so who is subsidising whom in the north since i grew up i saw the black market as the only option for buying fuel so people in northern nigeria didn t get anything called a subsidy because they have been permanently buying in the black market and likewise in some parts of southern nigeria many of them don t also see anything called a subsidy so this subsidy must be stopped if we are serious about fighting corruption and if we are serious about engineering our economy you cannot take about five trillion to invest in this fraudulent venture called fuel subsidy you can imagine if you are having this money it is a different thing altogether but you are borrowing this money to finance this subsidy this is not done anywhere in the world except in nigeria and this is because there is no serious economy management team that can help govern the economy of the country otherwise they would have brought other policy options to deal with this so the apex bank needs to be restructured to make it to be more effective and more efficient and less corrupt

it is plain that the finance minister s visit to washington has not resulted in any financial relief since apart from expressions of sympathy for the devastating floods no commitments have been made by the multilateral agencies for any further funding an announcement has been made that some of the loan amounts already committed will be released earlier than programmed but that s about all mr dar s us trip was intended to apprise the international financial community about the scale of the flood devastation and get some respite against harsh austerity measures as well as to urge the lending agencies to reschedule the short term repayments due this year in view of the economic crisis the country is going through but there were some missteps even before the visit for instance by not increasing the petroleum development levy a move deemed reckless by even the party s previous finance minister miftah ismail the imf and other international agencies may have had doubts about the government s sincerity and capacity to see the imf programme through to its conclusion mr dar was peeved with moody s for the ratings downgrade on pakistan s bonds but the bond market has the power to bring governments into line as the uk s prime minister and its former finance minister have found to their discomfiture only last week moody s was just following market signals which showed yields on pakistan s 10 year eurobonds as high as 27 per cent earlier this month an indication by investors that pakistan was heading for default moody s would have been negligent in its professional duties if they hadn t downgraded pakistan s bonds having already been pilloried by regulators and investors after the 2008 recession for misleading bond buyers because of its egregiously flawed ratings of asset backed securities at that time many of these were given the highest triple a ratings for safety and soundness but were actually nothing more than bundles of layered subprime mortgages that proved worthless when the housing market in the us cratered resulting in losses of billions to investors the whole rationale for issuing bonds by pakistan that we heard about first in the shaukat aziz years and then during ishaq dar s previous tenure has come unstuck then we were told that although we really didn t need the foreign exchange through the issuance of bonds the benefit would be that international credit rating agencies would give pakistan s bonds an investment grade rating that would enable us to access international capital markets more frequently the irony is that now that we need the funding we don t have any willing commercial lenders the route to rescheduling loan repayments leads through beijing look at it from a member of the paris consortium of lenders point of view they would want an assurance that any cash flow savings derived from concessions on their multilateral and bilateral loans are not passed on to china as timely repayment on the latter s loans instead they would insist that pakistan gets an agreement from chinese lenders so that if a haircut is acceptable to the lenders then it should be administered in lockstep in effect there is a default in the works even though it may only be one in a technical sense and yes it s also a haircut despite mr dar s refusal to accept the barbershop metaphor because if repayments are pushed into the future as they would be under a rescheduling agreement the present value of the liability to the borrower is reduced and the lender takes a hit at least that s what they teach in finance 101 when professors talk about the concept of the time value of money for those not versed in finance theory this states that a guaranteed amount of money received immediately is worth more than the same amount of money guaranteed to be received some time later because the money received now can be put to work earning interest in a world where interest rates are positive and there is no inflation for example rs100 received today grows into rs105 after one year when deposited in a bank paying five per cent interest this is preferable to the alternative of receiving only rs100 in a year s time finance professors must have been scratching their heads in bewilderment to explain to students how this key financial concept works in the topsy turvy world of negative interest rates which was the case in several european countries as recently as a year or so ago it will require some convincing to get beijing to agree to rescheduling loans since they have already expressed concerns about the delays in the china pak economic corridor cpec project implementation moreover they must be deeply upset that pakistan hasn t been able to apprehend any of the perpetrators involved in the killing of chinese citizens so the help of neutrals in these negotiations would be essential especially since the present government after its string of by election losses has more holes in its credibility than there are in a slice of swiss cheese in the current circumstances there is also a dire need to economize on government expenditure what is the need for a cabinet of 70 members at the centre when governance across the board is shoddy law and order is non existent and pakistan is pleading for concessions from international lenders as an aside the whole business of appointing special assistants to the ministers needs to be reformed cronies and friends are not entitled a share in the word of the leaked audio from the pm office about the demands of one of the members of the coalition in seeking appointments for their party members of high level advisory jobs as if this is booty to be divvied up as taxpayers bear the expense of these jobs there should be some accountability as to what special advisers are expected to achieve during their tenure in my opinion it would be preferable that all special assistant positions whether in the pm office or with a cabinet member be advertised with applications invited from all pakistani nationals the federal public service commission should be entrusted to conduct the recruitment and selection procedure and to appoint suitable candidates for a term of say three years there are at least two advantages of open competition for these advisory positions 1 a broader range of expertise including from the private sector could be availed by the concerned ministries and departments 2 specialist advisers could bring a non partisan perspective to issues instead of being part of an echo chamber where the only opinion that matters is that of the party s leader the federal government has nothing to offer the country except austerity the problem is that you can t grow an economy through austerity so their prospects for the next general election are grim especially since the general election should under the rules laid down by the constitution be held within the next calendar year hardly enough time to turn the economy around despite mr dar s sunny optimism shehbaz sharif s government is holding out against the call by the opposition for announcing a general election immediately despite bruising defeats suffered by the ruling party in the recent by elections at both the national and provincial levels one plausible reason is an important appointment next month so that the cards if not stacked in their favour are at least not stacked against them like the last time around but the price of delay could be a landslide electoral defeat the writer is a group director at the jang group he can be reached at iqbal hussain janggroup com

london ap like many small business owners in britain harry niazi hoped for government help to keep his south london fish and chip shop going in the face of rocketing energy bills and soaring inflation but an economic stimulus plan announced last week by prime minister liz truss new government brought no relief far from it for niazi and millions across the united kingdom things went from bad to worse after the promise of huge unfunded tax cuts sparked turmoil in financial markets and sent the british pound tumbling to a record low against the u s dollar this week everything s based on the dollar diesel for the vessels to catch the fish trucks to deliver our products it has a big impact niazi said from his takeout shop olley s fish experience the pound s slide is hitting many businesses hard because imported materials and commodities like natural gas that are priced in dollars will be more expensive businesses will likely be forced to pass the costs on to consumers which would further push up inflation already close to a 40 year high at 9 9 that would worsen the squeeze on people facing yet another hike in their household energy bills saturday even though truss plan capped a more devastating 80 rise as natural gas prices soar i m terrified of putting my prices up we have a good volume of customers coming in we don t want to lose them but every day something goes up in price i don t know how we re going to cope niazi said the haddock cod and other white fish he imports are priced in dollars and that cost had already surged since july when britain s government imposed a 35 tariff on russian seafood imports as part of sanctions over the war in ukraine niazi s concerns about the sliding pound are echoed by other businesspeople like sanjay aggarwal co founder of spice kitchen the liverpool based company sells indian spice mix gift sets packaged in steel tins from indian manufacturers tins and shipping his business s two biggest costs are both priced in dollars aggarwal said he s already been forced to hike his prices this year because of rising steel prices shipping costs too have spiraled since bottoming out amid the depths of the coronavirus pandemic the cost to ship a container from india to britain has quadrupled since 2020 to about 8 000 to 9 000 he said his latest shipment is already en route in time for christmas but he s bracing for a price shock when he has to place his next order we are affected because we re playing on a global scale said aggarwal so any future orders we now place it s going to cost us 20 more beyond britain the dollar has hammered many other world currencies fueled by the u s economy performing better than others and aggressive federal reserve interest rate hikes drawing investors the dollar s strength also has pushed the euro below parity and sent china s yuan to a 14 year low the u s dollar index which measures the greenback against six other major currencies has surged 18 this year britain s wine and spirit trade association warned that the falling pound is set to raise prices for consumers and threaten hundreds of british jobs in bottling plants across the u k the trade group said a fifth of all bulk wine imported to the u k for bottling comes from the united states miles beale the group s chief executive said that although the government s measures included laudable plans to freeze alcohol duties the pound tanking against the dollar has both usurped them and delivered a significant blow for u k wine businesses and consumers the mood of uncertainty has heightened since the government unveiled a plan to cut 45 billion pounds 48 billion in taxes but no details on spending reductions meaning they will be funding by public borrowing officials also want to spend billions more to subsidize steeply climbing energy bills for people and businesses the plans were met with widespread concern from economists and investors about ballooning government debt and the international monetary fund warned that the moves could worsen inflation and the cost of living crisis the bank of england has so far refrained from an emergency interest rate hike to offset the inflationary impact of the slide in the pound but many expect the central bank to sharply raise rates soon that has sparked panic among many homeowners used to interest rates that have stayed low at around 2 for years a sudden sharp rise in borrowing costs will make mortgages unaffordable for many dee corsi chief executive of the new west end company a group representing hundreds of shops hotels and restaurants in london s famous oxford street shopping district said she is certain those worries will loom large for consumers we may benefit in the short term with a boost of tourists especially from the u s because of the weaker pound corsi said but in the long term the lower pound will push up the cost of all imports for business she added and with the cost of living crisis we can t not talk about that and with mortgages going up i absolutely think people will be more cautious with their spending for some business owners the conservative party s divisive economic plan might be alienating them in other ways too niazi the fish and chip shop owner is a conservative party voter but said he is disappointed in the government and most probably would not back the party in the next election i don t know anything about running the country but i know what the government is doing is hurting everybody he said it s not working something s gone wrong he added they need to fix it

at an energy summit monday two key republicans told industry insiders fellow lawmakers and clean energy advocates their plan for driving down costs during a panel previewing legislative action in the upcoming session reported new hampshire bulletin this feels very much to me like the year of biomass said rep michael vose an epping republican seated next to him sen jeb bradley a wolfeboro republican agreed vose said he plans to introduce legislation to bring four defunct biomass power plants in the northern part of the state back online he acknowledged the plan may not bring energy prices down but said it would provide what s called baseload energy which can always generate power unlike solar and wind which generate power only when the sun shines or the wind blows some attendees were not only skeptical the biomass plan would bring down energy prices but also voiced concern about the environmental impact of burning wood to generate electricity bradley said price is the single greatest issue for families and businesses and that it would dominate discussion in the upcoming session there s not going to be a bigger focus than that he said bradley also said he would pursue offshore wind and the expansion of net metering and pointed to the targeted energy aid package passed by the legislature last week that bill will send one time temporary relief of up to 650 to around 50 000 income eligible families around the state while targeted aid cushions those most in need in the short term it doesn t address the underlying problem of the region s dependence on natural gas addressing attendees monday sen tom sherman a rye democrat and democratic nominee for governor also aired his proposals to bring down energy prices expand energy options build out clean energy infrastructure and invest in energy efficiency vose and bradley will likely get a chance to test their ideas both are poised to shape energy policy in the 2023 session if they get re elected in november vose chairs the house science technology and energy committee and bradley has long influenced state energy policy republicans currently control the state house senate and governor s office heading into midterm elections expected to favor their party and political analysts say high energy costs could pose an additional challenge to democrats as voters often blame the president s party for economic issues and its impact on their pocketbook it s the president and his party that get the credit when the economy s good and the blame when it s bad even if they had nothing to do with it said andrew smith politics professor and director of the university of new hampshire survey center if they don t do something to get those people s gasoline prices down and their houses warmed they re going to get slaughtered and national politics can have an effect on state politics according to dante scala professor of political science at unh there s always a trickle down effect if it s a bad year for democrats at the top it s going to affect them down ticket he said scala said that while voters are likely to blame federal politicians for gas prices electricity could factor into state races you see sherman trying to connect the dots between well look if sununu had followed what we had told them about diversifying energy prices we d be in a better place he said on monday vose downplayed the role of state government in driving down prices it s a challenge because in the legislature there s not much we can do to affect national energy policy or regional policy he said there s very little we can do in fact some energy experts disagree and believe state policies to decrease reliance on fossil fuels would help lower prices the four biomass plants vose wants to revive closed because they were no longer economically viable and couldn t compete on the free market those plants were important to new hampshire s timber industry but they weren t cheap said sam evans brown executive director of clean energy new hampshire an advocacy and educational nonprofit subsidies from connecticut historically allowed the plants to stay open evans brown said but without them the plants had to close and this past session one of new hampshire s last consistently operating biomass power plants burgess biopower in berlin went to the legislature to request ongoing support from taxpayers without it company executives testified the plant would shutter the legislature passed senate bill 271 which bradley sponsored granting the plant an additional year with no cap on above market energy bridgewater power is the one other biomass plant that s currently active and consistently running according to jasen stock executive director of the new hampshire timberland owners association the other plants are either idle or shuttered a company called stored solar which owns four plants in new hampshire filed for bankruptcy last week said stock who met the lawmakers plan to focus on biomass with excitement biomass is one of the few remaining markets for low grade wood and it s difficult for timber businesses to stay open without it electricity prices have skyrocketed in new hampshire because the cost of natural gas has gone up so drastically in the short term that s made power from biomass more attractive but it s not a long term guarantee that biomass will continue to be cheaper the cost of natural gas could go down in the future or other renewables like wind and solar could offer cheaper energy i m open to looking at any idea that might be a good one evans brown said but i can t imagine we would bring forth a bill that would lower electric rates by bringing back ancient wood fired electricity plants environmentalists are concerned that biomass does more harm than good when it comes to preventing the worst effects of climate change biomass releases a lot of carbon into the atmosphere in some cases as much as a coal plant or worse according to rachel smolker of biofuelwatch a nongovernmental organization but it s classified as carbon neutral under the presumption that a new tree will grow back absorbing that carbon that can take 50 years in which time ongoing emissions will continue to exacerbate climate change climate scientists say many biopower plants are also highly inefficient burgess biopower is about 25 percent efficient which means for every four trees burned the energy from only one is actually used the rest is released as waste heat that equation can improve if the waste heat is captured and put to use the burgess biomass plant which can produce 75 megawatts of power is small really small compared to other resources in the state it burns through an acre of forest per hour said patricia martin chair of the rindge energy commission addressing bradley and vose during the summit monday climate scientists are telling us that we have to stop burning things for power if we want to survive and when we re burning at 20 to 30 percent efficiency we are doing ourselves no favors there are reasons biomass has been popular in the north country last session residents testified that burgess biopower is considered an economic driver in the region that s still recovering from the exodus of paper mills proponents argue it provides a good market for low grade wood consumer advocate don kreis said with energy prices as high as they are now biomass should be economically viable but he questioned the burden biomass subsidies would place on ratepayers is it fair to pursue that on the backs of utility customers who are captive customers he said i would say maybe not

trump visits south texas as gop seeks to build on gains among latinos in three key house races warren mi october 01 former president donald trump gets ready to speak during a save america rally on october 1 2022 in warren michigan trump has endorsed republican gubernatorial candidate tudor dixon secretary of state candidate kristina karamo attorney general candidate matthew deperno and republican businessman john james ahead of the november midterm election photo by emily elconin getty images cnn with just over two weeks until election day former president donald trump is looking to shore up gop support in south texas on saturday as republicans seek to build on their 2020 gains with latino voters as part of their efforts to win control of the house republicans are targeting three congressional seats in the rio grande valley a culturally conservative but historically democratic region where gop candidates are aiming to grow the party s advances with latino voters in recent years if the gop can win multiple house seats in south texas it would boost the party s hopes of winning a majority in that chamber come november 8 while also solidifying republicans in several key statewide races the gop s three latina nominees have all proven to be strong fundraisers who could become part of a new more diverse generation of republican leadership i can t wait to see what these three strong women do they are really going to give a hard time to the squad when they get to dc nikki haley the former south carolina governor and trump s us ambassador to the united nations said at a recent campaign stop in mcallen the region s outcome could also be a harbinger for other battlegrounds where latino voters are crucial portions of the electorate including arizona and nevada both swing states in presidential elections as well as increasingly democratic urban counties elsewhere in texas democratic officials in south texas said this year s races will be an important gauge of whether they can stop the slide they saw in 2020 we are literally busting our butts trying to turn it around said sylvia bruni the democratic chairwoman in webb county home of laredo she said democrats are targeting infrequent voters there people who have voted for the party s candidates in the past but also have a history of skipping elections with their door knocking and phone banking efforts bruni said she hopes the increased outreach efforts can reverse her party s slide in an area that prior to 2020 had been very quiet in terms of political outreach and had seen lower than texas average turnout the message is for the love of god this time you absolutely have to vote bruni said a lot of it is just going to depend on whether there are more of us decent reasonable people that there are of them and for the life of me i couldn t tell you whether there are going to be however there are indications that energy is on republicans side the gop s candidates in those key house races all outraised their democratic rivals in 2022 s third quarter combined the republicans raised 4 3 million over the three month stretch from july through september compared to the democratic contenders 2 4 million all three raised more than 1 million a sign of republican donors enthusiasm about the party s prospects in one of the most rapidly evolving regions on the political map in the 15th district republican monica de la cruz raised a little more than 1 million and still had 772 000 in her campaign s bank account at the end of the quarter more than democratic rival michelle vallejo s 867 000 raised and 301 000 on hand in the 34th district home to an incumbent vs incumbent match up after redistricting republican rep mayra flores 1 6 million raised over the last three months dwarfed democratic rep vicente gonzalez 497 000 raised though both ended the quarter with about 800 000 on hand and in long time democratic rep henry cuellar s 28th district his 990 000 raised over the third quarter was outpaced by republican challenger cassy garcia s 1 7 million though cuellar ended the quarter with 836 000 on hand to garcia s 384 000 sometimes it s timing and the environment sometimes it s candidate quality sometimes it s money but when you have all of those at the same time it s pretty powerful said austin based republican strategist matt mackowiak and that s what we re seeing down there in explaining south texas shift toward republicans in recent years gop strategists point to cultural and economic factors nationally the supreme court s decision to reverse roe v wade s national abortion rights protections appears to have energized democratic voters but the issue has played differently in the house races in south texas where democratic candidates have not focused on the issue the way the party s contenders have in most other competitive races across the map among conservative catholic hispanics that issue cuts differently it may actually be a net positive mackowiak said additionally oil and natural gas production is a major economic driver in south texas an economic reality that diminishes the potency of the green energy elements of major spending initiatives biden has signed into law these are good high paying jobs and south texas is finally getting its share said wayne hamilton a texas republican strategist and former abbott campaign manager who now works on down ballot races and given that these house districts are on the us mexico border immigration and border security is also a key issue and trump s hard line policies appealed to wide swaths of voters people try to make this immigration issue a racial issue it s not it is illegal migrants overrunning small towns and the hispanics that live in those towns are as furious as the whites hamilton said you go to bed at night and in the morning people are camping in your backyard you can t leave your shoes outside because they get stolen you can t leave your bikes outside because they get stolen he said that has angered people up and down the border regardless of their ethnicity democrats argued that the political shifts in south texas have happened in part because of the area s historically low turnout it s always a bit of a blank slate said james aldrete a texas democratic strategist who is working on the 34th district house race it can be a different electorate every time they also point to the party s lack of investment in infrastructure in a state that has not elected a democrat to statewide office since 1994 aside from o rourke s 2018 senate campaign and 2022 gubernatorial campaign texas democrats have been starved for cash and must spread the money they do have across a state with several massive metropolitan areas you re looking a at battleground where the democratic infrastructure in the state has been on life support aldrete said of the rio grande valley it s a bit of a roll of the dice that you can change the dynamic with a little bit of effort trump is visiting robstown a suburb west of corpus christi which is north of the rio grande valley and just outside two of the three battleground house districts two texas republicans who have closely aligned themselves with trump and are on the ballot this year lt gov dan patrick who faces a rematch with 2018 democratic nominee mike collier and attorney general ken paxton who is locked in a tight race against democrat rochelle garza are both slated to speak at the rally gov greg abbott who faces democratic challenger beto o rourke said he isn t attending because he will be in florida on a pre planned fundraising trip it s not clear whether the three republicans in competitive house races will appear at trump s rally saturday none were listed on the speaking schedule and south texas democrats said trump s visit two days before early voting begins could do more to galvanize liberal voters than sway moderates in the gop s favor trump coming just highlights the contrast between what what we stand for and what they stand for said jared hockema the democratic chairman in cameron county the home of brownsville and a key portion of the 34th district they re promising to obstruct everything and do nothing and that certainly isn t a solution to addressing the challenge of inflation or the challenges people face in their everyday lives still the former president s visit to south texas underscores the importance of the region in this year s midterms and beyond the 15th district which stretches south from the eastern suburbs of san antonio has long been seen by both parties as the most competitive house district in texas but democrats there have complained in recent weeks as the national party and its house campaign arms focused resources elsewhere a sign that de la cruz is favored next month the current incumbent in the 15th district gonzalez is instead running in the redrawn 34th district vacated when democratic rep filemon vela resigned this spring even though president joe biden won the district which includes mcallen and brownsville and stretches along the gulf of mexico by 15 percentage points in 2020 gonzalez faces a tough race against a republican incumbent in flores who won vela s old seat in a special election to replace him in the 28th district which stretches just east of san antonio south to laredo cuellar is a political institution the most conservative democrat in the house who has now survived two fierce primaries against a progressive challenger he cast the only democratic vote in july against the women s health protection act of 2022 which would have preserved abortion rights nationwide after the supreme court s decision to reverse roe v wade but garcia his gop challenger has cast cuellar who was first elected to the house in 2004 as corrupt following the fbi s search of his home as part of an investigation in which cuellar has denied any wrongdoing he used us to enrich himself private planes dc condos and hundreds of thousands of dollars in payouts to relatives a narrator says in a garcia ad cassy garcia won t trade stocks in congress and she s not looking to get rich bruni the webb county democratic chairwoman conceded that while phone banking she has encountered left leaning voters who are opposed to cuellar we remind them when that comes up that the alternative is far far worse for us she said we re basically telling them this election is just as maybe more important than 2020

emergency funding legislation signed into law by the president in september 2008 public law no 110 329 included a non budget amendment that will have a major impact on the united states energy market advanced by outgoing senator pete domenici r nm the domenici amendment was intended to resolve a number of issues that are complicating america s uranium enrichment markets the most important of these issues is concern over the economic and national security implications of russia s role as a stable supplier of uranium currently fueling about half of all u s nuclear power reactors at a time when the u s is potentially on the threshold of a nuclear renaissance given russia s behavior in recent years especially regarding iran georgia and nato these concerns deserve close analysis while the domenici amendment attempts to bring predictability to the marketplace it does so at long term expense to american consumers it cre ates a bureaucracy laden protectionist approach to accommodating u s demand for fuel that will likely lead to higher energy prices carves out specific mar ket access for suppliers guarantees market protection for domestic producers and certain suppliers includ ing the russians and does little to enhance nonpro liferation efforts moreover rather than depend on the open markets that allow utility companies to buy fuel from the best most reliable sources the amend ment gives government bureaucrats the authority to manage significant portions of the u s uranium enrichment market and perversely will likely guar antee america s continued dependence on russian uranium in the future the way to ensure that the u s can meet its nuclear energy demand without institutionalizing vulnerabilities to uncertain suppliers and distorting markets is to open the enriched uranium market to competition the domenici amendment bad policy and unintended consequences the american nuclear industry is undergoing a substantial transformation as it prepares to meet america s growing demand for clean affordable domestic energy this new growth potential is espe cially pronounced in the uranium enrichment sec tor the adjustments have resulted in increased uncertainty over the long term viability of the industry and have sparked both political and orga nizational resistance to change congress and the administration have made several attempts to help stabilize the market the latest policy solution is the domenici amendment which clarifies by which method and in what amount russia can access the u s market unfortunately the details of the policy do more harm to the american consumer than good as a whole the amendment relies on the faulty assumption that price alone defines the value of enriched uranium the united states acquires about 20 percent of its electricity from nuclear power plants these 104 plants are fueled by low enriched ura nium about half of which is imported from russia as part of u s russian nonproliferation agreements these agreements will expire in december 2013 at which time russia would have enjoyed complete access to the u s market to avoid a flood of potentially cheap russian enriched uranium that would ostensibly under mine the viability of domestic enrichers the domenici amendment limits russia to supply ing only 20 percent of the u s market the amendment however is based on the misper ception that the value of enrichment services is based solely on price there is a benefit beyond price that consumers want and value the reliability of a supplier to fulfill contracted services is of vital importance to utilities providing power to america s house holds and businesses that is because at 5 per cent enrichment costs are a small percentage of the total cost of producing nuclear power when a plant loses over a million dollars per day during shut downs it is more important to keep the utility running than it is to save a nominal amount on fuel costs nuclear power suppliers recognize that it is better to spend more for enriched uranium from a reliable source than risk a break in supplying power to its customers thus u s utilities will be less likely to purchase russian enrichment services if that country is behaving erratically or if it threatens to disrupt fuel supplies the united states acquires about 20 percent of its electricity from nuclear power plants these 104 plants are fueled by low

supplies limits incentives to expand domestic enrich ment capacity to meet long term demand while the amendment does not explicitly man date that the u s obtain 20 percent of its ura nium from russia that will be the likely result which will have long term negative implications for u s energy supplies based on russia s past potential suppliers assume that russia will fill the 20 percent limit with below cost product essen tially removing that portion of the market from competition once removed domestic suppliers have no incentive to pursue that share of the mar ket this is exactly what is happening now two american and two european companies are cur rently planning to provide enrichment services in the u s upon the completion of their projects they will provide a quantity that is roughly equiv alent to 80 percent of the current u s market this means that the u s will be dependent on russian uranium for a minimum of 20 percent of its nuclear fuel in other words about 12 million americans or nearly 5 million households will depend on russia to provide their electricity while the amendment does not explicitly man date that the u s obtain 20 percent of its ura nium from russia

signaling that domestic sup pliers will be protected from foreign competi tion while the amendment purports to protect expanded domestic enrichment it does so at the expense of competition and market based prices moreover it is unclear that such protections are even necessary for domestic enrichers to be suc cessful four companies have already committed to constructing new enrichment facilities in the u s projects these companies have deter mined are feasible because of potential long term demand for enriched uranium not because of the prospect of government imposed market guarantees if these investments are based on the latter case the economic rationale for them disappears enrichment companies should be forced to compete like any other sector of the market and if they are unable to do so they should be allowed to fail domestic suppliers by limiting russian imports the government is signaling that domestic sup pliers will be protected from foreign competi tion while the amendment

allowing trained uranium fuel managers to assess risk and decide uranium pro curement strategies for their firms the domenici amendment authorizes the federal government to manage significant portions of the uranium market it creates a complicated set of condi tions requirements reviews timelines and authorities to decide who can supply what and to whom it can be supplied nuclear power plant operators rely on fuel managers who are respon sible for scanning global uranium suppliers for reliable low cost sources of fuel to support their multibillion dollar operations these managers are

fuel there is no need for govern ment to intervene in this facet of the industry gives preferential market access to a privileged few business and u s government consumers given that one of the stated justifications for gov ernment control of america s uranium enrichment market is to avoid becoming too dependent on any one supplier for example russia it seems coun terproductive to place limits on one sector while simultaneously lifting limits on others the amendment defines three exceptions to the limits under which enriched uranium could be imported in any amount from any source 1 to fuel new reactor cores 2 as an input for processing and re export and 3 to augment inventory held by the u s department of energy thus the amendment limits uranium supplies to the existing commercial electricity sector for example everyday consumers while big busi ness and the u s government will be allowed to scour the global marketplace to retain their enrichment services from the best supplier at the best price because this command and control approach to regulating the industry establishes a risk averse status quo where investors only invest to meet guaranteed market demand growing demand in the commercial market will likely require increasing america s reliance on russian uranium the amendment recognizes this very outcome which is exactly why it pro vides so many opportunities to adjust the quota and relieves special interests from quota restric tions altogether given that one of the stated justifications for gov ernment control of america s uranium enrichment market is to

accomplishes little to advance nonprolifer ation the domenici amendment is also sup posed to entice the russians to convert additional weapons grade uranium for use in commercial reactors the amendment com mendably supports the current policy of con verting 500 metric tons of russian weapons grade uranium for use in commercial reactors by the end of 2013 it also attempts to compel the russians to continue their weapons grade ura nium conversion activities after 2013 while the united states should express its strong desire that converted weapons grade uranium continue to make up a portion of russia s exports to the u s the incentives the amendment estab lishes to entice russian participation are small and not likely to be effective while the law would carve out another 5 percent of the american ura nium fuel market for russia if it agreed to convert another 300 tons of weapons grade uranium rus sia can instead sell the same amount or more to other countries without facing the same condi tions by creating a solution that is not likely to work the amendment diverts attention away from developing a more practical program market access does not imply dependence it is critical that u s policymakers not lose sight of the distinction between having access to a par ticular supplier and becoming dependent on it eliminating america s dependence on russian enrichment services is a desirable goal but doing so should not sacrifice all of america s access to those resources american utilities could choose to include some russian enriched uranium as part of a diversified supply portfolio without becoming dependent on russian suppliers indeed most large nuclear utilities already implement a diversified supply strategy as a matter of company policy any reform of america s uranium enrichment import export policy must take this delicate balance into consideration if america s relationship with rus sia continues to degenerate and a determination is made to impose punitive action against russia con trols on the uranium trade could be part of any result ing sanctions regime while such a policy approach would result in eliminating america s dependence on russian fuel suppliers it would also remove a specific source of supply from american businesses and con sumers regardless of whether sanctions would suc cessfully motivate russia to behave responsibly there would be negative economic consequences that must be weighed against any foreign policy benefits stem ming from economic sanctions nuclear power and uranium enrichment in america the federal government heavily promoted nuclear power throughout the 1950s and 1960s it realized that a robust commercial nuclear sector would help to support its national security objec tives the federal government worked with industry on a host of military civil and commercial projects throughout that period it provided lucrative guar anteed contracts and other subsidies that protected investments and assured private sector access to the latest nuclear technology although the industry grew it became depen dent on government this left it vulnerable to shifts in public policy when policy shifted toward out right opposition as the activist community con vinced america s political left that nuclear power was dangerous the industry predictably failed as investors cut their losses and moved capital to opportunities that were perceived as less threatened by increasing regulatory volatility a handful of companies survived and today make up america s nuclear industrial base this includes those in the uranium enrichment business only one domestic company enriches uranium in the u s this company usec was created in the 1990s to privatize and restructure america s enrichment com plex which was built to primarily support national security activities not commercial enterprise usec became a private company in 1998 the problem for usec is that it was forced to compete in the commercial world with a cold war national security infrastructure it uses an outdated expen sive and inefficient process of gaseous diffusion to enrich uranium a production process that is financially unsustainable and has led usec to engage in an ongoing modernization process its future hinges on using the more modern technology of gas centrifuges to enrich uranium enriched uranium supply and demand realities today and tomorrow the capacity to enrich uranium is measured in separative work units or swu the measurement of energy needed to separate u 235 from u 238 while a few countries such as japan and china have some enrichment capacity most global demand is met by usec two european consortiums and russia total global swu capacity is approximately 52 million although national policies limit available capacity to about 43 million swu the united states currently requires about 14 4 million swu annually to fuel its reactors about half of this amount is supplied by russia under the megatons to megawatts program which ends in 2013 the other half is supplied by domestic and european sources usec eurodif france and urenco uk germany and the netherlands the four companies planning to provide enrich ment services in the u s already have two projects one in new mexico and one in ohio under con struction total u s swu capacity will be about 11 million swu once the four planned facilities become operational however given that two of the new facilities are based on technology that has yet to be commercially proven the projected domestic capacity of 11 million swu is uncertain both the lack of domestic suppliers and the poten tial for future growth have attracted new investment in u s uranium enrichment capacity the investment was made however under the assumption that the u s would limit the share of america s enriched uranium market available for russia as current u s government policy would suggest this assumption however began to unwind when recent court decisions overturned the legal foundation allowing the u s to restrict russian suppliers with mounting legal uncertainty over the terms of russia s future market access in america congress and the administration faced a compli cated policy conundrum how to best assure reliable access to enriched uranium for power producers today and in the future the domenici amendment was one such remedy an agreement with russia in 1991 u s uranium miners and a uranium enrichment labor union accused russia of dumping enriched uranium on the u s market this insti gated a department of commerce investigation into russian trade in enriched uranium that could have resulted in additional duties on nuclear fuel imports instead the u s and russia signed a sus pension agreement in 1992 that sought to define the conditions under which russia could have access to the u s market a critical provision of the agreement was one that lifted all restrictions on the import of any low enriched uranium leu so long as it used russian bomb grade high enriched ura nium heu as its feedstock this provision was executed as part of a program between the u s and russia often referred to as megatons to megawatts this highly successful pro gram served two critical purposes it removed weap ons grade heu from the russian arsenal and it provided the u s with a reliable source of fuel for its power reactors russia supplies fuel for about 10 percent of america s electricity through this pro gram the heu agreement was set to last 20 years during which time 500 metric tons of russian heu would be down blended into nuclear fuel with the expiration of megatons to megawatts on the horizon the u s government has worked with russia to amend the suspension agreement to develop new terms for russian access to the u s market despite the fact that u s relations with russia have deteriorated since the early 1990s when the original suspension agreement was signed the agreement was amended in february 2008 and determined that russia would be allowed to supply up to 20 percent of america s nuclear fuel between 2014 and 2020 but a recent court decision undermined the applicability and thus legitimacy of this policy approach to controlling imports of russian uranium restricting trade in enriched uranium the legal question russia has not been the only nuclear fuel sup plier to face u s anti dumping actions a separate anti dumping action was taken against european gaseous diffusion uranium enrichment consor tium or eurodif eurodif appealed the decision through the u s court of international trade and the federal circuit court of appeals both courts ruled that the process of enriching uranium was not subject to u s anti dumping law because it repre sents the sale of a service rather than a good this decision undermined the basis for the u s russian suspension agreement and set in motion much of the controversy that exists today the supreme court is currently reviewing the decision u s utilities have two ways to import enriched uranium they may either purchase already en riched uranium or they can provide uranium feed stock and have it enriched in the second case the utility would arrange for the feedstock to be delivered to a foreign enricher who then delivers uranium enriched from its own inventory com pensation for the transaction includes transfer ring title of the delivered feedstock to the enricher as well as payment for the enrichment service this arrangement is referred to as a swu or enrich ment contract because the u s utilities retain title to the feed stock uranium until they receive leu from the enricher the federal circuit court found that there was no transfer of ownership and thus no sale of the leu from the enricher in this case eurodif to the u s utilities but only a service thus since no sale of merchandise occurred the court ruled that anti dumping laws did not apply that decision if affirmed by the supreme court will nullify the newly amended u s russia sus pension agreement while that agreement stated that russia could supply up to 20 percent of amer ica s enriched uranium it would do nothing to pro hibit russia from supplying unlimited enrichment services thus undermining the agreement s real world credibility the domenici amendment up held the application of the amended suspension agreement by clarifying that any imported russian uranium regardless of contract type would be con sidered part of the 20 percent quota the problem is that the domenici amendment upheld bad policy the reality is that the amended suspension agreement was initially an inappropri ate agreement because it artificially limited free trade and access to global energy resources with the potential new expansion of the u s nuclear power industry attempting to forecast future demand and determine market share for particular suppliers is fraught with uncertainty and is poten tially costly for all stakeholders russia s impact on uranium markets russia will have a total of about 26 million swu by 2010 but a domesticrequirement of only about 8 million swu at home this will leave about 18 million swu for the russians to offer on the global market at potentially low prices investors in u s enrichment capacity worry that open competition with russia would result in low fuel prices too low to bring a return on their multibillion dollar investments global trends toward increasing the production of commercial nuclear power however should ren der this concern moot india china japan the united kingdom and many other countries are all planning to build nuclear power plants in the years ahead russia also plans to build additional nuclear power plants which means its own demand for enriched uranium will increase the level of future demand is unclear however what is clear is that global demand will grow significantly in the future in 2007 then president vladimir putin commit ted to roughly doubling russia s nuclear power should this plan be realized its 18 million excess swu capacity quickly halves to about 10 million swu assuming that it supplies all of its own enrichment in addition russia plans to export up to 60 nuclear power plants to other countries over the next 25 years assuming that some if not most of these plants will include service agree ments with fuel most of russia s excess capacity will be used as the global nuclear renaissance unfolds a caveat to this analysis however is the financial crisis that is currently gripping the global economy this could affect many nations plans to build new power generation including nuclear energy should market conditions dictate that new power genera tion is either not needed or not required the above calculations would clearly require revision that is precisely why the u s should pursue market based policies regarding energy a well grounded market based system will be flexible enough to respond to changing conditions on the other hand a more state centric system like that promoted in russia will be unsustainable protectionism does not bolster national security reducing american dependence on foreign energy has been at the heart of the energy debate in recent years but dependence on foreign sources of energy is not the problem the problem arises when reliance on unstable or hostile foreign sources of energy creates unacceptable and unmanageable economic and strategic vulnerabilities the fear that less expensive supplies of foreign nuclear fuel will drive out domestic production and leave america at the mercy of a foreign regime certainly plays on this argument and seemingly provides justification for restrictions on foreign suppliers in the case of ura nium fuel however cost is not the most important factor because it represents such a small percentage of the total cost of nuclear electricity and the losses associated with shutdowns are so high supply reli ability is more important than cost u s national security also depends on policies that promote the country s economic well being the correct policy will consider the likelihood of becoming dependent on questionable foreign sup pliers like the russians and the likelihood that such a country would threaten the u s with supply inter ruptions and also the cost of denying americans access to foreign uranium enrichment resources additionally there are national security implica tions for not using a domestic supplier of enriched uranium for defense purposes the united states relies on assured supplies of uranium for some of the most critical defense activities while it is true that the u s must maintain domestic enrichment capacity for military use the cost of maintaining this capability should not fall on u s nuclear power utilities and their customers if domestic suppliers catering to defense demand cannot compete in commercial markets then the needed capability should be budgeted and paid for through national security budgets what to do to ensure that the u s can meet its nuclear energy demand without creating unacceptable vul nerabilities or distorting markets congress should repeal the domenici amendment congress and the administration should also reject calls to reassert protectionist policies the federal circuit court ruled that uranium enrichment is a service and therefore not subject to u s anti dumping law overturning this deci sion with legislation precisely as the domenici amendment accomplished in addition to being bad policy could open the door to a signifi cant expansion of retaliatory trade remedies as a means to solve problems

audience of children the acbf is the first and the largest nigerian book festival specifically for children we have some fabulous book festivals for adults but back when i started i looked around for book festivals for children a place that children can go to just revel in the breath of children s books that are available for people that look speak live like them and i simply couldn t find one so i started one the gathering was held for the first time in 2019 and it attracted over 1 400 attendees this year the acbf will hold on saturday october 29 2022 at the upbeat centre admiralty road lekki phase 1 lagos the theme for this year s event is together again you mentioned that the maiden edition of the festival attracted over 1 400 attendees would you say you have always known that the festival would be such a success in 2019 when we did the first one we had absolutely no idea what to expect we thought that maybe we d get around 400 or so people to show up but well over 1 400 people showed up by some counts it was over 2 000 people it was amazing we were in awe of what was going on there is an absolute desire for books children love to read they want to read what they need is better access to books and it was just really encouraging to see all the schools parents and grandparents that turned up bringing their children with them the children just had fun i remember there was one girl there who described it as book heaven and she expressed the desire that the event is repeated again and again and again it is because of people like her that we keep going so in 2020 and 2021 due to the covid 19 pandemic the second and third editions of the festivals were held online and we saw a different phenomenon this time it attracted participants from across nigeria and from over 23 countries around the world we had attendees join the festival from australia canada ghana belgium madagascar united kingdom united states rwanda estonia the netherlands south africa kenya france italy germany ireland qatar libya norway the philippines portugal singapore south korea and zambia to us this shows that there is an interest in books there is an interest in books for african children there is an interest in books written by african authors so i would say that the reception has been encouraging the road is hard it is a lot of work but the reception has been encouraging and it is the reception that keeps us going what should attendees expect at this year s festival the 2022 edition of the acbf will be an in person event it will feature author led book readings book chats book exhibition and professional workshops for children s books writers illustrators and publishers it will have fun mini workshops and activities for children there will be music drama and insightful sessions for parents and teachers the theme as i mentioned earlier for this year s event is together again it is to give us an opportunity to celebrate being back together in person after two years of being divided by the isolation requirements of the covid 19 pandemic how are writers who participate or showcase their works at the festival selected or it is open to everyone earlier on in the year months or weeks before the festivals depending on how much time we have we put out a call for offers and we advertise everywhere that the acbf is now in the planning stage anyone who wants their book featured would have to send their books to the editorial board for consideration we have a time when authors can submit their books and we encourage published authors and illustrators to do so this is because for children s books illustrators are just as good as writers this is because that beautiful attractive picture in the children s book helps to understand what the book is really about so we say to the illustrators come and exhibit your work we have an editorial board that is made up of different volunteers each year the eb then picks the books that they think are the best books and then we fill as many slots as we can with book readings and story time sessions this year we have about 23 books that will be showcased they are all by authors of african descent some of them are based here in nigeria and others are based in the diaspora we are also featuring three illustrators who are authors as well another way that writers and illustrators can be part is by leading one or two of the workshops this year we have a workshop session on how to create our own cartoon characters using shapes we have a self publishing workshop finally writers and illustrators can be a part of this by being a volunteer we don t have the budget nor do we have financial sponsors so everything is done on goodwill we put out a call for volunteers and we select the people that we need if we have too many we thank them and keep their details for the following year how can one access the creative writing boot camps which is also planned in the festival the acbf is coming up on saturday october 29 2022 in lagos the writing boot camp is available to anyone that has registered for the festival and has signed up for the workshop general admission is free but there is a small fee for attending these workshops the workshop is being led by one of the co founders of narrative landscape it is a session that i would say is not to be missed to register go to akadafestival org what are some of the most profound discoveries you ve made on this journey in relation to the african reading ecosystem especially among children i would say that children love to read what they need is better access to age appropriate books every time i do a book reading the children invariably ask me when my next book is coming out right now my focus is on the youngest readers who are kids under five although i have found out that children above 10 love to read my books i do children s picture books early reader books chapter books and things like that i will eventually write those books but i am focused on writing those picture books first in terms of the reading ecosystem some people say that nigerians do not like to read but i always say to them i don t agree with you and i don t know the nigerians you are talking about this is because the nigerians that i have met love to read they just need age appropriate books for them to read we shouldn t just force children to read textbooks nigerian parents are very good at having the kids do their homework but they don t encourage children to learn how to read for pleasure to do that parents have to have fun books that will encourage them to read that is what we try to do at the akada children s book festival do you think there are enough children s books to cater for the nigerian market the nigerian market is huge but the challenge that indigenous authors and publishers face especially for children s picture books is that they are exceedingly expensive to operate the margins are so high that it is very difficult to make a living as a children s books author in nigeria so it doesn t encourage very many people to write books for children so the authors are more likely to go to a book that will yield a steady income for themselves and their families we cannot blame anybody for that we can have a lot more books if the industry were more favourable to the producers of these books in some countries the government has a policy where they purchase at least 1 000 copies of any books published by self published authors they buy those books and give them to libraries across the country it would be so great if we could have a policy like that in nigeria where the government would support self published authors and publishing houses by buying the books that they publish and distributing those books free of charge in terms of whether or not there are enough books to cater to the nigerian market i would say are there enough good quality books or culturally appropriate books for the nigerian market and i would have to say that there are a lot of books available in nigeria but majority of those books are published abroad and created with other children in mind so we need to have more books that are created for the nigerian child in this culture and environment with us in mind there is a lot of room for improvement and growth in that regard what qualifies a book to be termed as a children s book there are different types of children s books there are board books for the youngest readers they tend to have pictures and no words or very few words they are made out of board paper to make it very uneasy for children to destroy them they are more durable and will last longer this is for children between zero and two years for example there are also picture books they are children s books with lovely illustrations and a few words on every page less than 500 words in total those are for children maybe two to five years old it is for children who are just starting to read by themselves they are excellent as bedtime storybooks we have books that can be referred to as early reader books and those are books that have one illustration and a whole page or two pages of text sometimes these books are known as early readers chapter books there is more text maybe the words will be around 1 000 or 1 500 words but every single chapter has an illustration to support the text and aid understanding then there are young adult books these are the books aimed at teenagers there is also the diary of a wimpy child kind of book those are for younger teens the ya books are for older teens any of these books can be classified as children s literature it depends really on how one s society defines a child really i know that there is a very major children s award given every other year by a leading company in nigeria and one of my complaints was that even though they call it a children s award sometimes the books that they give the awards to are majorly on chapter books even though they may have illustrations here and there this to me will be books for older teens perhaps but they typically are the type of books that win the award they refer to as a children s books award if they were true to form the children s books award should go to authors who write for young children as of now i am not aware of any indigenous book prize for children s picture book authors or for people who write for younger readers under the age of 10 how can children have improved access to reading materials libraries one of my dreams is for us to have a public library on every single street in every single one of our 774 local government areas in the country we need more libraries this is one sure way to improve access to reading materials for children of course i know the world has gone online and everything is now digital but not everybody has data and smartphones so yes well done to all who have developed apps for children and children s books for those who are connected but we still do not have high saturation in this environment so families with just one device can make their kids read at different times so i am still full on print books it may be because of my history as a printer because i used to be a printer i am very keen on actual printed books so many nigerians can have access to physical books as they can for this to happen we need more libraries and to stock the libraries with good books there is an argument about who an african author is from your experience as a publisher what qualifies one to be an african author well this must be a tricky question because i would have thought an african author must be an author either born in africa or one who has parentage from africa and or who is of african descent one could also argue that an african author is one who writes books about africa and for the african audience it could be a question of semantics or demography for me an african author is an author who is of african descent or who lives in africa or who writes things about africa and does so repeatedly and predominantly i can think of one or two authors who write fantastic children s books based in africa how can parents help their kids to develop quality reading analytical and comprehension skills parents can do this by encouraging their kids to love reading and that can be done by modelling good and healthy reading habits in front of them as a parent if you had the option of watching a show or picking up a book to read if you know you want your children to develop a love for reading and to learn how to pay attention to details pick up the book and let them see you pick up the book and read encourage them to read read along with them read them bedtime stories when they read ask them to read aloud to you and talk to them about what they have read ask them questions about what they have read to ensure comprehension also encourage them to do their english homework take an interest in what they do ask questions about what they have read find a time to read the books that your children are reading and ask questions about the book strike up conversations about the books you can help your children develop an understanding of nuance by asking questions that are not obvious in the books please do not discourage them if you find they are reading books about shows that are on tv if that is what is going to get them to read encourage them to read and show an interest by asking questions and listening to their answers encourage them when they get the answers right and help them improve on a wrong answer at what point should a child be taught creativity and writing it is never too early to start teaching children creativity and writing skills at the festival this year we have a workshop session on how to create one s own cartoon characters using shapes and that is available for children who are old enough to hold a crayon in their hands it is never too early to encourage children to think visually analytically and that can be done through play this will encourage this kind of learning also try to have lots of books around the house and don t stifle play time thinking it is a waste of time can children be taught sex and sexuality using books at the acbf we have a speaker dr lanre olusola coming to talk to parents it is called talking to your children about sex and sexuality why is this important many parents are faced with dilemmas that their own parents didn t face but because of the way things are in the world today there are many parents who don t know how to talk to their children about sex and sexuality they are being presented with scenarios that they didn t plan for and they don t understand and do not know how to deal with them the idea is to gather parents around to talk to them listen to them talk about the various concerns that they may have about their children and the behaviour and patterns that have emerged and to get advice on how to be the ones to guide their children into making healthy choices rather than letting it be random or just hoping and praying that their children won t ever find out or come across these difficult situations how can children and parents build trust through book bonding this is a great question because one of the things i am very passionate about is bedtime story time i believe that more parents need to take the time to read more bedtime stories to their children particularly to their younger children as the children get older parents can now sit and listen to the children read to them as simple or as mundane as bedtime stories may seem to an adult to a child it means multiple things and has myriads of benefits parents reading to their children at bedtime increases the child s sense of security and confidence

karachi habib bank ltd ceo muhammad aurangzeb said on saturday pakistan shouldn t seek relief on commercial debt after the devastation caused by the nationwide floods speaking at a conference organised by the marketing association of pakistan mr aurangzeb said failing to deliver on roughly 9 10 billion of commercial debt will knock the country out of the international capital markets we mustn t touch commercial debt which makes perfect sense at this point in time in the global context he said commercial debt consists of funds the sovereign has borrowed from commercial banks or international bondholders these are different from the loans that islamabad has acquired from bilateral and multilateral sources like foreign governments and international financial institutions our external debt is 130bn about 80pc of it is bilateral and multilateral he said according to the state bank of pakistan sbp the country s total external debt amounted to 130 2bn at the end of 2021 22 commercial loans of just a little over 10bn constitute 7 7pc of the country s total dollar denominated external debt there s good stuff coming out of islamabad we re steady with the imf programme we re going to focus on bilats in terms of how we re going to do our debt re profiling said the ceo of pakistan s largest commercial bank with assets of over rs4 3 trillion mr aurangzeb urged the government not to chase after deposits from friendly countries a recurring practice involving the shoring up of central bank reserves with funds obtained from countries like saudi arabia and the united arab emirates all this repo discussion it s not gonna happen he said while referring to a reserve build up plan championed by former finance minister miftah ismail under the proposed plan which has apparently been shelved now a friendly country was to acquire 10 15pc shareholding in state owned companies with tradeable shares on the stock exchange the transaction was to take place under a buyback agreement which would give islamabad the option but not the obligation to repurchase the same shareholding after a certain period of time at a 5pc higher rate let s just forget about it we re in a world where people are talking about hard core investments give them equity investments give them board seats that s how the investment is going to come in he said mr aurangzeb said his takeaway from the recent imf and world bank meetings held in washington dc last week was that pakistan wasn t the only country that was seeking relief from the global lenders there s donor fatigue and then there s the issue of multilaterals bandwidth my thought process coming out of those meetings was that we have to get our story together he said while urging the stakeholders to present a credible story for where pakistan is at least in terms of the dollar amounts needed for post floods rehabilitation we should speak with one voice as to what we need he said published in dawn october 23th 2022

my 1 year old has a hand me down t shirt that reads the future is female it s a few years old a relic of the girlboss era of feminism when cute slogans that sassed the patriarchy read like borderline sore winner taunts it s stained with beet puree now and looks like my baby wore it during a fight which feels appropriate given everything that s happened during the life of that shirt we were so confident that whatever was holding women back was over that pop feminism shrunk itself down to the size of a screen print i used to find that kind of celebratory sloganeering cloying now it just makes me sad post dobbs our futures have never been more closely tied to our femaleness and our femaleness has never been less within our control our femaleness is now the determinant of our physical health our financial health our access to education professional opportunity and happiness being a reproductively capable person in america feels more and more like walking around with an anatomical time bomb that could given the wrong circumstances force me down a path of physical and financial ruin the future has never been more female or frightening advertisement advertisement georgia gubernatorial candidate stacey abrams has recently taken some heat for a bad faith read on comments she made about abortion and the economy along these lines during an msnbc appearance this week she was asked about former president obama s recent comments that democrats need to formulate a plan to address kitchen table issues like the high cost of rent abrams countered that abortion is in fact an economic issue here s what she said in part let s be clear having children is why you re worried about your price for gas it s why you re concerned about how much food costs for women this is not a reductive issue you can t divorce being forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy from the economic realities of having a child it s important for us to have both and conversations we don t have the luxury of reducing it or separating them out staceyabrams floated abortion as a solution to voters concerns about inflation explaining to msnbc viewers that having children is why you re worried about your price for gas it s why you re concerned about how much food costs isaac_schorr pic twitter com 5hwdbsqj0v national review nro october 19 2022 this has caused a conniption among right wing media and the mainstream dupes who fall for their histrionics but abrams is not wrong children are expensive and the choice whether or not to have them is an economic one as much as it is a personal one advertisement advertisement as profiteers move to extract more and more money from parents at every point in their children s lives as the government does nothing but force all pregnant people to give birth the question of whether to have children becomes even more of an economic issue the government is doing nothing to ease the massive cost of carrying birthing and raising children one party has spent the last 40 years working toward a future where every pregnancy ends in a compulsory birth the most recent brookings institution estimate for how much a child costs to raise from 0 18 is 300 000 or about 18 000 a year that doesn t include the cost of a college education and that figure is likely higher in high cost of living areas i have a 1 year old child and live in los angeles and can anecdotally attest that her first year of life has been much more expensive than that even though she consumed primarily breastmilk which is free and only has child care two days per week it should not be controversial to point out that a country that would force anybody who becomes pregnant to carry that pregnancy to term and endure childbirth is essentially condemning them to physical injury ask your mother how many stitches she needed after you were born but it also condemns them to economic hardship this applies even if a mother opts out of the cost of parenthood by surrendering their child for adoption because the u s medical industry driven by profit first and patient care second is constantly innovating new ways to extract money from patients at their most vulnerable moments advertisement advertisement let s set aside the absurdity of the suggestion of the amy coney barretts of the world that adoption is a simple alternative to abortion adoption is an alternative to parenting but it is not an alternative to pregnancy and childbirth and it is a choice that carries with it so much trauma and heartache that very few healthy mothers who give birth to healthy children choose it without being coerced in one way or another about 4 million babies are born each year about 18 000 of those are put up for adoption lindsey graham s abortion ban bill is bad policy and dumb politics florida senator rick scott came up with the extraordinarily cruel suggestion that the state fund the cost of an impoverished woman s childbirth if and only if she gives her child up to adoptive parents it s the same sort of economic coercion that the largely unregulated billion dollar adoption industry utilizes now but it s still shocking coming from an elected official scott made it clear that a faction of american conservatives believe that people who are poor do not deserve to raise their own children but just because scott s saying the quiet part loud plan may not ever become law we re on a path to a place where it may as well be the cost of childbirth is exorbitant and getting worse there will be a time in the not so distant future where mothers who were forced to carry an unplanned pregnancy to term by republican policies will be forced to choose between surrendering their child at birth and suffering medical related bankruptcy advertisement advertisement according to a piece in fortune earlier this month hospitals are slapping new parents with surprise bills from so called obstetrics emergencies departments many of those oeds are staffed by private equity backed companies and women who believe they re going into labor have no idea that they re accessing emergency services when they utilize them they re money making machines for hospitals and can cost patients thousands out of pocket even if they re insured proponents of the departments say that oeds exist to provide patients with the best care possible but one source quoted in the article remarked that will always have a rationale for why income maximization is a reasonable and moral strategy this isn t the first time that parents have had to worry about surprise bills related to their own child s birth it s almost impossible to know in advance of a birth how much it s going to cost because that amount is dependent on so many variables that attempting to ballpark it is useless the location of the birth matters as does usage of anesthesia and whether the anesthesiologist even takes insurance and they often do not the length of labor whether or not the birth requires surgical intervention whether the baby needs the nicu whether the nicu accepts insurance maternal recovery time and the overall health of the baby post birth all factor in even a routine uncomplicated vaginal birth can cost five figures an emergency c section with a nicu stay can cost 250 000 recent polling has found that in the waning weeks before the midterm elections americans jitters about the economy now give republicans a slight edge problems with using national polls to predict local results aside it s always been puzzling to me that voters associate republicans with sound economic decisions what do poll respondents who associate conservatives with good fiscal policy believe the economy means do they think it means how much they pay for gas and how well the stock market is doing congress has very little to do with either of these things do they think the economy means inflation that s a global problem and republicans have no concrete plan to tackle it advertisement advertisement i suspect that when most americans respond to polling about the economy they re reacting to what messaging they re receiving from mass media about the economy combined with how they personally feel that they are doing but the ability to control when and how often they give birth is perhaps the biggest economic issue in most american women s lives it doesn t need to be this way the government could subsidize and mandate paid parental leave on the federal level they could extend the child tax credit subsidize wages of child care workers to stop the bleeding from the profession subsidize the cost of child care so that people aren t forced to choose between parenthood and their profession universal health care would mean that obstetrics would no longer be treated like a cash cow by private equity and that the cost of childbirth wouldn t be financially ruinous to all but the wealthiest sliver of society of course stacey abrams was right abortion is an economic issue birth is an economic issue parenting is an economic issue before dobbs one of the more grotesque truths of living in america was that the size of your family was not determined by what you wanted it was determined by how much family you could afford in the post dobbs future it doesn t even matter what you want or what you can afford read more at the daily beast get the daily beast s biggest scoops and scandals

by rob stock of photo 123rf new zealand children born to parents who are citizens of the united states face a difficult kiwisaver choice give up your us citizenship or face a kiwisaver tax compliance bill of 750 or more a year courtesy of the us taxman a petition has been started at parliament asking mps to change the kiwisaver act to allow people with kiwisaver accounts facing the unreasonable demands from us tax authorities to close their kiwisaver accounts the issue surfaced as a result of the plight of auckland dual national kira bacal and her four new zealand born children harper 13 rowan 10 and twins malachi and elias 8 bacal said she signed her children up to kiwisaver but found that had entangled them in a net of us tax authority red tape requiring extensive tax filings every year the filings were so complex only an accountant could prepare them bacal said she tried to shut her children s kiwisaver accounts at kiwisaver provider juno only to find the kiwisaver act does not permit that once open a kiwisaver account can be closed in only limited circumstances when the account holder dies or permanently emigrates although the children were born here they like me are dual nationals of new zealand and the usa and have tax obligations to both countries bacal said she blamed the us for imposing a punitive tax reporting process to discourage foreign investments in favour of domestic ones but said she was also annoyed there was no warning when she opened the accounts despite the application forms asking for the applicants nationality details this will cost me 2000 per child per year for the required reporting this is separate to any actual tax that is due this is just what it costs to fill out the extremely and deliberately confusing forms bacal said failure to file can result in a penalty of us 10 000 nz 17 600 a year i begged the inland revenue to allow the accounts to be closed but this appeal for an exemption was rejected she said i am trying to be a good citizen of both countries as a single parent we do not have a huge amount of disposable income under the best circumstances she said i appreciate that like many other savings and retirement accounts kiwisaver is designed to prevent early withdrawal of funds but surely it was never intended to force a family into financial hardship either her accountant david tzimenakis from us global tax said kiwisaver could work for some dual new zealand us citizens living their lives in new zealand but it comes with quite a lot of hooks attached us citizens were treated by the us tax authority irs as us residents for tax purposes no matter where they lived in the world tzimenakis said the fishhooks included many hours of an accountant s time to prepare the reporting he said this system was designed to be difficult it was designed to be complex even the irs estimates are that 32 hours of preparation time per form is required now it doesn t take us anywhere near that long but it was designed to be hard he said preparation fees could vary from 250 to 5000 a year he said it s not fair on us citizens he said the result has been a growing number of new zealand us dual citizens of which there may be more than 40 000 according to tzimenakis renouncing their american citizenship i used to deal with three to four renunciations a year now it s closer to 100 every single year tzimenakis said a great many of them do it through gritted teeth it created a loss of identity and limited their freedom it s an awful thing to do he said but there was an easy fix to this tzimenakis said he had been in contact with government ministers but had no luck in persuading them to act so he started a petition to parliament to ask mps to change the kiwisaver act to allow dual new zealand us citizens to close their accounts a petition to parliament triggers a select committee inquiry process including the gathering of evidence followed by a report which can eventually lead to law change commerce and consumer affairs minister david clark said that while he appreciated the difficult situation the bacals were in the government had no plans to change kiwisaver settings based on us tax requirements this story originally appeared on stuff
a fed shift away from quantitative tightening could be the next bull factor for stocks in 2023 according to bank of america the fed has started to reduce its near 9 trillion balance sheet at a clip of about 95 billion per month but central banks are petrified of market consequences of liquidity withdrawal bofa said advertisement a new bull factor for the stock market could emerge in 2023 after the federal reserve shocked markets with aggressive interest rate hikes earlier this year according to a friday note from bank of america while most investors pay attention to the fed s ongoing rate hikes behind the scenes the central bank is reducing its near 9 trillion balance sheet via 95 billion per month roll offs of its treasury and mortgage debt but that move combined with quickly rising interest rates is sucking liquidity out of the global market and could spark a shift in the fed s policy heading into next year according to the note that s because central banks are petrified of market consequences of liquidity withdrawal bofa s investment strategist michael hartnett said fear of deeper declines materializing in equity and fixed income markets is what could ultimately spark a fed shift away from quantitative tightening and towards quantitative tinkering hartnett said and it s partly already happening advertisement the fed is so far the only global central bank that is operating quantitative tightening and yet already the bank of england has had to flip back to quantitative easing and buy gilts delaying its planned tightening actions amid the fiasco sparked by uk prime minister liz truss failed tax cut plans meanwhile the bank of japan has been forced to buy bonds this week as the yen plunges to 32 year lows relative to the us dollar additionally the european central bank is considering but not yet committing to even passive quantitative tightening hartnett said a signal investors can monitor that would suggest the fed is leaning towards a pause would be halt in the us dollar s march towards new highs according to the note any pivot from the fed whether it s in the form of a pause in further interest rate hikes or a reduction or pause in its monthly balance sheet reductions could be viewed positively by investors and lead to a sizable relief rally but hartnett still sees pain ahead before that happens with the expectation that stocks will hit new lows soon that s because there has been no capitulation among investors and their relationship to stocks with hartnett observing more than 9 billion in flows to equities over the past week advertisement still no final capitulation in equity flows hartnett said we re bearish despite ubiquitous bear sentiment

medical disposables and supplies limited mds is looking to complete the integration of cornwall enterprises limited by the end of its 2023 financial year in march as it also plans to expand its presence in the western end of the island the distributor of medical supplies and various consumer products acquired 60 per cent of cornwall enterprises in march 2021 cornwall is the vehicle which was used to acquire cornwall medical and dental supplies limited which had a similar distribution profile like mds along with three pharmacies under the corn med pharmacy brand mds has spent the last year focused on integration of the business and culture of the new subsidiary we would have hoped to integrate our software system quite sooner because what comes with that is new equipment it has to come on stream so it s unavoidable in addition to that we also own a distribution facility in montego bay where we should be moving our current office to a more efficient space with more storage said mds chief executive officer kurt boothe at the company s annual general meeting held at its head office on october 13 when asked if the company would consider additional acquisition opportunities in the space boothe responded at this stage of the business cycle i think it s a clear strategy to look at inorganic growth opportunities the addition of our subsidiary was not the first organisation we looked at and it wasn t the second it was the one that passed through our filters and from time to time we filter other opportunities boothe at this stage of the business cycle i think it s a clear strategy to look at inorganic growth opportunities photo joseph wellington the company s profitability grew by more than 1 000 per cent for its most recent financial year from 7 53 million to 84 26 million arising from a 17 per cent increase in revenue to 2 83 billion for the broader group consolidated net profit moved past 105 million on 3 42 billion in revenue despite the positive headwinds in prior times boothe cautioned shareholders due to the current logistics challenges which continue to impact the group he cited an example of a good that was ordered with a three month window scheduled for arrival in september but isn t expected to reach until november as we move on we re not out of the woods as yet we re still experiencing some logistics challenges unfortunately this has also contributed to some targets not being achieved but we re only at half time in the year and we have another half to claim boothe related in his presentation while shipping rates from china have come down from the astronomical levels of around us 20 000 to stable prices of us 3 000 boothe explained that there still remain difficulties surrounding the ability to adjust prices upwards to account for inflation this he puts down to competition and the disruptions caused by the zero covid 19 policy in china he gave an example of the company only increasing the cost of a product in october when they had wanted to adjust it from january an aerial view of medical disposables and supplies limited s head office on hagley park road up to last night i was on a call with a manufacturer in europe this product line was manufactured in china and they re actually setting up manufacturing facilities in north florida as a matter of fact we can place an order but we can t receive the goods before february or march of next year â and this is just because of the shipping costs from the far east boothe explained on the nearshoring which is occurring by some manufacturers that still face difficulties in providing products to their clients in order to combat this issue mds s consolidated inventory profile is up 46 per cent year over year to a historic 1 33 billion up to june 30 this has been a general trend facing many listed manufacturers and distributors who have cited the need to keep additional months of inventory on hand to account for these disruptions i think this is evidence that shipping costs are still high but what it also shows is that we re looking at all ways to reduce costs we re looking at alternatives we are actually looking at manufacturers from this hemisphere right now said boothe however while this action has been to the benefit of the company s growth and ability to supply the market it has put pressure on its working capital the group s increased inventory spend resulted in a cash outflow from operations of 34 67 million the group borrowed 233 02 million and repaid 255 19 million in the first quarter which represents the company using external financing to support working capital financing costs for the group increased 40 per cent year over year to 24 12 million other external factors that are out of our control that we have experienced this year is the increase in interest rates i think this is the single greatest factor that has actually affected us thus far especially when we re managing our working capital so this has affected us in an increase in working capital and very soon an increase in capital expenditure as a matter of fact there are some capex projects that have been put on hold this year obviously this leads to increased finance costs which has trickled down to our bottom line thus far however i can assure you that as we speak we are reviewing mitigation strategies and once our feasibility review comes out favourable believe me you will be informed boothe assured on the increase in interest rates the bank of jamaica has increased its policy rate from 0 5 per cent to 6 5 per cent in the last year when the jamaica observer s sunday finance queried about the group needing to seek additional financing and its current debt make up boothe replied i would say it s quite the opposite it s quite the strain to keep the door closed from the bankers that keep knocking i think we re in an enviable position the company is currently focusing on expanding its reach into the fast moving consumer goods fmcg segment where it currently distributes products under the simply true natural and discin brands it is slated to announce a new partnership in short order as it continues to find complementary products to distribute not only to pharmacies but other businesses in jamaica boothe noted that the company is very selective about which brands it adds for its consumer and medical divisions as it tries to ensure that the quality standard remains of the highest degree mds s consolidated total assets are up 17 per cent year over year to 2 89 billion with cash standing at 86 61 million total liabilities are up 24 per cent to 1 77 billion as the group s interest bearing debt and payables went up during the quarter with equity attributable to shareholders up seven per cent to 987 88 million mds s stock price closed at 5 78 which leaves it down 11 per cent year to date with a market capitalisation of 1 52 billion with a trailing twelve months earnings of 0 36 the price to earnings ratio is at 16 times we really want to get maximum returns for our shareholders and we have to grow the company we re not a small business anymore but we re not that gigantic enterprise we re now faced with largest companies in jamaica as our competitors boothe closed on the group s transition into a larger distribution business over the years

income is your friend brent nyitray bank of new york mellon bank of new york mellon operates under a different model than the typical commercial bank or investment bank it s a trust bank which means that it holds securities on behalf of customers its typical customer might be a mutual fund for which it will manage the investments and withdrawals handle fund accounting and provide other services while commercial banks generally make most of their income from taking deposits and making loans trust banks rely on fee income for a big part of their revenues if the u s economy is headed into rough waters then we should expect an increase in borrower delinquencies that would require the big commercial banks to take provisions for credit losses and eventually record write offs which would negatively impact their earnings this makes commercial banks much more economically sensitive than trust banks bank of new york mellon earned about 80 of its revenue from fees last year its main business is asset servicing which includes custody services fund accounting and data analytics it also has an investment services business that includes investment and wealth management and it owns

of its 26 years as a public company with its only bottom line contraction occurring during the great recession meanwhile it has an unbroken 27 year streak of dividend hikes putting it in the elite

sectors that are resilient in the face of economic downturns and relatively isolated from the pressures of e commerce businesses like grocery stores pharmacies automotive service centers and warehouses it utilizes long term net leases under which the tenants are responsible for maintenance building insurance and even real estate taxes these agreements often feature annual rental rate escalation clauses this combination enables realty income to collect steadily rising rental income meanwhile the company has a strong financial profile it has a rated credit and a fairly conservative dividend payout ratio for a reit of around 75 of its adjusted funds from operations because of this it has the financial flexibility to expand its portfolio even during economic downturns realty

anchorage alaska ap two russian indigenous siberians were so scared of having to fight the war in ukraine they chanced everything to take a small boat across the treacherous bering sea to reach american soil alaska s senior u s senator said after talking with the two the two identified as males by a resident landed earlier this month near gambell on alaska s st lawrence island in the bering strait where they asked for asylum they feared for their lives because of russia who is targeting minority populations for conscription into service in ukraine republican u s sen lisa murkowski said saturday during a candidate forum at the alaska federation of natives conference in anchorage it is very clear to me that these individuals were in fear so much in fear of their own government that they risked their lives and took a 15 foot skiff across those open waters murkowski said when answering a question about arctic policy it is clear that russian president vladimir putin is focused on a military conquest at the expense of his own people murkowski said he s got one hand on ukraine and he s got the other on the arctic so we have to be eyes wide open on the arctic murkowski said she met with the two siberians recently but didn t provide more details about exactly when or where the meeting took place or where their asylum process stood she was not available after the forum for follow up questions murkowski s office on oct 6 announced their request for asylum saying the men reportedly fled one of the coastal communities on russia s east coast a village elder in gambell 87 year old bruce boolowon is believed to be the last living alaska national guard member who helped rescue 11 u s navy men who were in a plane that was shot down by russian migs over the bering sea in 1955 the plane crash landed on st lawrence island gambell an alaska native community of about 600 people is about 36 miles 58 kilometers from russia s chukotka peninsula in siberia even though one of the russians spoke english pretty well two russian born women from gambell were brought in to translate both women married local men and became naturalized u s citizens said boolowon who is siberian yupik russians landing in gambell during the cold war was commonplace but the visits were not nefarious boolowon said since st lawrence island is so close to russia people routinely traveled back and forth to visit relatives but these two men seeking asylum were unknown to the people of gambell they were foreigners and didn t have any passports so they put them in jail he told the associated press last week the two men spent the night in the jailhouse but townspeople in gambell brought them food both alaska native dishes and items bought at a grocery store they were pretty full they ate a lot boolowon said the next day a coast guard c 130 with some officials came and picked them up he said adding that was the last he heard about the russians since then officials have been tight lipped the individuals were transported to anchorage for inspection which includes a screening and vetting process and then subsequently processed in accordance with applicable u s immigration laws under the immigration and nationality act was all a department of homeland security spokesman said in an email this past week when asked for an update on the asylum process and if and where the men were being held margaret stock an immigration attorney in anchorage said it s very unlikely information about the russians will ever be released the u s government is supposed to keep all of this confidential so i don t know why they would be telling anybody anything she told the ap instead it would be up to the two russians to publicize their situation which could put their families in russia at risk i don t know why they would want to do that stock said thousands of russian men fled the country after putin in september announced a mobilization to call up about 300 000 men with past military experience to bolster forces in ukraine messages sent last week and again on saturday to the russian consular office in san francisco were not returned
