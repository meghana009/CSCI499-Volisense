washington d c according to the federal bureau of investigation fbi murders in the u s rose by 30 percent from 2019 to 2020 the steepest ever one year increase the agency s annual uniform crime report released earlier this week detailed how more than 21 000 homicides were reported last year reaching its peak during the summer of the covid 19 pandemic violent crime also witnessed a rise of 5 percent between 2019 and 2020 however these figures are not comprehensive due to missing data as only 85 percent of law enforcement agencies submitted their crime related statistics in 2020 cnn reported several large metropolitan areas including new york chicago and new orleans also did not share their data another factor that could have led to less participation by agencies is the fact that the fbi recently changed its reporting system to the national incident based reporting system nibrs which requires police agencies to enter more specific details for each recorded offense a general rise in gun violence coincided with the rise in murders with mass unemployment school closures children confined at home and widespread panic over the pandemic causing social turmoil and possibly contributing to increased gun deaths including suicides according to the gun violence archive between 2019 and 2020 gun related fatalities rose by some 4 000 while police in many large cities are anticipating more homicides next year the rate of increase seems to be flattening and the overall crime rate has been declining over the past twenty years including in 2020 according to the fbi
telling water s story selling your story by jim lauria and adam tank why good storytelling is important for improving the state of municipal water service if long sales cycles give you nightmares the water industry will ensure you never sleep long utility planning discussions make 12 to 24 month sales cycles regulated rate structures and budgets can delay a deal by years as the utility and manufacturer wait for funds to become available and communications behind the transactions can be challenging as understaffed utilities get frustrated by a parade of new salespeople whose companies and their quarterly focused executives don t have the patience for but there are great opportunities for successful selling in the municipal utilities market at the heart of those opportunities is telling water s story good water storytelling helps manufacturers position their product sell the benefits and serve the customer but it goes much further good water storytelling in the sales process helps the utility explain to regulators and ratepayers why your product and theirs water itself is so important it could help shake loose funding from government and build support within the regulatory chain and good storytelling can generate enthusiasm among the public about technologies a utility is adopting as long as the story is easy for a layperson to understand the bottom line is that telling water s story helps build the public s perception of the value of water if people don t value water they don t support budget allocations and rate increases to pay for better technology water plays in this weird space in our lives where it s a right says reese tisdale ceo of bluefield research who was a guest on the water we talking about podcast on june 28 2021 i think people expect it but also people think that distribution and supply are free and the infrastructure is free which it is not adding to the challenge says tisdale is that the water industry tends to be invisible to most of the public it s out of sight out of mind for most people so the water industry as a whole kind of operates in the shadows he notes our job in the water industry is to bring the process out of the shadows and explain what s behind the water in the tap to increase the perception of the value of water and to provide the products services and support that help utilities source treat and deliver that water through our water we talking about podcast hosted by water online we have a unique opportunity to talk with some of the best storytellers in the water industry and share their insights with listeners in conversations with three leaders in the business we distilled several key lessons that can be applied to selling in the municipal utilities market tisdale s perspective informed by his analysis of the water industry on the challenges of telling a highly technical story is the first major lesson jeff hobbs former vice president of technology for san jose water and our water we talking about guest on may 26 2021 points out that utility staffs tend to be extremely small and extremely busy his department had 25 employees handling the technical needs of a utility that serves about 235 000 customers that s a pretty small department for what we re trying to handle hobbs told us i wanted to be able to trust my contractors my vendors hobbs points out that building that trust could be difficult especially when forced to continually tell his own story to new salespeople and that was doubly problematic when those salespeople didn t do their homework before calling on him we think it s a public agency but in many cases it s a public company that s very heavily regulated hobbs explains as he had to do countless times to green salespeople calling on him just a hint oftentimes an investor owned utility will have the word company in its name and a company almost always means that it s not an agency in the public sense go online just look at the website he urges do an about the company type of thing if someone s just hey i know you re on the nyse that s like alrighty you ve done at least some research that s already a step up on more than 95 percent of the people i ve talked to how your customer makes money use some of that research time to determine how your client makes its money with utilities it may not be as simple as just taking a margin on sales the vast majority of the business model from a private water utility is capital dollars the utility is granted an authorized rate of return every three years at least in california you can earn this much on this amount of capital dollars hobbs explains so where does your story fit into that investing in your technology or service could be part of your customer s profit picture but only if you time your pitch and transaction right you ve got to know what your customer s budgeting and rate case cycle is if you miss it today you may be on the bench for the next several years that s years of trying to keep on your customer s radar and keeping your sales manager at bay so you may have a great discount offer for a signature this year but you may be two years too early hobbs notes clockwise from left jim lauria adam tank and reese tisdale jeff hobbs left confers with adam tank and jim lauria jim lauria and adam tank talk with mae stevens another key audience government while you re working your way through your municipal or utility customer s budget cycle you could be doing him or her a favor by telling water s story to public officials the more elected officials and agency staffers understand the importance of your solutions the more support your customer is likely to get when it comes to allocating grants and support mae stevens vice president and chair of water practice for signal goup in washington dc is a go to lobbyist for the water industry and was our podcast guest on june 14 2021 she pointed out that we re fortunate to have some officials like u s epa principal deputy assistant administrator for water radhika fox former ceo of the water alliance who understands water and the water industry but there are many others who like the rest of the public just haven t heard our story yet people in washington don t understand what you need anybody whether it s water or any other sector of the economy unless you tell them stevens says they don t know what you want unless you ask for it just as important we need to understand their story too just as we need to understand our customers stories if you are in the water sector you need to understand what s going on in washington because it has a really significant impact on what you do back home wherever you are stevens says stevens emphasized that telling your story in washington and we can make the parallel at the state level is a process too your first call is going to end up at the desk of a young intern who can pass your message to a legislative aide who can ultimately deliver your perspective to the representative or senator over time a pressing story can evolve from a message to an issue to a policy to a piece of legislation and you can build a relationship with your elected representatives and their staffs as a valuable resource for understanding what s happening at ground level when change happens when allocations are made when a new system is installed to benefit ratepayers it s time to tell the public what happened make sure the public knows how its water system just improved and be sure to thank the officials who helped make it possible notes stevens thanking the public fuels the careers of elected officials if they do you a solid make sure you return the favor allies provide consistency telling your story over time and through different levels of government or a customer s organization can be a challenge especially when sales teams are often training grounds for rising stars who get shifted frequently to new roles look for representatives who can be your allies trade associations are an outstanding place to unite with others in the industry to zero in on messages and deliver your story from multiple angles to government and prospective customers on a more company focused level team up with manufacturers reps for equipment or value added resellers for software those organizations tend to have salespeople who stay in their positions for years building trusted relationships with their customers your customers they see all aspects of the utility s operation so they can present your product or service in context and at the right time in the procurement cycle and they have expertise not just in your technology but also the technologies around it in all it s a perfect setup to tell a great story tell your story loud when it comes to selling to municipalities and utility companies start with your story distill your messaging and keep it consistent learn your customer s needs not just in terms of technology but in terms of timing too use your story to help your customer gain the support of government and the public celebrate the wins and ally yourself with others who can help tell water s story i think for significant change to happen it takes leadership and it takes a sponsor within the organization to do it says tisdale be that leader be that sponsor and turn the water story into the story of your sales success

richer reviewed by experts trusted by millions of readers investors are facing several risks and worries including covid 19 and its variants inflation and interest rates in a conversation with bloomberg three wall street behemoths ark investment s cathie wood chief economic adviser to allianz se mohamed a el erian and chairman of guggenheim investments scott minerd shared their own concerns for the future stimulus update petition for a fourth stimulus state economic boosts golden state checks child tax credits impressive crypto trading hamster outperforms warren buffett cathie wood wood told bloomberg that deflation not inflation is the top risk adding that she is seeing three major deflationary forces brewing on the innovation side she noted that we re in a period today like we ve never been in you have to go back to the telephone electricity and automobile to see three major technologically enabled sources of innovation evolving at the same time today we have five platforms dna sequencing robotics energy storage artificial intelligence and blockchain technology all of which are deflationary she said the good news is that this is good deflation which causes a boom in economic activity at least where the innovation is taking place wood added the problem is this innovation is going to be very disruptive to the traditional world order but if disruptive innovation is evolving to such a rapid extent there s going to be disintermediation and disruption companies that have learned to satisfy short term shareholders who want their profits and want them now have been leveraging up to buy back shares and pay dividends companies haven t been investing enough in innovation and we re going to see a lot of carnage out there increasingly during the next five to 10 years more walmart goes on 150k employee hiring spree could perks to working there benefit you what worries mohamed el erian the most is inequality both within and across countries he told bloomberg and it s something that financial markets puts aside as a social problem not really an economic or financial problem and we ve risked seeing the issue of inequality gather momentum covid has already been the great un equalizer but rather than go back to where we ve come from we are now creating the dynamics for inequality to worsen and to assume greater importance in disrupting all sorts of things in our society he says el erian added that as we slowly emerge from the pandemic its aftermath creates different dynamics around the world if you re in a developing country today you can no longer assume that companies will come to you the onus is increasingly on you coming to the employer and that is the real issue when education is lagging when technology is lagging so i do worry that we re going to see this massive process get larger if we re not careful he noted that there s a correct notion that inequality can incentivize people to work harder and do better but there comes a point when it goes from encouraging people to do good things to actually detracting from not just economic well being but social and political well being i don t think the american dream is dead el erian said i think it s harder to achieve if you don t have the right education to begin with if you don t have a set of assets to begin with you re looking at a much steeper curve and that is a real problem for too many people related states and cities offering the best incentives to move there finally for guggenheim s minerd the number one risk is the sustainability of the global payment system he told bloomberg and i choose the word sustainability over the word vulnerability because the real key here is keeping the global payment system running and we ve had so many hacks terrorist attacks the colonial pipeline incident he clarified it would appear that we are extremely vulnerable to having an attack against the payment system of the financial markets and not just here in the u s but in europe he added that if there was a synchronized attack it would essentially bring the global financial market to its knees the first response would probably be that securities prices would crash and the second is we would probably have to close all the exchanges in the world in order to figure out how to restore the global payments system senior stimulus how an additional 1 400 check could help social security recipients afford rising grocery costs shutdown postponed senate house pass measure to fund government into december with hours to spare in addition minerd says he puts the probability of it happening as very high we need international cooperation to assess the risk and figure out how we can harden the system that exists in the short run and in the long run modernize it he added but that s going to take a new generation of technology and whether that s blockchain or whatever it needs to be modernized more from gobankingrates last updated september 30 2021
washington reuters the u s congress on thursday passed legislation to avert a government shutdown but another test of president joe biden s agenda lay ahead as the house of representatives prepared to vote on a 1 trillion infrastructure bill some progressive democrats vowed to vote against the bill to invest in the nation s roads bridges and other infrastructure angry that democrats have not yet reached agreement on a multi trillion dollar companion bill with funding for social services and to address climate change the house approved the measure to fund the government through dec 3 in a bipartisan 254 175 vote hours after it passed the senate 65 35 it will now go to biden for signing before funding runs out at midnight speaker of the house nancy pelosi confirmed the house will also vote thursday on the infrastructure bill despite fresh infighting between moderate and progressive democrats when reporters asked no 2 house democrat steny hoyer if he was confident that bill would pass in a thursday vote he had a one word reply nope failure to pass that measure would be a stinging setback for biden the infrastructure legislation has already passed the senate with republican and democratic support but it could fall victim to an impasse between democratic moderates and progressives over a larger bill that would bolster social services and tackle climate change lawmakers on the party s left flank have said they will not vote for the infrastructure bill unless they feel certain their priorities will be reflected in the social spending bill senator joe manchin a key democratic moderate with the power to block legislation in the senate said on thursday that bill should cost no more than 1 5 trillion far lower than the 3 5 trillion price tag floated by biden pelosi who had earlier promised moderates a vote on the smaller 1 trillion infrastructure bill this week said at a news conference that the party was in a good place but she declined to predict whether the measure would pass on thursday with razor thin majorities in congress democrats cannot afford to lose many votes if they want to pass their agenda and they are unlikely to win much support from house republicans eager to take back the majority in the 2022 midterm elections the stopgap spending bill approved in the senate would also provide aid for communities hard hit by hurricanes wildfires and other natural disasters money to help afghan refugees is included as well manchin s proposed price tag of 1 5 trillion was sure to rile progressives who initially proposed 6 trillion in new spending a group of protesters chanted manchin is a traitor while he spoke on thursday he said the bill should also help natural gas producers who have a large presence in his home state of west virginia that was sure to anger environmentalists who have urged a swift shift away from fossil fuels in the face of worsening climate change manchin also said lawmakers should first sort out what taxes are needed to cover the cost of new spending he said the differences could take weeks to resolve another democratic moderate senator kyrsten sinema declined to say whether she agreed with manchin s proposal she has met with biden multiple times to discuss the bill debt ceiling threat in yet another high stakes battle congressional democrats and republicans continued brawling over giving the treasury department additional borrowing authority beyond the current statutory limit of 28 4 trillion a historic u s debt default could occur around oct 18 treasury secretary janet yellen has estimated if congress fails to act republicans want no part of the debt limit increase saying it is democrats problem since they control congress and the white house the house late on wednesday approved a bill suspending the debt limit through december 2022 the senate could vote on it as early as next week senate majority leader chuck schumer said but republicans are expected to block it again yellen said on thursday it would be a catastrophe if congress does not raise the debt ceiling the uncertainty is starting to filter into financial markets though few believe the nation will ultimately default the looming debt crisis is rattling americans on both sides of the political spectrum according to an ipsos national opinion poll conducted for reuters on tuesday and wednesday it showed that 65 of adults including eight in 10 democrats and five in 10 republicans are very or somewhat concerned that congress will fail to reach a debt deal in time the poll also found that 30 think congressional republicans deserve the most blame if there is a government shutdown while 21 would blame democrats in congress and 16 would blame biden reporting by david morgan susan cornwell and richard cowan additional reporting by jarrett renshaw and chris kahn writing by andy sullivan editing by scott malone cynthia osterman and jonathan oatis

washington d c according to the federal bureau of investigation fbi murders in the u s rose by 30 percent from 2019 to 2020 the steepest ever one year increase the agency s annual uniform crime report released earlier this week detailed how more than 21 000 homicides were reported last year reaching its peak during the summer of the covid 19 pandemic violent crime also witnessed a rise of 5 percent between 2019 and 2020 however these figures are not comprehensive due to missing data as only 85 percent of law enforcement agencies submitted their crime related statistics in 2020 cnn reported several large metropolitan areas including new york chicago and new orleans also did not share their data another factor that could have led to less participation by agencies is the fact that the fbi recently changed its reporting system to the national incident based reporting system nibrs which requires police agencies to enter more specific details for each recorded offense a general rise in gun violence coincided with the rise in murders with mass unemployment school closures children confined at home and widespread panic over the pandemic causing social turmoil and possibly contributing to increased gun deaths including suicides according to the gun violence archive between 2019 and 2020 gun related fatalities rose by some 4 000 while police in many large cities are anticipating more homicides next year the rate of increase seems to be flattening and the overall crime rate has been declining over the past twenty years including in 2020 according to the fbi
the remains of a decapitated 13th century warrior were discovered in greece in the 1990s now his unique gold threaded jaw is revealing hippocratic ancient surgery secrets from 5th century bc thracian greece professor anagnostis agelarakis from adelphi university in new york discovered the byzantine warrior s jaw in 1991 at the polystylon fort archaeological site in western thrace greece in a 2017 paper published in the journal byzantina symmeikta the professor explained that in the early 1380s ad residents of polystylon made a stand against the ottoman turks who were encroaching upon their ancestral family lands it is believed that the wounded warrior was decapitated following the ottoman s capture of his fort now in a new study from agelarakis published in the september issue of the journal mediterranean archaeology and archaeometry the professor shows how the man s jaw was threaded with gold to help it heal this complicated and dangerous ancient surgery technique was developed in 5th century bc greece and reveals the medical methods that were available to the valuable and no doubt valiant broken jawed greek warrior long before he was decapitated for fighting for his family farm and freedom the ancient warrior s head which contained the evidence of hippocratic surgery was found in this child s grave in western greece in the 1990s the archaeologist who found it published his first research paper on it in 2017 and then this month published another one detailing the surgery anagnostis agelarakis mediterranean archaeology and archaeometry bizarre evidence of ancient surgery found in a child s grave after decades of speculation the new study determined that the 13th century people of the thracian polystylon fort did not submit peacefully to the invading ottoman forces the new analysis of the decapitated warrior confirms that a violent stand off took place agelarakis first detailed the burial in his 2017 paper in which he said the warrior wasn t given his own grave but was laid in the pre existing grave of a 5 year old child at the center of a 20 plot cemetery at polystylon fort while it is thought of as being highly probable it is unknown at present if the warrior and the child were related in his new paper published in the journal mediterranean archaeology and archaeometry professor agelarakis writes that after the warrior s head was relieved from its torso an unknown individual likely took the head and stealthily buried it given that the rest of the body was not recovered the warrior s head was probably snatched without the permission of the subjugators furthermore because the cranial cap and the jaw were discovered together it is believed that the man s head likely had soft tissues on it when it was buried in the mid 1380s said agelarakis a representative drawing of the dead greek warrior s head when it was lopped off by the ottomans anagnostis agelarakis mediterranean archaeology and archaeometry a sophisticated and flabbergasting medical discovery the new paper says the warrior died between the ages of 35 and 40 years old ten years previously around 1373 ad he experienced the devastating jaw fracture also described as a horrendous frontal impact the cause of the wound is unclear but the author suggests several possibilities such as a forceful fall while horseback riding a battle trauma from a thrust spearhead or another sharp hand held weapon or a ballistic projectile fueled by black powder professor agelarakis described the discovery of the nearly 650 year old warrior s healed jaw as a perfect example of the accuracy of an ancient medical professional it was discovered that the warrior s lower teeth had a line of dental calculus hardened plaque that accumulated around a thin wire that was threaded around the base of the man s teeth to help the jaw heal think about it six hundred and fifty years ago somebody successfully put the two major fragments of a smashed jaw back together it s very sophisticated it s flabbergasting the professor told live science moreover the 13th century greek physician who performed the ancient surgery clearly followed the medical advice laid out by hippocrates of kos the 5th century bc greek physician who is known to be the father of western medicine and its moral code a classical white marble bust of hippocrates isolated on black more than one thousand years before the important greek warrior with the wired jaw died hippocrates had already written that gold thread was perfect for joining facial bones mrakor adobe stock ancient medical solutions sorted medieval elites analysis of the tooth calculus showed no evidence of a silver copper or bronze wire having been used which leaves only gold thread this is precisely what hippocrates prescribed in the 5th century bc for assisting the healing of broken facial bones in conclusion receiving state of the art medical assistance having his food and drink prepared for him the latest research study says this man must have been a very important person professor agelarakis goes so far as to say the man might have been the military leader of the fort when those dark days descended on the fort in the 13th century when the ottoman forces darkened the horizon the warrior fought to save his family and fort then when the ottomans finally subjugated the fort the master of the family was beheaded and someone close to him grabbed his head and later buried it at the center of the fort with the unidentified 5 year old child top image the left side of this greek warrior s jaw was broken

i introduction on september 15 2021 the house ways and means committee approved tax provisions for proposed inclusion in the build back better act the bbba if enacted in their current form the proposals would among other things raise income tax rates for certain corporations and individuals raise the long term capital gains rate impose new limitations on interest deductions for large corporations increase u s taxes on foreign earnings of multinationals and further curtail the tax benefits of carried interests the bbba now heads to the house floor for consideration alongside the infrastructure investment and jobs act which the senate passed on august 10 and which would expand tax information reporting requirements for cryptocurrencies and other digital assets the bbba needs only a majority vote in each of the house and the senate to pass however several congressional democrats have expressed reservations about the bill in its current form this memorandum summarizes the tax proposals that are of most interest to u s corporate taxpayers financial institutions hedge funds private equity funds and their investors part ii discusses corporate tax measures part iii discusses individual and partnership tax measures ii corporate tax measures raise the corporate income tax rate the current federal corporate tax rate is 21 before the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tcja the highest marginal tax rate that applied to corporations was 35 the bbba would reintroduce graduated corporate income tax rates and apply a 26 5 marginal rate to income in excess of 5 million the benefit of graduated rates would be entirely phased out for corporations with income in excess of 10 million the proposal would be effective for tax years beginning after 2021 for non calendar year corporations the 2021 2022 tax rate would be 21 plus 5 5 times the portion of the tax year that occurs in 2022 limit deductions for disproportionate u s leverage under section 163 j enacted by the tcja u s corporations generally are allowed a deduction for business interest expense only to the extent that it exceeds their business interest income plus 30 of ebitda or ebit beginning after 2021 the bbba would further limit interest deductions of u s members of multinational groups that prepare consolidated financial statements if their net interest expense for financial reporting purposes exceeds 110 of their proportionate share determined based on their share of the group s ebitda of the net interest expense reported on those financial statements the proposal would be effective for tax years beginning after 2021 and would apply only to u s corporations whose average annual net interest expense determined on a three year rolling basis and taking into account all u s corporations in the group exceeds 12 million interest expense disallowed under either section 163 j or new section 163 n could be carried forward up to five years increase the gilti tax under the tcja u s corporations generally are taxed annually at a 10 5 rate increasing to 13 125 in 2026 on the excess of certain global intangible low tax income earned by their controlled foreign corporations cfcs over a 10 imputed return on depreciable tangible property held by the cfcs for tax years beginning after 2021 the bbba would increase the gilti tax rate to 16 5625 after accounting for the increase in corporate tax rates and replace the 10 imputed return with a 5 imputed return the bbba also would modify the gilti regime to operate on a country by country basis allow carryforwards of country specific gilti deductions and increase the foreign tax credit for gilti income under the tcja u s corporations generally are taxed annually at a 10 5 rate increasing to 13 125 in 2026 on the excess of certain global intangible low tax income earned by their controlled foreign corporations cfcs over a 10 imputed return on depreciable tangible property held by the cfcs for tax years beginning after 2021 the bbba would increase the gilti tax rate to 16 5625 after accounting for the increase in corporate tax rates and replace the 10 imputed return with a 5 imputed return the bbba also would modify the gilti regime to operate on a country by country basis allow carryforwards of country specific gilti deductions and increase the foreign tax credit for gilti income reduce the fdii deduction the tcja grants u s corporations a 37 5 deduction decreasing to 21 875 in 2026 for certain intangible income that they derive from exports so called foreign derived intangible income the bbba would reduce the deduction to 20 7 for tax years beginning after 2021 the tcja grants u s corporations a 37 5 deduction decreasing to 21 875 in 2026 for certain intangible income that they derive from exports so called foreign derived intangible income the bbba would reduce the deduction to 20 7 for tax years beginning after 2021 modify the beat under the tcja s base erosion and anti abuse tax corporations with average gross receipts exceeding 500 million are subject to a minimum tax add on generally equal to 10 increasing to 12 5 in 2026 multiplied by the excess by which their beat liability calculated by adding back certain deductible payments made to foreign affiliates exceeds their regular tax liability a de minimis exception generally allows up to 3 of a corporation s total deductions or 2 for groups that include banks and securities dealers to be made to foreign affiliates before the beat applies the bbba would increase the beat to 12 5 beginning in 2024 and 15 beginning in 2026 and would eliminate the de minimis exception beginning after 2021 curtail tax free spinoff monetization under current law subject to certain limitations a subsidiary spinco can issue debt securities to its parent corporation that the parent corporation can then distribute tax free to creditors in redemption of its own outstanding debt in connection with a spinoff of the spinco beginning after the date of its enactment the bbba generally would require the parent corporation to recognize gain to the extent that the amount of spinco debt that it transfers to its creditors exceeds 1 the aggregate basis in any assets it transfers to the spinco less 2 a any liabilities the spinco assumes from it and b any payments the spinco makes to it under current law subject to certain limitations a subsidiary spinco can issue debt securities to its parent corporation that the parent corporation can then distribute tax free to creditors in redemption of its own outstanding debt in connection with a spinoff of the spinco beginning after the date of its enactment the bbba generally would require the parent corporation to recognize gain to the extent that the amount of spinco debt that it transfers to its creditors exceeds 1 the aggregate basis in any assets it transfers to the spinco less 2 a any liabilities the spinco assumes from it and b any payments the spinco makes to it defer worthless stock deductions on subsidiary liquidations beginning after 2021 the bbba would defer a corporate parent s worthless stock loss on the liquidation of an insolvent subsidiary a so called granite trust transaction until the parent disposes of substantially all of the subsidiary s property to unrelated persons beginning after 2021 the bbba would defer a corporate parent s worthless stock loss on the liquidation of an insolvent subsidiary a so called granite trust transaction until the parent disposes of substantially all of the subsidiary s property to unrelated persons repeal cfc downward attribution taxpayers may be subject to adverse tax consequences including phantom income if they are 10 united states shareholders in a cfc very generally a cfc is any foreign corporation more than 50 of whose voting power or value is directly indirectly or constructively owned by 10 united states shareholders the tcja expanded constructive ownership to include downward attribution so that a subsidiary is deemed to own all of the stock owned by any 50 shareholder as a result of this expansion if for example a foreign parent owns a u s subsidiary and a foreign subsidiary the u s subsidiary is deemed to own all of the stock of the foreign subsidiary so that the foreign subsidiary is treated as a cfc which could have adverse tax consequences for any 10 united states shareholders of the parent even if 10 united states shareholders collectively own no more than 50 of the parent the bbba would repeal downward attribution retroactively as if the tcja had never introduced it and would instead more narrowly target the transactions that downward attribution was intended to address namely decontrol strategies effected in connection with corporate inversions the retroactive application of this change could motivate or require taxpayers to revisit closed transactions and possibly amend their tax returns limit the participation exemption to dividends from cfcs section 245a enacted by the tcja exempts u s corporations from tax on dividends paid by certain 10 owned foreign corporations even when the foreign corporations are not cfcs so that their earnings are not subject to current u s taxation under the subpart f and gilti regimes the bbba would limit the exemption to dividends paid by cfcs and would allow u s corporations to elect to treat certain foreign corporations as cfcs the proposal would apply retroactively to tax years beginning after 2017 section 245a enacted by the tcja exempts u s corporations from tax on dividends paid by certain 10 owned foreign corporations even when the foreign corporations are not cfcs so that their earnings are not subject to current u s taxation under the subpart f and gilti regimes the bbba would limit the exemption to dividends paid by cfcs and would allow u s corporations to elect to treat certain foreign corporations as cfcs the proposal would apply retroactively to tax years beginning after 2017 modify the portfolio interest exemption the broad portfolio interest exemption eliminates withholding tax on u s source interest paid to foreigners the exemption does not apply to 10 shareholders who instead are subject to withholding on interest at a 30 rate unless an income tax treaty provides otherwise under current law a 10 shareholder is a holder of at least 10 of the debtor corporation s voting power the bbba would amend the definition to include a holder of at least 10 of the value of the debtor corporation s stock thus large foreign shareholders of a domestic corporation would not be able to avoid withholding tax by holding low vote stock the amendment would apply to debt issued after the bbba s enactment iii individual and partnership tax measures increase the individual tax rate under the tcja the highest marginal federal income tax rate applicable to individuals is 37 increasing to 39 6 after 2025 the bbba would increase the rate to 39 6 for tax years beginning after 2021 in 2022 the rate generally would apply to taxable income over 450 000 for married individuals filing a joint return 425 000 for heads of households 400 000 for unmarried individuals and 225 000 for married individuals filing separately this rate increase results in a top marginal federal income tax rate of 46 4 when combined with the 3 8 tax on net investment income and the 3 surtax on high earners described below increase the maximum long term capital gains rate currently individuals are subject to a 20 maximum rate on long term capital gains and qualified dividends the bbba would increase the top rate to 25 for tax years ending after september 13 2021 unless the sale occurs in 2021 pursuant to a binding contract entered into on or before september 13 currently individuals are subject to a 20 maximum rate on long term capital gains and qualified dividends the bbba would increase the top rate to 25 for tax years ending after september 13 2021 unless the sale occurs in 2021 pursuant to a binding contract entered into on or before september 13 expand the 3 8 tax on net investment income currently limited partners who materially participate in a partnership s business are not subject to self employment tax and s corporation members who materially participate in an s corporation s business are subject to self employment tax only on reasonable compensation that they receive in their employee capacity these individuals also are exempt from the 3 8 tax on net investment income under section 1411 which currently applies only to certain passive income and gains for tax years beginning after 2021 the bbba would subject all trade or business income of individuals earning over 400 000 in the case of single filers or 500 000 in the case of joint filers to the net investment income tax unless that income is subject to self employment tax impose a 3 surtax on high income earners beginning after 2021 the bbba would impose a new 3 tax on a taxpayer s modified adjusted gross income in excess of 5 000 000 2 500 000 for a married individual filing separately beginning after 2021 the bbba would impose a new 3 tax on a taxpayer s modified adjusted gross income in excess of 5 000 000 2 500 000 for a married individual filing separately limit the qualified business income deduction under section 199a enacted by the tcja non corporate taxpayers may deduct up to 20 of 1 their income from a u s trade or business operated as a sole proprietorship or through a partnership s corporation trust or estate qualified business income and 2 their combined a qualified reit dividends very generally reit dividends that are subject to tax at ordinary income rates and b qualified publicly traded partnership income very generally their allocable share of the partnership s ordinary income beginning after 2021 the bbba would limit this deduction to 500 000 for joint filers 400 000 for unmarried individuals and 250 000 for married individuals filing separately modify the taxation of carried interests as we have previously discussed section 1061 enacted by the tcja imposes a three year holding period as a precondition to recognizing long term capital gains on carried interests issued to investment professionals and otherwise treats the capital gains as short term capital gains which are taxed at ordinary income rates the three year holding period is determined by reference to the owner of the asset sold whether the asset is the carried interest itself or an asset held by the partnership that issued the carried interest the bbba would significantly revise section 1061 for tax years beginning after 2021 under the bbba 1 a three year holding period would apply to real property businesses and to individual investment professionals with less than 400 000 of adjusted gross income and 2 otherwise a five year holding period would apply in each case the holding period would begin on the later of a the date the taxpayer acquired substantially all of the carried interest and b the date the partnership acquired substantially all of its assets the legislative text requires similar rules to apply to tiered partnerships the application of these rules is not at all clear the bbba would further require an investment professional to recognize gain on any transfer of its carried interest presumably even by gift or bequeath as we previously reported senate finance committee chair ron wyden has released a discussion draft of legislation that would repeal section 1061 and instead tax carried interest holders annually at ordinary interest rates on deemed compensation tax transfers between grantor trusts and owners the bbba would treat transfers between grantor trusts and their deemed owners as taxable exchanges by contrast under current law the deemed owners of a grantor trust are treated as if they already directly owned the trust s assets in addition to having far reaching estate planning consequences this provision of the bbba could be detrimental to the leveraged finance industry because many securitizations and other borrowing transactions are effected by 1 one or more taxpayers contribution of a pool of assets to a grantor trust in exchange for ownership certificates and 2 the grantor trust s issuance of debt securities backed by the pool of assets the proposal would apply to grantor trusts formed on or after the bbba s enactment and to any portion of a grantor trust attributable to a contribution made on or after the bbba s enactment expand the wash sale rules section 1091 a currently disallows a deduction for a loss realized from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities or contracts to buy or sell stock or securities if within thirty days the taxpayer acquires substantially identical stock or securities or contracts beginning after 2021 the bbba would expand the scope of the wash sale rules to include foreign currencies commodities digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and contracts to buy or sell these assets business needs exception the wash sale rules would not apply to foreign currency and commodity trades that are directly related to the taxpayer s business needs other than the business of trading currencies or commodities or are part of certain identified hedging transactions the lack of a business needs exception for digital assets could be problematic for businesses that transact in these assets although a number of commentators believe that bitcoin and ether are commodities if the bbba were enacted in its current form commodity traders that have not already done so might want to consider making an election under section 475 to mark to market their assets each year and treat any resulting gain or loss as ordinary in nature the wash sale rules do not apply to mark to market taxpayers related parties the wash sale rules also would apply when a related party acquires substantially identical specified assets within the thirty day wash sale window for this purpose related parties generally include 1 the taxpayer s spouse and dependents 2 individuals or entities that control or are controlled by the taxpayer or the taxpayer s spouse or dependents and 3 certain retirement and tax advantaged accounts of the taxpayer or the taxpayer s spouse or dependents basis adjustment the bbba would preserve any losses disallowed by the wash sale rules on an acquisition by the taxpayer or the taxpayer s spouse by adding the disallowed losses to the acquirer s basis in the asset however losses disallowed as a result of other related party acquisitions would be permanently disallowed limit gain exclusion on sales of qualified small business stock section 1202 currently allows noncorporate taxpayers to exclude up to 100 of their gain on a sale of certain qualified small business stock held for more than five years the bbba would eliminate the 100 exclusion rate for individuals with adjusted gross income of at least 400 000 and for all trusts and estates instead these taxpayers would be eligible for only up to a 50 exclusion this change would apply for sales occurring on or after september 13 2021 unless the sale occurs in 2021 pursuant to a binding contract entered into on or before september 13 section 1202 currently allows noncorporate taxpayers to exclude up to 100 of their gain on a sale of certain qualified small business stock held for more than five years the bbba would eliminate the 100 exclusion rate for individuals with adjusted gross income of at least 400 000 and for all trusts and estates instead these taxpayers would be eligible for only up to a 50 exclusion this change would apply for sales occurring on or after september 13 2021 unless the sale occurs in 2021 pursuant to a binding contract entered into on or before september 13 withhold on partnership derivatives section 871 m currently imposes a 30 withholding tax on u s source dividend equivalent payments under securities loans repos and certain high delta swaps and other derivatives the bbba would expand the withholding tax to income equivalent payments under repos and high delta swaps on 1 publicly traded partnerships and 2 any other partnership as the secretary by regulation may prescribe an income equivalent payment would be any payment that is determined by reference to income or gain in respect of the partnership or any other payment that the irs determines is substantially similar the bbba provides that any income equivalent payment would be treated as a dividend paid by a u s corporation and the rate of tax imposed on nonresident aliens and foreign corporations would not be less than the rate that would be imposed with respect to a dividend from a domestic corporation in which the foreigner owned less than 1 of the stock by vote or value presumably this means that nonresident aliens and foreign corporations qualifying for the benefits of an income tax treaty would have to use the treaty s default dividend withholding rate instead of a lower rate that might apply to larger shareholders the bbba s proposal would be very difficult for taxpayers to administer a partnership discloses an investor s allocable share of u s source dividends on schedule k 1 the partnership is not required to provide schedule k 1 to investors until the due date for filing the partnership s tax return which may be later than the date that payments are required to be made on a repo or swap that references the partnership moreover the payer under a repo or a swap might not actually own the referenced partnership interest and thus might not even have access to the partnership s schedule k 1 accordingly parties might have to avoid entering into repos and swaps that reference partnership interests feel compelled to over withhold on those repos or swaps or demand indemnification for any liability they incur for under withholding modify the rules for worthless partnership interests subject to satisfying certain evidentiary burdens taxpayers may claim a deduction under current section 165 a for partnership equity that becomes worthless during the taxable year taxpayers typically treat partnership equity worthlessness deductions as capital losses if they have a share of partnership liabilities because a shift of partnership liabilities in connection with a partner s departure results in a deemed sale but otherwise claim ordinary losses beginning after 2021 the bbba would apply deemed sale treatment to all partnership equity worthlessness deductions so that taxpayers would have capital losses instead of ordinary losses except to the extent the deemed sale is attributable to inventory or other hot assets the bbba also would revise section 165 g which governs deductions for worthless corporate securities to treat partnership debt as securities and to treat all worthless securities deductions as arising at the time of the identifiable event establishing worthlessness instead of at the end of the year

opec is likely to stick to an existing deal to add 400 000 barrels per day bpd to its output for november when it meets next week sources said despite oil hitting a three year high above 80 a barrel and pressure from consumers for more supply the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and allies led by russia known as opec agreed in july to increase production by 400 000 bpd each month to phase out 5 8 million bpd in cuts it also agreed to assess the deal in december so far we will keep the plan to increase by 400 000 bpd one of the sources said opec which has held regular meetings agreed in september to continue with its existing plans for an october output rise the opec joint technical committee jtc which met on wednesday sees the oil market in a 1 4 million bpd surplus next year under its base scenario slightly below the previous forecast of 1 6 million bpd a presentation seen by reuters showed in opening remarks to the jtc opec secretary general mohammad barkindo said the current opec deal is helping to keep the oil market balanced from where we stand today the opec and non opec ministerial decisions to begin returning 400 000 bpd to the market each month continue to help balance the need for incremental increases to address demand while guarding against the potential for supply overhangs he said according to opec s twitter nyse twtr account the jtc sees the oil market in a 1 1 million bpd deficit this year assuming demand growth of about 6 million bpd it assumes demand growth of 4 2 million bpd next year the sources said opec ministers who meet online on monday would consider the jtc s findings before making a final decision brent oil rose to a three year high above 80 a barrel on tuesday boosted by unplanned outages in the united states and a strong demand recovery after the pandemic hammering prices were trading just below 80 on wednesday the white house which in august raised concerns about high prices said on tuesday it was in communication with opec and looking at how to address the cost of oil india the world s third biggest oil importer and consumer signalled on tuesday that a spike in crude prices would speed up the transition to alternative energy sources energy ministers from opec members iraq nigeria and the united arab emirates said in recent weeks the group saw no need to take extraordinary measures to change the existing agreement the jtc s agenda includes compliance with existing cuts which stood at 116 in august meaning the group is cutting more than planned with several members facing domestic constraints on increasing output this points to a tighter oil market opec members nigeria and angola major african oil exporters will struggle to boost production to their opec quota levels until at least next year because of underinvestment and maintenance issues sources said this means any major output increase by the group would have to rely on producers with spare capacity such as saudi arabia and the united arab emirates barclays lon barc said the demand recovery would outpace opec moves to taper its curbs due partly to limited capacity of some producers in the group to ramp up output which is likely to drive the inventory cushion to the lowest level in decades source reuters by ahmad ghaddar olesya astakhova and alex lawler
henrico county based tobacco giant altria group inc has been hit with a legal ruling that could crash the rollout of its iqos device an alternative to conventional cigarettes the u s international trade commission ruled wednesday that altria and its former subsidiary philip morris international must halt imports and sales of the iqos device because it infringes two patents held by their top competitor winston salem n c based r j reynolds tobacco co the iqos is a battery powered device that heats tobacco instead of burning it the device is part of a larger strategy by altria to expand its product portfolio and introduce alternatives to conventional cigarettes as smoking rates decline altria the parent company of top u s cigarette maker philip morris usa has been selling the iqos device in the u s since 2019 under an exclusive agreement with philip morris international philip morris international which was spun off as a separate company from altria in 2008 and does business only in overseas markets first introduced the device in 2014 a complaint filed in april 2020 claims that the iqos device infringes on patents held by r j reynolds parent company british american tobacco plc that were issued by the u s patent and trademark office between november 2012 and december 2019 the itc s ruling now goes into an administrative review process which is expected to take 60 days and could overturn the decision we re disappointed with the itc s decision to impose an exclusion order that prohibits the importation of iqos and to issue a cease and desist order altria said in a statement we continue to believe rjr s patents are invalid and that iqos does not infringe those patents we expect to continue marketing and selling iqos in its current geographies throughout the administrative review period the company said we re working with pmi on contingency plans altria spokesman david sutton said thursday that the company had no other comment at this time beyond its statement shares in altria fell 6 61 or 3 22 in heavy trading to close thursday at 45 52 philip morris international stock dropped 4 72 to close 94 79 the iqos product was first introduced in the u s in the atlanta area in 2019 as part of what was expected to eventually be a national rollout altria introduced it for sale in the richmond area later that year and in charlotte n c early in 2020 in november 2019 altria opened a store on west cary street in richmond s carytown area dedicated to selling iqos and the replaceable heat sticks that contain tobacco and go into the device altria did not say this week specifically how the ruling might impact its iqos retail stores r j reynolds hailed the itc decision saying in a statement that infringement of our intellectual property undermines our ability to invest and innovate and thereby reduce the health impact of our business we will therefore defend our ip robustly across the globe iqos is a key part of both altria and philip morris international s plans to introduce products that are potentially less hazardous than traditional tobacco products in july 2020 the u s food and drug administration allowed altria to sell iqos as a modified risk product meaning the company can communicate to consumers that iqos offers reduced levels of harmful and potentially harmful chemicals however the fda also said more research is needed and the designation does not mean consumers should consider the product safe the itc s ruling on wednesday won t have an immediate impact on altria s overall sales because iqos is still a small part of the company s portfolio but the ruling is a setback for what had been a positive long term outlook for iqos said michael lavery a research analyst who follows the tobacco industry for investment banking firm piper sandler contingency plans are not yet clear but we do not expect altria to consider paying a royalty to bat and u s production certainly for the devices is unlikely to be ready within 60 days lavery said in a research note to investors production of heat sticks for existing products potentially could be moved to the u s in that time period he said altria potentially could appeal the itc s ruling to the u s court of appeals some analysts noted though a court challenge could take years david sweanor a professor of law at the university of ottawa and a tobacco control advocate who favors policies that push smokers toward less toxic nicotine products said the ruling is a further barrier to consumers accessing less hazardous alternatives to cigarettes he noted that iqos is one of the only products that was able to get through the fda labyrinth this litigation is also a continuation of big tobacco treating less toxic products as simply another area of competition no different from another cigarette brand rather than a fundamental obligation of the companies to reduce harm for their consumers he said gregory conley president of the american vaping association took a public health approach to his criticism of the itc decision by potentially denying them the opportunity to switch to a harm reduction production iqos the real losers of this protracted court battle could end up being american adult smokers conley said patent wars are inevitable in every new technology area but usually there is another similar product that current or future consumers could use instead in the u s market iqos is currently the only heat not burn device cleared for sale he said while some may use vaping snus or pouches in the absence of iqos far too many american adults will choose to just smoke cigarettes instead
the 2021 federal duck stamp art contest was in full swing saturday on the east coast when brothers joe bob and jim hautman pulled in their decoys from a slough in central minnesota to wrap up their season opening hunt they bagged just one wood duck by 9 a m but the day s biggest prize was still up in the air as judges zeroed in on finalists jim of chaska and bob of delano were tied for first place it was a showdown between jim s evocative painting of two redheads bobbing in 3 foot waves and bob s striking painting of airborne ross s geese preparing to land once home they watched a live video stream from the u s fish and wildlife service to see jim declared winner and six time champion of the nation s most prestigious wildlife art competition bob with three titles of his own finished second joe hautman a five time federal duck stamp winner and the eldest of the three anticipated finishing in the top six it s pretty amazing i can t believe i ve been doing this for more than 30 years jim hautman said this week in an interview the victory over a field of 137 entries including a few mock paintings snuck in by british american comedian john oliver sets up another significant payday for the youngest hautman brother the 57 year old career artist from chaska will cash in all year by selling limited edition prints and other reproductions of the winning stamp sold for 25 each the stamps double as collectors items and mandatory add ons to waterfowl hunting licenses each year the sales raise some 40 million for wetland conservation and wildlife management jim hautman is the first artist to win the contest six times it began in 1934 if you win you become a publisher promoter vendor and a public speaker hautman said i m no good at any of those art broker russ fink of virginia a biographer of all federal duck stamp winners said it s not a surprise that the hautman brothers have grown to dominate the competition not only are they highly skilled painters but as avid hunters and outdoorsmen they create life like intricate designs that resonate with duck stamp enthusiasts throughout the land they know what people want in a duck stamp he said the hautmans are just the cream of the crop fink said i love seeing them win this thing over the years the fish and wildlife service has turned to fink as a consultant for the duck stamp contest and he has seen his share of pretentious winners all of a sudden they ve got a halo and they think they re god s chosen people fink said the hautmans are the salt of the earth all together they are the nicest group of guys you ever want to deal with and they re good for the industry under federal duck stamp rules winning artists aren t eligible to rejoin the contest for the next three years a reprieve that jim hautman said he welcomes typically for him painting an entry for the contest requires a month of deadline painting day and night completely engulfed it s kind of fun he said an excuse to blow everything else off because you re working on something big if the effort brings a win the achievement demands a year of attention that includes travel public appearances media calls and the appreciation of patrons i enjoy the 3 year wait because it s an exhausting year hautman said when the post victory dust settles he s ready to chill and paint at his own pace for two years jim hautman s latest duck stamp masterpiece flowed from his fondness of redheads it was one of five species artists could highlight in this year s contest the others were king eider blue winged teal greater white fronted goose and ross s goose the redhead jumped out hautman said i just think they are really cool ducks that red head is just so striking after toying with a design of three flying redheads hautman opted to stage a hen and drake riding on the peak of a wave in churning greenish lake water dark clouds are heaped on the horizon in late afternoon while a sharp angle of sunshine glints off the ducks faces they appear to be watching two hunters and a dog in the distance heading home in a skiff i was happy with the way it came out he said in the sales heyday of wildlife painting a federal duck stamp design routinely earned the winner millions of dollars fink said the market in those years starting in the mid 1970s was juiced by speculators who bought multiple prints in hopes of reselling them at higher prices like stocks the investment matrix collapsed when the market became flooded with prints hautman said wildlife painting is less lucrative these days but still anchored by a healthy core of dedicated federal duck stamp collectors who traditionally pair a stamp with a limited edition print currently winning artists normally produce 10 500 copies for limited edition sales those prints in the past few years have steadily fetched 185 each unframed and without a stamp the hautman family s involvement in the scene dates back to the very beginning when the late thomas tuck hautman began collecting federal duck stamps in the program s maiden year thomas hautman an attorney also tried his hand at wildlife painting his wife elaine was an artist herself they also instilled the values of hunting and fishing in their seven children jim said he remembers fall trips to an uncle s cabin on lake vermilion where he and his siblings first started hunting ducks at age 16 often on beaver ponds starting at age 13 they d hunt for deer in the area s woods with bows and arrows our trip in the fall was our highlight of the year he said the children grew up in the same st louis park neighborhood that gave rise to hollywood filmmakers joel and ethan coen in the movie fargo police chief marge gunderson s husband norm is a wildlife artist who naturally loses a duck stamp competition to the hautmans aww hon you re better than them marge consoles jim hautman was 25 when he painted his first federal duck stamp in 1989 making him the youngest artist at that time to ever win his brother joe a physicist followed up two years later with the family s second winning design all in all joe bob and jim have painted 14 federal duck stamps while showing no signs of quitting starting in 2015 with joe s flight of swans they swept the contest three consecutive years combined with jim s geese at sunset in 2016 and bob s mallards in 2017 this was the first year all three of them were back in the contest together we have our own little rivalry going so it s fun joe said finishing in second place in the federal contest like bob did this year is the most painful jim said that s because the runner up provides no commercial payback while the artist becomes tortured by self evaluation the reward is pretty much like last place and you start to second guess the little things that might have put you over the top jim said the brothers have a duck hunting trip planned later this month in north dakota a replacement for what had become an annual elk hunting trip in montana the elk hunt lost appeal when grizzly bears attacked other hunters in the same area jim said he said his next painting project is already underway a ruffed grouse he intends to bag one this fall for table fare as well as a study of the bird s feathers grouse is a complicated bird it s a tough one to paint he said

builder covid 19 update where do we go from here zonda s ali wolf and tim sullivan expect the economy to continue to grow but at a decelerating pace and not without its risks adobe stock as of now the economy is in a state of flux according to ali wolf chief economist at zonda during the latest covid 19 update webinar the stock market is moving up and down consumer confidence has fallen to a seven month low worries about inflation are rising and the specter of potential government shutdown has loomed over the past week the biggest question on the economic front is where do we go from here says wolf there s so many moving parts there s good news we re growing there s bad news there s uncertainty there s volatility for any of us trying to forecast how do you make sense of it while wolf expects the economy to continue to grow her prediction is that the pace of that growth will decelerate the apparent end of stimulus checks also signals the end of the blockbuster numbers associated with a large economic cash flow and job recovery is expected to come in fits and starts with a full recovery expected within 14 to 18 months risks include the influence of federal policy the emergence of variants inflation and access to labor nonfarm payroll employment which rose steadily by almost a million jobs per month at the beginning of the summer only rose by 235 000 jobs in august a drop attributed to the delta variant surge professional and business services led employment growth while leisure and hospitality which had been growing remained unchanged in august total nonfarm payroll numbers are still down by 5 3 million workers from march 2020 wolf notes that residential is near fully recovered up almost 80 000 workers since february 2020 with 320 000 job openings in the construction sector inflation concerns looking at year over year changes the latest data shows a 3 6 inflation growth albeit growth that is presently leveling off as compared with a healthy 2 average goal the sectors with the largest two year changes in inflation include food motor vehicles and fuel furniture and appliances sectors strongly impacted by covid according to wolf based on the data and analysis available economists are divided on whether the present inflationary environment will be transient or longstanding one way or another rising inflation poses a risk for the economy and for housing in particular given its influence on interest rates wolf says that the fed anticipates that inflation will fall back down to 2 but are not clear on how quickly that will occur among the indicators the fed is using to monitor this prediction are rent growth spending on goods versus services particularly as supply chain bottlenecks delay goods whether wage gains are raising the prices of goods and services and inflation expectations are we in a bubble as outlined in wolf s recent opinion piece in fortune magazine one of the most frequent questions she receives is whether or not the economy is presently in a bubble much as it was before the great recession as wolf defines a bubble a condition where the price of an asset is rising faster than fundamentals can justify then suddenly falling faster than fundamentals she does not believe these conditions are being met rising prices alone she says are not a sign of a bubble given the question of whether today s home prices are justifiable wolf cites strong demographics rising wealth accumulation low inventory high migration low interest rates and strong financial safeguards as fundamental price drivers as an example millennials are presently in their peak home buying age bracket and the financial conditions of the pandemic have enabled them to save more and defer student loan payments without consequence giving them more money for a down payment at the same time baby boomers and gen xers who already own homes have gained equity in the tens of thousands one strong argument against a bubble is the financial safeguards put in place following the great recession mortgage credit availability has fallen from astronomical highs in 2007 to a relative low in the years following this means that buyers qualifying for mortgages are usually coming in with great credit scores and low debt to income ratios however justification by fundamentals does not indicate a healthy market cities like boise idaho phoenix riverside california tampa and raleigh north carolina have seen price growth between 20 and 50 yoy unhealthy signs include the return of investors bidding wars fear of missing out and the looming specters of rising interest rates and the end of qualified buyer demand real time housing stats while new home sales have fallen by 14 yoy the comparison is apples to oranges according to zonda senior managing principal tim sullivan this time last year community counts were higher vacant developed lots were more available demand was far stronger and sales caps were not in place over 90 of respondents to zonda s builder survey report executing on some kind of supply control in their sales strategy according to zonda s regular builder survey the present seasonal conditions are giving some crews time to catch up on their work but cycle times are still heavily stretched pricing is plateauing in some areas and incentives are back for some communities markets and builders community count is expected to rise slightly toward the end of the year and supply chain delays and slower lot deliveries are among the biggest challenges at present base price increases are beginning to plateau 38 of builders reported they have not raised base prices in september while almost half said they raised base prices by 5 000 or less eighty two percent of builders reported labor shortages up from 69 last month and 54 cited land disruptions up from 40 last month supply shortages across a large number of product categories are creating construction delays at different stages a full 60 of builders reported delays in receiving windows and doors while 35 reported delays in garage doors 29 in hvac equipment and 28 in appliances forty six percent of builders said sales were flat month to

washington d c according to the federal bureau of investigation fbi murders in the u s rose by 30 percent from 2019 to 2020 the steepest ever one year increase the agency s annual uniform crime report released earlier this week detailed how more than 21 000 homicides were reported last year reaching its peak during the summer of the covid 19 pandemic violent crime also witnessed a rise of 5 percent between 2019 and 2020 however these figures are not comprehensive due to missing data as only 85 percent of law enforcement agencies submitted their crime related statistics in 2020 cnn reported several large metropolitan areas including new york chicago and new orleans also did not share their data another factor that could have led to less participation by agencies is the fact that the fbi recently changed its reporting system to the national incident based reporting system nibrs which requires police agencies to enter more specific details for each recorded offense a general rise in gun violence coincided with the rise in murders with mass unemployment school closures children confined at home and widespread panic over the pandemic causing social turmoil and possibly contributing to increased gun deaths including suicides according to the gun violence archive between 2019 and 2020 gun related fatalities rose by some 4 000 while police in many large cities are anticipating more homicides next year the rate of increase seems to be flattening and the overall crime rate has been declining over the past twenty years including in 2020 according to the fbi

the stock was taken down in sympathy with another retailer what happened shares of the container store tcs 1 94 fell sharply on thursday losing as much as 15 earlier in the session ultimately ending the day down 14 6 there didn t appear to be any company specific news driving down the organization and storage products retailer but evidence suggests that comments made by the executive from another home goods retailer brought down the container store as well so what bed bath beyond bbby reported its second quarter financial results after the market close on wednesday and the results were dismal the company missed analysts consensus estimates on both the top and bottom lines while that was bad enough the home furnishings retailer also slashed its full year profit forecast on the q2 earnings conference call management cited unprecedented supply chain challenges caused by external disruptive forces bed bath beyond also blamed a rise in covid 19 cases in three key states florida texas and california as negatively impacting revenue it s just gotten significantly tougher in the last couple of months late into the quarter said ceo mark triton so what does all this have to do with the container store in a nutshell the challenges that bed bath beyond laid out could be true for many retailers the results show that freight costs are eating into the company s profit margins a paradigm that s likely to bleed over into other similarly situated retailers the container store has yet to report its second quarter results having ended its fiscal first quarter on july 3 if the timing cited by triton is accurate it suggests the container store might be experiencing the same issues reported by bed bath beyond but investors won t know for sure until it reports in early november now what the all important holiday season is just months away and retailers are already feeling the pinch we ve been hearing about freight costs and supply chain issues for some time now investors fear that the container store may get caught up by the same challenges that said for investors with a sufficiently longtime horizon disappointing results in a single quarter if they materialize shouldn t change the investing thesis for the container store

necoclí colombia this town s caribbean beaches used to fill up with tourists but there s no longer room instead thousands of haitian migrants who can t afford the hotels have pitched tents on just about every patch of sand nearly 20 000 haitians who are on their way to the united states are now holed up in necoclí forming a human bottleneck even bigger than the recent migrant logjams on the u s mexican border bruno noel got to necoclí two weeks ago with his wife and 6 month old son and notes his many compatriots speaking haitian creole on the boardwalk this is like a smaller version of haiti he quips lacking visas noel and other haitians are taking a roundabout overland route to get to the u s many moved to brazil chile and other south american nations following haiti s devastating 2010 earthquake but now that countries in the region have eased pandemic travel restrictions throngs of haitians are heading north many believe they will have a better chance to get into the u s and to stay there now that donald trump has been replaced in the white house by president biden donald trump lost the election so i m giving it a try says noel 34 who spent the last five years in brazil working in a hotel laundry room it s an exhausting trip that can take months as migrants board buses and taxis and hitchhike through as many as a dozen countries their progress comes to a temporary halt in necoclí a town in northern colombia that lies near the border with panama there are no roads connecting the two countries which are separated by the vast darién jungle parts of which are controlled by bandits and drug trafficking gangs the only way migrants can continue their journey to panama and eventually the u s is to take an hourlong boat ride across the gulf of urabá to a spot near the panamanian border then hike through the jungle for up to 10 days to cross the darién gap more than 88 500 migrants have entered panama through the darién so far this year according to the panamanian immigration department which didn t specify travelers nationalities panama is officially allowing just 500 haitians per day to enter the country from colombia so colombian officials allow just 500 migrants per day to board the boats in necoclí as a result the ferry service can t keep pace with the swelling number of migrants arriving in necoclí many many many migrants up to 1 000 are showing up here every day says césar zúñiga the official in charge of emergency management for necoclí many must wait up to a month for a seat at the town s main pier dockworkers try to keep order as hundreds of haitians demand tickets or try to talk their way onto boats that are already fully booked we have eight boats but that s not enough said andrés vargas manager of the main ferry service in necoclí as he keeps a wary eye on the growing crowd of migrants colombian immigration officials also keep watch over the haitians nearly all of whom sneaked into the country but zúñiga says there s no effort to arrest or deport them because they don t intend to stay and the government prefers that they pay their own way out of the country referring to the migrants eventual departure from necoclí to the darien jungle that awaits them zúñiga says we get rid of one problem but at what cost they have to spend up to 10 days in the jungle at the mercy of wild animals and other dangers carlos camargo the colombian government s human rights ombudsman estimates that 19 000 haitians are now camped out in necoclí nearly doubling the town s population for many businesses this influx has produced a bonanza as the migrants stock up on food clothes and camping gear and some rent rooms in private homes or hotels which are now full all this has helped local merchants recover from the economic meltdown caused by covid 19 jairo soto says he was forced to shut down his store for five months during the pandemic but now does a brisk business selling machetes rubber boots jeans and t shirts to the migrants óscar hernández who owns a perfume store says haitians account for 80 of his sales and that he now has a full collection of gourdes the haitian currency courtesy of his migrant customers i thank god because everyone is benefitting from this he says but the town s infrastructure is at a breaking point it now has a water shortage and its only hospital has been overwhelmed with up to 60 sick haitians arriving per day according to wilfredo menco zapata a local human rights official some necoclí residents have been expelled from their apartments by landlords looking to make quick cash by offering rooms to haitians for about 10 per night meanwhile businesses that depend on tourism are suffering at her beach side fish restaurant felicia ospino is frying sea bass for a few customers normally the two dozen tables are full at lunchtime but the dining room is nearly empty she complains that the migrants who have occupied the beaches and have produced growing piles of trash have scared away tourists ever since so many haitians arrived tourism has disappeared she says it s a total mess some town officials predict that the biden administration s efforts to deport newly arrived haitians from the u s will halt the flow of migrants passing through necoclí but for now their numbers keep growing copyright 2024 npr to see more visit missing some content care to comment check the

washington congress on thursday sept 30 passed legislation to avert a government shutdown but another test of president joe biden s agenda lay ahead as the house of representatives prepared to vote on a 1 trillion infrastructure bill some progressive democrats vowed to vote against the bill to invest in the nation s roads bridges and other infrastructure angry that democrats have not yet reached agreement on a multi trillion dollar companion bill with funding for social services and to address climate change the house approved the measure to fund the government through dec 3 in a bipartisan 254 175 vote hours after it passed the senate 65 35 it will now go to biden for signing before funding runs out at midnight speaker of the house nancy pelosi confirmed the house will also vote thursday on the infrastructure bill despite fresh infighting between moderate and progressive democrats when reporters asked no 2 house democrat steny hoyer if he was confident that bill would pass in a thursday vote he had a one word reply nope advertisement failure to pass that measure would be a stinging setback for biden the infrastructure legislation has already passed the senate with republican and democratic support but it could fall victim to an impasse between democratic moderates and progressives over a larger bill that would bolster social services and tackle climate change lawmakers on the party s left flank have said they will not vote for the infrastructure bill unless they feel certain their priorities will be reflected in the social spending bill sen joe manchin a key democratic moderate with the power to block legislation in the senate said on thursday that bill should cost no more than 1 5 trillion far lower than the 3 5 trillion price tag floated by biden pelosi who had earlier promised moderates a vote on the smaller 1 trillion infrastructure bill this week said at a news conference that the party was in a good place but she declined to predict whether the measure would pass on thursday with razor thin majorities in congress democrats cannot afford to lose many votes if they want to pass their agenda and they are unlikely to win much support from house republicans eager to take back the majority in the 2022 midterm elections the stopgap spending bill approved in the senate would also provide aid for communities hard hit by hurricanes wildfires and other natural disasters money to help afghan refugees is included as well manchin s proposed price tag of 1 5 trillion was sure to rile progressives who initially proposed 6 trillion in new spending a group of protesters chanted manchin is a traitor while he spoke on thursday he said the bill should also help natural gas producers who have a large presence in his home state of west virginia that was sure to anger environmentalists who have urged a swift shift away from fossil fuels in the face of worsening climate change advertisement manchin also said lawmakers should first sort out what taxes are needed to cover the cost of new spending he said the differences could take weeks to resolve another democratic moderate sen kyrsten sinema declined to say whether she agreed with manchin s proposal she has met with biden multiple times to discuss the bill debt ceiling threat in yet another high stakes battle congressional democrats and republicans continued brawling over giving the treasury department additional borrowing authority beyond the current statutory limit of 28 4 trillion a historic u s debt default could occur around oct 18 treasury secretary janet yellen has estimated if congress fails to act republicans want no part of the debt limit increase saying it is democrats problem since they control congress and the white house the house late on wednesday approved a bill suspending the debt limit through december 2022 the senate could vote on it as early as next week senate majority leader chuck schumer said but republicans are expected to block it again yellen said on thursday it would be a catastrophe if congress does not raise the debt ceiling the uncertainty is starting to filter into financial markets though few believe the nation will ultimately default the looming debt crisis is rattling americans on both sides of the political spectrum according to an ipsos national opinion poll conducted for reuters on tuesday and wednesday it showed that 65 of adults including eight in 10 democrats and five in 10 republicans are very or somewhat concerned that congress will fail to reach a debt deal in time advertisement the poll also found that 30 think congressional republicans deserve the most blame if there is a government shutdown while 21 would blame democrats in congress and 16 would blame biden reporting by david morgan susan cornwell and richard cowan additional reporting by jarrett renshaw and chris kahn writing by andy sullivan editing by scott malone cynthia osterman and jonathan oatis

taiwan s foxconn would pay lordstown motors corp 230 million to purchase the massive 6 2 million square foot assembly complex it acquired from general motors if lmc agrees to make foxconn the contract manufacturer of its electric pickup truck the nonbinding agreement was announced late thursday a definitive agreement is expected by oct 31 according to the wall street journal it would allow lmc to keep certain components and intellectual property while the companies work together on the endurance and future electric vehicle programs foxconn also would purchase 50 million in lordstown nasdaq ride shares directly from the company at 6 89 per share shares closed thursday 8 42 higher at 7 98 they were up an additional 7 in after hours trading if the deal closes as expected next april lordstown motors would issue warrants for 1 7 million additional shares to foxconn that it could exercise over the next three years at 10 50 per share lmc would sign a long term lease for the portion of the plant it uses foxconn would employ the manufacturing and hourly employees major supplier to apple foxconn is the trading name of tucheng new taipei city taiwan based hon hai precision industry co ltd it is best known as a contract manufacturer of cellphones including being a major supplier to apple inc it is expanding into electric vehicles and has a deal with fisker inc nyse fsr to build the startup s second luxury electric car which foxconn hinted would be built in lordstown we have high expectations through this partnership that we will be able to successfully integrate our resources with lordstown motors young liu chairman of hon hai technology group said in a press release this mutually beneficial relationship is an important milestone for foxconn s ev business and our transformation strategy lordstown motors ceo daniel ninivaggi who made finding a tenant for the plant a priority said joining forces with a world class smart manufacturer like foxconn would provide operational technology and supply chain benefits to our company and accelerate overall scaled vehicle production and increase employment in the lordstown facility politicized plant in acquiring the lordstown property foxconn is the latest to tread on manufacturing ground heavily politicized during donald trump s presidency foxconn is familiar with trump having announced a 10 billion plant in mount pleasant wisconsin that the former president pointed to as an example of onshoring new manufacturing jobs four years later it is an unfinished construction site in northeast ohio general motors opened its lordstown plant in 1966 and shut it down in march 2019 after production of the chevrolet cruze compact sedan ended trump railed at gm ceo mary barra urging her to find a new product for the plant gm nyse gm instead sold the plant to startup lmc in november 2019 for 20 million which the automaker held as a mortgage and lent lmc 20 million for retooling lordstown s troubles lmc founded by former workhorse group ceo steve burns plans to make a commercial battery powered pickup truck called endurance lmc merged with special purpose acquisition company diamondpeak holdings corp and received about 675 million in october 2020 as part of the spac business combination gm made the plant an in kind contribution and invested 25 million in cash in lmc that effectively made it an lmc asset to do with it as it wished as the startup costs proved too great and lmc ran low on money it filed a notice of going concern with the securities and exchange commission in june suggesting it might be out of business within a year if it did not get more funding a three year equity line of credit for up to 400 million was arranged in july with ya ii pn ltd a fund managed by yorkville advisors global lp of new jersey lmc can choose when to sell company shares to the fund in exchange for cash but lmc did not retract the going concern notice it plans to begin limited production of the endurance before the end of the year the hindenburg factor meanwhile burns and chief financial officer julio gonzaelz were ousted in june following a short seller s report alleging fabricated preorders for the endurance an internal lmc investigation challenged many of the hindenburg report allegations but found some truth to the claims regarding phony pre orders the sec and the department of justice are investigating lmc no charges have been filed against the company or any individuals a sale of the plant to foxconn potentially gives lordstown some more financial runway before they run out of cash sam abuelsamid principal analyst at guidehouse told freightwaves before the tentative agreement was announced on the flip side though they still have that truck which it doesn t appear that anybody might want to buy though it has marketed the endurance as a commercial truck for construction utility and other uses the 52 500 price tag after a federal electric vehicle tax credit is thousands more than the ford f 150 lightning electric pickup coming in 2022 i remain skeptical abuelsamid said i think they are going to have a very difficult time competing with ford and with gm and stellantis when they launch their work truck stellantis is the name of the amsterdam based merging earlier this year of the italian american conglomerate fiat chrysler automobiles and the french psa group fisker to the rescue but abuelsamid sees an upside this could actually be good for the lordstown community because if foxconn does end up building vehicles for fisker there at least it brings back some of the jobs that they lost he said referring to the 1 400 hourly and salaried layoffs when gm closed lordstown lordstown motors never really had the resources to execute and they didn t really have the right product he said fisker now has a much better chance of being a white knight for the lordstown community related articles electric pickup truck maker lordstown motors taps former

washington d c according to the federal bureau of investigation fbi murders in the u s rose by 30 percent from 2019 to 2020 the steepest ever one year increase the agency s annual uniform crime report released earlier this week detailed how more than 21 000 homicides were reported last year reaching its peak during the summer of the covid 19 pandemic violent crime also witnessed a rise of 5 percent between 2019 and 2020 however these figures are not comprehensive due to missing data as only 85 percent of law enforcement agencies submitted their crime related statistics in 2020 cnn reported several large metropolitan areas including new york chicago and new orleans also did not share their data another factor that could have led to less participation by agencies is the fact that the fbi recently changed its reporting system to the national incident based reporting system nibrs which requires police agencies to enter more specific details for each recorded offense a general rise in gun violence coincided with the rise in murders with mass unemployment school closures children confined at home and widespread panic over the pandemic causing social turmoil and possibly contributing to increased gun deaths including suicides according to the gun violence archive between 2019 and 2020 gun related fatalities rose by some 4 000 while police in many large cities are anticipating more homicides next year the rate of increase seems to be flattening and the overall crime rate has been declining over the past twenty years including in 2020 according to the fbi

washington d c according to the federal bureau of investigation fbi murders in the u s rose by 30 percent from 2019 to 2020 the steepest ever one year increase the agency s annual uniform crime report released earlier this week detailed how more than 21 000 homicides were reported last year reaching its peak during the summer of the covid 19 pandemic violent crime also witnessed a rise of 5 percent between 2019 and 2020 however these figures are not comprehensive due to missing data as only 85 percent of law enforcement agencies submitted their crime related statistics in 2020 cnn reported several large metropolitan areas including new york chicago and new orleans also did not share their data another factor that could have led to less participation by agencies is the fact that the fbi recently changed its reporting system to the national incident based reporting system nibrs which requires police agencies to enter more specific details for each recorded offense a general rise in gun violence coincided with the rise in murders with mass unemployment school closures children confined at home and widespread panic over the pandemic causing social turmoil and possibly contributing to increased gun deaths including suicides according to the gun violence archive between 2019 and 2020 gun related fatalities rose by some 4 000 while police in many large cities are anticipating more homicides next year the rate of increase seems to be flattening and the overall crime rate has been declining over the past twenty years including in 2020 according to the fbi

the energy price cap will rise by 139 today in a change that will leave millions of households paying out more for their monthly gas and electricity bills the hike comes at a difficult time for many britons who are also grappling with the end of the furlough scheme a cut to universal credit supply chain disruptions and creeping inflation however unlike the fuel frenzy at petrol stations across the country which appears to be a uniquely british fiasco the energy crisis is sweeping the globe worldwide woe unlike the fuel frenzy at petrol stations across the country which appears to be a uniquely british fiasco the energy crisis is sweeping the globe day ahead uk gas prices are only just behind the all time highs registered during the beast from the east in 2018 hitting 203p last night a staggering 500 per cent increase on this time last year european contracts have also hit successive record highs and are up 550 per cent the jumps have been caused by a perfect storm of events some underpinned by the rapid rebound from the pandemic but many of which are out of governments control dan starman head of assets and infrastructure at energy consultancy cornwall insight says this isn t purely a british phenomenon it is international and is to a large extent being driven by the fundamental imbalance between global gas supply and demand gas prices across europe have been on a steep upward trajectory this summer after a long cold winter left storage levels far below normal russia has also been sending over less gas than usual which many experts have interpreted as a political powerplay aimed at putting pressure on european leaders to open up a controversial pipeline project called nord stream 2 more broadly there has been rampant demand for shipping tankers and energy in asia which quickly bounced back from the pandemic leaving less available for the rest of the world these global problems matter for britain and have driven our crisis because successive governments have insisted that we can rely on foreign imports of liquid gas and undersea cables that connect us to european grids policies used to justify the closure of the uk s last gas storage site in 2017 already at the mercy of the global markets the uk was vulnerable when good weather meant that there was less wind and a fire at a crucial interconnector that linked the british and french power grids hit supply this event led to a 16 per cent spike in prices that sent shockwaves through uk manufacturers and forced american industrial giant cf industries to temporarily shut its fertiliser plant which had the knock on effect of creating less co2 a key by product the crisis gripping the uk and europe threatens to send inflation soaring prices in britain are rising at the fastest rate since 2012 in spain inflation is at a 13 year high but it is china the world s economic powerhouse that is facing a toxic cocktail that is terrifying analysts blackouts are hammering many areas and industrial production is tumbling as coal stocks a major source of the country s power are down to dangerously low levels china s issues might not be exactly the same as our own but if its problems end up tanking its productivity and holding back its economy then the whole world is in trouble for britons what is most frustrating about the current crisis is that we are at least in part at the mercy of the weather another beast from the east that stretches gas supplies to the max could be ruinous whereas a mild winter could bring relief but geopolitics will play a role too sam wahab energy analyst at advisers sp angel said russia is one of the largest gas producers in the world and this winter depends in part on how much they allow to be sold out in the international market and russia has historically been quite unpredictable what s worrying too is that even if gas prices do not rise further they are unlikely to fall significantly putting pressure on industry government businesses and households whose finances have already been stretched to the brink today s rise in power bills could be just the beginning with some experts predicting that the next time the price cap is reviewed it could go up by 280

frazin and zack budryk write to us with tips rfrazin thehill com and zbudryk thehill com follow us on twitter rachelfrazin and budrykzack let s jump in manchin says gas should be part of the clean energy program asked thursday about whether natural gas should be included in a clean energy program pushed by his fellow democrats sen joe manchin d w va said that it should be it has to be the key swing vote senator told reporters i am all for all of the above i am all for clean energy but i am also for producing the amount of energy that we need to make sure that we have reliability the remark is sure to anger climate advocates who have opposed the use of natural gas in a key program known as the clean electricity performance program cepp he differs from his house counterparts a version of the cepp drafted by the house would pay power providers to shift towards clean energy sources and penalize companies that don t move quickly enough the house s version would exclude natural gas that doesn t use technology to capture its emissions but wait there s more manchin on thursday also reiterated past opposition to paying utilities to make the switch and instead floated low interest loans i am just not for giving public companies who have shareholders public dollars free when i know they re going to be very profitable at the end whatever we do he said we might front you the money with low interest loans but shouldn t we get it back when the profits start flowing so we don t have to incur more debt he added and that s not all there is to reconcile manchin also commented on the reconciliation package overall telling reporters that his top line spending number for the budget reconciliation package is 1 5 trillion far below the 3 5 trillion spending goal set by the budget resolution that he and every other senate democrat voted for last month my top line has been 1 5 he said explaining that he doesn t want to change our whole society to an entitlement mentality manchin also said that he had shared his figure with president biden related politico obtained a copy of a proposal manchin gave to senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y this summer the document calls

future says andreas shamel of ford motor company that future includes lower co2 emissions achieved through partnerships with u s natural gas and oil companies senate confirms biden s controversial land management pick the senate on thursday voted to confirm tracy stone manning to lead the bureau of land management despite a decades old tree spiking incident that led to gop opposition to her nomination ok but what s the controversy republicans opposed stone manning s confirmation because of a letter she sent in 1989 that mentioned tree spiking a tactic used to prevent logging that involves putting metal rods or materials into trees it can both damage equipment and cause injuries in the letter stone manning a 23 year old graduate student at the time warned that trees in a forest in idaho had been spiked to protect them and that people would get hurt if they tried to cut them down this letter is being sent to notify you that the post office sale in idaho has been spiked heavily the reasoning for this action is that this piece of land is very special to the earth the letter said you bastards go in there anyway and a lot of people could get hurt the letter did not contain stone manning s name but she acknowledged in court in 1993 that she had sent it she did not write the letter but retyped a message and sent it after an activist asked her to do so she has said she was not involved in any tree spiking and that she sent the letter because i wanted people to know that those trees were spiked i didn t want anybody getting hurt as a result of trees being spiked what did the gop have to say republicans ripped stone manning over the letter and argued that it showed she was unfit to lead the blm tracy stone manning is a dangerous choice to be put in charge of america s public lands sen john barrasso r wyo said in a floor speech on thursday what about democrats sen john tester d mont stone manning s former boss accused his colleagues of character assassination the truth is tracy stone manning did nothing wrong and in fact the people who went to jail went to jail because of tracy stone manning but that aside character assassination isn t

comprise about 15 135 blocks in a range of three to 231 miles offshore and depths ranging from nine to more than 11 000 feet the federal bureau of ocean energy management boem said in a statement that the leases will include stipulations to protect threatened species and potential conflicts with other activities in the gulf the boem also resolved to press on with a comprehensive review of the deficiencies associated with its offshore and onshore oil and gas leasing programs as one of his first acts in office president biden announced a moratorium on new leases on federal lands for oil and gas drilling however a federal judge in june ordered a temporary hold on the moratorium the interior department said it would appeal the decision but comply with it in the meantime boem had previously announced it would make a decision on the lease sale in question by the end of september after it was initially canceled in february despite these caveats environmental and progressive groups were sharply critical of the announcement president biden is doing donald trump s bidding today this lease sale will be devastating for the earth s climate and set america back years on our path to a climate solution center for western priorities deputy director aaron weiss said in a statement read more about the lease sales here a message from api these relationships help us plan for the future says andreas shamel of ford motor company that future includes lower co2 emissions achieved through partnerships with u s natural gas and oil companies seeking refuge the swell of haitian migrants attempting to come to the u s shows that the country needs a plan to help environmental refugees advocates say while warning that the swift deportation of those camped in texas is indicative of how climate migrants could be treated in the years to come the biden administration in recent days deported some 4 000 migrants back to haiti without giving them a chance to seek asylum their plight brought to the forefront with images of border officials on horseback dispersing migrants in del rio texas advocates say the scenario reveals a hole in the biden administration s plans for addressing climate change and those displaced by natural disasters as haitians flee both political turmoil from the assassination of president jovenel moïse in july and the effects of a 7 2 magnitude earthquake in august so what s the climate tie exactly while haiti s earthquake wasn t directly attributed to climate change experts say it was a preview of how the administration may respond to climate fueled disasters like hurricanes and wildfires that can factor into why people leave their countries haitians have routinely sought to enter the u s via the border with mexico as they leave a country plagued by famine and gang violence but their efforts to migrate to the u s have gotten greater attention after the earthquake struck a nation already reeling from a political assassination and succession fight that has further destabilized the country advocates say the cool reception they ve received could be reflective of how the biden administration and future presidents will treat people fleeing the most harmful effects of climate change we haven t seen anything that tells us that we re going to go in a different direction other than what we ve always historically done and that has always been to have a far more securitized militarized response said amali tower executive director of the advocacy group climate refugees read more about the situation here what we re reading top epa air

held to the extent return of capital distributions exceed the adjusted basis in the shares held capital gain is recognized with a holding period based on the period the shares have been held at the date such amount is received the payment of distributions in accordance with the distribution policy may result in a decrease in the fund s net assets a decrease in the fund s net assets may cause an increase in the fund s annual operating expense ratio and a decrease in the fund s market price per share to the extent the market price correlates closely to the fund s net asset value per share the distribution policy may also negatively affect the fund s investment activities to the extent that the fund is required to hold larger cash positions than it typically would hold or to the extent that the fund must liquidate securities that it would not have sold for the purpose of paying the distribution each fund s board has the right to amend suspend or terminate the distribution policy at any

washington congress on thursday sept 30 passed legislation to avert a government shutdown but another test of president joe biden s agenda lay ahead as the house of representatives prepared to vote on a 1 trillion infrastructure bill some progressive democrats vowed to vote against the bill to invest in the nation s roads bridges and other infrastructure angry that democrats have not yet reached agreement on a multi trillion dollar companion bill with funding for social services and to address climate change the house approved the measure to fund the government through dec 3 in a bipartisan 254 175 vote hours after it passed the senate 65 35 it will now go to biden for signing before funding runs out at midnight speaker of the house nancy pelosi confirmed the house will also vote thursday on the infrastructure bill despite fresh infighting between moderate and progressive democrats when reporters asked no 2 house democrat steny hoyer if he was confident that bill would pass in a thursday vote he had a one word reply nope advertisement failure to pass that measure would be a stinging setback for biden the infrastructure legislation has already passed the senate with republican and democratic support but it could fall victim to an impasse between democratic moderates and progressives over a larger bill that would bolster social services and tackle climate change lawmakers on the party s left flank have said they will not vote for the infrastructure bill unless they feel certain their priorities will be reflected in the social spending bill sen joe manchin a key democratic moderate with the power to block legislation in the senate said on thursday that bill should cost no more than 1 5 trillion far lower than the 3 5 trillion price tag floated by biden pelosi who had earlier promised moderates a vote on the smaller 1 trillion infrastructure bill this week said at a news conference that the party was in a good place but she declined to predict whether the measure would pass on thursday with razor thin majorities in congress democrats cannot afford to lose many votes if they want to pass their agenda and they are unlikely to win much support from house republicans eager to take back the majority in the 2022 midterm elections the stopgap spending bill approved in the senate would also provide aid for communities hard hit by hurricanes wildfires and other natural disasters money to help afghan refugees is included as well manchin s proposed price tag of 1 5 trillion was sure to rile progressives who initially proposed 6 trillion in new spending a group of protesters chanted manchin is a traitor while he spoke on thursday he said the bill should also help natural gas producers who have a large presence in his home state of west virginia that was sure to anger environmentalists who have urged a swift shift away from fossil fuels in the face of worsening climate change advertisement manchin also said lawmakers should first sort out what taxes are needed to cover the cost of new spending he said the differences could take weeks to resolve another democratic moderate sen kyrsten sinema declined to say whether she agreed with manchin s proposal she has met with biden multiple times to discuss the bill debt ceiling threat in yet another high stakes battle congressional democrats and republicans continued brawling over giving the treasury department additional borrowing authority beyond the current statutory limit of 28 4 trillion a historic u s debt default could occur around oct 18 treasury secretary janet yellen has estimated if congress fails to act republicans want no part of the debt limit increase saying it is democrats problem since they control congress and the white house the house late on wednesday approved a bill suspending the debt limit through december 2022 the senate could vote on it as early as next week senate majority leader chuck schumer said but republicans are expected to block it again yellen said on thursday it would be a catastrophe if congress does not raise the debt ceiling the uncertainty is starting to filter into financial markets though few believe the nation will ultimately default the looming debt crisis is rattling americans on both sides of the political spectrum according to an ipsos national opinion poll conducted for reuters on tuesday and wednesday it showed that 65 of adults including eight in 10 democrats and five in 10 republicans are very or somewhat concerned that congress will fail to reach a debt deal in time advertisement the poll also found that 30 think congressional republicans deserve the most blame if there is a government shutdown while 21 would blame democrats in congress and 16 would blame biden reporting by david morgan susan cornwell and richard cowan additional reporting by jarrett renshaw and chris kahn writing by andy sullivan editing by scott malone cynthia osterman and jonathan oatis
stocks on wall street fell broadly thursday closing out september with their worst monthly loss since the beginning of the pandemic the s p 500 ended the month 4 8 percent lower its first monthly drop since january and the biggest since march 2020 when the viral outbreak rattled markets as it wreaked havoc with the global economy after climbing steadily for much of the year the stock market became unsettled in recent weeks with the spread of the more contagious delta variant of covid 19 a sudden spike in long term bond yields and word that the federal reserve may start to unwind its support for the economy the s p 500 fell 1 2 percent thursday after selling accelerated in the final hour of trading the benchmark index is still up 14 7 percent for the year it s not really surprising that we re

ago all the sectors in the s p 500 ended in the red thursday with technology stocks banks and and a mix of companies that provide consumer goods and services accounting for much of the pullback more than 90 percent of the stocks in the index fell the broader market stumbled through september as investors tried to get a clearer picture of the economy s path amid inflation concerns and uncertainty about how covid 19 will continue to impact industries and consumers in recent weeks economic data has revealed that the highly contagious delta variant has crimped consumer spending and the job market s recovery the weak signals for economic growth continued thursday as the labor department reported that unemployment applications rose for the third straight week and were higher than economists anticipated the commerce department upgraded its estimate of economic growth during the second quarter to 6 7 percent which was slightly better than economists expected but they expect growth to slow to 5 5 percent during the third quarter inflation concerns that had been weighing on the market earlier in the year returned in september as a wide range of companies issued more warnings about the impact of rising prices on their finances sherwin williams and nike are among the many companies that have warned investors about supply chain problems higher raw material costs and labor issues advertisement inflation will likely remain the key worry hanging over the markets for the rest of the year pestrichelli said and it could put the federal reserve in the tough position of having to raise rates earlier than anticipated investors are still trying to gauge whether those issues are temporary and part of the economic recovery or could linger longer than expected the upcoming round of corporate earnings reports could shed light on how companies are dealing with those problems the jury is still out on this and we don t really know if it s demand driven or supply driven inflation pestrichelli said if you end up getting lower growth and higher inflation then you get stagflation and that s no good for the market investors have also had their eyes on washington where democrats and republicans in congress have been wrestling over extending the nation s debt limit on thursday a bill to fund the u s government through dec 3 and avoid a partial federal shutdown cleared congress

washington d c according to the federal bureau of investigation fbi murders in the u s rose by 30 percent from 2019 to 2020 the steepest ever one year increase the agency s annual uniform crime report released earlier this week detailed how more than 21 000 homicides were reported last year reaching its peak during the summer of the covid 19 pandemic violent crime also witnessed a rise of 5 percent between 2019 and 2020 however these figures are not comprehensive due to missing data as only 85 percent of law enforcement agencies submitted their crime related statistics in 2020 cnn reported several large metropolitan areas including new york chicago and new orleans also did not share their data another factor that could have led to less participation by agencies is the fact that the fbi recently changed its reporting system to the national incident based reporting system nibrs which requires police agencies to enter more specific details for each recorded offense a general rise in gun violence coincided with the rise in murders with mass unemployment school closures children confined at home and widespread panic over the pandemic causing social turmoil and possibly contributing to increased gun deaths including suicides according to the gun violence archive between 2019 and 2020 gun related fatalities rose by some 4 000 while police in many large cities are anticipating more homicides next year the rate of increase seems to be flattening and the overall crime rate has been declining over the past twenty years including in 2020 according to the fbi

washington congress on thursday sept 30 passed legislation to avert a government shutdown but another test of president joe biden s agenda lay ahead as the house of representatives prepared to vote on a 1 trillion infrastructure bill some progressive democrats vowed to vote against the bill to invest in the nation s roads bridges and other infrastructure angry that democrats have not yet reached agreement on a multi trillion dollar companion bill with funding for social services and to address climate change the house approved the measure to fund the government through dec 3 in a bipartisan 254 175 vote hours after it passed the senate 65 35 it will now go to biden for signing before funding runs out at midnight speaker of the house nancy pelosi confirmed the house will also vote thursday on the infrastructure bill despite fresh infighting between moderate and progressive democrats when reporters asked no 2 house democrat steny hoyer if he was confident that bill would pass in a thursday vote he had a one word reply nope advertisement failure to pass that measure would be a stinging setback for biden the infrastructure legislation has already passed the senate with republican and democratic support but it could fall victim to an impasse between democratic moderates and progressives over a larger bill that would bolster social services and tackle climate change lawmakers on the party s left flank have said they will not vote for the infrastructure bill unless they feel certain their priorities will be reflected in the social spending bill sen joe manchin a key democratic moderate with the power to block legislation in the senate said on thursday that bill should cost no more than 1 5 trillion far lower than the 3 5 trillion price tag floated by biden pelosi who had earlier promised moderates a vote on the smaller 1 trillion infrastructure bill this week said at a news conference that the party was in a good place but she declined to predict whether the measure would pass on thursday with razor thin majorities in congress democrats cannot afford to lose many votes if they want to pass their agenda and they are unlikely to win much support from house republicans eager to take back the majority in the 2022 midterm elections the stopgap spending bill approved in the senate would also provide aid for communities hard hit by hurricanes wildfires and other natural disasters money to help afghan refugees is included as well manchin s proposed price tag of 1 5 trillion was sure to rile progressives who initially proposed 6 trillion in new spending a group of protesters chanted manchin is a traitor while he spoke on thursday he said the bill should also help natural gas producers who have a large presence in his home state of west virginia that was sure to anger environmentalists who have urged a swift shift away from fossil fuels in the face of worsening climate change advertisement manchin also said lawmakers should first sort out what taxes are needed to cover the cost of new spending he said the differences could take weeks to resolve another democratic moderate sen kyrsten sinema declined to say whether she agreed with manchin s proposal she has met with biden multiple times to discuss the bill debt ceiling threat in yet another high stakes battle congressional democrats and republicans continued brawling over giving the treasury department additional borrowing authority beyond the current statutory limit of 28 4 trillion a historic u s debt default could occur around oct 18 treasury secretary janet yellen has estimated if congress fails to act republicans want no part of the debt limit increase saying it is democrats problem since they control congress and the white house the house late on wednesday approved a bill suspending the debt limit through december 2022 the senate could vote on it as early as next week senate majority leader chuck schumer said but republicans are expected to block it again yellen said on thursday it would be a catastrophe if congress does not raise the debt ceiling the uncertainty is starting to filter into financial markets though few believe the nation will ultimately default the looming debt crisis is rattling americans on both sides of the political spectrum according to an ipsos national opinion poll conducted for reuters on tuesday and wednesday it showed that 65 of adults including eight in 10 democrats and five in 10 republicans are very or somewhat concerned that congress will fail to reach a debt deal in time advertisement the poll also found that 30 think congressional republicans deserve the most blame if there is a government shutdown while 21 would blame democrats in congress and 16 would blame biden reporting by david morgan susan cornwell and richard cowan additional reporting by jarrett renshaw and chris kahn writing by andy sullivan editing by scott malone cynthia osterman and jonathan oatis

formerly fiat chrysler many enter another team by october 7 rivian s highly anticipated r1t pickup will participate again the startup electric vehicle builder was the first to use the electrified designation rebelle rally going off road a challenge for modern vehicles miller is clear about her commitment to offering a competition for stock vehicles and she says that s one reason so many manufacturers are competing light trucks a category made up of pickups suvs and crossovers now account for nearly 80 of new vehicle sales part of the popularity is driven by the vehicles size and versatility but another component is the growing popular interest in capability for adventuring to meet the voracious demand automakers are stuffing their lineups with vehicles that boast varying off roading credentials though most suvs and crossovers offer light off roading talent very few are used to their full capacity the rebelle gives automakers a chance to showcase their vehicles going flat out over uncompromising terrain inspiring owner confidence and manufacturers hope increased sales especially among women freedom adventure and capability are core to the jeep brand s values and the rebelle rally which covers more than 1 400 off road miles of the most extreme conditions across the nevada and california desert is the epitome of adventure and capability said jim morrison vice president of jeep in north america it s the perfect venue to showcase our jeep 4 4 capability along with the capabilities of our female teams nissan has participated in all six rebelle rallies the automaker says 20 of its frontier pictured buyers are women and as such it s an effective way to showcase the truck s capabilities to an important audience rebelle rally according to kevin raftery a product communications senior specialist at nissan the rebelle rally is another way to reach a quickly growing audience of off road enthusiasts nearly 20 of nissan frontier buyers are female and nissan sees an opportunity to continue to grow in this space and the rebelle rally provides an excellent platform to do so porsche echoes this sentiment we thrive on competition it s ingrained into who we are and by pushing ourselves and our cars we learn fast more importantly events like rebelle rally serve to inspire and to ignite interest and curiosity in a new generation of drivers said shelby akin the product communications specialist for the cayenne panamera and macan while competitors will not have any form of internet connectivity during the event the rebelle organizers will be broadcasting live on their site and provide daily updates on standings and results the event concludes in the dunes of glamis on october 17

mr naupari solicited the co founders of the company david dorr and brian dorr to take on the role of chief executive officer ceo and chief operating officer coo beginning january 1 2021 at the same time mr naser persuaded the board to appoint him chairman of the board a position he held until just recently when he suddenly resigned on august 17 2021 mr naser induced david dorr and brian dorr to take the officer positions without any form of compensation by committing that with his new title of chairman he would raise 10 million in funding for the company the ceo and the coo are appointed by the board on january 1 2021 david dorr and brian dorr agreed and took on their roles for no compensation in cash stock or other benefits they were appointed to their positions in the best interests of the company shareholders and since that time have done everything in their power to gain customers and investors in the company by developing the software the product and installing proper bookkeeping and marketing they reduced the company s net losses by approximately 36 from 2 717 361 for the first 6 months of 2020 to 1 734 787 for the first 6 months of 2021 which can be clearly verified by anyone reviewing the company s public filings1 they installed a complete accounting system and accounting policies and hired ex deloitte consultants immediately to implement and correct operational deficiencies left by prior management each issue which was identified was reported to the board unfortunately the prior board who resigned failed to resolve the issues identified by the ceo and coo of the company indeed during mr naser s mr hueppi s and mr naupari s tenure as directors of the company the stock price declined approximately 88 mr naser failed to raise the 10 million in funding he committed to raise as a condition to david dorr and brian dorr taking on their positions as ceo and coo of the company having failed in their governance of the company and refusing to take responsibility on august 17 2021 mr naser mr hueppi and mr naupari abandoned ship and spontaneously and coincidentally resigned brian and david dorr develop the company a revolutionary financial technology business as the remaining board members of the company david dorr and brian dorr have taken every action to preserve and develop the value of the company from the time they were appointed by the board of the company through and beyond the abandonment of the company by directors who resigned the company scaled its application s robustness and functionality completing over thirty api updates and releases so far this year the company also acquired approximately 1 600 new customers all these milestones had been predicated upon having the capital to execute and indeed the current board was able to accomplish these milestones without the capital mr naser had committed to raise the company and its current board have operated in a transparent manner and the burn rates and financials were routinely reported to mr naser who in turn as chairman reported them to the board of the company mr naser s baseless claims of mismanagement at the company are without basis and are denied appropriate executive compensation as set forth in its publicly filed form 8 k report on september 9 2021 coro global granted an aggregate of 6 000 000 restricted shares of common stock to six officers employees and consultants of the company including 1 000 000 shares to david dorr as ceo 1 000 000 shares to brian dorr as coo 1 000 000 shares to anna milaeva chief marketing officer 1 000 000 shares to albert rodriguez ceo coro corp 1 000 000 shares to lorenzo delzoppo chief compliance officer and 1 000 000 shares to jonathan beck chief technology officer the shares were issued as compensation to the executive officers of the company to ensure that the company has a successful executive team for the next four years these six executive team members have supported the company since its inception in 2018 and have earned the rights to be compensated for their ongoing efforts and contributions to the company the former board of directors and officers of the company all received restricted stock during their tenure all of the restricted stock they received was without cash consideration david dorr and brian dorr started their employment as officers and directors of the company on january 1 2021 they have worked without salary health benefits stock or any other forms of compensation all previous management and directors received combinations of cash stock and health benefits on may 17 2018 mark goode the former ceo received 500 000 in restricted stock immediately upon becoming ceo with a closing stock price of 2 50 thus granting him 1 250 000 in immediate compensation 2 on september 9 2021 the day the restricted stock was granted to our senior management team the company s stock closed at 1 32 and the first 250 000 shares that each executive will be eligible to have vested will not occur until september 10 2022 none of the shares are vested and thus are future compensation which is both acceptable and valid in the industry these restricted shares were issued to ensure that the current management of the company is appropriately compensated in a manner which would ultimately inure to the greatest benefit of the company and its shareholders mr naser s press release conveniently ignores the fact that none of the restricted shares have vested yet the shares vest over the course of four years with a one year cliff that means that any executive that leaves before september 10 2022 loses 100 of the shares granted to them each executive that is with the company on september 10 2022 will only receive 250 000 shares they must continue with the company to earn the remaining shares the balance of their stock is vested each quarter over the remaining three years they serve the company the restricted stock granted to the company s senior management team does not possess any anti dilution rights in other words all financing rounds over the next four years will dilute the positions of the senior management who received the restricted stock this is not evidence of mismanagement this is evidence of proper management of the company and actions which were necessary in order to incentivize the executive team to stay at coro global particularly after the prior board members left and encourage them to continue working over the course of four years and against leaving the company simply put the shares were validly issued for compensation are not self dealing or entrenchment and were validly issued by the board of the company moreover under the amended bylaws of the company effective as of january 22 2021 it was not necessary to hold a meeting to issue these restricted shares mr naser s request for a meeting is invalid although mr naser claims that he has secured a majority of the shareholders to request a special meeting under the amended bylaws his press release does not evidence such a majority the shares which were validly issued for executive compensation and which have not vested still provide voting rights to the holders of those restricted shares the total number of voting shares therefore is 31 458 746 which includes the restricted shares issued on september 9 2021 mr naser has identified 12 926 234 votes as those voting in favor of holding a special meeting however that amount results in only 41 1 of the shareholders voting in favor of holding a special meeting there is no valid basis for mr naser to hold a special meeting pursuant to the amended bylaws and such meeting appears to be for an improper purpose doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern in every annual and quarterly public filing since 2018 when the company started there has been a public disclosure regarding the uncertainty in the company s ability to remain a going concern despite this ongoing and now heightened uncertainty david dorr and brian dorr have remained committed and aligned with the company since they co founded it in 2018 this commitment has been demonstrated in their tireless efforts to build the company and coro product willingness to serve as officers of the company without compensation and supported by the fact that they have never sold a single share of the company s stock messrs naser hueppi and naupari served the company as directors from june 24 2020 through august 17 2021 a period in which the company s stock price declined 88 74 messrs naser hueppi and naupari were the sole members of the independent board as well as the sole members of the company s audit compensation and nomination committees they resigned simultaeously along with the company s corporate secretary and general counsel glenn truitt on august 17 2021 as was reported in the company s most recent 10q while mr naser s allegations suggest a litany of baseless reasons for their resignation the fact is that the company was provided in writing from mr truitt that each of these members is resigning to focus their efforts on sectors and opportunities outside of the gold industry it is also disappointing that a review of the group of stockholders list from mr naser provided in exhibit a compared against public filings shows that his group of stockholders appear to be responsible for greater than 60 of every single share sold in the public market since the company was founded 3 this begs the question as to what their true intentions are for the company and if those intentions would be in the best interest of all stockholders the irresponsible and sudden departure of the directors mr naser s failure to deliver on his commitment of a 10 million funding continued fall in the company s stock price likely driven by share sales from the group of stockholders mr naser represents and defamatory press release filled with unsupported allegations have dramatically heightened the risk of the company remaining a going concern considering the current circumstances the company and management intend to take a number of actions including but not limited to the following first with financial and legal risks a clear and present danger the company will take all actions necessary to preserve resources to do so the company will be notifying customers of the coro app that services will be suspended effective october 31 2021 during that period company management will explore opportunities to partner license or sell part of its assets all actions taken will be done with the requisite transparency and procedures required under the company s amended bylaws management is also considering withdrawing some or all its money transmission licenses to preserve operational resources the company will continue to preserve the technology assets and resources and evaluate monetization strategies for them on a standalone basis second the company has retained advisors to do a thorough review of the company including but not limited to its finances operations and history of officers directors and shareholders since inception the purpose of this review is to document transparently how the company has evolved to the present situation all shareholders deserve such a review the company moves forward the company always has been and continues to be transparent the company s board meetings are recorded and well documented the company s current board and management is dedicated and has maintained their roles as ceo and coo as true fiduciaries of the company and as the co founders who established the very foundation for the company business on a positive note the prior board is no longer managing the company having abandoned their fiduciary duties to the company and their positions and the company can now focus on all available options to preserve the core mission of the company which is to develop an inclusive new financial system where gold as stable money can be used safely and securely in everyday transactions as easily as fiat currencies cautionary note regarding forward looking statements matters
