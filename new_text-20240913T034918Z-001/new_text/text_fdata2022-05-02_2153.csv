tesla did what nobody thought was possible it not only defeated the legacy carmakers but the well known ev manufacturer made highly successful auto companies want to replace it the fight is ongoing but what almost nobody is expecting is china s going to have a say in this an important one and the asian country might give us a new king my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined photo public domain wikimedia commons it might happen faster than experts anticipated ev photo byd just look at the market conditions now there s geopolitical unrest almost everywhere many global economic powers have a lot of internal problems to deal with our societies are just recovering from the health crisis while another one s looming because chronically ill people were left untreated for a long time and we re facing a disparity between incredibly rich people and those that work two or three jobs and are barely making ends meet it s not a pretty picture the inflationary situation is common in most developed economies it s not happening only in the u s canada australia germany the uk france spain turkey and india are all seeing signs of increased costs of living powering our lifestyle houses and offices is one of the factors that contribute to this reality nobody s relaxed anymore almost everyone s planning for the worst thanks to what we see happening around us and announced almost every day by the news stations across the globe the stock market has already entered a downfall as well and that got me thinking where s the tesla model 3 standard range that we were promised that car was supposed to be revolutionary it had incorporated in it the idea that all electric personal transport will become something everybody wanted and desired for a long long time it was supposed to be the 35 000 electric vehicle that made switching from gas guzzlers a no brainer look at it now the car costs 46 990 it s a 267 mile range a rear wheel drive machine that s considerably more expensive than what we were promised i think it s a good idea to have affordable cars it s a great idea i think where it s going to become challenging in the future is as the price of the gasoline rises the cost of acquiring the car is much less of an issue than the cost of operating the car said elon musk in an interview where he was asked about ratan tata and his vision to develop the nano a 2 300 sedan that was very smartly fitted with a compressed natural gas cng tank which made using it a lot cheaper than a gas powered equivalent now elon musk is buying social media companies and he is a firm believer in freedom of speech space travel and technologies for the advancement of the human brain he even sold some tesla shares to buy the web platform and just recently advised his followers to sell the stock of the companies that they think are trending worse but dude where s my 35 000 electric car that was something that would ve greatly benefitted our crowded urban societies where s the new and improved chemistry for batteries or better deals for cheaper parts where are the shops and the sustainable right to repair why can t this brilliant minded man use his abilities to make tesla the best of them all and cover every type of customer not everyone s rich but almost everyone needs a car let it be a model 3 that s not going to put you in debt no ok then but at the end of the day elon musk won t care he never did after all name one big company or a ceo that did care for their customers it s a for profit world nothing will change this fact chasing expensive models with high profit margins is making business much better for the newest apple like auto company people are paying the extra money because they have a lot of it so why not let them do it but that s where everyone s wrong paying over 100 000 for anwon t be a thing that s going to last it will stop sooner rather than later and when it stops happening china will sweep everyone off their feet or better said in this case wheels maybe that s why elon musk is actively choosing to focus on anything else other than making tesla even better and more accessible you might be inclined to disagree with me but china has the raw materials the battery manufacturers a lot of up and coming carmakers and already established auto brands a government that doesn t endorse losing overseas or at home and is willing to cross any barriers necessary for it a very close position to the world s leading chip producer taiwan and a plethora of capital it s going to eat everyone for breakfast the country s already testing the markets with different offers lynk co offers very attractive subscriptions for its cars while volvo is evolving with help from geely american and european automakers are scrambling to satisfy the chinese market even if it comes at the expense of western customers everything is pointing at asia they might very well become the next global leaders in the auto industry if not in everything that matters to us all and it s not only china vietnam is pushing in this direction as well with vinfast unfortunately tesla and the companies that followed in its footsteps like rivian lucid and canoo are not about affordability they re relying on desirability and that s going to be a catalyst for foreign expansion in our auto industry don t think it hasn t started it s happened already give it a few years and it will reach even the most remote parts of our little connected world
video director recalls how he was pulled over by 10 cops at gunpoint when hertz mistakenly reported his rental car stolen 100 customers come forward to sue the firm following wrongful arrests stephen scherr who took over as ceo on feb 28 said hertz has changed its practices to fix problems that have occurred when cars were reported stolen however another 100 cases are set to be filed to add to the more than 230 to date which have sought over 750million in damages the allegations have caught the attention of congress who are demanding the federal trade commission investigate michael okoasia 29 a music video director from new york city rented a 2019 nissan versa from hertz at the lax marriott hotel in california okoasia claims he was headed to a shoot when he was pulled over and arrested at gunpoint by 10 officers lawyers are set to file over 100 new claims against hertz on behalf of customers who say they were victims of false arrests because the company s computer system erroneously reported their rental cars to police as stolen the new claims come despite promises from the company s ceo just this month to fix what he called a glitch in the system causing the false reports stephen scherr who took over as ceo on feb 28 said the company has changed its practices to fix problems that have occurred when cars were reported stolen but the transaction was improperly recorded in hertz s system however another 100 cases are set to be filed to add to the more than 230 to date which have sought over 750million in damages some of these new cases are being filed as civil cases separate from the bankruptcy proceeding because the incidents happened after hertz got out of bankruptcy the allegations have caught the attention of congress who are demanding the federal trade commission investigate michael okoasia 29 a music video director from new york city said he was the victim of this hertz glitch after renting a 2019 nissan versa from the company at the lax marriott hotel in california okoasia claims he was headed to a video shoot when he was pulled over and arrested at gunpoint by 10 officers hertz had rented me the wrong car and then without any investigation reported the car i was driving stolen i was eventually let go and the car towed but not before a very public arrest in hollywood okoasia said in a legal filing i had to tell the production team i had been arrested for being in possession of a stolen car michael okoasia 29 a music video director from new york city rented a 2019 nissan versa from hertz at the lax marriott hotel in california when he was pulled over rental vehicles parked at a hertz location at the louisville international airport in louisville kentucky he s claiming losses of about 20 000 because he was unable to shoot the music video he was supposed to work on as well as airfare expenses brittany morgan and jeremy benjamin were also pulled over at gunpoint in houston recently after renting a ford mustang from hertz s george bush airport location we showed the police the paperwork and told them we had obviously not stolen the car we were stunned when the police told us that the license plate on our car was from another car that was reported stolen and that it was not even the license plate listed on our rental paperwork the couple wrote in their legal declaration we are infuriated that something like this could happen and dumbfounded to learn that hertz has previously rented stolen cars to customers they added okoasia claims he was headed to a video shoot when he was pulled over and arrested at gunpoint by 10 officers hertz claims that it files over 3 000 police reports annually saying that most of the reports are for customers who were many weeks or even months overdue returning vehicles and who stopped communicating with us well beyond the scheduled due date but scherr said earlier in april that he d been working to fix a glitch in the rental car giant s systems that has led to some of its customers being wrongly accused of stealing cars they had rented this is among the first things that i have started to look to take care of and deal with in the first 30 days i ve been at the company scherr told cnbc on monday it is not acceptable to hertz to have any customer caught up in some of what has happened some hertz customers have said they were arrested and jailed because the company accused them of stealing cars that they had paid to rent and in some cases had returned long before their arrest it s not clear how many people have been affected more than 200 customers asked a federal judge in delaware to hertz to disclose records about erroneous theft reports and the judge ruled in the renters favor in february stephen scherr who took over as ceo on feb 28 said the company has changed its practices to fix problems that have occurred when cars were reported stolen but the transaction was improperly recorded in hertz s system the company logo is shown on the exterior of a closed hertz car rental office may 23 2020 in south denver scherr said the false reports involve several hundred customers out of hertz s 15 million annual transactions but lawyers for the customers say the number is more like 8 000 we have changed our policies to avoid the possibility of this happening again scherr said no one customer should be put through that scherr said that in some cases vehicles have been reported as stolen the report was withdrawn when the vehicle was found but that rescission wasn t recognized francis malofiy an attorney for the victims told fox business that the company s recent comments are discordant with reality and frustrating for a lot of people who are still being arrested jailed and prosecuted for false police reports advertisement there s a massive world of difference between something that s lost or misplaced or that you can t find and something that s stolen he added

washington d c in a major victory for anti smoking advocates the u s food and drug administration fda issued a proposal to ban menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars a move that could affect the sales of tobacco companies one year after the agency announced the plan the proposal still needs to be finalized and could take years to implement likely facing stiff opposition from major tobacco companies xavier becerra health and human services secretary said the proposed rules would help prevent children from becoming the next generation of smokers and help adult smokers quit for decades anti smoking groups have argued that menthol cigarettes have disproportionately contributed to health issues affecting black communities and played a role in encouraging young people to smoke while overall smoking rates have been declining in the u s menthol cigarettes banned in many states including california and massachusetts account for more than one third of the industry s overall market share the agency said in 2019 that there were more than 18 5 million american menthol cigarette smokers ages 12 and older with particularly high rates of use by youths young adults african americans and other racial and ethnic groups in response tobacco company altria stated we believe harm reduction not prohibition is the better path forward taking these products out of the legal marketplace will push them into unregulated criminal markets that don t follow any regulations and ignore minimum age laws

review and preview gross domestic product unexpectedly declined at a 1 4 annualized pace in the first quarter marking an abrupt reversal for an economy coming off its best performance since 1984 the commerce department reported thursday a plethora of factors conspired to weigh against growth during the first three months of 2022 which fell off a cliff following the 6 9 gain to close out last year rising covid omicron infections to start the year hampered activity across the board while inflation surging at a level not seen since the early 1980s and the russian invasion of ukraine also contributed to the economic stasis jeff cox u s gdp fell at a 1 4 pace to start the year www cnbc com april 28 2022 he harvard university professor kenneth rogoff argued that if the federal reserve does not hike a lot there is going to be inflation and if they do there is going to be a massive recession the economist made the comment shortly after it was revealed that gross domestic product gdp the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the economy fell at a 1 4 annualized rate in the three month period from january through march noting that the number is even below the worst he thought it might have been talia kaplan u s economy shrinking at start of 2022 is shocking harvard economist www foxbusinesnews com april 28 2022 it s not like readers of this column and prior webinars were unaware of the economic danger before thursday s shocking report on the negative gdp last week s column had reiterated this outlook stating something is not right in the world of financial markets today as the fed continues to loudly again wave the flag of its commitment to fight inflation by raising rates aggressively while at the same time reducing liquidity by ending its quantitative easing programs thereby risking an economic downturn in the upside down reality of today s dangerous fragile economic situation the bad news was good news for the stock market this dr jekyll mr hyde market behavior is not a promising sign for the bulls a characteristic of a bear market is to see sharp rallies that don t last followed by a plunge to lower lows last week was a prime example of the stock market s inability to sustain any upside momentum as shown by the djia on monday it fell to a new 6 week low but then reversed and closed up 238 points on tuesday it fell to another 6 week low closing down 809 another new multi week low happened on wednesday but then it reversed and closed up 61 points followed by thursday s powerful rally of 614 points on friday it collapsed again down 939 despite the declines the low of february 24 continues to hold in the djia and s p the nasdaq however fell to its lowest low in over a year the declines were just as severe in china where the shanghai composite fell to its lowest level since june 2020 amidst a challenging effort to control the spread of a new covid outbreak but the decline in other world equity markets was much less severe than in the u s or china in fact many look like normal corrective declines in a bullish trend and so far not the threat of a new bearish campaign then again other economies are not witnessing the extremely high rate of inflation with the prospect of sharply rising interest rates looming ahead nor are they embarking upon zero covid governmental policies that are disrupting the flow of their production of goods as is the case in the u s and china respectively the world s largest two economies gold and silver also had difficult weeks until friday gold sold off to a low of 1870 on thursday april 28 its lowest price since mid february and down considerably from its recent high of 2003 the prior week silver briefly dipped below 23 00 thursday and friday its lowest level since mid february and well down from its recent high of 26 50 the previous week bitcoin also struggled last week falling below 38 000 but starting to show signs of support crude oil on the other hand rallied smartly as the russia ukraine conflict rages on with no end in sight and with jupiter soon to enter the sign of aries aries and its ruler mars have dominion over the theater of war and in late may they conjoin one another in aries this is a rare combination the last three times corresponded to world war ii 1940 the end of the vietnam war 1975 and the arab spring 2011 short term geocosmics nobody s right if everybody s wrong buffalo springfield for what it is worth 1966 the manic depressive nature of last week s stock market reflects the cosmic conflict between the venus jupiter neptune conjunction optimism and euphoria turned to hysteria and panic of last week and the transit of saturn in a t square with the lunar nodes in scorpio and taurus pessimism anxiety connected with debt and the slowing economy and with each connecting to the mercury pluto fixed square in the chart of the new york stock exchange every rally is brief followed by a surrender of all gains to lower prices until that pattern changes this is bearish the next 1 2 weeks are likely to be a cosmic challenge for world equity markets and especially u s indices to break that pattern as the sun will conjoin uranus on may 5 followed by mercury turning retrograde in its ruling sign of gemini on may 10 lasting through june 3 this does not portend market stability and it can be compounded in late may as mars war themes conjoins jupiter possibility of a large offensive in aries on may 29 1 week our immediate attention will be on the sun uranus conjunction in taurus on may 5 which precedes the monthly payroll reports of the following day this is one of the most powerful level 1 geocosmic signatures with an 83 historical correlation to primary cycles within a range of 14 trading days and most often within only 4 trading days but before it reverses it can also coincide with a dramatic breakout of important support or resistance mercury turning retrograde also highlights periods when support and resistance zones are vulnerable to being broken only to be followed by sudden reversals since the stock market is closer to important lows than highs this becomes a concern the sun and uranus together present a geocosmic conundrum the sun is symbolic of leadership but uranus symbolizes revolt and rebellion against leadership together they can indicate instability related to conflicting visions as to what must be done in taurus this pertains to economic and financial matters hence we find some nations adhering to policies designed to reduce inflation at the risk of an economic downturn and others following a policy to support economic growth and avoid a recession at the risk of rising inflation the result is turmoil in currency markets which had led to a very strong u s dollar against all other major currencies plus the insistence by russia to be paid in rubles and not u s dollars or the euro however this bullish dollar trend has been quite common since the 1980 s when a democrat occupies the white house which will continue into january 2025 allow an orb of six months for a peak on a more hopeful note the sun uranus conjunction also pertains to themes of innovation and new solutions to existing problems it is a time when thinking out of the box can lead to new policies that envision a brighter future but perhaps a little ahead of their time to garner enough support in the present in terms of financial markets the sun uranus conjunction might correspond to something exciting regarding technology and outer space this special conjunction can also produce aha moments of awakening to those who have the capacity to be inspired to visualize a brighter future that is more inclusive and connected after all our collective well being depends more on working together to build a strong global economy that helps one another grow than on the threat to annihilate one another with a nuclear attack as mentioned last week i am optimistic regarding the majority of outer planets now in their waxing growth phase for the first time in many years since late 2020 we are no longer cosmically waning as a human race but we still have to recognize the opportunities and choose to move in that direction which i think is slowly happening and will be visible by the time jupiter moves into taurus in one year may 2023 followed by uranus and pluto moving into air signs 2023 2025 and trine to each other 2026 2028 the seeds of another renaissance are being planted now

similar concerns about retail exposure to cryptocurrencies ravi menon the agency s managing director said in a recent interview adding that it has granted retail crypto licenses but they come with strict terms and conditions funds like three arrows capital don t deal directly with retail crypto as they aren t open to non institutional or non accredited investment so why the long face it might

mas won t give coindesk a clear answer putting a fund on an investor alert list which has negative connotations and not explaining the reasoning isn t a good look it also might be the beginning of

vancouver british columbia april 14 2022 vizsla silver corp tsx v vzla nyse vzla frankfurt 0g3 vizsla or the company is pleased to report results from 19 new drill holes targeting the animas vein corridor at its 100 owned flagship panuco silver gold project panuco or the project located in mexico the results are centered on two zones the rosarito zone which was included in the march 2022 maiden resource estimate and the cuevillas zone a new discovery located near perpendicular to rosarito at the northern end of the animas vein corridor highlights cuevillas am 22 42 returned 1 088

delivering the maiden resource estimate vizsla continued its exploration efforts in order to identify and test new targets across the project commented michael konnert president and ceo given the current resource base comprises less than five percent of the known mapped sampled veins in the district the company is confident in its ability to uncover new centers of mineralization this was reinforced by multiple high grade drill intercepts from the rosarito and cuevillas zones located at the northern end of the animas vein corridor both of these zones are open for expansion and represent only two of several excellent targets that extend beneath historic workings in the central portion of the property vizsla now has seven of its thirteen planned drill rigs devoted to testing new exploration targets and looks forward to growing these zones of mineralization ahead of the company s resource update planned for the second half of 2022 figure1 plan map of recent drilling along the north end of the animas vein corridor about the animas vein corridor results initial underground sampling and drilling completed by vizsla in 2020 targeted extensions to known mineralization beneath historic workings along the animas vein corridor these early results marked by underground samples grading up to 140 0 g t silver and 1 67 g t gold over 11 90 metres and drill hole intercepts beneath existing mine workings reporting 231 g t silver and 2 19 g t gold over 6 75 metres including 821 g t silver and 5 08 g t gold over 1 50 metres see press releases dated may 12 2020 and august 13 2020 highlighted the potential of the animas corridor to host additional mineralization beneath the old workings however due to a lack of accurate detailed underground plans combined with the exploration success being realized at napoleon and tajitos exploration in the area was deferred by late 2021 vizsla had collected enough data to accurately locate all significant workings in the north end of the animas vein corridor and the company recommenced drilling in this area ultimately three high priority targets were developed rosarito cuevillas and la muñeca the first two have been drilled and are reported in this news release and drilling has commenced at la muñeca a compilation of historic mine workings drilling and underground sampling suggests that the animas vein corridor might be rotated to the north if so this event may have preserved mineralization beneath old workings in the northern half of the corridor the rosarito zone is situated along the main animas vein at the intersection of a high angle northeast trending splay vein figure 1 drilling completed to date has traced a panel of continuous mineralization over 170 metres long by approximately 80 metres beneath the lowest level of historic workings and remains open along strike and to depth the 11 rosarito holes reported in this news release were included in the company s march 2022 maiden resource estimate rosarito currently hosts an estimated in situ indicated resource of 719koz ageq grading 191 g t ageq and an in situ inferred resource of 553koz ageq grading 188 g t ageq the technical report titled national instrument 43 101 technical report for the panuco project mineral resource estimate concordia sinaloa mexico was filed on sedar on april 7 2022 has an effective date of march 1 2022 and was prepared in accordance with national instrument 43 101 standards of disclosure for mineral projects ni 43 101 by tim maunula p geo principal geologist t maunula associates consulting inc and kevin murray p eng manager process engineering ausenco the cuevillas vein is a northeast trending vein that intercepts the rosarito resource nearly perpendicular to strike hosted within the hanging wall of the animas vein to date drilling has highlighted a panel of mineralization over 100 metres long by 100 metres deep with assays pending on two new holes cuevillas represents a new discovery outboard of the maiden resource areas where mineralization remains open along strike and to depth the company believes the northern end of the animas vein corridor has significant potential to host additional resources and will continue to explore this area throughout 2022 additionally the company is reviewing the potential to utilize existing workings in the area to conduct underground drilling this may provide improved access to drill more vein intercepts in less time at lower overall costs figure 2 rosarito zone contour longitudinal section figure 3 cuevillas zone contour longitudinal section

with ni 43 101 martin dupuis p geo vice president of technical services is the qualified person for the company and has reviewed and approved the technical and scientific content of this news release information concerning estimates of mineral resources the scientific and technical information in this news release was prepared in accordance with ni 43 101 which differs significantly from the requirements of the u s securities and exchange commission the sec the terms measured mineral resource indicated mineral resource and inferred mineral resource used in this news release are in reference to the mining terms defined in the canadian institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum standards the cim definition standards which definitions have been adopted by ni 43 101 accordingly information contained in this news release providing descriptions of our mineral deposits in accordance with ni 43 101 may not be comparable to similar information made public by other u s companies subject to the united states federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder you are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral resources will ever be converted into reserves pursuant to cim definition standards inferred mineral resources are that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling such geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity an inferred mineral resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an indicated mineral resource and must not be converted to a mineral reserve however it is reasonably expected that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated mineral resources with continued exploration under canadian rules estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre feasibility studies except in rare cases investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource is economically or legally mineable disclosure of contained ounces in a resource is permitted disclosure under canadian regulations however the sec normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute reserves by sec standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures canadian standards including the cim definition standards and ni 43 101 differ significantly from standards in the sec industry guide 7 effective february 25 2019 the sec adopted new mining disclosure rules under subpart 1300 of regulation s k of the united states securities act of 1933 as amended the sec modernization rules with compliance required for the first fiscal year beginning on or after january 1 2021 the sec modernization rules replace the historical property disclosure requirements included in sec industry guide 7 as a result of the adoption of the sec modernization rules the sec now recognizes estimates of measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources information regarding mineral resources contained or referenced in this news release may not be comparable to similar information made public by companies that report according to u s standards while the sec modernization rules are purported to be substantially similar to the cim definition standards readers are cautioned that there are differences between the sec modernization rules and the cim definitions standards accordingly there is no assurance any mineral resources that the company may report as measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources under ni 43 101 would be the same had the company

investors are constantly searching for the next big winner we mean the stocks that are on track to see explosive growth handsomely rewarding the investors that managed to get onboard at the right time but how are investors supposed to know when it s time to snap up the right stock the street s seasoned pros tell investors that compelling investments can be found among names that have stumbled lately rockiness in share prices can present a unique opportunity to get in on the action before the stock heats up taking this into consideration we ve used tipranks database to pinpoint 3 tickers with strong growth narratives that remain intact despite recent weakness if this wasn t promising enough each of the names has received enough bullish calls in the last three months to be given a strong buy consensus rating marathon digital holdings mara the first beaten down stock we re looking at is marathon digital holdings one of the us s biggest bitcoin miners the company operates a data center in hardin montana with a maximum power capacity of 105 megawatts that said aiming to become 100 carbon neutral by the end of 2022 the company has pledged to move out of the coal powered facility by q3 at a co hosted facility in north dakota marathon also owns 2 060 top of the line asic bitcoin miners the company has set its sights on expansion by mid 2022 marathon is on schedule to install a total of 133 000 miners generating around 13 3 exahash while it also remains on track to meet its hashrate guidance of 23 3 exahash per second eh s by early 2023 to reach that goal the company is setting up shop at compute north s new 300 megawatt texas data center which will become home to marathon digital s recently purchased bitcoin miners 73 000 of them however there have been delays in the installation and despite producing a record 1 259 btc in q1 2022 amounting to a 556 year over year uptick the lack of new rig installs in march saw figures miss analysts expectations unfortunately for investors marathon digital stock has been falling and is down 80 from its november peak however this is not much of an issue for davidson analyst christopher brendler in fact brendler remains resolutely upbeat regarding marathon s prospects march results came in below expectations but we re bulled on the stock here the analyst said although estimates fall due to final tx delays and the move out of montana this is just timing and we re more confident in mara s growth trajectory with one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector and tx now finally opening we are increasingly confident marathon will be able to hit its remarkable hashrate goals from 4 eh s to 23 eh s by early 2023 accordingly brendler rates mara stock a buy while his 65 price target makes room for one year growth of a whooping 317 to watch brendler s track record click here other analysts agree based on buys only 4 in total the stock boasts a strong buy consensus rating moreover the average price target is a bullish one at 57 67 the figure suggests shares will climb 270 higher over the next 12 months see mara stock forecast on tipranks schrodinger sdgr let s move from crypto mining to a

company has received the backing of some very prominent investors namely the bill melinda gates foundation highlighting the growing adoption of its platform in q4 the last reported quarter software

schrodinger s guidance of 102 million 110 million jefferies michael yee notes the software segment is quite attractive but the analyst is mostly excited about the underappreciated biotech pipeline and

investors stock came in a lot in 2021 on a risk off environment especially as quarters were tepid until q4 they put up a strong q4 and guide and we think the stock could partially rebound in 2022 as

double over the one year timeframe to watch yee s track record click here the street is also in agreement on this one all 5 recent ratings are positive making the consensus view here a strong buy the

article 3 months old esg focus may 02 2022 richard rick mills ahead of the herd as a general rule the most successful man in life is the man who has the best information the green economy is one of the most important buzzwords of the 21st century it refers to an economy aimed at reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities while achieving sustainable development another well worn term the green economy fits hand in glove with esg as shareholders and institutional investors demand that companies place more emphases on environmental social and governance issues to be green an economy must not only be efficient but fair implying a just transition to an economy that is low carbon resource efficient and socially inclusive all well and good but as kevin o leary of dragon s den fame stated on more than once occasion how do i make money below are our top five reasons for investing in the green economy new commodity super cycle analysts including goldman sachs global head of commodities research jeff currie have repeatedly stated that we are bearing witness to the beginning of a decade long commodity super cycle unlike the last cycle driven by china s hunger for fuels metals building materials and foodstuffs this new commodity super cycle will be fueled by green metals needed for technologies that mitigate the negative effects of climate change indeed the transition towards a green economy can only be accomplished with renewable power electric vehicles and energy storage technologies all of these require lots of minerals in fact the amount of raw materials we ll need to extract from the earth to feed this green energy transition is staggering according to bloombergnef it would take 10 252 tons of aluminum 3 380 tons of polysilicon and 18 5 tons of silver to manufacture solar panels with a 1gw gigawatt capacity wind turbines need steel copper aluminum nickel and other materials to construct wind infrastructure with the power capacity of one gigawatt bnef found that 154 352 tons of steel 2 866 tons of copper and 387 tons of aluminum would be needed for lithium ion batteries the key metals are copper aluminum lithium nickel cobalt and manganese bnef estimates that it would take 1 731 tons of copper 1 202 tons of aluminum and 729 tons of lithium to manufacture 1gwh gigawatt hour batteries all in all bnef estimates that the global transition will require about 173 trillion in energy supply and infrastructure investment over the next three decades until then every commodity under the sun will be gobbled up the need for metals that feed into the new commodity super cycle is just one reason to invest in the green economy below are four others we have identified climate change the climate on planet earth is changing and a lot faster than many had anticipated droughts are impacting food production in canada and the united states lowering crop yields and causing ranchers to cull part of their herds stubbornly high natural gas prices are being reflected in record high fertilizer costs lake mead america s largest manmade reservoir and a source of water for millions just fell to an unprecedented low a 2017 research paper found that each degree celsius increase would on average reduce global yields of wheat by 6 rice by 3 2 maize by 7 4 and soybeans by 3 1 these foods provide two thirds of human caloric intake a new study showed more than a fifth of global food output growth has been lost to climate change since the 1960s putting an estimated 34 million people on the brink of famine not to be glib but with crisis comes opportunity among the agricultural commodities that have risen sharply due to a combination of climate change and the war in ukraine are the three most important food staples rice corn and wheat mined commodities that we can draw a straight line to from climate change include ev battery metals lithium graphite nickel cobalt and manganese as evidence of global warming mounts the greater the incentive to accelerate the shift to carbon free electric vehicles and sources of electricity raising the demand for these metals also in the mix are palladium and platinum platinum group metals used to make catalytic converters that filter pollutants from traditional vehicles gas powered cars and hybrids are considered to be transitional technologies as automakers shift to fully electric models climate change plays into shortages for certain metals described in detail below in chile for example drought conditions in the country s arid north are forcing mining companies to desalinate water for mineral processing the added cost pressure is affecting production leading to higher metal prices bmo estimates the top copper producing country s 2022 production has slowed to a pace where it could be lower than 2004 when mine output was slightly over 5 4 million tonnes equivalent to just 37 of the world s production beyond rising metal and crop prices that attract investors clean energy is obviously good for the environment a 2020 report from the environmental defense fund and datu research found the number of annual severe weather disasters has increased four fold since 1980 costing us taxpayers more than 1 75 trillion according to edf multiple analyses reveal that stimulus support for key elements of a clean economy is a smart way to generate good paying jobs that can help lift the us out of the recession and sustain long term growth one study found that clean energy investments create three times more jobs than an equivalent investment in fossil fuels green infrastructure the new super cycle being touted by goldman sachs and others is tied to the infrastructure deficits many countries need to try to reduce in many places around the world basic infrastructure such as roads bridges water sewer systems etc have all been poorly maintained and require hefty investments measured in trillions of dollars to bring them up to the standards of a modern economy more spending will be needed on things like smart power grids 5g and high speed rail china the world s biggest commodities consumer has committed to spending at least 14 8 trillion yuan us 2 3 trillion this year on thousands of major projects according to bloomberg reports the us is looking to keep up with its own trillion dollar infrastructure package which will be spent on roads bridges power water systems transit rail electric vehicles and upgrades to broadband airports ports and waterways among many other items for such plans to work they will need an extensive amount of minerals to build the required infrastructure and will have to compete with one another plus every other country to do so driving commodity prices higher it s no wonder that analysts are now super bullish on commodities china despite keeping a lower profile when it comes to commodities consumption than during the last super cycle from 2003 11 arguably china will continue to need more commodities than the rest for traditional infrastructure think roads bridges airports etc green projects needing a broad range of electrification decarbonization metals and to feed an expanding and evolving manufacturing base now that the country has done all it needs to do to urbanize and having acquired the metals indeed locked up most of the world s minerals to build the infrastructure for its belt and road initiative china s next mission is to become the world s high tech manufacturing hub previously building more highways railways and airports the traditional blacktop infrastructure were seen as a way to stabilize the economy but they resulted in a large increase in local government debts amid unregulated spending sprees beijing has therefore taken steps to prevent these debts and is advocating for so called new infrastructure including 5g ultra high voltage power transmission big data centers industrial internet and artificial intelligence towards this goal the ministry of finance has allocated us 188 billion worth of bonds that local authorities are urged to issue to fund construction projects and to leverage private investment not only has china outspent the united states and led the world on infrastructure investments it has also worked relentlessly over the past decade to lock up the world s metals creating import dependencies for a number of key minerals in the us and other western countries metal shortages referring to the bloomberg commodity spot index which hit a new record earlier this year driven in part by surging oil prices goldman sach s jeff currie said he s never seen commodity markets pricing in the shortages they are right now source investing com i ve been doing this 30 years and i ve never seen markets like this the commodity expert said in a bloomberg tv interview this is a molecule crisis we re out of everything i don t care if it s oil gas coal copper aluminum you name it we re out of it lingering supply chain issues from covid and the war in ukraine have made these pressures even stronger nickel prices spiked following the invasion of ukraine by russia a major supplier of the base metal through state owned miner norilsk as far as transitioning to a green economy we still have ways to go because at the current rate the supply of almost every mineral on earth is under threat copper for example is seeing its cupboard dry up thanks to a dearth of new discoveries and lack of capital spending on mine development in recent years analytics firm s p global predicts that due to a shortage of projects copper supply will lag demand as soon as 2025 in 20 years bloombergnef says copper miners need to double the amount of global copper production just to meet the demand for a 30 penetration rate of electric vehicles from the current 20mt a year to 40mt remember copper is already one of the most consumed industrial metals on the planet and the bellwether for the global economy the commodity will always be in great demand and the threat of a decades long supply shortage should keep its price elevated another commodity garnering increased attention is lithium the key ingredient in electric vehicle batteries many have predicted that the ev revolution would eventually strip away our supply of the metal and this year it looks like this will finally happen further demand growth in ev sales will mean a lithium deficit this year as use of the material outstrips production and depletes stockpiles predicts s p global according to its december report supply is forecast to jump to 636 000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent in 2022 up from an estimated 497 000 in 2021 but demand will jump even higher to 641 000 tonnes from an estimated 504 000 tonnes lithium carbonate prices in china have nearly doubled this year a signal that a demand supply gap is imminent many other commodities from battery minerals like nickel cobalt and graphite to oil and natural gas are also surging with supply concerns and disruptions hitting every corner of the global economy prices for these metals have already been rising for awhile but we and others believe they have much further to go as stock markets churn due to the war weak earnings from the tech giants inflation and rising interest rates now would be an excellent time to examine your options for making a long term investment in the green economy richard

by dominique patton beijing reuters the protracted lockdown in shanghai china s financial hub is slowing the nation s normally booming meat trade with stringent covid 19 measures causing logistics logjams across the food industry in a sign of the broadening disruptions to business the challenge of moving food in and around shanghai whose residents are into a month long stressful home isolation highlights similar problems in many other chinese cities as beijing persists with its controversial zero covid strategy despite growing risks to its economy china is the world s biggest buyer of meat bringing in more than 9 million tonnes last year worth about 32 billion and the financial hub with a thriving dining scene accounts for the largest chunk of imports traders rely on shanghai s ideal location for distributing product around the country but since an outbreak of covid 19 cases forced a lockdown in the city at the end of march moving chilled or frozen products has become a costly headache unloading containers is actually ok the real issue is logistics out of the harbour getting trucks and drivers to pick up the product said soeren tinggaard vice president at the pinggu retail foodservice business for pork processor danish crown frequent covid tests lengthy quarantines and long clearance times to enter shanghai have kept many drivers away while fewer refrigerated trucks are available because of special licensing requirements imports pressured other food products including dairy and edible oils have also been stuck in the shanghai port while beef imports into the city have dropped 23 year on year in march taken together with other cities under covid 19 restrictions the data suggests food exporters like brazil the united states and australia are facing pressure on their trade with the world s second biggest economy australian beef exports to china fell 10 year on year in march when the lockdown had just started while overall pork imports fell 70 pork imports could plunge as much as 30 this year because of the logistics woes compared with a previous estimate of 10 said pan chenjun senior analyst at rabobank u s meat processor tyson foods nyse said this week it has diverted meat shipments to other markets until the situation eases brazilian exporters have cancelled shipments and stopped booking new cargo a source told reuters the shanghai port congestion has also impacted customers elsewhere in china since april 1 i haven t got a single piece of meat said a beijing based trader who normally receives about 3 million yuan 453 995 16 worth of beef each month from shanghai a two tonne shipment of chilled u s beef worth about 400 000 yuan that arrived more than a month ago is becoming a concern said the trader if it s still there after 70 days most of my customers won t want it anymore he said declining to be identified because of the sensitivity of speaking out about covid measures new challenge everyday for now the sharply weaker consumption due to covid restrictions is keeping a lid on prices though it could become a problem the longer the lockdowns persist all these logistics issues are adding cost into the supply chain which ultimately leads to food inflation said andrew cox singapore based general manager of international markets at trade body meat and livestock australia some traders are rerouting product to other ports in china but deliveries are slow and even then costs are mounting as cities roll out their own stepped up covid protocols for trucks arriving into beijing product goes to designated central warehouses where it is tested for covid 19 once released some importers have been told they must hold it for up to 14 days and carry out more covid tests tianjin requires covid tests on all chilled and frozen foods including one test on the inside of the packaging said another beijing importer for a bag of wagyu beef worth about 2 000 yuan that s a lot of money down the drain every day brings a new challenge for the f b industry he said 1 6 4408 renminbi 1 6 6080 chinese yuan renminbi
state sen ryan fazio r greenwich speaks at a press conference outside the armstrong court public housing complex in the chickahominy section of greenwich conn tuesday feb 8 2022 local and state elected officials joined greenwich housing authority officials to speak out against the 8 30g law which is a state mandated target of 10 percent of the housing in each community deemed as affordable tyler sizemore hearst connecticut media one size fits all over the past two years the strongest proponents of applying one size to the use of land have accused housing diversity advocates of promoting a one size fits all policy an interesting projection the 18 municipalities in the region of the state known as the western ct council of governments westcog which includes greenwich are zoned on average to allow for single family homes as of right on 95 5 percent of the region s land this certainly has a one size look advertisement article continues below this ad highlighting this one size single family land use is that on average the municipalities in this same region are zoned for as of right multi family housing on 2 1 percent of the region s land at an april 2021 demonstration in fairfield that denounced state legislative proposals for more diverse and affordable housing state sen tony hwang r fairfield defended the single family land use pattern by arguing that proponents of the controversial legislation were advocating for a one size fits all policy i m not saying that we should stay with the status quo he said i m simply saying that the solution being offered right now by hartford is a one size fits all that takes away and disrespects the personal property rights of owners and residents of every community in the state of connecticut not the status quo the rejection of legislation that would have permitted greater density and more diverse housing opportunities as of right in downtown areas and near transit hubs in connecticut municipalities certainly appears to defend the one size fits all single family status quo advertisement article continues below this ad change is difficult it invites resistance it mobilizes defenders of the status quo it engenders hostility but without significant change the state faced with a serious housing shortage will never meet its overall housing needs much less produce an adequate supply of housing affordable to households of moderate low and extremely low income a national low income housing coalition report released in march 2021 found a national shortage of 7 million homes affordable to extremely low income households at and below the poverty level or at and below 30 percent of their area median income connecticut has 148 502 extremely low income households but only 61 785 rental units that are affordable to them leaving a shortfall of 86 717 units for extremely low income households affordable housing requires multi family development and greater concentrations of density than is currently permitted in most connecticut municipalities the proponents of increased housing supply and greater diversity of housing choices want such density to be permitted in downtown areas and near bus and rail stations they advocate for statewide land use policies that address the state s housing needs by allowing for more affordable equitable integrated and environmentally sustainable development statewide policy multi family density low income advertisement article continues below this ad these concepts pose a threat to those who are invested in the one size single family status quo especially threatening is the idea of a statewide policy that could interfere with local zoning that protects this status quo although the legislative proposals are not about government regulation but rather about removing local regulations that prevent market forces from addressing housing need these proposals are perceived as state government taking away local government control it s really all about ensuring that local zoning restrictions maintain the status quo the westcog affordable housing plan still in draft form is illustrative it doesn t call out regulatory barriers that exclude affordable housing it doesn t call upon municipalities to allow as of right multi family housing and rather than encourage municipal investment in infrastructure to support multifamily housing it validates infrastructure as an anti development argument it fails to acknowledge the region s racial and income segregation most disturbing is the plan s perversion of the intent of the 8 30g statutory provisions that allow developers to submit applications inconsistent with local zoning regulations if conforming to an 8 30g affordable housing formula the intent of this 1989 legislation with an exemption threshold for municipalities with 10 percent affordable housing stock was to break through exclusionary zoning barriers not mandate 10 percent affordable units nor even set a 10 percent goal advertisement article continues below this ad the westcog plan applies 10 percent to the entire region and proposes individual municipalities below 10 percent buy their way out from municipalities with units in excess of that threshold stamford norwalk danbury this ensures continued exclusivity within the region while concentrating affordable housing in three cities exactly what

pse drops 2 5 to the 6 700 level for the first time in 8 months personally it s always seemed like a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy to me a bunch of traders just waiting for the first sign of weakness to unload and run from the market just creates an additional weakness that reinforces the belief the value of the psei dropped by 2 5 to the 6 700 level for the first time since august of last year the index is down 10 from its 2022 high of 7 502 that we hit back in early february the last two times the index dropped to this level it eventually made its way all the way down to the 6 200 level before recovering thankfully the associated recoveries were v shaped which is a slang financial term for a quick recovery after a quick decline mb bottom line i guess we re all just hoping that market conviction returns once the volume comes back but that might be a little bit of a chicken and egg problem because we have a couple of issues on the horizon that might make things interesting the first is that some traders have enthusiastically adopted the american saying sell in may and go away which refers to the perceived under performance of the market during the may through october period i know a few people that follow this saying and i actually know one trader that follows this guide robotically by trading out of their positions on the first trading day in may personally it s always seemed like a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy to me a bunch of traders just waiting for the first sign of weakness to unload and run from the market just creates an additional weakness that reinforces the belief from a historical perspective we don t even have to look any further than last year to see a time when following the sim ga saying would have been a mistake since the market went up over 15 between may and november with the market going up 5 during the month of may alone we are also very likely to see the bsp raise interest rates in june generally when the cost of renting money goes up this puts downward pressure on the potential future cash flows of most companies and stock prices tend to fall rising rates will also make fixed income products marginally less attractive like reits and bonds the impact isn t even and in some cases like banks rising rates can actually be pretty good for business oh yeah and that whole election thing can t forget about the election merkado barkada is a free daily newsletter on the pse investing and business in the philippines you can subscribe to the newsletter or follow on twitter to receive the full daily updates merkado barkada s opinions are provided for informational purposes only and should not be considered a recommendation to buy or sell any particular stock these daily articles are not updated with new information so each investor must do his or her own due diligence before trading as the facts and figures in each particular article may have changed

the week ahead is packed with several central bank meetings and important high frequency economic data the week begins off with china s april pmi over the weekend the world s second largest economy is being hit by the lockdowns as part of the policy response to the outbreak of covid however the economic impact seems somewhat milder than when the pandemic first arose in q1 20 and the economy shrank by 10 3 quarter over quarter still more stimulus measures from beijing and the pboc seem likely the reserve bank of australia meets on may 3 the market s perception of the likelihood of a hike increased markedly after last week s stronger than expected q1 cpi it rose to 5 1 year over year from 3 5 in q4 21 and was above the 4 6 median bloomberg survey forecast the underlying measures quickened to above 3 and more than expected before the inflation report the cash rate futures implied a 1 in 4 chance of a 25 bp hike now there is about a 60 chance of a such a move but a 15 bp move is fully discounted previously the conventional wisdom was that the rba would wait for june after the may 21 elections like other central banks governor lowe emphasized developments in the labor market perhaps the pullback in the australian dollar 4 2 in april provides extra encouragement but it should not be over emphasized the rba s trade weighted index did pull back after approaching last year s high but it is still relatively firm and near mid march levels almost 6 above the late january low the federal reserve meets on may 4 a 50 bp hike is a foregone conclusion the fed funds futures market has priced a 50 bp hike not only at this meeting but also at the following three meetings june july and september the federal reserve will also announce its balance sheet roll off strategy the forward guidance has suggested a short ramp up period in june and reaching a maximum of 95 bln a month investors and reporters may have some questions about the bill holdings and if the fed would consider selling some mbs outright to achieve its goals the market has shown a recent pattern by which it reacts one way to the fed s statement and reverses it during chair powell s press conference the economic highlight is the april employment report at the end of the week the early estimate is for around a 400k gain in nonfarm payrolls under normal circumstances it would be regarded as robust however if the forecast is accurate it would be the smallest increase since last april subject to revisions job growth averaged 562k in q1 22 still and even if average earnings growth slows powell s assessment that the labor market is strong perhaps too strong will not interrupt the fed s expeditious course to neutrality the bank of england and norway s norges bank meet on may 5 despite some poor economic data including the squeeze on the cost of living that has seen retail sales excluding gasoline falling in nine of the past 11 months the market is confident that the boe will deliver its fourth hike in the cycle that began in december that will lift the bank rate to 1 0 the swaps market is looking at another 100 125 bp hikes this year also on may 5 england and wales hold local elections the tories do not appear to be doing well prime minister johnson will come under pressure but a compelling alternative does not jump out now that chancellor sunak s support has waned note that sein fein looks poised to oust the democratic unionist party to lead northern ireland s assembly the norges bank has also lifted rates three times already and the deposit rate stands at 0 75 the underlying rate of inflation which excludes energy and adjusts for tax changes stood at a relatively mild 2 1 in march the krone has been no match for the dollar but it has appreciated against most of its major trading partners this year the recent weakness is unlikely to be sufficient to spur the norges bank into faster action after hiking last september december and march this year it will likely wait for the june meeting to hike again tokyo s april cpi will be reported at the end of next week tokyo s cpi is reported ahead of the national figures but provides a good economic tell the april report is important because the cut in mobile service prices last april drop out of the 12 month comparison this means that tokyo and by extension japan s consumer price measure will jump the phone charges are thought to be worth around one percentage point and this is what the market is anticipating as a result the headline pace rises to 2 3 from 1 3 and the core rate which excludes fresh food may increase to 1 8 from 0 8 it means that the measure that excludes fresh food and energy will turn positive for the first time since march 2021 however the boj will see through it and the new fiscal measures are projected to reduce consumer inflation by around half of a percentage point in the may september period four other central banks of note meet next week two from south america and two from central europe with next week s hikes brazil and chile are maybe 1 or 2 hikes away from being done a 100 bp hike in the brazilian selic rate brings it to 12 75 the latest cpi reading puts inflation slightly above 12 year over year the swaps market looks for rates to peak near 13 5 chile s cpi is closer to 9 and its policy rate is 7 the last two hikes january and march were 150 bp each and before that the central bank hiked twice by 125 bp it raised rates by a total of 100 bp in june and july last year the swaps market envisions 155 bp tightening over the next six months for the peak poland and czech central banks have wood to chop with march inflation around 11 and 12 7 poland s central bank has hiked rates at each of the last seven meetings for a total of 440 bp it hiked by 100 bp in april and another hike of that magnitude appears likely the swaps market looks for a peak near 6 next year the czech repo rate is at 5 0 the central bank has also hiked rates at its last seven meetings for 475 bp in total it dialed back its hikes after 125 bp and 100 bp moves last november and december to 75 bp and 50 bp in february and march a 50 bp hike is the most likely scenario the market also looks for the czech rate to peak near 6 next year turning now to the price action in the foreign exchange market despite or because of naysayers is trading new multi year highs against the euro and sterling the greenback may begin consolidating the gains that took it to 20 year highs against the yen chinese efforts to slow the yuan s descent appear to have done the trick and broken the strong downside momentum the unusual politburo statement ahead of the weekend and extended holiday is conducive of a consolidation phase after a sharp decline and with signals of policy support forthcoming chinese stocks may draw some new attention dollar index the six day rally ended before the weekend with the help of china s allusion to more economic support for the world s second largest economy the modest pullback was only the third decline since march 30 it barely slipped through the previous day s low and was marginally inside the upper bollinger band 103 35 the momentum indicators are stretched but do not appear to rule out a new high it may take a break of the 101 80 102 35 band to signal a correction instead of a flattish consolidation april s nearly 5 net gain is the largest monthly rise since january 2015 euro the euro bounced ahead of the weekend to snap a six day fall that took it from around 1 0850 to almost 1 0470 its lowest level since early 2017 the momentum indicators are over extended but do not appear poised to turn higher yet the squeeze that carried the single currency to almost 1 06 before the weekend was met with new selling and it settled in the middle of the day s range there is more talk about a test on 1 00 parity ahead of it the 2017 low 1 0340 may offer the next target given the sharpness of the euro s decline a move above the 1 0650 1 0700 area is needed to cause the bears any pain japanese yen the boj s signals of its intent to defend the 0 25 cap on the 10 year cap indefinitely broke the dollar out of the pennant or flag formation and sent it to jpy131 25 the boj governor recognized that rapid moves are not helpful for businesses but saw the weaker yen as a net positive force for the economy overall the finance minister s rhetoric is gradually strengthening but intervention ahead of what is expected to be a 50 bp fed hike is highly unlikely ahead of the weekend and with tokyo markets closed for a holiday the dollar found support near jpy129 40 some lighter activity during the holiday period may be conducive for consolidation maybe the lower end of the range may be in the jpy128 60 jpy129 00 area on the other hand a move toward jpy135 would likely coincide with us 10 year yields pushing above 3 british pound sterling dropped like a rock too since reaching a high a little shy of 1 31 and reversing lower on april 21 sterling nearly declined seven cents to almost 1 24 on april 28 it has not been lower since july 2020 the six day slide ended before the weekend amid the broader dollar pullback before the bounce sterling had settled five consecutive sessions below the lower bollinger band the macd looks poised to turn higher and appears to be a little ahead of the slow stochastic the next important chart point is around 1 2250 meanwhile the 1 2670 area offers the nearby cap a bout of short covering could lift sterling further ahead of the boe meeting the swaps market has a 25 bp hike fully discounted now and another at the june meeting the market appears nearly evenly divided between a 25 bp and 50 bp move at the august meeting canadian dollar the us dollar has extended its pullback into a third session ahead of the weekend when the dramatic decline in us equities turned it around the greenback s small correction stalled near cad1 2720 the 38 2 retracement of the advance from the april 21 low cad1 2460 the macd and slow stochastic are still rising suggesting a re test of the cad1 2880 cad1 2900 ceiling canada has a solid macroeconomic story but it has been overshadowed by the broad gains for the greenback the unwinding of the commodity currency theme as questions raised over chinese demand and the risk off mood the correlation between changes in the exchange rate and the s p 500 over the last 30 sessions is about 0 60 which is about twice the inverse correlation with oil 30 a break of cad1 27 could spur a move into the cad1 2620 cad1 2640 area australian dollar the aussie has fallen out of bed coming into this month it appreciated in seven of the past eight weeks starting with the week ending april 1 it has fallen for five consecutive weeks the latest leg down was brutal after peaking near 0 7460 on april 21 the australian dollar fell by about 5 25 to the low on april 28 by 0 7055 that was the lowest level since early february the pre weekend bounce stalled around 0 7180 it must get above 0 7200 to be meaningful it seems more likely to retest the year s low set in late january near 0 6970 the risk of a deeper decline toward 0 6850 may be growing the macd looks like it can turn higher soon but the slow stochastic may take longer the rba meets and if it does not hike the cash target rate by at least 15 bp the aussie may be vulnerable to a new bout of selling the swaps market has discounted about 245 bp of tightening this year that seems too aggressive and an adjustment could also leave the currency vulnerable mexican peso when everything is said and done the mexican peso proved itself relatively resilient in april to the greenback s surge the peso fell by about 2 6 in the month less than all the major currencies but the canadian dollar the dollar recouped half of what it lost from the early march high near mxn21 4675 it stalled after reaching almost mxn20 64 the initial pullback found slightly below mxn20 29 this seems like a rather shallow pullback warning of the risk of a new attempt higher next week that said the momentum indicators may be poised to turn lower in the coming days a break of mxn20 20 would undermine the dollar s technical tone chinese yuan the dollar gapped higher against the yuan on april 25 and has not looked back the gap would be particularly significant in a less controlled currency because it appears on the weekly charts the dramatic losses in the euro and yen put downward pressure on the yuan which the pboc says is managed against a trade weighted basket the pboc s 1 cut in required reserves for foreign currency deposits was seen as a tepid protest more a warning the dollar s surge extended to cny6 65 before the politburo s pledge of more economic support which sent it to about cny6 5850 with mainland markets closed for the first three sessions next week cnh will be monitored more closely as typically happens when the yuan falls the offshore yuan falls faster the spread between the two is the largest of the year e g the dollar settled at cny6 6080 and cnh6 6400 consolidation over the next few days may serve nearly everyone s interest arguing backward from the 20th party congress later this year where china s xi is expected to take a third term there must be a desire to provide a good economic backdrop it is partly a function of the covid response and partly a function of the economic stewardship

for the first professor v practitioner debate of the 2022 inta annual meeting christine farley and tiffany shimada argued over whether brand owners should be legally entitled to control depictions of their branded goods and services in creative works shimada shareholder at greenberg traurig in utah took the position that they should while farley professor at american university washington college of law in washington dc argued that they shouldn t moderator joel feldman co chair of greenberg traurig s trademark and brand management group in atlanta asked the audience to give a yes or nay at the beginning and end of the session to indicate whether they agreed or disagreed with the argument that brand owners should have more control most members responded nay at the beginning and end taking farley s side protecting peloton shimada kicked off the debate by arguing that the rogers test which is used to determine whether the use of trademarks in creative works is protected by free speech was nearly impossible for creators to fail the rogers test sets out that the title of an artistic work is protected under free speech when it has some artistic relevance to the underlying work and the title isn t explicitly misleading as to the source of the content of the work shimada went on to argue that brands having a say was important because their businesses could be harmed by their depictions in media she highlighted the premier of the sex and the city revival in which the love interest big died after using a peloton bike as an example she noted that the exercise bike company s stock decreased 11 on the day of the premier and declined a further 5 the next day perhaps this was just bad timing but there was real calculable harm done to peloton as a result of the artistic choice to kill off a main character with its brand she said she concluded that there should be a middle road that would allow creators to use brands to tell stories but give said brands some level of control favouring freedom when farley took the floor she jokingly asked shimada to recuse herself given that she and the moderator were from the same firm noting that shimada had an unfair advantage for being exceedingly likable her request was unsurprisingly denied farley argued that the proposed resolution of giving brand owners more control over creative works would impoverish expression she said it was important for creators to be able to use brands because they were important tools to develop characters or set scenes can you imagine a rich guy from manhattan on a stationary bike using anything but peloton that s unlikely q a feldman the moderator asked each of the speakers if they could articulate a scenario in which the use of a trademark in a creative work could have zero artistic value farley at american university said it generally wouldn t be a good idea for the courts to determine whether there was artistic relevance but she noted that if an awards show decided to call itself the oscars that could be a case of someone making a deliberate choice to confuse and in which there was no artistic relevance shimada at greenberg traurig answering the same question came up with a scenario in which an antagonist needed a coffee cup on set and someone happened to have a starbucks cup lying around and used the cup in the scene now we ve damaged the brand without any intent she said feldman also asked shimada whether brand owners should lose control over how their marks were depicted if they chose to place advertisements in public places such as times square and a scene was later filmed in that area that included said mark in the background shimada said she expected businesses would take that scenario into account when choosing to advertise in public spaces she said that would be ok for some brands bad news is fine for many brands because they re still in the news she noted the inta annual meeting is being held this week at the walter e washington convention center in washington dc

russian businessman oleg tinkov attends the st petersburg international economic forum in saint petersburg russia on june 6 2019 olga maltseva afp tns oleg y tinkov was worth more than 9 billion in november renowned as one of russia s few self made business tycoons after building his fortune outside the energy and minerals industries that were the playgrounds of russian kleptocracy then last month tinkov the founder of one of russia s biggest banks criticized the war in ukraine in a post on instagram the next day he said president vladimir putin s administration contacted his executives and threatened to nationalize his bank if it did not cut ties with him last week he sold his 35 stake to a russian mining billionaire in what he describes as a desperate sale a fire sale that was forced on him by the kremlin i couldn t discuss the price tinkov said it was like a hostage you take what you are offered i couldn t negotiate advertisement article continues below this ad tinkov 54 spoke to the new york times by phone sunday from a location he would not disclose in his first interview since putin invaded ukraine he said he had hired bodyguards after friends with contacts in the russian security services told him he should fear for his life and quipped that while he had survived leukemia perhaps the kremlin will kill me it was a swift and jarring turn of fortune for a longtime billionaire who for years had avoided running afoul of putin while portraying himself as independent of the kremlin his downfall underscores the consequences facing those in the russian elite who dare to cross their president and helps explain why there has been little but silence from business leaders who according to tinkov are worried about the impact of the war on their lifestyles and their wallets indeed tinkov claimed that many of his acquaintances in the business and government elite told him privately that they agreed with him but they are all afraid in the interview tinkov spoke out more forcefully against the war than has any other major russian business leader advertisement article continues below this ad i ve realized that russia as a country no longer exists tinkov said predicting that putin would stay in power a long time i believed that the putin regime was bad but of course i had no idea that it would take on such catastrophic scale the kremlin did not respond to a request for comment tinkoff the bank tinkov started in 2006 denied his characterization of events and said there had been no threats of any kind against the bank s leadership the bank which announced last thursday that tinkov had sold his entire stake in the company to a firm run by vladimir potanin a mining magnate close to putin appeared to be distancing itself from its founder oleg has not been in moscow for many years did not participate in the life of the company and was not involved in any matters tinkoff said in a statement advertisement article continues below this ad tinkov has also run into trouble in the west he agreed to pay 507 million last year to settle a tax fraud case in the united states in march britain included him on a list of sanctions against the russian business elite these oligarchs businesses and hired thugs are complicit in the murder of innocent civilians and it is right that they pay the price foreign secretary liz truss said at the time tinkov is nevertheless widely seen as a rare russian business pioneer modeling his maverick capitalism on richard branson and morphing from irreverent beer brewer to founder of one of the world s most sophisticated online banks he says he has never set foot in the kremlin and he has occasionally criticized putin but unlike russian tycoons who years ago broke with putin and now live in exile such as former oil magnate mikhail b khodorkovsky or tech entrepreneur pavel durov tinkov found a way to coexist with the kremlin and make billions at least until april 19 advertisement article continues below this ad that is when tinkov published an emotional anti war post on instagram calling the invasion crazy and deriding russia s military why would we have a good army he asked if everything else in the country is dysfunctional and mired in nepotism servility and subservience pro war russians posted photos of their shredded tinkoff debit cards on social media vladimir solovyov a prominent state television host delivered a tirade against him declaring your conscience is rotten tinkov was already outside russia at that point having departed in 2019 to receive treatment for leukemia he later stepped down and ceded control of tinkoff but kept a 35 stake in the company which was valued at more than 20 billion on the london stock exchange last year a day after the april 19 post tinkov said sunday the kremlin contacted the bank s senior executives and told them that any association with their founder was now a major problem advertisement article continues below this ad they said the statement of your shareholder is not welcomed and we will nationalize your bank if he doesn t sell it and the owner doesn t change and if you don t change the name tinkov said citing sources at tinkoff he declined to identify on april 22 tinkoff announced it would change its name this year a step it claims was long planned behind the scenes tinkov says he was scrambling to sell his stake one that had already been devalued by western sanctions against russia s financial system tinkov said he was thankful to potanin the mining magnate for allowing him to salvage at least some money from his company he said that he could not disclose a price but that he had sold at 3 of what he believed to be his stake s true value they made me sell it because of my pronouncements tinkov said i sold it for kopecks advertisement article continues below this ad he had been considering selling his stake anyway tinkov said because as long as putin is alive i doubt anything will change i don t believe in russia s future he said most importantly i am not prepared to associate my brand and my name with a country that attacks its neighbors without any reason at all tinkov is concerned that a foundation he started that is dedicated to improving blood cancer treatment in russia could also become a casualty of his financial trouble he denied that he was speaking out in the hopes of getting the u k sanctions against him lifted although he said he hoped the british government would eventually correct this mistake advertisement article continues below this ad he said that his illness he is now suffering from graft versus host disease a stem cell transplant complication he said might have made him more courageous about speaking out than other russian business leaders and senior officials members of the elite he claimed are in shock about the war and have called him in great numbers to offer support they understand that they are tied to the west that they are part of the global market and so on tinkov said they re fast fast being turned into iran but they don t like it they want their kids to spend their summer holidays in sardinia tinkov said that no one from the kremlin had ever

was top qualifier and won the event i m trying to find myself on the christmas tree that s always a job for me i m a mood swinging person and i ve got to keep a lid on it you can have the best car and lose and you can have the worst car and win because i ve proved it force said what he proved is that he still can put together a team that can help him win and that he still can capitalize on it behind the wheel the 16 time champion will turn 73 years old on may 4 and he said this gave me confidence i think that i can race i m still out here winning races let s keep this sport alive that is my ultimate goal he said people ask me what i m trying to accomplish i want my grandkids if they wish to see what i ve loved for over 40 years of my career i just love it out here force fourth in the funny car standings said things just seem to happen where you re destined to win it was amazing on some days magical things just happen things went right and we were able to win the race it was like it was destiny and it was a great weekend for my team to finally get a win this year gives me a lot of confidence he has more four wide victories than anyone in his category top fuel s steve torrence has six and pro stocks erica enders has three this is the 34th season in which force has won at least one race force dedicated the victory to eldest daughter adria hight who is recovering from a medical issue nhra national dragster mike salinas won for the second time this season in top fuel mike salinas wins again in top fuel salinas had problems on the first three of his four qualifying attempts but had himself and his pep boys scrappers dragster on point sunday when it counted in his initial qualifying opportunity friday salinas performed his burnout but couldn t get his dragster in reverse he later described the culprit as a broken clutch pedal nhra officials told him repeatedly to get out of the car in order not to hold up the other three racers at the starting line he complied then in his next turn friday he was docked five points for crossing the center line saturday didn t start much better with tire smoke in his third overall session finally he set the quickest pass of the session in his last chance and settled on the no 5 starting position he zipped away from cam ferré josh hart and spencer massey in the final round of eliminations sunday to record his second victory this season and his first at zmax dragway he moved up to second in the standings just 17 points behind leader brittany force as the camping world drag racing series heads north to virginia motorsports park south of richmond in two weeks this was only the seventh time in the past 26 races that neither steve torrence nor brittany force appeared in a final round we have a very very consistent car salinas said the consistency of the car the crew everybody on the team it s amazing rob flynn is an amazing crew chief all our runs in eliminations were in the 70s we ve worked so hard to get here most people don t understand this stuff is hard we re racing the best guys in the world but if you believe you belong here do the right things to stay here you re going to be here and you re going to win nhra national dragster steve johnson won for the 11th time in pro stock motorcycle steve johnson goes back to back in bikes steve johnson has just 11 wally statues for winning in the pro stock motorcycle class but giddy after claiming back to back success both at charlotte and on the tour following his triumph a week ago at houston he warned i m comin after you force you and anderson john force who joined him on the winners podium has an nhra best 155 victories greg anderson whose pro stock class was not on the schedule is next on the all time list at 99 victories not exactly making friends nhra cycle winner johnson rankles female racers these bikes they re so hard to ride perfectly johnson said we made some good runs today but it s never going to be an easy day in this class for us to win it s special and this track is always a special place anytime you can win and win a race at a bruton smith track you re killing it and doing a great job johnson won the first event ever at this venue in the fall of 2008 so this is his third victory at the circuit s newest racetrack even after a dozen years four wide racing still has issues the concept of four wide racing which bruton smith introduced to the modern era in 2010 at zmax dragway then expanded it to his las vegas property in 2018 still has its hiccups maybe the most glaring in sunday s eliminations was the messy pro modified final round stan shelton rolled his mustang past the starting line then backed up and staged again that automatically disqualified him because rules state that a driver cannot cross the starting line twice it happened at reading last fall to pro stock driver alan prusiensky in two wide format too so it s not exclusive to four wide racing capps new ride capps emotional over new partnership with toyota shelton s mistake appeared to have had a domino effect rickie smith then left the starting line before the christmas tree electronic starter activated so he was disqualified kris thorne and lyle barnett waited and were rewarded by being the drivers of record but they had abysmal reaction times thorne despite his uncharacteristic 320 light won the trophy barnett whose 150 start was way off a perfect 000 was runner up the first round of top fuel eliminations also had an unexplained timing malfunction no 1 qualifier justin ashley clearly won in that foursome and no 16

on a wet and windy thursday in october 1987 a crowd of bankers gathered at the headquarters of rothschild co in the heart of the city of london they were there to sign what was for many the biggest deal of their careers having been chosen by the uk government to sell its stake in the oil giant british petroleum at 7 2bn the deal was set to be the biggest share sale ever seen within hours it would all go horribly wrong that night london was hit by the biggest storm in 300 years for the first time since the blitz the city was plunged into darkness eighteen people lost their lives but another storm was about to hit financial markets one that would expose huge mistakes made by the banks and would leave them facing hundreds of millions of pounds in losses this episode of the syndicate tells how the biggest share sale in history very nearly didn t happen it s the story of how within hours of the banks committing to underwrite the deal stock markets around the world were hit by the biggest sell off since the great depression the crisis left one bank facing collapse because of its mammoth exposure while the 1987 crash was the main cause of the debacle the fallout was made that much worse because of a series of rash decisions by the banks at the time the uk was in the middle of a massive sale of state owned companies banks eyeing the long line of privatisations in the pipeline made a series of concessions to the uk government to win a place on the bp sale that would end up coming back to bite them nigel lawson who was chancellor of the exchequer came under huge pressure to cancel the sale the us banks on the deal lobbied james baker the us treasury secretary who called lawson to ask him to call off the deal when that didn t work the white house got involved imploring 10 downing street to intervene and rein in a chancellor who was insisting on holding banks to their commitments but lawson had also dug himself into a hole cancelling the deal would blow a 7 2bn hole in uk finances much of which had already been spent in a generous pre election budget as banks lobbied to invoke force majeure clause open warfare broke out between lawson and rothschild which was supposed to be advising the government but which he accused of switching sides eventually lawson had to find a way out just hours before the deal was supposed to officially launch with several banks already resigned to deep losses he stood up in parliament and announced a backdoor government bailout little did he know that in saving his own skin the deal and the banks he would create another political headache in the months that followed despite the drama the deal would leave a lasting impact on the capital markets of today the bp share sale broke a lot of new ground from a legal standpoint and would eventually become a blueprint for cross border equity deals in many ways and certainly from legal and structural perspectives the deal was groundbreaking and many of today s deals owe much to it to hear this episode and more like it for free and in full click one of the links below

if remote working is no longer to be temporary workers could revitalise previously remote areas well maybe olesya kuznetsova shutterstock com the pandemic has upset rules and habits long entrenched in our lives yet the most profound shift is arguably in how we understand and valuework most people have been prompted to re examine their role within their professional community assess their career prospects and reconsider their relationship with their bosses through accelerating a long overdue modernisation the pandemic has proved that working outside the office can be pleasant and advantageous for a wide range of employees and professionals many workers have chosen to move from cities to low density areas in their home regions or to migrate to sunnier climes thereby benefiting from the availability of ample space improved working conditions and a better quality of life over the last few years such south working remote working from rural and inland areas has become widely practised antiquated structures remote work as an organisational model was already available within the traditional regulatory arsenal if rarely implemented before 2020 but as a result of the lockdowns it has been tested on a large scale albeit in an exceptional regime this has reshuffled the characteristics of remote work voluntariness and alternation between the workplace and remote days partly redefining its purpose simultaneously antiquated organisational structures in which rigidities of function are coupled with presenteeism and control mania have reached a crisis point the absurdities of the top down approach have been revealed especially in light of the first reassuring data concerning the productivity of remote workers become a social europe member support independent publishing and progressive ideas by becoming a social europe member for less than 5 euro per month your support makes all the difference click here to become a member workers have overcome significant obstacles participated in impromptu upskilling and contributed responsibly to business continuity preliminary surveys have revealed a broad appreciation for these arrangements leading many large companies not necessarily technology oriented ones to give up their offices given the substantial savings and shrink face to face activities to advocate a return to the prior approach to work would be illogical it would waste a good crisis renouncing one of its most important legacies rather the urgent need is to transform flexible arrangements into an opportunity to achieve a better work life balance reduce gender inequalities and digitalise public administration new prospects the transformation facilitated by south working arrangements affects economic geography and social anthropology after centuries of the demographic development of places depending exclusively on their productive capacity the breaking of the aristotelian unity of place and work represents a copernican revolution for the mediterranean countries which have faced centuries of mass emigration the attractiveness of places is no longer solely dictated by economic activities but also by workers aspirations and choices thus new prospects emerge for those areas that have suffered apparently inexorable depopulation and brain drain in particular southern and inland areas characterised by a distance from essential services which makes everyday life difficult can shape an alternative future where local economies are revived and decline reversed policy makers in italy ireland spain greece croatia and the united states have incentivised counter intuitive housing choices to revitalise communities where aggressive measures are adopted such as houses being sold for a euro the aim is to rehabilitate the housing stock in other cases where local taxation is redesigned to promote the settlement of families the aim is to regenerate communities in harmony with their history and roots increasingly measures are being introduced to encourage remote work this requires offering incentives in terms of taxation critical infrastructure work related equipment and places that allow workers to socialise such as community co working spaces when the pandemic finally passes it will be crucial to measure whether and to what extent south working has contributed to the repopulation or even just slowed the depopulation of marginal areas such areas have a great opportunity albeit accompanied by a great challenge citizenship and public services cultural offerings and social liveability will have to become magnets or even the most romantic of places will lose their attractiveness and remain niche phenomena if not subject to outright speculation shortcomings and resistances the pandemic variant of remote work cannot be applicable to ordinary times yet the associated upheaval has highlighted the weaknesses of many organisations some of which have paid dearly for tardiness in updating their managerial culture in the public sector many shortcomings and resistances have been revealed ranging from a failure to digitise files to a shortage of mobile devices from poor planning to a lack of cybersecurity responsibility for such failures and oversights needs to be firmly attributed lest the resultant bottlenecks provide the perfect alibi for a backwardness which undermines the credibility of the sector unsupervised workers have shown unparalleled tenacity during the pandemic yet many bosses have replicated the panopticon workplace by developing not so infallible tools for measuring workers performance down to the second often with unconvincing or counterproductive results there have been excessive demands to keep track of every completed action turn on the camera to demonstrate that no distractions are present or attend excessive co ordination meetings to boost engagement betting on the crisis blowing over many organisations have refrained from investing in the redesign of organisational modules and appraisal mechanisms positive experiences there have also been many positive experiences where trust and flexibility responsibility and autonomy have been successfully combined yet the temptation is to apply a straitjacket such as restricting the number of days worked away from headquarters or banning remote working adjacent to the weekend while little is being done to develop evaluation schemes with the realisation of objectives rather than presenteeism as their yardstick digital tools can emancipate human capital from the most tiring and repetitive tasks yet this is generally neglected in favour of surveillance bordering on the authoritarian rather than chasing the latest project management or time tracking applications employers should value the unorthodox contributions diversity and creativity flexibility can foster remote working requires a cultural shift companies are starting to compete to attract talents not amenable to being squeezed into an unfulfilling nine to five role policy makers and social partners must be wary of implementing one size fits all solutions likely to fail due to their rigidity which is incompatible with the heterogeneity of economic operations the most effective solutions are those tailored to the needs of businesses and workers through constant and constructive social dialogue many qualitative studies have reported successful experiments in self management especially during phases of uncertainty convincing even the most sceptical to promote high quality contributions it is crucial to ensure full autonomy in time space and organisation so as to realise the emancipatory purpose of non standard arrangements balanced formula many claim that this approach would depreciate office spaces in city centres yet geographically centralised models have long impoverished the fabric of marginalised areas concerns have also been expressed about reduced socialisation with relationships mediated by screens but poorly designed offices can engender unsociable and even toxic environments perhaps most of all for women the positions of recruits and those who have always been disadvantaged as well as the weakening of already precarious collective solidarity are also at issue but there is a vast distance between the pandemic version of remote working and the authentic mode a more balanced formula would avoid a drift towards isolation while simultaneously fostering empowerment and trust south working facilitates spatial and social mobility thereby offering a channel to reverse the depopulation and cultural impoverishment of dream territories currently considered marginal in rural or inland areas remote working helps to mitigate gender gaps modernise productive sectors and make cities less congested and repulsive greater variability in living habits could reshape the balance between work and the environment in a virtuous way with 2030 just around the corner it is time to be pragmatic in terms of achieving the united nations sustainable development goals negotiating new organisational templates collective agreements and company practices with the ambition to enable a more balanced way of working consistent with

it s hard to imagine a company that hasn t been affected by supply chain issues over the past couple of years even before the covid 19 pandemic began a couple of utility executives had suggested power write about supply chain issues and hold sessions on the topic at our conferences while power has done that the situation has gotten markedly worse in the meantime in recent months sanctions on russia following the country s invasion of ukraine and covid lockdowns in china have threatened to disrupt the world s supply chains even more china briefing a business publication produced by dezan shira associates a foreign direct investment consultancy reported that a lockdown in shanghai a city of 25 million people that serves as china s financial center was the largest scale lockdown ever and that port of shanghai operations had been disrupted by the situation shipping giant maersk estimates trucking services into and out of shanghai will be severely impacted by 30 china briefing reported on april 3 some shipping companies have diverted their vessels to nearby ports such as the port of ningbo in zhejiang however it s not an easy switch as covid 19 control measures have already caused rising congestion outside both ports the global supply chain may feel the impact in the following weeks it said supply chain challenges for power projects during the combustion turbine operations technical forum ctotf spring conference held march 13 17 in louisville kentucky a panel discussion on day one focused on the supply chain crisis luis cordova pe plant manager of austin energy s sand hill energy center a 600 mw combined cycle facility in del valle texas said supply chain issues had forced his team to postpone work that was scheduled to occur at the end of april cordova said his group has been preparing for about three years to do a project this spring the company had all the equipment it needed on order and everything seemed to be on track the necessary contractors were all lined up and the engineering aspects of the job had been finalized however when the construction kickoff meeting was held cordova received bad news two solid state relay controllers that were needed for the project were on an eight week backlog to make matters worse the controllers are very particular to sand hill s panels and aren t interchangeable with other controllers that may have been available so the project had to be rescheduled perhaps the most frustrating part of the job delay is that the controllers are relatively inexpensive before the pandemic struck cordova suggested they probably could have been purchased for less than 1 000 and received in about two weeks but now the unavailability is affecting a multi million dollar project and may result in some workarounds until the project can be completed these are unprecedented times from my perspective said joe clements director of generation procurement and warehousing with ppl services co and clements perspective is quite broad having worked in the industry for almost 40 years 32 years of which he s been running supply chain organizations to provide context clements noted that in the spring of 2021 steel tubing for boilers had a 16 week lead time by the fall the lead time had jumped to 21 weeks lead times for spring outages this year climbed to 30 weeks following the london metal exchange s decision to halt nickel trading on march 8 after prices doubled to more than 100 000 per tonne for the metal clements said he can t even get companies to give him a quote for boiler tubes nickel is used to make stainless steel and other alloys stronger and better able to withstand extreme temperatures and corrosive environments we had an active proposal out and we had three of our oems tell us we can t give you pricing on that because we can t hold it firm for the duration of our quotation so they wouldn t even bid us raw stock material that s unprecedented for us and for our industry clements said chelsea kovanda bukowski manager of business development with oilkleen a company that supplies lubricants and advanced oil filtration technologies to the power industry reported she was having trouble getting hydraulic fluid for customers we just got put on allocation for 12 000 gallons of hydraulic fluid a month we sell 50 000 gallons of hydraulic fluid a month so you re going to these customers and you re having to figure out ways to keep them running she said we re also getting 10 to 14 week lead times six month lead times on some and trying to get people product the planning conundrum a major problem stemming from supply chain issues is hoarding many managers don t want to get caught with their pants down so they place orders for items they might need or order a few extras so they don t have to worry if something goes awry during installation or an unexpected problem arises later admittedly it s hard not to overcompensate when faced with supply chain issues and trying to plan for every possibility but that just exacerbates the situation clements said he s been trying to better understand his company s supply chain for a while for some time i ve encouraged my folks to get out and understand our suppliers who they are their principals what drives their business the risks that they present to us how they re managing those risks so we ve been doing a little of that but probably not enough he said we have a forward looking procurement plan that we use it s 12 to 18 months of projects that are coming up with new contracts so we are out there forward looking trying to understand our risk in those markets it behooves everyone in the power industry to do the same aaron larson is power s executive editor
jea sensible people have been amazed to see how the mass social media has relentlessly reported only one side of the russia ukraine conflict just take a look at yahoo news on a daily basis and the answer may surprise you just recently yahoo news has reported that putin threatened to annihilate the entire world if russia doesn t capture ukraine but there is still hope people are waking up and scott ritter s article is one of those pieces you don t want to miss scott ritter western media coverage of the ukraine conflict has been so hysterically one sided and divorced from reality that it s probably only a matter of time before iraq s erstwhile comical ali is brought out of retirement to insist that there are no russians advancing towards the ukrainian army s front lines meanwhile the actual fighting continues to result in a string of defeats for kiev s battered forces who have already lost control of two major cities despite unprecedented support from the us and its allies as american officials work with the government of ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky to craft a perception of kiev s victory against the russian military moscow is preparing to counter with a harsh dose of reality us secretary of state antony blinken on the heels of a dramatic visit to the ukrainian capital of kiev where together with secretary of defense lloyd austin he met with zelensky testified before congress that the goal of the ukrainians in fighting their two month old conflict with russia would be to push the russians out of the territory that they re trying to occupy in eastern ukraine blinken added that the administration of us president joe biden was providing full support to kiev to achieve this goal the secretary of state added that zelensky s objective was to degrade the russian military so that it would not be able to attack ukraine in the next month next year or in five years echoing similar sentiments expressed by lloyd austin who had declared that the goal of the us was to see russia weakened so that it cannot do the kinds of things that it has done the shared optimism of blinken austin and zelensky comes from the joint embrace of a narrative of the russian military operation against ukraine which holds that the russians are in the process of suffering a strategic defeat in ukraine but in a sign that this narrative may represent little more than wishful thinking on the part of these three leaders the us chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general mark milley had a more nuanced take noting that if russia were to get away with what he termed its aggression against ukraine cost free then the global international security order that has been in place since the end of the second world war would be put at risk far from projecting a sense of optimism as to the outcome of the russian ukrainian conflict milley s statements reflected a sense of urgency that comes with the recognition that the war in ukraine has reached a critical juncture the gap between perception and reality when it comes to assessing the russian ukrainian conflict is a direct result of the confusing nature of the conflict itself where a well oiled propaganda campaign waged by ukraine and its western partners both government and media alike contrasts with a russian public relations effort which is reticent to delve deeply into russian strategic goals and objectives let alone the day to day details of the fighting on the ground the result is an information war where two competing narratives wage an unequal conflict and perception is ultimately trumped by reality some harsh truths as the military operation in ukraine enters its third month some harsh truths have emerged which are altering how both the russian armed forces and modern warfare will be assessed going forward few analysts including this author expected serious resistance to last more than a month indeed general milley had briefed congress during closed door briefings in early february that a full scale russian invasion of ukraine could result in the fall of kiev within 72 hours there were several reasons for such an assessment first and foremost was the extensive preparation that had been conducted by russia in advance of the military incursion the movement of hundreds of thousands of troops along with their equipment and the logistical means to sustain both men and material in combat is not a trivial exercise and russia had been engaged in military drills which stretched out over the course of several months perfecting such logistics the russian military is led by officers who excel in staff work and preparation and to assume that they had planned for every possibility that could be encountered on the battlefield is not an outlandish proposition doctrinally the russian military was configured for the kind of warfare it had prepared for where its overwhelming advantages in mass and firepower were optimized to produce the very battlefield results anticipated by most observers the destruction of enemy defenses in depth with massed fire followed by an aggressive armored assault that penetrated deep into the enemy rear areas sowing confusion and disruption leading to the rapid loss of combat effectiveness on the part of those being attacked a russian ukrainian war was always going to be primarily a ground war neither the ukrainian air force nor its navy was expected to put up a sustained viable resistance to their russian counterparts while the ukrainian army had been trained and equipped as a virtual nato proxy force since 2015 the reality was that it had undergone a rapid expansion from 2014 when it could field some 6 000 combat ready troops to its pre military operation composition of some 150 000 soldiers organized into 24 brigades the expectation that ukraine would be able to perfect anything more than basic battalion sized combined arms operations i e the coordinated employment of maneuver forces with artillery and air support was wishful thinking while ukraine had placed a great deal of effort in transitioning from an all conscript military in 2014 to one where some 60 of its combat personnel were professional contract soldiers led by seasoned non commissioned officers one cannot create such a force in so short of time small unit leadership of the sort that represents the glue that holds a military force together under the strain and duress of sustained combat simply had not had enough time to take hold and mature in the ukrainian army leading many to assess that it would fold when placed under the stress of russian doctrinal warfare the following analysis is sourced from publicly available reporting by journalists embedded with the russian military and the forces of the donetsk people s republic as well as russian ministry of defense briefings and statements made by the ukrainian side within the first week of the russian operation getting underway it was clear to most that many of the assumptions that had been made were flawed and or misplaced first and foremost moscow had opted not to employ its forces according to standard doctrine opting instead to take a light approach which appeared to be born from a concerted effort to minimize civilian casualties and harm to civilian infrastructure that itself was derived from a fundamental misunderstanding of the reality of the situation on the ground in ukraine the reported purging of 150 officers from the 5th department of the russian federal security service fsb responsible for operations in the so called near abroad which includes ukraine along with the arrest of sergei beseda the former head of the department suggests that russia had suffered a failure of intelligence the likes of which has not been seen since the israeli failure to predict the egyptian crossing of the suez canal during the yom kippur war of october 1973 while the russian government has remained characteristically tight lipped about any possible shortcomings regarding the work of the 5th department prior to the start of the military operation the statements by russian leadership suggesting that the ukrainian military might remain in its barracks and that civilian leadership would not interfere with russia military operations suggest that these assumptions were made using intelligence provided by the 5th department that such assumptions if indeed they were made proved to be so fundamentally off target when combined with the preparedness of the ukrainian military to engage the initial columns of russian forces suggests that the work of the 5th department had been disrupted by ukrainian security services who took control of russian human networks and fed false reports back to the russian leadership the fact is that columns of russian troops advancing boldly into ukraine without the kind of attention to route security and flank protection that would normally accompany offensive operations found themselves cut off and annihilated by well prepared ukrainian ambushes moreover instead of folding under pressure the ukrainian army both regular and those from the territorial forces stood their ground and fought using hand held anti tank weapons us made javelins and british made nlaws to great effect it was to use an american colloquialism a turkey shoot and the ukrainian government made effective use of combat footage obtained from such encounters to great effect in shaping global public opinion about the effectiveness of ukraine s defenses however the limitations of the ukrainian armed forces did not allow it to turn its impressive tactical victories into positive operational and strategic outcomes despite costly initial setbacks the russian army pressed home its attack achieving impressive gains in the south where russian forces operating out of crimea secured the strategic city of kherson and advanced on the equally important city of mariupol there they joined with russian and allied forces from the donetsk republic to surround the ukrainian forces defending mariupol eventually trapping the survivors numbering several thousand strong in the reinforced concrete underworld of the azovstal steel factory further north russian forces together with the forces of the donetsk and lugansk republics advanced westward to drive ukrainian forces from their prepared defenses to gain control of the totality of the territory encompassing the donbass region the battle for kiev while securing the territorial integrity of the donbass region was one of the primary objectives of the russian special military operation to accomplish this russia carried out extensive supporting operations which included a diversionary advance toward kiev designed to fix ukrainian forces in place and divert reinforcements away from the eastern front as well as an amphibious feint off the coast of odessa for the same purpose for a diversionary attack and or feint to be operationally viable it must be believable which means the forces carrying out the mission must be aggressive in the execution of the diversion even under unfavorable conditions the russian advance on kiev was done by a force of some 40 000 men operating on two axes one heading south the other pushing southwest from the direction of chernihiv the ground advances were preceded by several air assaults targeting airfields in the vicinity of kiev whether or not russian intelligence had indicated that kiev was ripe for a coup de main or the russian paratroopers and special forces conducting the assaults were too aggressive in selling the attack or a combination of both the reality was that kiev was well defended by a mix of regular army and territorial forces who were not inclined to give up the ukrainian capital without a fight for over a month the russian forces advanced on kiev launching probing attacks that penetrated the northern suburbs and threatened to surround the city from both the east and west the fact of the matter remains however that a force of 40 000 men no matter how aggressively employed cannot take and hold a city of some three million inhabitants defended by a mix of 60 000 regular reserve and territorial soldiers but this was never their task these actions colonel general sergey rudskoy the first deputy chief of russia s general staff announced during a briefing on march 26 are carried out with the aim of causing such damage to military infrastructure equipment personnel of the armed forces of ukraine the results of which allow us not only to tie down their forces and prevent them from strengthening their grouping in the donbass but also will not allow them to do this until the russian army completely liberates the territories of the and in an indication of both the intensity of the combat involved in the kiev feint and the importance of the assigned mission russian president vladimir putin awarded the honorific title of guard to the 64th detached motor rifle brigade for its astute and bold actions during the kiev fighting the unit s staff became a role model in fulfilling its military duty valor dedication and professionalism putin noted in the accompanying citation the ukrainian government has accused the 64th brigade of committing war crimes in the town of bucha north of kiev a charge the russian government vehemently denies the so called battle for kiev is a clear cut example of the difference between perception and reality the ukrainian position is that its forces decisively defeated the russian military on the approaches to kiev forcing not only a retreat but also a complete re design of the strategic objectives of the special military operation this point of view has been echoed unquestioningly by a compliant western media and embraced by political and military leaders in europe canada and the us one of the major outcomes of this ukrainian victory was the ability of ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky to leverage this perception into a fundamental shift of thinking on the part of his supporters in the west resulting in an increase in both the amount of money allocated to supplying ukraine with weapons as well as the quality of the weapons themselves as the west shifted away from an emphasis on light anti tank weapons to more conventional armor and artillery left unspoken was the need for this dramatic change in weapons priority especially given the fact that ukraine had according to its own narrative decisively defeated russia using these very same light anti tank weapons the reality however was that the russian phase one operations had inflicted near fatal damage to the ukrainian military killing and wounding tens of thousands of soldiers while destroying the vast bulk of ukraine s heavy weaponry the artillery tanks and armored fighting vehicles critical to waging modern combined arms warfare the reason ukraine requested more tanks armored vehicles and artillery from its western suppliers is that it had depleted its available stocks but equipment was the least of ukraine s worries a military is only as good as its ability to logistically sustain its forces while in combat and one of the primary objectives of the russian phase one campaign was to destroy ukraine s fuel and ammunition storage facilities and degrade ukrainian command and control the result is that while ukraine held onto kiev it did so at an enormous cost in overall combat effectiveness and while russia was able to withdraw from the kiev front and undergo a period of rest rearmament and reorientation a normal action for military units that had been engaged in virtually non stop combat operations for a month the ukrainian military remained under pressure from incessant russian aerial attack and bombardment from precision guided cruise missiles and russian artillery perception when subjected to the harsh light of reality is exposed as little more than wishful thinking this is very much the case regarding the so called battle for kiev where the ukrainian military was left holding territory which no longer served any useful purpose for the russians russia was able to redeploy its forces to better support its prime objective the seizure of donbass leaving the ukrainian forces in kiev frozen in place mariupol and the battle for donbass the battle for mariupol is another example where perception management clashed with ground truth reality the narrative surrounding the present fate of mariupol is very much a tale of two cities from the ukrainian perspective the city continues to be held by a heroic cadre of fighters who are tying down tens of thousands of russian forces who otherwise could be redeployed elsewhere supporting the russian main effort against donbass so long as these defenders hold out the ukrainians contend the vital land bridge connecting crimea and the russian federation will be at risk likewise their continued resistance serves a major propaganda purpose denying russia the ability to declare victory prior to the victory day celebration of may 9 russia however has already declared victory in mariupol while conceding that a few thousand defenders remain dug into the cold war era bunkers underneath the azovstal steel factory russia says that these forces serve no meaningful military value indeed rather than sacrifice russian troops to dig the ukrainian forces from their underground lairs president putin directed the military to seal off the azov facility and wait the defenders out there is no doubt that the presence of ukrainians in the azovstal factory represents a propaganda victory for ukraine but the reality is that the city of mariupol has fallen to russia while the ukrainian defenders possibly accompanied by thousands of civilians waste away as their food supplies diminish the rest of mariupol is beginning the task of rebuilding a shattered city where an estimated 90 of the buildings have been damaged or destroyed in brutal street to street fighting the russian land bridge is intact and the russian offensive against donbass is proceeding without delay the statements in kiev by antony blinken and lloyd austin are a byproduct of the perception of ukrainian victory shaped by the twin ukrainian victories in kiev and mariupol the reality however is that kiev was a masterful russian deception that shaped the overall strategic situation in ukraine in favor of russia and the mariupol battle is likewise finished in terms of any strategic impact on the overall campaign what is left is the harsh truth of simple military math which when projected onto a map provides the kind of unyielding fact based evidence that ukraine is losing its war with russia the fact of the matter is that the military aid being provided to ukraine by the west will not have any discernable impact on a battlefield where russia is asserting its dominance more and more each day not only is there not enough equipment being provided hundreds of armored vehicles cannot replace the more than 2 580 that have been lost by ukraine to date nor can dozens of artillery pieces offset the more that 1 410 artillery tubes and rocket launchers destroyed by the russian military when two military forces of equal size and capability face off against one another they seek to acquire an operational advantage through the attrition of their opponent s capabilities which in combination with effective maneuvering of their own forces puts the opponent in an untenable situation the transition from a battle of equals to decisive military victory is often rapid representing as it does the culmination of acquired supremacy in the form of firepower and maneuver which is brought together in synchronistic fashion creating a series of tactical and operational dilemmas for which the opponent has no viable solution this is the current situation with the ukrainian military facing off against the russians in donbass today the ukrainians lacking any meaningful artillery support of their own are at the mercy of the russian artillery and rocket launchers that pound their positions day in and day out without respite the russian troops have taken a very deliberate approach to engaging with their ukrainian opponents gone are the rapid advances by unprotected columns and convoys now the russians isolate the ukrainian defenders pound them with artillery and then carefully close in and destroy what remains with infantry supported by tanks and armored fighting vehicles the casualty ratio in this fighting is unforgiving for ukraine with hundreds of soldiers lost each day in terms of killed wounded and surrendered while russian casualties are measured in scores not only can russia maneuver virtually at will along the front as it closes with and destroys the ukrainian defenders but russian troops also operate with absolute freedom in depth meaning that they can pull back to refit rearm and rest without fear of ukrainian artillery fire or counterattacking forces the ukrainians meanwhile remain pinned down unable to move without fear of being detected and destroyed by russian air power and as such doomed to be isolated and destroyed by russian troops in due course there is virtually no hope of reinforcement or relief for the ukrainian forces operating on the front lines russia has interdicted the rail lines that had served as the conduit for resupply and the likelihood of any ukrainian forces which have received heavy weapons provided by the west reaching the frontlines in any discernable strength is virtually zero the battle for donbass is reaching its culminating point where the ukrainian military rapidly transitions from a force capable of providing the semblance of resistance to one that has lost all meaningful combat capability this is the state of play entering the third month of russia s military operation in ukraine while the termination of any conflict is always a political question one thing is for certain if the operation extends into a fourth month the battlefield will look vastly different from the one that the world currently sees the battle for donbass and eastern ukraine is all but over that is the hard reality and no amount of wishful

duke energy one of the largest energy companies in the world grew out of a system of lakes and dams along the catawba river to generate power for the piedmont carolinas while the company has sustained a core value of investing in the future throughout its 118 year history planning for the energy transition has posed critical new uncertainties for the corporate giant the half century from 1880 and 1930 was a remarkable formative period in the history of power generation across the u s in the south still predominantly agricultural and rural in 1900 development arrived rapidly delivering stunning advances for the poverty crushed region the most enduring of those efforts came from two wealthy entrepreneurs from north carolina james b duke and to a lesser extent his older brother benjamin n duke 1 catawba power co s 3 3 mw catawba hydro station which began operating on april 30 1904 became the first generating station on the duke power co system the date is considered to be the birthdate of duke power courtesy duke energy heavily involved in both tobacco and textile manufacturing the duke brothers began to explore the possibilities of hydroelectric power as early as the 1890s wrote historian robert durden meanwhile in 1900 walker gill wylie and his brother robert h wylie established the catawba power co to supply electricity to textile mills near rock hill south carolina a hydropower power plant figure 1 the wylie brothers completed on the catawba river four years later that was later purchased by the dukes kicked off the birth of a unique investor owned electric utility through multiple mergers and acquisitions that company would go on to play a major role in the industrial transformation of the piedmont carolinas and later as one of the nation s largest power generators and utility companies from the very start that company then known as southern power co before it evolved into duke power co in 1924 and eventually duke energy corp in 1997 see sidebar a long legacy was distinctive and different from most other investor owned utilities in several ways durden noted first the company s pioneers envisioned a series of interconnected single system generating plants and a comprehensive development of an entire river and its valley as opposed to piecemeal development second it enjoyed private capital autonomy from the duke brothers that buoyed its operational and financial health and served to insulate it during the great depression and third duke power s engineers adopted a do it yourself policy that would continue into the atomic era allowing the company to foray easily into innovation and transformation duke power became a national leader in its field by pioneering with numerous technologies durden wrote the company s generating plants were recognized by trade journals and industry associations as the most efficient in the nation over a period of many years an energy mammoth today duke energy corp headquartered in charlotte north carolina is one of the largest investor owned utilities in the country its sprawling business comprises three main reportable segments electric utilities and infrastructure gas utilities and infrastructure and commercial renewables its electric utility subsidiaries which include duke energy carolinas duke energy progress duke energy florida duke energy indiana and duke energy ohio provide retail service through generation figure 2 transmission distribution and power sales as well as wholesale sales to municipalities cooperatives and other load serving entities 2 duke energy subsidiaries own a massive generating fleet with a combined capacity of 50 3 gw however duke energy s power mix has transformed dramatically since 2005 courtesy duke energy in total duke energy serves about 8 2 million customers within the southeast and midwest in a service territory that spans 91 000 square miles across six states all these businesses with the exception of ohio which operates in a competitive electricity supply market operate as sole suppliers of power within their service territories with services that are priced by state commission approved rates the federal energy regulatory commission however also approves cost based rates for sales to some power and transmission wholesale customers the gas utilities and infrastructure segment meanwhile conducts natural gas operations primarily through the regulated public utilities of piedmont duke energy ohio and duke energy kentucky serving residential commercial industrial and power generation natural gas customers finally duke energy s commercial renewables segment acquires develops builds operates and owns wind and solar renewable generation throughout the u s the segment s portfolio includes utility scale wind and solar generation assets distributed solar generation assets distributed fuel cell assets and battery storage projects which total 3 554 mw across 22 states these include 23 wind facilities 178 solar projects 71 fuel cell locations and two battery storage facilities duke energy notes that revenues from the increasingly lucrative commercial renewables division are primarily generated by selling renewable power through long term contracts to an array of customers many of which have obligations under state mandated renewable portfolio standards outside of these ventures duke energy also owns a captive insurance company bison which provides the company s subsidiaries with indemnification for financial losses it also notably holds a 17 5 equity interest in nmc a petrochemical and plastics producer based in saudi arabia grappling with multi pronged challenges while the company s business interests have historically been shaped by business opportunity and soaring power demand recent changes appear to be more solidly driven by a combination of factors including pressure from shareholders to improve its environmental social and governance esg posture in response to a recent resolution by non profit advocacy group as you sow that urged the company to revise its net zero target duke energy in february said it will expand its 2050 net zero goals to include scope 2 and specific scope 3 emissions scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from power the company purchases from others to use in its facilities while scope 3 includes indirect emissions that arise from other sources in the company s value chain 3 by 2035 only one duke energy coal plant could be operational the edwardsport integrated gasification combined cycle igcc plant the 618 mw coal fired project in knox county indiana started commercial operations in june 2013 a power top plant in 2013 the plant is one of only a handful of large scale igcc projects that are operating today worldwide courtesy duke energy in tandem as part of its expanded clean energy action plan the company also said it would dramatically slash coal generation s share from the current 22 of total generation to 5 by 2030 and achieve a full phaseout of unabated coal companywide by 2035 duke energy has already reduced its scope 1 carbon emissions from electricity generation by 44 from 2005 levels the majority of those reductions were achieved through the retirement of 56 coal units a combined 7 5 gw since 2010 but as lynn good duke energy corp chair president and ceo noted at the company s inaugural esg investor day in october 2020 esg efforts are also rooted in long term sustainability particularly as the company continues to navigate emerging industry disruptions and related uncertainties we became a stronger more agile company intensifying our focus considerations and accelerating our clean energy transformation good said esg conscious changes to the company s generating fleet and business interests offer a compelling investment story and investment good noted will be crucial to the company s growth given new infrastructure demands related to the energy transition to achieve a complete coal phase out by 2035 the company in february said it expects to deploy more than 130 billion over the next decade 63 billion of which it will spend over the next five years to fund investments in grid modernization and efforts to replace its coal fleet with renewables natural gas and emerging technologies keeping customer bills affordable however remains a crucial priority for the company which is why the company will strive to mitigate capital increases by reducing other costs as you transition out of coal you will have lower fuel costs said steve young duke energy executive vice president and chief financial officer there are people the outages are less complex the third area is our continual pursuit of efficiencies across our footprint to our business transformation model he added we have a good track record here as well we will continue to find digital applications to automate processes he said we will use data analytics to tell us how to do things and when to do it better and we have learned from the pandemic how to virtually move our workforce from areas of lesser importance to emergent work to help us displace the need for contractors duke energy s precarious attempts to strike the right balance between reliability affordability and sustainability aren t without risks however duke energy s results of operations depend in significant part on the extent to which it can implement its business strategy successfully the company acknowledges duke energy s clean energy strategy which includes achieving net zero carbon emissions from electricity generation by 2050 modernizing the regulatory construct transforming the customer experience and digital transformation is subject to business policy regulatory technology economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond its control and may make those goals difficult to achieve it says 4 the asheville combined cycle station in arden north carolina is one of duke energy s newest gas fired power plants the 817 million facility which began operating in july 2020 is a two unit facility with a total capacity of 560 mw the station normally runs on natural gas but can also burn diesel fuel when necessary courtesy duke energy the company is especially wary of federal or state policies that could restrict the availability of fuels or generation technologies such as natural gas figure 4 or nuclear power limit retirements or limit investments in new capacity it also actively advocates for supportive policies that could facilitate siting and cost recovery of transmission and distribution upgrades needed to build out large volumes of renewable and energy storage in addition the company has highlighted concerns about labor procurement constraints including shortages that may be needed to build new generation on time and on budget as with other utilities duke energy also faces a decline in customer demand owing to energy efficiency measures and advances in distributed generation cybersecurity risks and environmental litigation including from esg concerns continuing a legacy of innovation yet another prominent risk involves gambles on technologies that aren t yet commercially available or are unproven at utility scale but which could reshape its investment strategy if successful if these technologies are not developed or are not available at reasonable prices or if we invest in early stage technologies that are then supplanted by technological breakthroughs duke energy s ability to achieve a net zero target by 2050 at a cost effective price could be at risk the company notes so far the company has embarked on a careful vetting of an array of emerging technologies duke energy is for example partnering with siemens and clemson university on a department of energy backed study to evaluate hydrogen integration and utilization at duke energy s clemson combined heat and power plant the pilot project which began in march 2021 is evaluating 30 co firing of hydrogen in 2024 and 100 firing of hydrogen on or before 2030 hydrogen s allure is entrenched is a longer term play for the company s sizable natural gas fleet as well as for energy storage good suggested in february under another project duke energy is testing honeywell s new flow battery technology which can store and discharge electricity for up to 12 hours exceeding the duration of four hour lithium ion batteries honeywell is expected to deliver a 400 kwh unit to duke energy s emerging technology and innovation center in north carolina this year duke energy also plans to begin testing an eos zinc bromine znyth gen 3 0 battery in late 2022 for now however duke energy is doubling down on its existing nuclear fleet buoyed by its noteworthy performance and low carbon attributes good in february suggested duke energy s six nuclear plants in the carolinas may factor heavily in a carbon plan it intends to file in may 2022 to comply with north carolina s house bill 951 landmark legislation that provides a framework to achieve a 70 carbon reduction by 2030 the company has since 2019 explored subsequent license renewals slrs for all of its 11 reactors which are sited at the six nuclear plants in 2021 the company filed its first slr application for the three unit 2 5 gw oconee plant in seneca south carolina in a bid to keep that plant open until 2054 meanwhile recently announced federal tax incentives for nuclear could prove very favorable from a cash flow standpoint good noted in february however if duke energy embarks on future new nuclear builds they will likely be smaller advanced reactors as good noted in february smaller reactors appear much more attractive than a 10 year journey to build a large scale nuclear reactor duke energy already provides consulting and advisory in kind services for the 500 mw natrium sodium cooled fast reactor plant at pacificorp s naughton power plant site in wyoming a terrapower and ge hitachi nuclear energy project that is expected to be operational by 2028 the company has also been working with other advanced nuclear developers including holtec and nuscale for potential investment in the 2030s good said asked about a timeframe for duke energy to begin incorporating these technologies in its business good said the awareness of what might be possible with hydrogen advanced nuclear and carbon capture storage and utilization ccus is already part of conversations with all its regulators the good news is we believe we have runway with existing technologies to achieve the majority of our aspirations around clean energy transition over the next five years or so she said these technologies could begin to grow more significantly in the 2030s when it would be more important to get to net zero and the next tranche of carbon reduction she added and so i think time will tell on whether they get to commercial scale she said however the company intends to be thoughtful working with stakeholders and our regulators before we begin introducing any of these technologies so that we have a common view of what we would like to achieve and invest in to meet our goals she said sonal

in arts magazine from 1976 to 1990 critic art historian and onetime artforum contributing editor robert pincus witten s vivid and frequently contentious missives recorded his comings and goings in the overheated art world of the 80s beginning in this issue artforum reprises the name and spirit of pincus witten s column with entries contributing editor david rimanelli s new monthly diary chronicling his own adventures in the world of art today march 14 julian schnabel opens at gagosian a jolly gaudy back to the 80s affair pretty people ornate people ridiculously dressed people hustlers and men who like dressing like hustlers i met a nice woman who adorned her forehead with a spiral of swarovski crystals the big girl paintings are really big from 122 by 110 inches to 162 by 148 more than one person said ah size does matter indulging their vin ordinaire vulgarity the big girl works are based on a thrift store painting schnabel acquired in 1987 a broad swath of paint obliterates the eyes of each big girl robert rosenblum in his essay for the exhibition catalogue mentions baselitz s practice of painting the figure upside down so that you would concentrate on the painting itself rather than the image depicted i was more forcefully reminded of martin kippenberger who also took junk sources and repainted them often subjecting the original images to all sorts of delightful painterly assaults on taste and dignity the art historically minded may also catch a whiff of cobra situationist artist asger jorn dinner at pastis the hors d oeuvres movement of this symphonie fantastique featured lavish trays of the cuisine of concupiscence fat shrimp and fleshy scary oysters delicious actually schnabel held court the picasso placeholder of our time al pacino and his girlfriend gina gershon were ensconced at the table of honor i was seated nearby and had to restrain myself from staring willem dafoe came but he s a downtown fixture ben gazzara so great in those john cassavetes films was also in attendance but he doesn t really look like a movie star he looks like a guy in a suit even so movie stars make better visual spectacles than art stars schnabel s art aside i think people respond to the largesse of his persona he comfortably occupies the great artist role and unlike other 80s era artists who made movies robert longo david salle most recently cindy sherman he really has gone hollywood lisa dennison from the guggenheim introduced me to jim rosenquist aside from nice to see you what could i say i love f 111 april 16 the galleys of the 100th issue of october a special issue devoted to obsolescence arrived today a hefty volume some two hundred pages anniversaries are often hateful no less than joyous with the psychic undertow of recrimination sometimes breaking through the manicured surface of celebration for some two decades the journal founded in 1976 by rosalind e krauss and annette michelson along with jeremy gilbert rolfe in part as a response to their dissatisfaction with the direction artforum was taking reigned supreme as the resistant organ of dense theoretically driven art history and criticism it was and remains distinguished also by its absence of gallery advertising the parsimony of its strictly black and white reproductions and its adherence to a mostly unchanged and nevertheless quite stylish black white and red cover design a design that proclaimed its serious tone just as the name announced its revolutionary intentions perhaps inevitably october has experienced its own graying over the past twenty six years the sense of excitement has dimmed considerably many of the articles are less than must reads its founders and many of its contributors have themselves become thoroughly institutionalized strange then that in an issue taking obsolescence as a theme the continuing vitality of the journal itself is only scarcely addressed october 100 includes twenty one artist responses to the question of obsolescence a roundtable on obsolescence and american avant garde film essays by t j clark and others it also contains rem koolhaas s junkspace a lengthy text without paragraphing by the radical architectural genius behind such recent masterpieces as the 40 million prada store in soho with no doubt unintentional humor this piece is followed by hal foster s the abcs of contemporary design but the most attention getting element of october 100 is its concluding roundtable on the present conditions of art criticism a double double toil and trouble pot of pointed critiques mixed up with a certain lack of reflexivity that seems odd among this group and for extra spice a dash of bitterness and unrepressed hostility the roundtable included krauss and fellow editors benjamin h d buchloh hal foster and george baker who sort of acts as chair also in attendance were various art historians david joselit james meyer helen molesworth the artists john miller and andrea fraser and critic and moma curator robert storr early on buchloh states his case about the decline of art criticism quite well once the traditional assumption that artistic practices supposedly generate a critical if not utopian dimension of experience had withered away we were left with a sense of the primacy of institutional and economic interests now all you have to have is the competence of quality judgments and high level connoisseurship that serves as investment expertise my exaggeration and admittedly it is an exaggeration serves to say that you don t need criticism for an investment structure you need experts you don t have criticism of blue chip stocks either one of the most vivid bad objects is dave hickey peter schjeldahl is another foster attacks the former baker the latter each making more or less the same point about liberalish belletrism catering to an essentially anti artistic vulgus although baker does so with considerably more rhetorical élan schjeldahl is often involved in baiting the anti intellectualism of the public that hal highlighted earlier that is one of his talents he is only serious about the corpse of a certain understanding of art and in keeping that corpse presentable for the public for which he writes well everybody has to be good at something the overall anathematization of hickey and schjeldahl colludes with a general disapprobation for the glossy art magazines artforum in particular this aspect is curious given all the shared personnel one of october s editors yve alain bois and two advisory board members thomas crow and molly nesbit are artforum contributing editors none of the three was included in the proceedings the artforum question creates numerous amusing situations an interchange between buchloh foster and fraser turns on buchloh s contributions to the magazine fraser asks but benjamin you made an extreme all or nothing statement about the cultural landscape and i m just wondering if you see artforum as part of the cultural landscape that you want to reject answer absolutely read i publish in this magazine i categorically reject what this magazine stands for baker introduces the discussion with a quotation from paul de man s criticism and crisis here might one detect the presence of a favorite de manian trope aporia a blockage an impasse no way out an interesting rhetorical move occurs frequently during the roundtable participants feel the need to return to something said earlier and presumably left unfinished e g going back to rosalind s comment for a moment but i would like to return to my earlier point about the withering away of criticism one thing that is almost entirely excluded in these various returns is any form of commentary on the enormous power that leaders of the october group wield within the academy more power than anybody writing art criticism belletristic feuilletonistic or otherwise could possibly imagine weird maybe the journal should be rechristened december after a less glorious episode in russian revolutionary history april 24 25 invited to a panel discussion women in the arts in conjunction with an exhibition at the palm beach institute of contemporary art devoted to sue williams s post filthy talk abstractish paintings of the past several years the panel itself did not explicitly address williams s art but i kept wanting to blurt out you know the pictures she made about ten years ago looked really different from what you re seeing here there wasn t a single painting representing that period in williams s development no try to be more accommodating no are you a pro porn or anti porn feminist i was pleased to see however her artist s book they eat shit for sale at the ticket counter instead the exhibition curated by the palm beach ica s director michael rush traces williams s painterly development beginning with a hint of twombly then progressing through pollockoid all overness and the oft remarked recourse to effects derived from late de kooning flaccid penises and pomegranate like vaginas rise and swell within the wallpaper skeins of color before giving way at last to pure painting before i went down to florida i dropped in on the show of new paintings by williams at 303 these feature broad strokes laid down with big brushes i thought now she s doing bernard frize it was all very support surface sue williams has become an appropriation artist a sort of crypto sherrie levine redoing in veiled and sometimes not so veiled form the work of historic male masters but i doubt very much that anybody cares april 30 more mail vogue hommes the paris based soft porn handsome men s fashion magazine that is written almost entirely in english some interesting art coverage for example john waters s interview with richard serra question now i notice that you are very well dressed i know it s embarrassing to ask but do you get a new outfit for documenta answer come on give me a break question have people ever had sex in answer probably waters also comments i ve seen couples strolling hand in hand through the torqued spirals and i ve thought how romantic richard it s glamorous to imagine being crushed by them i mean you should jump out at the end and scare them droll may 1 the premiere of matthew barney s cremaster 3 at the ziegfeld theater a benefit for special programming at the guggenheim at one point during the reception i overheard a sibilant hiss more like a benefit for the bankruptcy lawyers i saw stella tennant but not björk barney s girlfriend who rumor has it is carrying his child before introducing barney the guggenheim s director thomas krens made a few remarks followed by a conspicuous lack of applause he asseverated that the guggenheim s presentation of the cremaster cycle had been merely postponed never canceled during the intermission deborah solomon who s writing a story for the new york times on the museum s uh difficulties said that she had been in krens s office earlier that day and that they had been talking about my preview for the exhibition which had just appeared in the may issue of artforum was it true that people had talked about the show being canceled well yeah i didn t make that up it was even reported in the times i wish i d queried deborah more specifically on what krens had said really you just can t win even when you re delivering very favorable press the film started with an image of blue sea there was no sound but i thought well it s an art movie then barney got up from his seat and stormed up the aisle somebody turn on the sound it s really amazing how things as elementary as this can get fucked up at such a high profile event the film looked incredible on the vast expanse of the ziegfeld screen having already seen a rough cut of cremaster 3 on a monitor i e tv set i felt privileged to view it there it s hard to imagine another setting in which it could possibly look more splendid i guess size does matter

power plants across the country are facing coal shortages representational photo the bulk of india s electricity comes from burning coal this coal has to go from the minefields to the electricity generating plants it travels by rail and road mostly the former the total annual demand for coal in india is close to 1 billion tonnes and is expected to rise to 1 5 billion by 2030 the domestic production by the government owned coal india limited was 622 million tonnes during the last fiscal year 2021 22 this was a record in fact the actual coal dispatched from cil mines was even higher at 662 million tonnes due to prior inventory to transport this huge amount of coal and also imported coal from the ports to the generating plants the railways haulage also reached new records over and above cil production there is private mining production of coal too thanks to liberalisation in mining policy and also captive mining which utilises coal for uses like producing steel and aluminum even then the country has to depend on more than 200 million tonnes of coal imports from places like indonesia australia and south africa despite such efforts there is a shortage of coal which leads to an energy shortage this is happening even after india s great push to install solar electricity the installed capacity for solar electricity is ahead of target but the actual electricity produced is low since the sun does not shine at night i e fifty percent of the time and there is no way to store electricity produced during the day to be used at night this requires a massive increase in battery storage which is as of now prohibitively expensive the other promise is through hydrogen based fuel cells which can store energy produced from the sun this is a great technological promise that big companies like reliance are betting on with large investments until that happens india has to depend on coal based electricity and hence face shortages the energy shortage even back in october was about 1 2 billion units this shortage is mostly due to the unavailability of coal at the electricity plant either because the rail rakes were not available or enough coal was not mined india s total installed electricity capacity including all sources is 400 gigawatt of which coal alone accounts for 51 per cent i e more than half a coal plant can run all 24 hours of the day unlike solar or wind power plants india produced nearly 1500 billion units bu of electricity during 2021 22 but there was a shortage of around 1 2 bu recorded during october 2021 as demand peaked due to winter the shortage has become more acute now during the last week of april 2022 the energy shortage is more than 2 bu this is due to an unprecedented heatwave across much of india causing temperatures to soar above 43 degrees the daily peak demand exceeds 200 gw daily this high demand will persist for another two or three months since summer will last till july at least in north and west india the coal shortage pinch is such that the stocks kept at generating plants are reaching dangerously low levels in both domestic and imported coal based plants stocks are as low as 7 days thus to ensure that coal reaches these plants in a timely fashion the railways are taking unprecedented measures the railways have cancelled passenger trains to make way for coal rakes to travel from mining areas to power plants the cancellations include 753 trips across 21 trains till the end of may more such measures might be necessary if the heatwave does not relent the cumulative shortage of power if it exceeds 2 5 billion units will call for power cuts in some parts of india long hours of a power outage cannot be ruled out of course typically the metros and large cities will be spared the worst of the power cuts and smaller towns and villages will bear the brunt the coal crisis also means that non power sector users like aluminum and steel producers textile and paper industry sponge iron and some fertiliser units will be denied coal which may affect their production this is a complex optimisation exercise involving coal movement railway train rake planning and power outage planning the situation has been aggravated by the ukraine conflict as gas from russia becomes unavailable or boycotted the europeans and americans will burn more coal the price of international coal from australia is usually 100 dollars per tonne but thanks to the ukraine war coal prices spiked up to a shocking 440 dollars as there were supply worries of course the price of natural gas the other fuel used for home heating in europe has gone through the roof so coal based energy at these high prices is still cheaper the global demand for coal had risen 9 per cent during 2021 to an all time high of nearly 8 billion tonnes it will rise by another 2 per cent in 2022 even as there are fears of a recession and stagflation the price of coal in india has shot up too especially manifest in the e auctions conducted by the exchanges so we have the twin scourge of power outages and a surge in prices the power exchanges recorded prices of 12 rupees per unit of electricity which normally is around 3 or 4 one consequence of excessive dependence on coal is the implication for global warming and the net zero targets announced for emissions most recently in the glasgow summit as we wait for renewables like solar power and hydrogen to become economical and available in abundance the world may have to explore an increase in nuclear energy countries like france and japan are largely dependent on nuclear power although after the fukushima accident there was a temporary stoppage that freeze on nuclear power expansion needs to be re examined and india too must keep the nuclear expansion option open as if the commodity inflation due to oil and other materials wasn t bad enough we now have to contemplate getting singed by the shortage of coal and expensive electricity looks like it s going to be a hot sweaty summer dr ajit ranade is a noted economist
tech earnings disappointing with apple the standout and facebook a relief amazon was poor and apple spoke worryingly on the conference call us gdp shocked to the downside and yields and oil are back on the ascent equities are back at precarious levels as we approach the end of the week and the end of the month tech earnings season is now more or less done and dusted and the report card looks like its detention facebook fb rallied 15 but really those numbers were not great it was just a relief rally that they were not as bad as last time amazon amzn had a shocker which really we should have all seen coming as it became a pandemic stock now we all go back out malls are packed and warehouses are quiet google googl was also a bit of a disappointment so we come to the good news if there is any on a day when the nasdaq is staring at 4 at the time of writing microsoft msft and apple aapl beat the street and produced solid earnings but even apple managed to slap bulls in the face on the conference call when it spoke about significant headwinds from supply chain issues apple turned around 4 that set up friday s fright with the fed in a blackout at least they cannot add to it with more of their recent hawkishness but investors are running scared we will naturally get some relief or bear market rallies but we are in a bear market make no mistake about it deutsche bank moved to pencil in a nailed on us recession in 2023 and their chief economist seemed incredulous that the fed is even contemplating a soft landing as he pointed out it has never been achieved before so why is it different this time it never is different this time history repeats itself elon musk remained in the news as his deal to take twitter twtr drags on some interesting news hit the tape as he has had to sell a decent chunk of tesla tsla to stump up the cash for the deal and put down quite a bit more as collateral this could get very ugly if things turn lower for tesla there is a decent chance the deal doesn t make it across the finish line or else he will have to sell more tesla stock if the deal does go through and this bear market really takes hold twitter also got a put down from donald trump who said he would not return to it and instead popped up on truth social on thursday evening dwac stock naturally soared so is there any good news out there well curiously yes it is always important at times like these when bearish thoughts are rampant to try and take a contrarian view and see if it holds that is where the best trades come from so let s get to it this is getting me down already and it s the weekend refinitiv lipper alpha shows us that as of april 29 275 companies from the s p 500 have reported earnings and 80 4 of them have beaten estimates doesn t feel like it but there you have it the long term average is 66 q1 2022 revenue growth is running at 12 5 and even excluding energy that is 9 3 so why the long face source american association of individual investors aaii com source cnn com both sentiment metrics are showing extremely bearish readings with the aaii in particular a noted low the cnn fear and greed has moved from 38 to 29 in the space of one week the put call ratio has also spiked so we re all buying puts now hmm looks like the perfect setup for a counter rally fairly soon then put call ratio cboe volatility has naturally spiked as fear has so this makes all of you rushing into buying puts paying the top of the recent market below shows vix and vxn nasdaq volatility versus move which is bond market volatility that has notably quietened so could see some stability for yields going forward vix vxn and move for april the energy xle sector has not been the top performing sector despite what many of you may think that crown goes to drum roll xlp consumer staples the green line in our chart above xle energy blue line is second while unsurprisingly xlk tech orange line is the worst performing sector for the month spy forecast still have massive support at 415 a potential triple bottom and then 410 the ukraine invasion low there is a volume gap from 405 to 395 so that could get a trigger if we move below 410 400 is likely to see stops placed just below the level as well we all love round numbers don t we that move would likely flush out all the longs result in peak bearishness and so set up a bear rally nasdaq qqq forecast also big support here at 316 another triple bottom earnings week ahead this week was really it in terms of earnings with mega tech names stepping up next week is more broad based with industry and consumer names filling the slate we should get a lot of commentary on the strength of the us consumer though which will help shape our view of the us economy source benzinga pro economic releases on the docket for next week is obviously the fed interest rate decision 50 bps a nailed on certainty but let us see how hawkish they remain after this week s equity sell off and more geopolitical woes the initial us gdp read this week was surprisingly weak but within the reading employment remained red hot as did the consumer so the fed has to keep raising in spite of the deteriorating economic picture globally friday s employment report will then draw our focus last month was red hot and caused another leg higher in yields the unemployment rate is forecast at 3 6 and employers are still

state sen ryan fazio r greenwich speaks at a press conference outside the armstrong court public housing complex in the chickahominy section of greenwich conn tuesday feb 8 2022 local and state elected officials joined greenwich housing authority officials to speak out against the 8 30g law which is a state mandated target of 10 percent of the housing in each community deemed as affordable tyler sizemore hearst connecticut media one size fits all over the past two years the strongest proponents of applying one size to the use of land have accused housing diversity advocates of promoting a one size fits all policy an interesting projection the 18 municipalities in the region of the state known as the western ct council of governments westcog which includes greenwich are zoned on average to allow for single family homes as of right on 95 5 percent of the region s land this certainly has a one size look advertisement article continues below this ad highlighting this one size single family land use is that on average the municipalities in this same region are zoned for as of right multi family housing on 2 1 percent of the region s land at an april 2021 demonstration in fairfield that denounced state legislative proposals for more diverse and affordable housing state sen tony hwang r fairfield defended the single family land use pattern by arguing that proponents of the controversial legislation were advocating for a one size fits all policy i m not saying that we should stay with the status quo he said i m simply saying that the solution being offered right now by hartford is a one size fits all that takes away and disrespects the personal property rights of owners and residents of every community in the state of connecticut not the status quo the rejection of legislation that would have permitted greater density and more diverse housing opportunities as of right in downtown areas and near transit hubs in connecticut municipalities certainly appears to defend the one size fits all single family status quo advertisement article continues below this ad change is difficult it invites resistance it mobilizes defenders of the status quo it engenders hostility but without significant change the state faced with a serious housing shortage will never meet its overall housing needs much less produce an adequate supply of housing affordable to households of moderate low and extremely low income a national low income housing coalition report released in march 2021 found a national shortage of 7 million homes affordable to extremely low income households at and below the poverty level or at and below 30 percent of their area median income connecticut has 148 502 extremely low income households but only 61 785 rental units that are affordable to them leaving a shortfall of 86 717 units for extremely low income households affordable housing requires multi family development and greater concentrations of density than is currently permitted in most connecticut municipalities the proponents of increased housing supply and greater diversity of housing choices want such density to be permitted in downtown areas and near bus and rail stations they advocate for statewide land use policies that address the state s housing needs by allowing for more affordable equitable integrated and environmentally sustainable development statewide policy multi family density low income advertisement article continues below this ad these concepts pose a threat to those who are invested in the one size single family status quo especially threatening is the idea of a statewide policy that could interfere with local zoning that protects this status quo although the legislative proposals are not about government regulation but rather about removing local regulations that prevent market forces from addressing housing need these proposals are perceived as state government taking away local government control it s really all about ensuring that local zoning restrictions maintain the status quo the westcog affordable housing plan still in draft form is illustrative it doesn t call out regulatory barriers that exclude affordable housing it doesn t call upon municipalities to allow as of right multi family housing and rather than encourage municipal investment in infrastructure to support multifamily housing it validates infrastructure as an anti development argument it fails to acknowledge the region s racial and income segregation most disturbing is the plan s perversion of the intent of the 8 30g statutory provisions that allow developers to submit applications inconsistent with local zoning regulations if conforming to an 8 30g affordable housing formula the intent of this 1989 legislation with an exemption threshold for municipalities with 10 percent affordable housing stock was to break through exclusionary zoning barriers not mandate 10 percent affordable units nor even set a 10 percent goal advertisement article continues below this ad the westcog plan applies 10 percent to the entire region and proposes individual municipalities below 10 percent buy their way out from municipalities with units in excess of that threshold stamford norwalk danbury this ensures continued exclusivity within the region while concentrating affordable housing in three cities exactly what 8 30g was designed to prevent one size fits all yes it s about rejecting anything else

by rodrigo campos and davide barbuscia new york reuters russia may have averted default as it announced it had made several overdue payments in dollars on its overseas bonds shifting the market s focus to upcoming payments and whether it would stave off a historic default russia s 40 billion in international bonds and the chance of a default have become the focus of global financial markets since it was hit with sanctions from the united states and its allies after its invasion of ukraine in late february dubbed a special military operation by russia the invasion has turned russia into a pariah including in financial markets and has entangled its ability to pay its debts the chance of default dramatically increased in early april when the united states stopped the russian government from using frozen reserves to pay some 650 million to its bondholders with the end of a grace period on those payments looming russia s finance ministry said on friday it had paid in dollars 564 8 million of coupon and redemption obligations on a bond maturing in 2022 and a coupon payment of 84 4 million on another due in 2042 the announcement surprised markets that had been gearing up for a default at the end of the grace period on wednesday which would have been russia s largest major external default in over a century what happened on april 29 the russian finance ministry announced it paid nearly 650 million it owed holders of two of its dollar bonds two creditors told reuters they had not yet seen the money in their accounts but a senior u s government official confirmed that the payments had been made and that the source appeared to be outside the limits of the current sanctions the credit derivatives determinations committee representing major global banks and asset managers met on friday and acknowledged the reports of russia s payments but nonetheless made plans for a credit default swap auction next week solely in order to prepare for the possibility of a failure to pay credit event what was the market reaction russian bond prices jumped higher according to traders in some cases by 15 cents nearly doubling in price bonds of major still unsanctioned companies such as gazprom lukoil and telecoms firm vimpelcom were quoted up 2 5 cents too insurance against russia s default got less expensive with five year credit default swaps cds linked to russia s sovereign debt down to 64 333 upfront from 76 4 upfront on thursday according to s p global market intelligence what s next if friday s announced payments clear attention will shift to two events at the end of may 1 transactions between u s persons and russia s finance ministry central bank or national wealth fund are only allowed under a temporary license issued by the u s office of foreign assets control ofac that will expire on may 25 the u s treasury has not commented on whether that deadline will be extended 2 russia faces coupon payments due on may 27 on a dollar bond issued in 2016 and an euro bond issued in 2021 the payment on the euro bond could be done in rouble as a last resort but the dollar bond does not have that provision the bonds related to the april 4 payment did not include rouble payments as an option which was key in determining that a potential failure to pay had occurred when russia tried to pay in rouble how much does russia owe and does moscow have the cash if last week s payments clear russia s international bond payment obligations through the end of the year are about 2 billion prior to the ukraine crisis roughly 20 billion or half the outstanding foreign currency issuance was held by investment funds and money managers outside russia the threat of russian default is peculiar in that moscow is expected to have the funds to pay its obligations the fact that some of its sources are frozen or under sanctions boils it down to moscow s willingness to pay from other cash sources rather than its ability to do so only half of russia s over 600 billion of foreign reserves was frozen as a result of the sanctions even as europe has pledged to diversify its energy purchases russia has gotten this year on average close to 1 billion a day in revenue from sales of oil coal and gas reporting by rodrigo campos and davide barbuscia in new york andrea shalal in washington and karin strohecker and marc jones in london editing by megan davies and gerry doyle

work at cnh we want to hear from you tell us about the conditions at your workplace and what workers are fighting for comments will be published anonymously a cnh worker in racine wisconsin cnh industrial media shortly after the previous six year contract expired for approximately 1 000 cnh industrial workers in wisconsin and iowa the united auto workers union announced that it would be extending the prior agreement at 2 01 a m early sunday morning two hours after the contract expiration uaw local 180 in racine wisconsin posted a statement from the union s international headquarters on its facebook page announcing the extension an official for local 180 added we are extending the contract hour by hour we are close but we re not there yet there will be more information in the very near future report to work on monday as normal until you hear different from the leadership the uaw s contract extension comes in defiance of overwhelming strike authorization votes earlier this month by workers in racine with 98 4 percent voting in favor of a walkout and burlington iowa 97 4 percent like their brothers and sisters at john deere and volvo trucks last year the agricultural and construction equipment workers at cnh are seeking to seize the moment and reverse decades of declining wages benefits and working conditions the extension has already provoked discontent among workers earlier this week the members were expressing their opinion about a possible extension and it wasn t good a worker in burlington told the wsws previous experience shows that the uaw in its closed doors discussions with management is rapidly moving to finalize a sellout agreement which will fail to meet any of the basic needs of cnh workers at john deere last year the uaw also waited until after a midnight contract expiration before announcing an extension of the previous agreement on october 1 less than 24 hours later the uaw announced a tentative agreement with the company with president ray curry claiming it included substantial gains for members in fact the agreement failed utterly to meet workers demands for major improvements to wages and benefits workers rejected the proposal with contempt voting it down by a massive 90 percent margin and beginning their first strike in 35 years a few days later at cnh workers should have no doubt that the same team of company stooges including uaw president ray curry uaw vice president chuck browning and region 4 director ron mcinroy are once again preparing to push through the demands of the company workers should take the initiative now and not adopt a wait and see approach to the uaw s inevitable pro corporate machinations rank and file committees independent of the uaw should be initiated at both burlington and racine in order to form lines of communications between the two plants and to formulate demands based on what workers really need the company a global operation with factories on five continents has plenty of money to provide workers a decent standard of living like deere and other major agribusiness firms like adm cnh is expecting to profit handsomely from the skyrocketing rise in commodity prices driven by the us nato proxy war with russia in ukraine in a recent presentation to investors the company forecast sales of 22 billion by 2024 up from 17 8 billion last year huge sums are squandered on top executives and shareholders in 2021 cnh provided ceo scott wine with total compensation of 21 8 million 313 times the average employee s pay according to the company s own calculations cnh has expended tens of millions more in share based compensation for other executives as well as 200 million in dividends last year also in 2021 the company spent 2 1 billion to acquire raven a precision agricultural technology firm just last week cnh sold off the engineered films division of the acquired company for 350 million in march the company announced that the board had approved a share buyback program of up to 100 million euros which will largely benefit institutional and super wealthy investors by driving up cnh s stock price the worker in burlington described the increasingly grueling work schedules workers have faced as well as the long term decline in wages we ve done more sundays than we ve ever done in past years when i first started they weren t even on the list this past six years there s been a lot of sundays in 2016 they took all the cola out and before that happened when we were on the old contract it had taken a while to build that up we got screwed what we re making now isn t even close to what we should be making workers back in the 90s were making close to 26 workers are increasingly distrustful of the uaw he said we don t trust the union up above i don t trust them at all when the last meeting we had to vote for our strike our president and chairman didn t really tell us what they re asking for they gave an overall dollar amount for the contract but they didn t really explain that to us i totally understand we re up against both the company and the union we re just not taking it any more i know in my heart you re not pushing me to do nothing and i know racine feels the same way this is about our future this is big when you sign an agreement it has to be right there s money to go around for everybody the overwhelming strike votes at cnh and workers determination to win back earlier concessions is part of an overall development of the class struggle internationally from the us to sri lanka peru to turkey and in many other countries workers are launching strikes and demonstrations against an increasingly impossible cost of living along with wages that have stagnated or eroded for decades a central role in the struggle by deere workers was the deere workers rank and file committee organized by workers with the assistance of the world socialist web site that formulated demands and provided workers with timely information to help defeat uaw sellouts a central task of a rank and file committee at cnh will be to draw up a list of demands based on the common interests of all workers such as an end to the tier system an immediate 40 percent raise to make up for years of stagnation the restoration of cola and retiree health benefits improvements to working hours and more to fight for these and other demands workers in racine and burlington should reach out to the thousands of cnh workers at non union plants in the us and in other countries as well as workers at deere caterpillar volvo mack and the big three automakers to prepare the groundwork for a new working class movement for higher wages job security and decent working conditions
pardonnez notre français mais le fed est phoqué yes s price continues its lower grind the current short trend in mind but tis the fed that s in a real bind stateside annualized real gross domestic product gdp less chain deflator just shrunk for the third successive quarter 3 7 in q3 2021 0 2 in q4 2021 and now a whopping 9 4 in q1 2022 with prices on the rise that s a stagflationary recession well underway period worse still toward memorializing this now nine month stint of higher prices and real economic shrinkage the federal open market committee shall we think unanimously as they ve all been blabbing about it increase their bank s funds rate by 50 basis points right in the face of it all going wrong live by the credibility and die by it this is the fed s worst bind in its 108 year history well mmb they were pretty entrapped back in the late 70s a devil s advocate point there squire within which came the volcker administered saturday night massacre but the money supply in those days was just 7 of what tis today and the debt gdp ratio just 35 whereas today tis 137 but to the point as reported this past monday by dow jones newswires the fed wants to raise rates quickly but may not know where to stop chair powell inferring a target of neutral in thus looking to the fed s favored inflation gauge the march s just reported 0 3 figure annualized is 3 6 were that the fed s neutral target then following this wednesday s 50 basis point fedfunds rate increase to the 0 75 1 00 range six subsequent 50 basis point increases targets the 3 75 4 00 range come the fomc s 01 february 2023 policy statement just in case you re planning ahead course this assumes that you neither drive nor eat moreover should real economic shrinkage continue such that consumers the 70 driver of the u s economy materially reign in their spending lacking the dough with which to go in turn making the fed nervous over missed debt service then tis qe seven all over again remember when bazooka joe cost 1 we do today tis 25 tomorrow 25 see venezuela zimbabwe et alia still such shock can be somewhat mitigated from covid to date the u s money supply by m2 has increased 44 some 7 trillion we ve previously demonstrated the final destination of all that money was basically the stock market however one may take some comfort against today s stagflationary angst via distribution of the money from the stock market back into folks pockets which obviously we re now seeing thus more dough at home to counter inflation along with the fed s cost of money and the nation can breathe a sigh of relief were it only that simple got gold as for the it always comes back crowd historically yes the stock market always has come all the way back but can you last that long to briefly review yet again the s p s high on 24 march 2000 was 1553 that level was not breached until 1555 traded over seven years later on 17 july 2007 then barely higher in hitting 1576 on 11 october 2007 twas better than five years until 1589 traded on 10 april 2013 or put another way for you westpalmbeachers down there it took the more than 13 years to rise just 36 points 2 3 from 1553 to 1589 to be sure we re all taught in finance 101 that stocks are a hedge against inflation so if we re still around we may compare notes in 2035 and don t forget the gold it being month end here we ve got the begos markets standings through april with a third of 2022 in the books obviously remains far out ahead followed on the podium by the itself not a begos component but a mainstay of this table and gold all the others are

don t miss out on the headlines from entertainment followed categories will be added to my news comment when meghan markle former suits star blogger and one time designer of a mid priced clothing range for a mid range department store married prince henry charles albert david she made history not just because she was the first woman of colour to marry into the royal family or that she was the oldest windsor bride but for one gloria steinem approved reason she was the first self made millionaire to have made the unthinkable leap from civvy street to hrhdom unlike sophie rhys jones camilla parker bowles and kate middleton the three windsor brides who preceded her up the aisle meghan was a woman who had carved out a successful career and had the bank account to boot when she got a title and a loaner tiara meghan markle was as successful actor and millionaire when she joined the royal family picture sem van der wal anp afp her decision to join the palace ranks was a 21st century feminist re imagining of the cinderella story now everyone clutch their copy of the female eunuch briefly in pride done good because here is where this supposed fairytale takes a dramatic turn for the worse because the question we are asking today is has meghan s us career totally flopped on monday news broke that pearl the animated series the duchess of sussex had been working on for netflix as part of the 140 million deal she and harry has with the streaming giant has been axed now sure the streaming behemoth has canned a slew of series from big names in the last week making the duchess just another casualty of the company s stock price woes and yes the company s pr machine swung into action saying that they still considered archewell productions a valued partner meghan markle s animated series pearl has been dumped by netflix photo by max mumby indigo getty images but widen the lens step back and a discernible and concerning pattern emerges pretty much every one of meghan s various professional endeavours since decamping from royaldom has been a bit of a failure in june 2020 it was announced that harry and meghan had signed on to the harry walker agency for speaking engagements neither has undertaken any sort of headline conference event or corporate gabfest in september of the same year the sussexes announced their megawatt deal with netflix reported to be worth around 140 million in the 21 months since then they have only announced two shows her animated one and a documentary about his sporting championship for wounded military service personnel called the heart of invictus meghan s series has now obviously been given the chop in december 2020 it was revealed that they had also signed on with spotify we will get our first real taste of the sussexes podcasting prowess in the coming months with the debut of meghan s ineptly named archetypes series the announcement of which was greeted with about as much enthusiasm as prince edward rolling up to give a pep talk at a young offenders institution then there was the bench meghan s debut literary foray a children s book it was published in july last year and the same month landed on the new york times bestsellers list for a scant three weeks it basically made a brief blip on the publishing landscape before disappearing from view by contrast a number of other pictures books on the list at the same time as the bench in 2021 including dragons love tacos and the day the crayons quit are both still on the bestseller list now in september meghan still appeared to be trying her darnedest to gin up interest in the title reading it to a class of harlem schoolchildren in full view of the press meghan markle s book the bench hasn t seen the huge success she may have hoped for picture youtube come october and she was still at recording a youtube video of her reading it an effort which has been viewed 474 000 times by contrast the queen s speech from last christmas has been viewed 917 000 times and that might be one of the dullest things i have had the misfortune of watching then there was her milestone 40th birthday project a charitable mentoring initiative called 40x40 it was announced with a headline grabbing video starring hollywood a lister melissa mccarthy and a cameo performance from harry demonstrating his juggling skills the launch garnered global publicity and coverage only for the whole thing to disappear talk about going out with a whimper not a bang the news section of sussexes archewell website has not mentioned the project since then meghan markle celebrated her 40th birthday by launching 40x40 but it hasn t been mentioned since picture archewell the thing is look back at the two years since harry and meghan landed on us soil to embark on their exciting new lives and the duchess has not notched up a single discernible win or clear cut success in a professional sense back in 2020 the sussexes were sizzlingly hot property who seemed to have hollywood wall street and silicon valley at their feet and a vast fortune was theirs for the making and taking sadly today the duchess is looking like a busted flush meghan doesn t really have a brand you feel that she is sort of grasping somewhat at whatever is the kind of twitter caring of the moment royal biographer and insider tina brown said in an interview with the washington post last week you know it s vaccinations it s ukraine it s women s rights it s hey my 40th birthday let s have a mentoring scheme nothing is really going anywhere for meghan what is looking increasingly apparent is that even in the us meghan might be a one woman headline generated powerhouse but that public obsession has remained infuriatingly impossible to monetise and this brings us to a painful truth without her royal connections meghan does not really matter all that much has the sparkle of meghan markle dulled now she s no longer a working royal picture max mumby indigo getty images before harry came along she had never appeared on a glossy magazine cover never had star billing anywhere and had according to the 2020 biography finding freedom resorted to occasionally set up a paparazzi photo here and there or let info slip out to the press all of that changed the minute the news broke that she was dating perhaps the most eligible bloke in the world then came the sussexes all too brief royal chapter followed by their freedom years the only thing that meghan has done that has really shaken the zeitgeist in the last two years has been the oprah winfrey interview during which she talked about the royal family separate meghan from her windsor ties and the question becomes does anyone really care however that is also a question that applies equally to harry the most memorable thing harry and meghan have done since leaving the royal family is talk about the royal family picture cbs over the weekend veteran british broadcaster and mate of prince charles jonathan dimbleby gave an interview to the times and warned that having left royal life they will become less and less significant as a couple as she gets older as he gets older they will matter less because the celebrity on which they trade will become less valuable and therein lies the heart of the matter what makes them so prized and marketable isn t their creativity or tv show ideas or charitable zeal or them as individuals but who his family is brown recently argued that the sussexes both completely underestimated what it was going to be like to be without the palace platform they re now having to scramble for the deals in a way that anybody who s a celebrity in kind of platformless universe has to do that is a miscalculation that could cost harry and meghan dearly and the further away they get from the magic of royalty the less dazzling and commercially attractive they look meghan markle and prince harry visited a harlem school last year where meghan read her children s book picture gotham gc images what is coming into focus is the inescapable fact that it is their status as intimately related to the current queen and the next three kings which makes them valuable to deep pocketed corporate giants unmoored from the monarchy their lustre and bankability is starting to look decidedly shaky the couple s very literal fortunes now rest on harry s memoir which will obviously largely deal with life in the royal family and his invictus doco a project he launched while a working member of the royal family the biggest success he has achieved in the last few years was the release of his mental health tv series the me you can t see which started when he was still a frontline royal like it or not all lucrative roads for both harry and meghan connect back to the royal family this gross underestimation of the power of the monarchy links brown argues is something that diana princess of wales would never have made she didn t want to be out of the monarchy she saw that the royal imprimatur was always going to be the best you know leverage the best convening power to promote the causes that she cared about i don t know that she would have ever really advocated going off to live in montecito without any of the patronages and any of the platform brown said in exactly a month from today the queen s platinum jubilee celebrations will kick off in london and harry and meghan have still not announced whether they will be attending regardless of whether they want to see his family or not some good old fashioned standing on the buckingham palace balcony and doing a spot of waving to the masses sounds like it would be just what their careers and bank accounts need right now daniela elser is a royal expert and a writer with more than 15 years experience working with a number of australia s leading media titles originally published as cruel message to meghan markle in netflix sacking

the announcement of which was greeted with about as much enthusiasm as prince edward rolling up to give a pep talk at a young offenders institution then there was the bench meghan s debut literary foray a children s book it was published in july last year and the same month landed on the new york times bestsellers list for a scant three weeks it basically made a brief blip on the publishing landscape before disappearing from view by contrast a number of other pictures books on the list at the same time as the bench in 2021 including dragons love tacos and the day the crayons quit are both still on the bestseller list now in september meghan still appeared to be trying her darnedest to gin up interest in the title reading it to a class of harlem schoolchildren in full view of the press meghan markle s book the bench hasn t seen the huge success she may have hoped for picture youtube come october and she was still at recording a youtube video of her reading it an effort which has been viewed 474 000 times by contrast the queen s speech from last christmas has been viewed 917 000 times and that might be one of the dullest things i have had the misfortune of watching then there was her milestone 40th birthday project a charitable mentoring initiative called 40x40 it was announced with a headline grabbing video starring hollywood a lister melissa mccarthy and a cameo performance from harry demonstrating his juggling skills the launch garnered global publicity and coverage only for the whole thing to disappear talk about going out with a whimper not a bang the news section of sussexes archewell website has not mentioned the project since then meghan markle celebrated her 40th birthday by launching 40x40 but it hasn t been mentioned since picture archewell the thing is look back at the two years since harry and meghan landed on us soil to embark on their exciting new lives and the duchess has not notched up a single discernible win or clear cut success in a professional sense back in 2020 the sussexes were sizzlingly hot property who seemed to have hollywood wall street and silicon valley at their feet and a vast fortune was theirs for the making and taking sadly today the duchess is looking like a busted flush meghan doesn t really have a brand you feel that she is sort of grasping somewhat at whatever is the kind of twitter caring of the moment royal biographer and insider tina brown said in an interview with the washington post last week you know it s vaccinations it s ukraine it s women s rights it s hey my 40th birthday let s have a mentoring scheme nothing is really going anywhere for meghan what is looking increasingly apparent is that even in the us meghan might be a one woman headline generated powerhouse but that public obsession has remained infuriatingly impossible to monetise and this brings us to a painful truth without her royal connections meghan does not really matter all that much has the sparkle of meghan markle dulled now she s no longer a working royal picture max mumby indigo getty images before harry came along she had never appeared on a glossy magazine cover never had star billing anywhere and had according to the 2020 biography finding freedom resorted to occasionally set up a paparazzi photo here and there or let info slip out to the press all of that changed the minute the news broke that she was dating perhaps the most eligible bloke in the world then came the sussexes all too brief royal chapter followed by their freedom years the only thing that meghan has done that has really shaken the zeitgeist in the last two years has been the oprah winfrey interview during which she talked about the royal family separate meghan from her windsor ties and the question becomes does anyone really care however that is also a question that applies equally to harry the most memorable thing harry and meghan have done since leaving the royal family is talk about the royal family picture cbs over the weekend veteran british broadcaster and mate of prince charles jonathan dimbleby gave an interview to the times and warned that having left royal life they will become less and less significant as a couple as she gets older as he gets older they will matter less because the celebrity on which they trade will become less valuable and therein lies the heart of the matter what makes them so prized and marketable isn t their creativity or tv show ideas or charitable zeal or them as individuals but who his family is brown recently argued that the sussexes both completely underestimated what it was going to be like to be without the palace platform they re now having to scramble for the deals in a way that anybody who s a celebrity in kind of platformless universe has to do that is a miscalculation that could cost harry and meghan dearly and the further away they get from the magic of royalty the less dazzling and commercially attractive they look meghan markle and prince harry visited a harlem school last year where meghan read her children s book picture gotham gc images what is coming into focus is the inescapable fact that it is their status as intimately related to the current queen and the next three kings which makes them valuable to deep pocketed corporate giants unmoored from the monarchy their lustre and bankability is starting to look decidedly shaky the couple s very literal fortunes now rest on harry s memoir which will obviously largely deal with life in the royal family and his invictus doco a project he launched while a working member of the royal family the biggest success he has achieved in the last few years was the release of his mental health tv series the me you can t see which started when he was still a frontline royal like it or not all lucrative roads for both harry and meghan connect back to the royal family this gross underestimation of the power of the monarchy links brown argues is something that diana princess of wales would never have made she didn t want to be out of the monarchy she saw that the royal imprimatur was always going to be the best you know leverage the best convening power to promote the causes that she cared about i don t know that she would have ever really advocated going off to live in montecito without any of the patronages and any of the platform brown said in exactly a month from today the queen s platinum jubilee celebrations will kick off in london and harry and meghan have still not announced whether they will be attending regardless of whether they want to see his family or not some good old fashioned standing on the buckingham palace balcony and doing a spot of waving to the masses sounds like it would be just what their careers and bank accounts need right now daniela elser is a royal expert and a writer with more than 15 years experience working with a number of australia s leading media titles originally published as cruel message to meghan markle in

the general contours of the business and investment climate are being shaped by three forces first russia s invasion of ukraine and the sanctions boosting price pressures and slow growth it was a supply shock even before the war countries had begun stepping back from the powerful monetary and fiscal support provided during the pandemic second china s response to its covid outbreak is slowing the world s second largest economy it threatens supply chains but also a demand shock the knock on effect has seen a reversal of fortunes for previously favored commodity currencies third the market understands that the federal reserve has made a hawkish pivot it now sees the year end fed funds target at 2 85 up from around 0 80 at the end of last year and 2 40 at the end of march in addition a relatively aggressive reduction of the fed s balance sheet in the current context is also tantamount to some more tightening even if economists differ on how much this has helped send the us dollar broadly higher while the fog of war and the impact of china s covid policies reduce visibility and boost uncertainty they have spurred an acceleration of rate hikes among the high income countries the reserve bank of new zealand and the bank of canada hiked rates by 50 bp the federal reserve to match them in may at the same time several central banks including the reserve bank of australia the reserve bank of new zealand the bank of england sweden s riksbank and the bank of canada have begun allowing their balance sheets to shrink by refraining from reinvesting the full amount of the maturing proceeds at the may 4 meeting the federal reserve will announce its starting date after a short rolling start the fed is seen allowing the balance sheet to shrink by 95 bln a month 60 bln of treasuries and 35 bln mbs this is almost twice the fed s pace in the 2017 2019 period the aggressive reduction of the fed s balance sheet spurred an abrupt steepening of the us in the first half of april the inversion that provoked so much discussion was erased and the 40 bp difference that it reached was the steepest slope since late february the curve finished the april near 20 bp we suspect the curve will become inverted again the swaps market shows that the terminal rate for the fed funds will be around 3 25 3 50 in this cycle suggesting that there may be value at the long end of the curve when yields are near 3 however the two year note yield may need to climb closer to the anticipated peak in fed funds our concern is that something breaks before the fed can lift rates to those levels the combination of aggressively tighter monetary policy including the balance sheet a dramatic decline in fiscal support the deficit may be halved this year from 10 8 of gdp in 2021 to around 5 3 and the higher food and energy prices that sap the purchasing power of consumers will slow the economy this quarter will likely see better growth than q1 but starting in h2 a more sustained slowdown may become evident interest rate sensitive sectors like housing may already be seeing some evidence the unexpected decline contraction in q1 us was bit of a statistical fluke the yawning and slower inventory accumulation shaved four percentage points off gdp final sales to domestic purchasers which excludes trade and inventories rose 3 7 in q1 which is more than the previous two quarters combined q3 21 1 3 and q4 21 1 7 the decline in q1 gdp is not a prelude to a recession and most economists look for a strong rebound in q2 yet don t be mistaken growth forecasts are being cut the world bank and imf have cut their global forecasts this year s forecast for the us was cut to 3 7 from 4 0 which is still higher than the private sector projection bloomberg survey median is 3 2 next year the imf has the us growing by 2 3 0 3 less than its estimate in january this is also a little optimistic compared with private sector forecasts several european countries including germany france and italy cut their 2022 growth outlooks china s q1 surprised on the upside but the details were poor and the full impact of the lockdown in shanghai 25 mln people has yet to be reflected in the data indeed the pandemic in china threats domestic growth and further disruption in global supply chains the imf trimmed its forecast for china s 2022 gdp to 4 4 from 4 8 while china has targeted growth at 5 5 there were four main developments in the foreign exchange market to note first the dollar was broadly stronger boosted by a dramatic adjustment to the federal reserve s now recognized as a second the divergence of monetary policy drove the yen to 20 year lows against the dollar the boj shows no sign of ending its yield curve control policy that caps that yield at 0 25 third the tightening of monetary policy reduced risk appetites which weighed on the dollar bloc currencies and latam currencies fourth the chinese yuan came under strong selling pressure the 10 year of 100 bp it offered in early march turned into a small discount portfolio capital outflows and boosting currency hedge ratios were drags on the currency rising rates and weaker growth are challenging equity investors among the g10 only the internationally heavy is higher on the year through the end of april in europe luxembourg 2 9 norway all share index 6 5 and portugal all share index 4 6 have shined between the squeeze on the property and tech sectors and the zero covid policy chinese equities are among the worst performers through the first third of the year the top 300 companies list in either shanghai or shenzhen is off nearly 19 year to date a couple of markets in emerging economies are proving resilient in the asia pacific region the strait times of is up 7 5 and the has risen almost 10 most central european equities markets have been sold but turkey s index is up nearly 32 is notable the is off a little more than 10 this year after a 44 decline last year in 2021 turkey s shares rallied by about 30 however regionally latam stands out equities in the region have generally rallied amid rising commodities the nearly 3 5 decline in mexico s is a notable exception south america and mexico have accounted for five of the top six emerging market currencies in q1 22 but in april as we have noted there were hit by an aggressive bout of profit taking the s 2 7 decline was the best performer in the region the lost about 7 26 the s 4 5 drop trimmed this year s advance to around 12 2 uk prime minister johnson s approval suffered before russia invaded ukraine and the war eased the political pressure however the issue returned last month as the prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer were fined by the london police for violating covid restrictions last year chancellor sunak also ran afoul of poor press as his wife filed taxes as a non domicile which means she did not have to pay uk taxes sunak had been regarded as a likely candidate to succeed johnson but his spring budget statement was poorly received and the fine for being at a party he denied attending sapped his support in addition the tory showing in the local elections on may 5 wales uk and northern ireland s assembly may intensify the pressure on johnson still there may not be a compelling alternative that could lead the party to victory in 2024 germany holds two state elections in may they may draw interest as a bit of a referendum on the federal government which has taken at least three measures merkel did not first the controversial nord stream 2 pipeline has been formally terminated second after growing increasingly dependent on russian energy even after the war in georgia 2008 and the annexation of crimea 2014 the new german government has set about reversing direction third the spd led government committed to boosting military spending after years of under spending relative to the commitment to nato schleswig holstein s election is on may 8 the state is currently led by a cdu green fdp coalition north rhine westphalia has a cdu fdp government and it goes to the polls on may 15 australia s general election is on may 21 it is a close contest the liberal national coalition seeks a fourth term but voters seem to want a change however labor has run an uninspired campaign neither may secure 76 seats in parliament for a majority the market anticipates the beginning of what may be an aggressive tightening cycle an acceleration of q1 cpi to 5 1 from 3 5 in q4 21 with a 4 unemployment rate spurred speculation of the first move coming at the may 4 central bank meeting rather than waiting until after the election the cash rate futures market is discounts about 240 bp of tightening before year end the bannockburn world currency index is a gdp weighted index of the top 12 economies recognizing the eurozone as one economy half of the constituents are from high income countries and the other half are from emerging market economies the index fell almost 2 5 in april reflecting the decline of the constituent currencies against the us dollar it was the largest fall since may 2012 and the first monthly decline of more than 2 since january 2015 the bwci hit a low in march 2020 around 93 60 and peaked last june near 102 25 it finished april near 97 55 none of the currencies in the index gained against the greenback the with a a little less than a 1 decline was the most resilient followed by the canadian dollar and mexican peso 2 7 the yen was the weakest falling around 6 2 several of the currencies in the index fell by more than 4 including the euro sterling the australian dollar and the brazilian real the chinese yuan s 4 decline in april appears is the largest monthly depreciation since at least 2005 when the peg formally ended the federal reserve has communicated its intent to bring the fed funds rate to a neutral setting and maybe higher in recognition of the persistence of unacceptably high inflation the market has gone a long way toward pricing in 50 bp rate hikes at the next four fomc meetings through q3 the message from the fed s leadership is that the policy adjustment will be front loaded the market accepts this and sees fed funds peaking next year around 3 25 3 50 in addition the may 5 fomc meeting is expected to announce an aggressive unwinding of the fed s balance sheet after a short ramp up period 95 bln a month of maturing bonds will not be re invested some economists estimate that the balance sheet reduction in h2 could be the equivalent of another 50 bp hike the dollar s strength is consistent with the tighter financial conditions and exports are at a record even if imports have grown faster there seems to be scope for additional dollar gains but the leg higher looks nearly complete the pendulum of market fear of may peak around the same time as the corrective and consolidative forces are likely in the weeks ahead the european central bank will continue to buy bonds through june the swaps market discounts a tightening cycle that begins in july and is anticipating more than 80 bp of hikes in the second half this seems to be pricing in perfection we note that only the hawkish members of the ecb are talking about a hike in july president lagarde has been more circumspect it is still vulnerable wider cuts in russian gas shipments moreover the sanctions will begin covering parts of russia s energy exports which may also come at new costs for europe disputes within europe have been overshadowed by the war in ukraine however the fissures cannot be held at bay much longer the ec appears to be doing a good job separating poland and hungarian issues and electoral result in slovakia will see tensions ease leaving hungary with one less ally hungary may be the test case for the ec s new power to deny funds to members for contravening eu rules the euro fell to five year lows in late april near 1 0470 on a near term view of momentum it is stretched but also in terms of the oecd s

than officials who seem more focused about the pace of the adjustment after years of adopting to a strong yen japanese businesses suddenly find themselves having to compete in a weak yen environment the yen s slide of 6 2 in april brings the year to date decline to 11 25 moreover the yen has morphed from a low volatility exchange rate to a higher one forcing an adjustment by asset managers and hedge funds one month implied volatility reached almost 13 in late april almost twice the average over the past 200 day japanese households appear more unsettled by the rise in price pressures which the bank of japan says will not be sustainable and maintains its asset purchases and 0 25 cap on the 10 year yield is expected to jump starting with the april reports as the cut in the mobile phone charges drop out of the 12 month comparison on the other hand according to some estimates the government s fiscal support will result in around 0 5 decline in the imf s regional head indicated that the yen s weakness is fundamentally driven and that the dollar is strong broadly making actual material intervention only a remote possibility the dollar broke above the jpy130 area in late april after the boj strengthened its determination to cap the 10 year yield yet if we are right about value emerging at the long end of the us curve some of the downside pressure on the yen may ease and a

cost of living squeeze is weakening the economy and the bank of england will be unable to raise rates as aggressively as the us and canada for example the uk economy is particularly sensitive to the rising interest rates and energy prices excluding gasoline uk have fallen for nine of the past 11 months through march the boe is tightening policy gradually its balance sheet has begun shrinking with the anticipated 25 bp hike on may 5 the base rate will be at 1 allowing the central bank to sell its holdings not just passively wait for holdings to mature however the boe has signaled this is unlikely at the end of last year the and us 2 year yields were around parity now the us offers about 110 bp on top of the uk the most since before covid the uk holds local elections on the same day as the boe meeting the polls point to the likelihood of a poor showing for the tories which could intensify the cloud of uncertainty that hangs over prime minister johnson the political challenge is starker too now that the favorite to replace johnson chancellor of the exchequer sunak has taken a drubbing in the polls at the same time sein fein looks to take a majority in northern ireland s assembly for the first time sterling s accelerated decline in late april leaves it stretched from a technical perspective it punched through the 1 25 area and there may be scope for another couple of

restrictive than anticipated this did not prevent the canadian dollar from of succumbing to the strong us dollar instead it helped minimize the loss the canadian dollar declined about 2 70 in april the least of the major currencies yet it was still was sufficient to reverse the q1 gain and leave it off about 1 6 year to date the canadian dollar remains sensitive to the general risk appetite as

the economic weakness and beijing s policies may have encouraged foreign investors to reduce equity exposure it appears that foreign investors sold around 36 bln of chinese stocks and bonds in february and march in april the sales continued and anecdotal reports suggest currency hedge ratios were raised chinese exporters may ease the pressure on customers to pay in yuan whose market share of swift the message system remains less than 3 chinese officials have been reluctant to take bold measures to provide support for the economy which still is at the mercy of covid and the lockdowns we are concerned that developments will get worse in the period ahead it would mean a greater risk of supply chain disruptions and slower growth impulses from the world s second largest economy and the largest exporter this could translate into a weaker yuan and higher volatility the pboc cut the required reserve on foreign currency deposits by 1 in april ostensibly to boost the supply of dollars and other currencies to steady or slow the yuan s descent this was understood as a mild move given that it hiked it in two percentage point increments twice last year a move above cny6 65 may encourage run toward cny6 75
