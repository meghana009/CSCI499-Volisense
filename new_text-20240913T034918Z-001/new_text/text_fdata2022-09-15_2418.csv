america s love affair with a steak dinner started many decades ago and is still as strong as ever while the current competitive steakhouse landscape is dominated by household names like outback longhorn and texas roadhouse many steakhouse giants have come and gone before them old school steakhouses created a different experience and atmosphere that is more rare to find today you might have to take a trip to an upscale restaurant in order to receive the service and dining quality we save back in the 70s and 80s here s a walk down memory lane that takes stock of several beloved american steakhouse chains that ended up going out of business when all was said and done 8 steakhouse chains with the best quality meat in america lone star steakhouse what once was a potential rival to texas roadhouse or outback steakhouse today lone star steakhouse saloon is only just a memory according to restaurant business the steakhouse chain started with eight locations in 1992 and within a few years it had grown nationwide with more than 250 units across the boards but unfortunately by the mid 2000s lone star was growing too quickly and had a dramatic fall in 2017 filing for bankruptcy with less than 20 locations remaining for some time it wasn t too long until it was completely gone 6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e sign up for our newsletter this site is protected by recaptcha and the google privacy policy and terms of service apply mr steak someone should have told mr steak not to fix what ain t broke as the popular chain s pivot outside of steak seemed to be its demise the popular nationwide brand was first launched in colorado in the 1960s when a steak dinner was just about the epitome of the american lifestyle it served affordable u s d a choice steak a t bone steak dinner featuring salad a choice of potatoes and toast would set you back about 3 99 back then 2 99 with coupons throughout the following decades the chain flourished with its simple message of high protein well priced dinner options and reached its absolute peak with 278 units across the country in 1978 but the chain then tried to diversify following what it believed was a shift in public opinion on steak adding chicken fish salad and other options to its menu which ended up confusing the message to its customers besides the clientele was already being drawn away by competitors add to that a money losing attempt at expanding and the chain ended up filing for bankruptcy in 1984 at a reduced store count of just 150 in 1993 the chain attempted a comeback by rebranding its remaining 40 locations to mr steak s firegrill a modernized western themed concept with huge dining rooms visible cooking areas lounges and new decor in 2009 the final location of mr steak closed its doors in st charles mo some of its michigan locations were rebranded as finley s and you can still enjoy a steak there today steak and ale another relic from the 60s the steak and ale brand debuted in dallas as a chain offering a high end steak experience at lower prices its signature dishes included an herb roasted prime rib ny strip and filet mignon while the menu was punctuated with an unlimited salad offering and a soup that came alongside most dishes in 1976 pillsbury purchased all 113 steak and ale locations and ended up taking it to new heights by the late 80s the chain was at its peak with 280 restaurants across the country but competition began nipping at its heels and the company was soon on a downward spiral in 2008 all of the chain s remaining 58 locations shuttered permanently as part of its parent company s bankruptcy proceedings however there s been recent chatter about reviving steak and ale whose intellectual property like branding and recipes safely reside with legendary restaurant brands llc the parent company of bennigan s and bennigan s on the fly the chain is allegedly opening its first location in cancun mexico and looking for franchisees in the united states valle s steak house this steak and lobster joint must have been doing something right because it was around for an impressive tenure of over seven decades the chain s locations dotted across maine massachusetts new york rhode island connecticut pennsylvania washington d c florida and georgia operated huge dining rooms and provided quick service to its patrons which enabled them to benefit from a fast turnover of customers but by the 80s the company was in turmoil and judith and richard valle part of the founding family were looking to offload their controlling shares in the company at the time valle s operated 32 locations and this was the beginning of the end for its shrinking footprint the final three locations shut down in december of 1991 7 steakhouse chains with the best quality

operated close to 200 locations in 27 states spanning from texas to maine most of the locations were housed inside malls and served hot and cold items like the popular steak potatoes and salad combo some of the chain s locations would eventually become york s choices which featured the addition of bakery and dessert displays at the front of the store but once general mills bowed out of the relationship things quickly went downhill for the strip mall staple the chain began shedding locations and while some remained in operation as independent restaurants for several years the brand was largely defunct by the early aughts one final york steak house location is still in operation today in columbus ohio according to its website the restaurant is keeping the nostalgia as well as the

u s district court judge lydia kay griggsby ordered wednesday afternoon a postponement of baltimore state s attorney marilyn mosby s upcoming perjury and mortgage fraud trial due to a delayed disclosure on expert testimony her trial was scheduled to begin monday after jury selection on thursday and the postponement comes after the defense failed to disclose the details of its expert witness testimony by griggsby s mandated july 1 deadline mosby s lawyers sent its last disclosure at griggsby s direction to prosecutors late friday night lawyers for mosby opposed the postponement describing federal prosecutors as hypocrites for raising a delay as a remedy for legal debates in the case the last minute pointed back and forth came just before jury selection was slated to start thursday and as attorneys on both sides prepared for wednesday s hearing late monday night and during the day tuesday prosecutors made an attempt to undercut an evolving legal strategy from mosby s defense her lawyers plan to argue she s not guilty of perjury because her personal business took a hit because of the coronavirus pandemic prosecutors asked to introduce sanitized snippets of statements the state s attorney made while under unrelated investigations in 2020 and 2021 indicating that her businesses were inoperable and hadn t made her a dollar then the government said mosby s defense team missed a deadline to provide a disclosure about what its forensic accountant planned to testify to at trial prosecutors received an email late friday night after the court s deadline indicating the defense expert planned to testify about the travel industry mosby s investment portfolio and the stock market during the covid 19 crisis prosecutors asked griggsby to either prohibit the accountant s testimony because of the late disclosure and what they described as inappropriate testimony or to postpone the trial so the government could hire its own expert on the travel industry and the economy to evaluate and potentially rebut the defense s witness two legal experts interviewed by the baltimore sun on tuesday predicted griggsby would find good cause and postpone the case in recognition of both sides right to a fair trial and the potential appellate ramifications of limiting the defense s expert testimony the way prosecutors proposed in a tuesday night filing mosby s lawyers pushed back on the prosecution s request they urged griggsby to deny a postponement arguing prosecutors had missed their opportunity to file these pretrial motions and had enough time to prepare for trial the defense lawyers called the government s late motions evidence of trial by ambush tactics griggsby should deny prosecutors request on their hypocrisy alone mosby s lawyers argued citing the government s opposition to mosby s push for a delay in april griggsby granted mosby s request then but mosby s lawyers also filed a pretrial motion outside of the deadline griggsby set the judge allowed the argument over whether to dismiss the perjury charges to go forward and scheduled the hearing wednesday for the attorneys to debate it after unsuccessfully arguing for the case to be dismissed because of unfounded claims of racial and personal animus harbored within the maryland u s attorney s office mosby s lawyers presented a nuanced legal argument targeting the perjury charges the defense said language congress crafted to determine eligibility for cares act relief was fundamentally ambiguous and that mosby couldn t be prosecuted under those terms according to her indictment mosby applied for two early withdrawals from her city retirement savings account under the guise of having suffered financially because of the coronavirus state and city employees cannot access their retirement accounts before retirement unless they stop working for the government or experience an unforeseeable emergency congress loosened those rules temporarily when it passed the cares act meaning government workers could draw retirement funds by claiming a business they owned had to shut down or took a loss or they had suffered adverse financial consequences because of covid 19 mosby checked a box under the penalties of perjury that she either suffered adverse financial consequence because of the pandemic either being laid off or furloughed having reduced work hours because of a lack of childcare or experiencing a monetary blow in her personal business the indictment said federal prosecutors say she suffered none the indictment says mosby used the approximately 80 000 from the two early withdrawals to make down payments on a pair of vacation homes in florida an eight bedroom rental near disney world and a condo on the state s gulf coast without those two withdrawals she would not have been able to make the down payment on either of the two florida vacation homes she purchased in september 2020 and february 2021 federal prosecutors wrote in a previous court filing simply put the defendant s perjury allowed her to leverage 90 000 in funds she should not have had access to in order to get two vacation homes prosecutors also accused mosby of lying on mortgage applications for both properties by obfuscating her intentions about the rental to lock in a lower interest rate and neglecting to disclose a federal tax lien on both loan requests

the stock market is the right place to implement a get rich slow scheme the stock market has proven to be a great way for normal folks to build wealth over time if get rich quick schemes work it s usually for the party on the other side of the bet but investing in great companies at reasonable prices can be a great way to get rich over time it can be as simple as investing through index funds for some that don t have the time or inclination to stay involved but identifying good values and great companies can help boost returns even further below are five stock investments that could offer a diversified way to beat the s p 500 index over the coming years and decades berkshire hathaway some people want others to manage their money and investing in warren buffett s berkshire hathaway brk a 0 59 brk b 0 74 is almost like having a fund manager but it comes with added benefits berkshire has brilliant leadership with buffett and vice chairman charlie munger who have been mentoring their eventual successors for years it also offers a mix of stock ownership and cash generating operating businesses it owns businesses in manufacturing and retail an energy and utilities business bnsf railroad and insurance it also holds meaningful investments in a broad mix of companies that include several banks apple coca cola american express as well as automakers buffett and munger have liked buying berkshire stock too the company spent more than 51 billion to repurchase about 9 of its own shares in 2020 and 2021 its businesses continue to thrive with operating earnings growing more than 19 year over year in the first six months of 2022 those share repurchases have continued in 2022 though at a slower pace through the first half of the year berkshire spent 4 2 billion more on buybacks two consumer favorites walt disney dis 0 93 and target tgt 0 67 have had struggles recently but these names have proven they can navigate their businesses successfully through many different environments disney is pouring money into its streaming services as it builds that business segment while its streaming business isn t yet profitable the company can fund that growth from its other segments in its fiscal 2022 third quarter report for the period ended july 2 2022 disney said its theme parks are thriving for the nine month period ending that date its parks experiences and products segment almost doubled revenue year over year importantly revenue from the parks segment was also 9 higher compared to the same nine month period prior to the pandemic in 2019 target stock has taken a recent hit after it created an inventory glut trying to work through supply chain constraints but the company directly addressed the situation with investors and showed confidence in its plan by raising its dividend by 20 at the same time target s dividend is one reason an investment is worth considering despite the risks having now raised the dividend for 51 consecutive years the company is on the elite list of dividend kings while past performance isn t a prediction of future results berkshire disney and target have treated shareholders well for a very long time all three stocks have handily beaten the s p 500 in total returns including dividends since 2000 tap into future trends the electric vehicle ev sector looks to be just getting started and it would make sense to have a stake in it tesla tsla 5 59 has been the trailblazer and is the obvious leader the company isn t just sitting around waiting for others to catch up either ceo elon musk has the lofty goal of selling 20 million evs annually the company is just now ramping up its third and fourth manufacturing plants and musk s goal is to have as many as 12 tesla is expanding its product offerings with its semi truck and cybertruck scheduled to begin sales this year and next respectively it also has a growing energy business that supplies megapacks for energy storage as well as products for solar generation tesla almost ran out of money when its was ramping up its mass production model 3 vehicle but it reported 5 5 billion in net income in 2021 and exceeded that in just the first six months of 2022 some investors might want to speculate on another ev name since the sector itself is just taking off like tesla china based nio nyse nio narrowly avoided bankruptcy just a couple years ago while it still is losing money it had about 8 billion in cash on its balance sheet as of june 30 2022 nio has been struggling with supply chain issues as well as a drop in demand as china has continued to lock down cities as covid 19 cases arise but those short term struggles aren t a reason to avoid the stock as part of a diversified portfolio it continues to launch new vehicles and has started expanding its exports into europe while nio remains a very high risk investment the risk is tempered as part of this group of five stocks one bad outcome can be overcome by the balance of these names and the stock market has proven that if one diversifies appropriately it s the way investors can get rich over time

in another sign tensions are brewing between mayor adams and council speaker adrienne adams the speaker pushed back wednesday on hizzoner s demands that city agencies further cut their costs calling such a move counterproductive mayor adams called for the additional cost saving measures monday when his budget director jacques jiha signaled to city department heads that they should prepare to cut 3 from their budgets in addition to the 3 they were required to shed as part of the mayor s first adopted budget in his memo to agency heads jiha targeted all city agencies including the nypd health department and department of correction which were spared previous cuts and he signaled future cuts as well until at least 2026 speaker adams remarks wednesday represent her strongest critique of the mayor s proposal yet she cited recent difficulties the city has had hiring and retaining employees as part of what s guiding her rationale council speaker adrienne adams it s counterproductive for the administration to further restrict city agencies that need even more capacity for hiring purposes she said the city has to be judicious to ensure that it s making smart investments that yield long term benefits for our city and our communities rather than broadly making cuts that can undermine the health of our neighborhoods her statement wednesday came just two days after she said she d support a bill floated by public advocate jumaane williams that s intended to ban the use of solitary confinement in city jails mayor adams has said for months he opposes such a ban and on tuesday he doubled down on that stance labeling the council s proposal silly the mayor likened banning solitary to instructing cops to stop arresting people for violent street crimes what the city council is saying is if someone slashes someone in jail you do nothing with them he said tuesday during an appearance at the national press club in washington d c well if they believe that then don t arrest anyone for slashing someone on the street i mean you can t have it both ways mayor eric adams the mayor s argument for agency by agency budget cuts or the program to eliminate the gap or peg as it s also known has been a bit more nuanced it centers on the idea that the city needs to be prepared for fiscal headwinds which watchdogs have predicted are likely on the horizon they ve cited a downturn in the stock market soon to expire labor contracts inflation and rising health care costs as realities that make the city ripe for a significant budget shortfall a recession would be deeply problematic as well the prospect for such eventualities is what led to jiha s memo which essentially served as a precursor to the city s november budget modification typically the mayor proposes such modifications which the council can approve or vote down on wednesday council speaker adams didn t rule out the potential of a down vote we re not really there yet we re still considering our options when it comes to what happens in november she told reporters the picture is not clear what we re going to be looking at in november so the discussion is a little bit premature

while each took a different approach the major broadcast networks of abc cbs and nbc worked wednesday to isolate president biden from blame for the pitiful august inflation report showing it came out to 8 3 percent when the predicted number was 8 1 percent with energy food and rent still soaring instead some of them trumpeted biden s positive spin and that he s not worried about it while one ignored biden completely abc s good morning america co host and former clinton official george stephanopoulos opened with a tease warning of he sharpest one day stock market loss in two years and the inflation fallout following he disappointing new economic report showing prices still climbing more than expected how the fed could respond and what president biden is saying about the fight against inflation he added chief business correspondent rebecca jarvis gave the nuts and bolts of the inflation report with grocery prices up 13 5 percent helter costs those include rent prices up 6 2 percent from a year ago and medical care services up 5 6 percent from a year ago ahead of a likely interest rate hike of 0 75 percent hike from the federal reserve stephanopoulos went moments later to senior white house correspondent mary bruce with dejection mary not welcome news at the white house always a liberal stenographer bruce brushed it aside by arguing biden s not worried about these latest inflation numbers and he s putting a positive spin on things he is stressing that inflation is relatively flat up just 0 1 point since july and he argues the economy is strong pointing to low unemployment numbers and plunging gas prices the president is also touting democrats new inflation reduction act he is promising it will do just that that it will bring down energy and prescription drug costs she added bruce conceded that biden largely ignored these worse than expected numbers during that a big celebration at the white house even though they re well aware that inflation is a big potential political liability but since the white house does admit there s still a lot more work to be done here bruce and stephanopoulos were satisfied cbs mornings began with co host and democratic donor gayle king fretting wall street plunges on worse than expected news on prices even as president biden celebrates his inflation reduction act senior white house correspondent ed o keefe said later that it dashe hopes of a quicker economic rebound and while the stock market goes up and down all the time this one day drop for most indexes was the biggest since the early months of the covid 19 pandemic he noted that the figures came ust as the president and democrats were celebrating passage of their inflation reduction act with a soundbite of biden claiming it was he single most important legislation passed in the congress to combat inflation and one of the most significant laws in our nation s history in my view o keefe noted a few of the provisions but he admirably conceded it would do nothing address short term price hikes however he added biden isn t worried while republicans disagree o keefe also covered senator lindsey graham s r sc proposed national abortion bill but correctly made clear that the economy and inflation remain the top issues of concern for voters afterward cbs news business analyst jill schlessinger had more bad news about how holiday shopping could be a struggle click expand burleson all right so gas prices are down over the month but higher than a year ago other consumer prices are still up what s going on here schlessinger so this report was really important because that headline number did go down it didn t go down by as much as expected but i think the other areas of the report were really somewhat worrisome so let s look at food costs which were up by more than 11 percent from a year ago that s the fastest annual acceleration since 1979 so that s a big number and then we look at shelter the number isn t that big it s up 6 2 percent from a year ago but think about how much money of your household goes towards rent or paying for your house so that core inflation rate all the other stuff besides food and energy rising pretty substantially that s the worrying aspect of the report great news that gas prices are down but everything else is still expensive burleson okay jill we ve got holiday shopping around the corner will these prices come down schlessinger well here s the issue i think there is another aspect to the selloff in stocks i think that there is a worry that consumers if you re paying so much for food for gas for energy for everything else that you are not going to have as much money to spend on the holiday season and i m unfortunately here to report that i don t think prices are going to come down substantially in the next few months and that means that you may have to spend a little bit less this holiday season nbc s today went in a different direction by not even mentioning biden s name in their six minutes and 10 seconds of inflation coverage minus teases here were some highlights click expand hoda kotb and in just a moment guys we re going to get to the fallout over that sort of unexpected worse than expected inflation report it sent stocks into a freefall yesterday and coming up we re going to let you know what it means for your family s budget and also maybe tips that will help you make the most of your spending this fall savannah guthrie key measure of inflation was not what investors or the average american wanted to see the consumer price index predicted to fall in august actually rose an increase of 8 3 percent if you look from a year ago melissa lee well there were a lot of things that were in fact going right gas prices came down tremendously down 26 percent from its peak it was 5 a gallon in june we are paying 3 70 on average according to aaa right now so that came down supply chains issues they started to work out and a lot of retailers have a lot of inventory they marked a lot of things down so all of those things were seen as driving prices lower and so that s why there was a hope we had seen the worse of it when it came to inflation but there were other pockets of inflation that actually went higher food prices went up 0 8 percent you know housing went up 0 7 percent housing is one third of cpi and housing is sticky think about it you sign a lease it s usual for a year it s going to take a time for the price to come down kotb the fed seems to keep raising interest rates like that was supposed to be the solution the answer so is do we know if it s working or do we still have to wait give it time to see if it ll kick in lee we have to wait and give it time it takes six months or so for any interest rates hikes to work themselves into the economy we ve already seen two back to back 75 basis point interest hikes in the past two meetings there is another meeting next week now it s believed because the inflation number came in much hotter it will be 75 basis points again three back to back to back that s unprecedented emilie ikeda it s no secret inflation is hammering americans from just about every angle with industry

by susan puckett cnn eat with the seasons has long been the rallying cry of local growers and their supporters it s a message that s easy to embrace the taste and nutritional value of a hothouse tomato from the supermarket s year round stock is no match for that of one ripened by the sun in a community garden you ll get far more berries for the buck harvesting them yourself at a u pick farm than buying those packed in half pint plastic containers and air freighted from thousands of miles away and patronizing our neighborhood farm markets gives us the good feeling of getting to know our sustainably minded producers and their earth friendly practices while investing in the local economy but are personal food choices such as these doing much if anything to heal our ailing planet the answer in complicated and it depends on the food in question a united nations backed study from 2021 shows that the way we produce process and package food accounts for more than one third of global greenhouse gas emissions caused by human activity a 2019 report by the eat lancet commission a team of leading scientists across the globe further warned that without drastically changing our food consumption habits we won t be able to meet the nutritional needs of a growing world population without irreversible environmental damage and a new study exploring the carbon footprint greenhouse gas emissions of americans evolving eating patterns assures us that our efforts to shop and eat better aren t in vain some foods impact the environment in drastically different ways animal products and heavily processed and packaged foods for example typically require considerably more energy to produce than the homegrown and handmade foods at local farmers markets five commodities are responsible for more than 75 of the u s diet s carbon footprint according to study beef milk and dairy pork chicken and eggs and more than half of those greenhouse gases can be attributed to beef the good news said clare bassi the study s co author is diet changes are happening according to her study over a 15 year period us beef consumption fell by 30 while collective changes in eating habits across all demographics led to a 35 decline in greenhouse gas emissions that s roughly equivalent to taking every single passenger vehicle off the road for nearly two years she said in an email the study calculated greenhouse gas emissions based on individual daily diets reported by more than 39 000 us adults in the national health and nutrition examination survey between 2003 and 2018 bassi looked at how the averages changed over time and examined trends based on demographic factors such as sex age household income and race ethnicity the study was published in the journal of cleaner production other studies bassi added have shown that more than half of americans are willing to eat more plant based meat alternatives and it s predicted that the global market for plant based protein sources may increase five fold by 2030 going the distance a common claim among local food advocates is that reducing our food miles the distance our food travels from farm to plate can also help fight climate change some groups have even advocated labeling to indicate a product s mileage to its destination that might make sense intuitively but in a 2020 report hannah ritchie the head of research at our world in data calls that one of the most misguided pieces of advice land use and farm stage emissions including the application of fertilizers and production of methane in the stomachs of cattle account for more than 80 of the footprint for most foods transport is responsible for less than 10 of their final carbon impact for beef it s less than 1 the remainder of a food s emissions mostly occur during processing packaging and retail eating locally would only have a significant impact if transport was responsible for a large share of food s final carbon footprint ritchie wrote in the report for most foods this is not the case she does however note one exception where seasonality and geography do make a difference products which travel by air most foods are transported by boat which generate far fewer emissions air freight is generally reserved for highly perishable foods where speed of delivery is essential such as blueberries or green beans so it s probably a safe bet that those fragile fruits and vegetables at the farmstand will be a more climate friendly choice than their out of season mass produced counterparts practical solution what you eat as with recycling trying to offer one size fits all solutions is tricky and sometimes even counterproductive scientists and activists tell us that no amount of individual action will be sufficient to halt the catastrophic impacts on the climate global policies holding industry accountable for its role in the crisis they stress are essential for addressing the magnitude of the problem but that doesn t mean consumers are powerless beyond pressuring their lawmakers small changes at home really can make a significant positive impact bassi said by far the more significant thing we can do at the dining table to mitigate climate change she said is to eat less meat and dairy and incorporate a variety of healthy plant based alternatives into our diets fruits vegetables grains legumes nuts while eating less meat is one of the more quantifiable actions we can take other actions add up as well sourcing locally can be one driver for impact reduction bassi said but it s often a small or highly variable lever for change she and other experts stress that it s important for consumers to understand that what we eat rather than where it originated and how it gets to us matters most when it comes to trying to shrink our own carbon footprint most consumers don t want to invest tons of time untangling these simultaneous equations in their heads in making their food purchases said roni neff an assistant professor at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health and program director at the johns hopkins center for a livable future nor should they making these dietary shifts needn t be difficult neff said if the goal is greenhouse reduction weighing the differences between this apple and that apple is less important than just knowing it s an apple she said think about the bottom of the food chain you learned about in elementary school plants and seafood that are eating plants practical solution reducing food waste another practical way for individuals to take control of their carbon footprint is reducing food waste farmers have to grow far more food than we actually need because some 30 to 40 of what they produce gets tossed according to the united natural resources defense council that comes at a huge cost in greenhouse gases neff said plus it wastes land water labor energy and other valuable resources in this regard she pointed out controlling our portion sizes matters not only to our waistlines but the planet it s easy to buy more than we can realistically eat especially when we re shopping at a farmer s market when everything s fresh and beautiful and we just want to try it all and buy it all she said turning food scraps into nutrient rich compost can combat food waste while helping your garden grow neff also suggested getting creative with leftovers following guidelines for freezing your excess and setting a special bin in the front of the fridge for things that need to be consumed more quickly a really useful way to come up with solutions is write down everything your household actually eats for a week neff suggested get in the habit of communicating with family members to coordinate schedules so you ll know who will be around for meals practical solution variety scientists tell us that a vast diversity of plant and animal life from microbes in the soil to large predators such as bears and wolves is essential for maintaining a balanced and healthy ecosystem monoculture the practice of growing single species with identical genes in the same field is responsible for much of the uniform produce available to us year round in supermarkets while these methods have the advantages of yielding huge volumes cheaply and consistently they also destroy that biological diversity needed for long term sustenance we ve lost a lot of our biodiversity in our food supply and narrowed in on a few varieties of fruits and vegetables that we like and know and keep going back to neff said a farmers market is a great place to sample and try

to build for a warming planet architects look to nature and the past collapse fifteen years ago kyle isacksen and his wife katy chandler lived in what most people in their home city of reno nevada would think of as a normal house it was 1 200 square feet of drywall and two by fours in a neighborhood of skinny trees and other young families driving back and forth to work it felt to the two of them like a completely ridiculous arrangement their lives they sensed lacked a connectedness to the community to the earth to the high desert ecosystem in which they existed they had just had their first child and they couldn t stop thinking that there was a way to live with more integrity at that point a lot of the talk was about carbon footprint mr isacksen recalls but we just knew things felt off we felt we were part of the problem being caught up in our little rat race we started trying to figure out how to live within our values their first move was from that 1200 square foot tract home to a 200 square foot straw bale cabin in a co housing community across town then they went to oregon to apprentice with conrad rogue who was at the forefront of what s known as the natural building movement a shift toward using indigenous building practices and natural materials particularly clay to create homes and other structures what they learned there struck a nerve lindsay appel courtesy

an integrity to building with the earth that exists literally at one s doorstep mr isacksen says clay based structures are also comfortable he says keeping far cooler in hot weather than more modern

among the 10 warmest on record with scientists expecting that trend to continue in response there has been an increased focus by entrepreneurs and policymakers on technological innovations to help

climate change before 1900 most people were natural builders or at least had homes intentionally created for their particular climate zones whether that meant spanish or middle eastern homes with cooling courtyards eastern american houses with shaded porches or adobe brick structures in mexico but technological innovation ushered in an era of both mass construction and standardization and by

we now live in a time where a house in florida is built exactly the same as a house in washington state says mr rogue the creator of the house alive community in oregon and the instructor who taught mr isacksen natural building techniques there s no reason for it except that we have heaters and air conditioners and trainloads of lumber going back and forth to make it possible but i don t think it s serving anyone although estimates vary experts agree that the construction industry is responsible for a hefty amount of the world s greenhouse gas emissions as much as 40 according to the united nations if one includes building operations such as electricity use and the construction process itself from making cement to transporting materials and most projections expect the carbon impact of buildings to grow even further in no small part because more people will need and will be able to buy air conditioning according to the international energy agency global energy demand from air conditioners is expected to triple by 2050 and the global stock of air conditioners will rise from 1 6 billion today to 5 6 billion by 2050 a number that equates to 10 new air conditioners sold every second for the next 30 years part of this is because global economic development means that more people will have the financial capability to purchase cooling devices but it s also because more people

burkina faso wood screens help shade and protect the brick exterior from the hot west african sun last year researchers from the university of st andrews in scotland published a report predicting that climate change will amplify the hottest days in the tropics with the hottest 5 of days warming 20 more than the average day a trend that would mean dangerous heat waves in large swaths of africa asia and the americas last month the first street foundation a nonprofit climate research group based in new york released a report predicting a dramatic increase in the number of days reaching a heat index of 125 degrees in the u s over the next decades i think there s always been this idea that climate change is going to happen to some people somewhere but it s happening to everybody everywhere now says rachel kyte dean of the fletcher school at tufts university in medford massachusetts who has studied the energy implications of increased air conditioning if you re rich you ve got more resources to throw at the problem but you can t self isolate from warming the problem with using air conditioning to combat the growing heat she and others say is that air conditioning itself adds to global warming this is because the chemical refrigerants in most air conditioners are potent greenhouse gases and the units guzzle electricity which is created primarily by burning fossil fuels climate change drives higher temperatures drives higher air conditioning use which drives higher electricity usage says scott hinson chief technology officer at pecan street a nonpartisan energy research group if we provide that energy with coal or dirty fuels that s a pretty vicious cycle lowering urban temperatures brian dean the head of energy efficiency and cooling for the sustainable energy for all nonprofit based in vienna says that more effective insulation controlled ventilation and correct positioning of the house are all architectural elements that can lower the temperature of a home without air conditioning tree placement and shading also can have a huge impact he says before the invention of the air conditioner societies used a lot of nature based solutions he says it is an approach that urban planners are embracing and perhaps maybe nowhere more than in medellín luis bernardo cano parque la isla is a part of the green corridors project in medellín colombia this south american city of 2 5 million set in colombia s mountainous northwest was once known primarily for its drug cartel violence but in 2016 the year that the colombian government signed a cease fire agreement with the rebel guerrilla group farc a politician named federico gutiérrez took the mayor s office of medellín and decided to focus on climate change along with security he and a team of experts created the green corridors program an initiative to expand greenery replace impermeable heat capturing building materials and establish a network of parks bike paths and other shady public spaces connecting neighborhoods across the city alejandro restrepo montoya an architect who served as director of strategic urban projects in medellín at the time says this approach was an explicit effort to restore the topography of the city to focus on rebuilding an integrity with the natural ecosystem rather than trying to construct over around or against it topography needs to be more of a protagonist in urban development and architecture mr restrepo says cities often overlook it making errors like covering rivers to build streets that s not building a city that s disfiguring a city

building with vegetation planted over a waterproofing membrane german and swiss cities began experimenting with green roofs in the 1980s and 90s mostly to save energy and promote biodiversity but several studies showed that green roofs could also help counter the heat island effect the warming of urban ecosystems that both raises temperature for residents and disrupts other natural cycles such as rainfall cities are like heat storing ecosystems says stephan brenneisen an expert on urban ecology at the zurich university of applied sciences now climate change is making it much worse in these urban environments this is of course now the main driver when you see the strategies of cities that want to adapt to climate change green roofs are in the first two or three lines of many city plans the green roof offers improved insulation lower power consumption improved air quality and a boost for biodiversity offering habitats for insects and birds but they are not risk free insurance

to a new outlook on what one actually needs and wants in the climate debate so much is focused on electric cars and the way we produce electricity he says my big worry is that if we do insulate our

to a 200 square foot straw bale cabin in a co housing community across town then they went to oregon to apprentice with conrad rogue who was at the forefront of what s known as the natural building

climate change before 1900 most people were natural builders or at least had homes intentionally created for their particular climate zones whether that meant spanish or middle eastern homes with cooling courtyards eastern american houses with shaded porches or adobe brick structures in mexico but technological innovation ushered in an era of both mass construction and standardization and by the end of the 1900s building design had become globalized a glass and steel office tower looked pretty much the same in abu dhabi as it did in vancouver and new homes across the united states started to look quite similar as well courtesy of house alive a hybrid building made of cob straw bale and conventional building materials is located in jacksonville oregon the climate construction connection we now live in a time where a house in florida is built exactly the same as a house in washington state says mr rogue the creator of the house alive community in oregon and the instructor who taught mr isacksen natural building techniques there s no reason for it except that we have heaters and air conditioners and trainloads of lumber going back and forth to make it possible but i don t think it s serving anyone although estimates vary experts agree that the construction industry is responsible for a hefty amount of the world s greenhouse gas emissions as much as 40 according to the united nations if one includes building operations such as electricity use and the construction process itself from making cement to transporting materials and most projections expect the carbon impact of buildings to grow even further in no small part because more people will need and will be able to buy air conditioning according to the international energy agency global energy demand from air conditioners is expected to triple by 2050 and the global stock of air conditioners will rise from 1 6 billion today to 5 6 billion by 2050 a number that equates to 10 new air conditioners sold every second for the next 30 years part of this is because global economic development means that more people will have the financial capability to purchase cooling devices but it s also because more people want or need air conditioning iwan baan courtesy of kéré architecture the lycée schorge a high school and dental clinic designed by burkinabé architect francis kéré was built in 2016 in koudougou burkina faso wood screens help shade and protect the brick exterior from the hot west african sun last year researchers from the university of st andrews in scotland published a report predicting that climate change will amplify the hottest days in the tropics with the hottest 5 of days warming 20 more than the average day a trend that would mean dangerous heat waves in large swaths of africa asia and the americas last month the first street foundation a nonprofit climate research group based in new york released a report predicting a dramatic increase in the number of days reaching a heat index of 125 degrees in the u s over the next decades i think there s always been this idea that climate change is going to happen to some people somewhere but it s happening to everybody everywhere now says rachel kyte dean of the fletcher school at tufts university in medford massachusetts who has studied the energy implications of increased air conditioning if you re rich you ve got more resources to throw at the problem but you can t self isolate from warming the problem with using air conditioning to combat the growing heat she and others say is that air conditioning itself adds to global warming this is because the chemical refrigerants in most air conditioners are potent greenhouse gases and the units guzzle electricity which is created primarily by burning fossil fuels climate change drives higher temperatures drives higher air conditioning use which drives higher electricity usage says scott hinson chief technology officer at pecan street a nonpartisan energy research group if we provide that energy with coal or dirty fuels that s a pretty vicious cycle lowering urban temperatures brian dean the head of energy efficiency and cooling for the sustainable energy for all nonprofit based in vienna says that more effective insulation controlled ventilation and correct positioning of the house are all architectural elements that can lower the temperature of a home without air conditioning tree placement and shading also can have a huge impact he says before the invention of the air conditioner societies used a lot of nature based solutions he says it is an approach that urban planners are embracing and perhaps maybe nowhere more than in medellín luis bernardo cano parque la isla is a part of the green corridors project in medellín colombia this south american city of 2 5 million set in colombia s mountainous northwest was once known primarily for its drug cartel violence but in 2016 the year that the colombian government signed a cease fire agreement with the rebel guerrilla group farc a politician named federico gutiérrez took the mayor s office of medellín and decided to focus on climate change along with security he and a team of experts created the green corridors program an initiative to expand greenery replace impermeable heat capturing building materials and establish a network of parks bike paths and other shady public spaces connecting neighborhoods across the city alejandro restrepo montoya an architect who served as director of strategic urban projects in medellín at the time says this approach was an explicit effort to restore the topography of the city to focus on rebuilding an integrity with the natural ecosystem rather than trying to construct over around or against it topography needs to be more of a protagonist in urban development and architecture mr restrepo says cities often overlook it making errors like covering rivers to build streets that s not building a city that s disfiguring a city within three years in those parts of medellín where greening projects took place average surface temperatures fell by more than 10 degrees celsius 18 degrees fahrenheit there are so many trees such rich nature says sandra velázquez who runs a small beauty shop overlooking the playground in the parque la isla an oasis of green near the city s bustling center and on top of that the air feels fresh medellín s green corridors have caught the attention of governments across the globe with similar projects being discussed or already in process in guatemala peru bosnia and elsewhere in europe a growing number of builders are taking a similar concept and applying it to individual homes andreas hofstetter courtesy of stephan brenneisen a praying mantis rests on the green roof of the stücki shopping center in basel switzerland the potential of green roofs was discovered early on with the fabled hanging gardens of babylon one of the seven wonders of the world scandinavian countries also used to cover their roofs with sod for insulation the concept is making inroads today in major cities from new york and london to tehran also known as a living roof a green roof covers the top of the building with vegetation planted over a waterproofing membrane german and swiss cities began experimenting with green roofs in the 1980s and 90s mostly to save energy and promote biodiversity but several studies showed that green roofs could also help counter the heat island effect the warming of urban ecosystems that both raises temperature for residents and disrupts other natural cycles such as rainfall cities are like heat storing ecosystems says stephan brenneisen an expert on urban ecology at the zurich university of applied sciences now climate change is making it much worse in these urban environments this is of course now the main driver when you see the strategies of cities that want to adapt to climate change green roofs are in the first two or three lines of many city plans the green roof offers improved insulation lower power consumption improved air quality and a boost for biodiversity offering habitats for insects and birds but they are not risk free insurance companies for one are often worried about the potential for leakage and damage while building owners tend to worry about the maintenance green roofs require but many city planners have decided that the merits outweigh the risks in basel residents contribute 5 of their energy bills toward an ecological fund that helped subsidize the green roofs basel has made green roofs mandatory since 2000 for new buildings with flat roofs and since 2008 for any such building that is retrofitted today nearly half of the city s flat roofed buildings are green and green roofs are part of the building code in most major swiss cities kim gamel ap file the ruins of the fortress of shali in the egyptian oasis of siwa are seen in 2012 bricks made with salt but in some places there just isn t much greenery to help with the cooling and it is these desert environments architects say that perhaps give the most potent lessons for how to keep homes cool in a warming planet near the border with libya and an imposing expanse of desert lies the egyptian oasis siwa residents of siwa have long had to battle a harsh local climate the city s medieval citadel was built on the oasis s highest hill in order to protect the town from attacks from roving arab tribes but while the bandits might be gone the fortress still has to fight the desert heat that s made easier though by the architecture of the citadel and some of the old homes and buildings built nearby they re constructed from slabs of earth cut from the surrounding salt flats not only do the salt bricks provide a natural local building material but they also with the right building design help keep homes naturally cool wael al awar an architect based in dubai says he has been inspired by these salt flats and similar ones found in the united arab emirates he is now exploring methods of cement production that use magnesium oxide salt as a binding agent instead of the typical and carbon dioxide releasing process of breaking down limestone if you look at cement you quickly learn the problem is in the glue the binder says the lebanese born mr awar co founder of the architecture firm waiwai it s converting limestone to lime that really emits a lot of co 2 jacopo salvi courtesy of waiwai architect wael al awar co founder of the dubai based firm waiwai is developing a salt based cement that would cut down on carbon emissions rather than disturb the sabkha or salt flats that make up the united arab emirates wetlands waiwai is harvesting magnesium oxide from the brine left over from the gulf country s plethora of desalination plants while mr awar and his colleagues have only figured out how to use this magnesium oxide salt for single story buildings salt corrodes steel which is typically used for beams and reinforcements in taller load bearing structures they say there are lessons to be learned by this limitation shorter thick walled structures with fewer openings are probably the most suited for the climate they point out fewer windows means less sunlight pouring into a building which makes sense in a region where the sun is 90 blazing mr al awar says and which will also help in reducing your energy consumption wisdom in old buildings but there is more to traditional building he and others point out than simply swapping out concrete and glass for salt or mud or timber or even adding plants to the roof jill gotthelf for instance is a new york architect who tries to bridge the divide between historic preservation and green building two factions of the architectural profession that have long been at odds while she says she recognizes the potential in new technology to mitigate heat she also sees a wisdom to old buildings they have natural attributes for energy and sustainability she says rather than trying to rehab historic structures with an eco tech approach she urges colleagues to pause and instead research how a building fits into its environment and its community how historic masonry for instance worked as a temperature regulator how radiant heat can be maintained but tweaked into a climate efficient system how porches and other outdoor spaces were not only part of one building but often integral to a wider community federico torra for plane site courtesy of the national pavilion uae la biennale di venezia waiwai the display wetland made of salt based cement inspired by the united arab emirates wetlands and salt flats won an award at the venice biennale restoring this integrity of place and design often can end up as climate friendly as a new build with modern technology she says the natural builders take this philosophy a step further it is often countercultural to eschew what is labeled as progress whether that means more modern cement not brick homes in dakar mini mansions in a tony american neighborhood or the latest hyperinsulated green buildings in europe but there is an integrity that comes from reclaiming one s home the literal place one s life unfolds from an ideology that has often worked against the planet these builders say build with mud and all of a sudden the latest and greatest tech seems unnecessary says mr rogue it turns out that what s needed for comfort and satisfaction is inexpensive not controlled by an international supply chain independent from fossil fuels and part of the earth itself and that he says can lead to a new outlook on what one actually needs and wants in the climate debate so much is focused on electric cars and the way we produce electricity he says my big worry is that if we do insulate our houses better and we all have electric cars the next thing is going to be the demand for bigger homes or two electric cars natural building he says is a bridge toward thinking differently about consumption and lifestyle which in turn makes the most climate impact i teach not so much because i hope that everybody will live in a mud hut although that would be nice mr rogue says i hope that in building with earth the lack of speed that we build with the community aspects of it it will have an impact on the human spirit

new york a half century after founding outdoor apparel maker patagonia mr yvon chouinard the eccentric rock climber who became a reluctant billionaire with his unconventional spin on capitalism has given the company away rather than selling the company or taking it public mr chouinard his wife and two adult children have transferred their ownership of patagonia valued at about us 3 billion s 4 22 billion to a specially designed trust and a nonprofit organisation they were created to preserve the company s independence and ensure that all of its profits some us 100 million a year are used to combat climate change and protect undeveloped land around the globe the unusual move comes at a moment of growing scrutiny for billionaires and corporations whose rhetoric about making the world a better place is often overshadowed by their contributions to the very problems they claim to want to solve at the same time mr chouinard s relinquishment of the family fortune is in keeping with his long standing disregard for business norms and his lifelong love for the environment hopefully this will influence a new form of capitalism that doesn t end up with a few rich people and a bunch of poor people mr chouinard 83 said in an exclusive interview we are going to give away the maximum amount of money to people who are actively working on saving this planet patagonia will continue to operate as a private for profit corporation based in ventura california selling more than us 1 billion worth of jackets hats and ski pants each year but the chouinards who controlled patagonia until last month no longer own the company in august the family irrevocably transferred all the company s voting stock equivalent to 2 per cent of the overall shares into a newly established entity known as the patagonia purpose trust the trust which will be overseen by members of the family and their closest advisers is intended to ensure that patagonia makes good on its commitment to run a socially responsible business and give away its profits because the chouinards donated their shares to a trust the family will pay about us 17 5 million in taxes on the gift the chouinards then donated the other 98 per cent of patagonia its common shares to a newly established nonprofit organisation called the holdfast collective which will now be the recipient of all the company s profits and use the funds to combat climate change because the holdfast collective is a 501 c 4 which allows it to make unlimited political contributions the family received no tax benefit for its donation there was a meaningful cost to them doing it but it was cost they were willing to bear to ensure that this company stays true to their principles said mr dan mosley a partner at bdt co a merchant bank that works with ultra wealthy individuals including mr warren buffett and who helped patagonia design the new structure and they didn t get a charitable deduction for it there is no tax benefit here whatsoever that differs from the choice made by mr barre seid a republican donor who recently gave 100 per cent of his electronics manufacturing company to a nonprofit organisation shortly before the company was sold reaping an enormous personal tax windfall and making a us 1 6 billion gift to fund conservative fights over abortion rights climate change and more

patagonia founder yvon chouinard his spouse and two adult children are giving away their ownership in the apparel maker he started some 50 years ago the company s non voting stock worth close to 3 billion will be owned by a collective that will use all profits that aren t reinvested into the business to fight climate change the company expects to contribute about 100 million a year depending on the health of the business patagonia founder yvon chouinard his spouse and two adult children are giving away their ownership in the apparel maker he started some 50 years ago dedicating all profits from the company to projects and organizations that will protect wild land and biodiversity and fight the climate crisis the company is worth about 3 billion according to the new york times get a weekly recap of the latest san francisco bay area housing news sign up for nbc bay area s housing deconstructed newsletter in a letter about the decision published on the patagonia website on wednesday choiunard wrote of reimagining capitalism and said while we re doing our best to address the environmental crisis it s not enough we needed to find a way to put more money into fighting the crisis while keeping the company s values intact one option was to sell patagonia and donate all the money but we couldn t be sure a new owner would maintain our values or keep our team of people around the world employed another path was to take the company public what a disaster that would have been even public companies with good intentions are under too much pressure to create short term gain at the expense of long term vitality and responsibility truth be told there were no good options available so we created our own the privately held company s stock will now be owned by a climate focused trust and group of nonprofit organizations called the patagonia purpose trust and the holdfast collective respectively the company said in a statement noting every dollar that is not reinvested back into patagonia will be distributed as dividends to protect the planet the trust will get all the voting stock which is 2 of the total and will use it to create a more permanent legal structure to enshrine patagonia s purpose and values it will be overseen by members of the family and close advisors the holdfast collective owns all the non voting stock of patagonia which amounts to 98 patagonia expects to generate and donate about 100 million annually depending on the health of the business the company now sells new and used outdoor apparel gear for outdoor activities like camping fishing and climbing and food and beverages made from sustainable sources as a certified b corp and california benefit corporation patagonia was already donating one percent of its sales each year to grassroots activists and it intends to keep doing so fewer than 6 000 companies around the world are certified as b corp businesses they have to meet strict environmental social and governance standards and benchmarks set by b labs to gain certification ryan gellert will continue to serve as patagonia s ceo and the chouinard family will remain on patagonia s board following the apparel maker s expanded philanthropic strategy after informing its employees on wednesday about this move the company updated its website to state that earth is now our only shareholder

to build for a warming planet architects look to nature and the past collapse fifteen years ago kyle isacksen and his wife katy chandler lived in what most people in their home city of reno nevada would think of as a normal house it was 1 200 square feet of drywall and two by fours in a neighborhood of skinny trees and other young families driving back and forth to work it felt to the two of them like a completely ridiculous arrangement their lives they sensed lacked a connectedness to the community to the earth to the high desert ecosystem in which they existed they had just had their first child and they couldn t stop thinking that there was a way to live with more integrity at that point a lot of the talk was about carbon footprint mr isacksen recalls but we just knew things felt off we felt we were part of the problem being caught up in our little rat race we started trying to figure out how to live within our values their first move was from that 1200 square foot tract home to a 200 square foot straw bale cabin in a co housing community across town then they went to oregon to apprentice with conrad rogue who was at the forefront of what s known as the natural building movement a shift toward using indigenous building practices and natural materials particularly clay to create homes and other structures what they learned there struck a nerve lindsay appel courtesy of kyle isacksen an adobe and wood cabin built in 2021 is seen in long valley california courtesy of kyle isacksen adobe blocks are made and set out to dry in long valley california in 2021 there is an integrity to building with the earth that exists literally at one s doorstep mr isacksen says clay based structures are also comfortable he says keeping far cooler in hot weather than more modern buildings and using a fraction of the energy and while indigenous communities have used earthen techniques for centuries the heat adjusting properties of adobe and other sorts of mud brick buildings have taken on new importance with climate change this summer heat waves swept across the northern hemisphere bringing record temperatures from texas to england to pakistan the years 2013 to 2021 rank among the 10 warmest on record with scientists expecting that trend to continue in response there has been an increased focus by entrepreneurs and policymakers on technological innovations to help humans stay cool everything from higher efficiency air conditioning to superwhite reflective paint to nanoparticle window films but a growing number of architects builders and homeowners from northern africa to northern europe are focusing on a different approach a return to bygone building practices that were highly attuned to place and kept spaces cool before air conditioning buildings with integrity of place buildings started changing at the beginning of the last century because of cheap electricity and cheap heating and cheap cooling says iain campbell senior fellow at rmi an energy research organization before then people would design buildings based upon climate so if you went to say a building in the middle east it would not look like a building that is in downtown toronto i understand why people are going back and saying that we need to use these natural materials it s the philosophy that we should be designing buildings for the climate zones they are sitting in the movement is global in basel switzerland builders are increasingly installing green roofs of earth and plants a throwback to old scandinavian sod homes in medellín colombia policymakers have restored natural topography and greenery to their city lowering the overall temperature dramatically and in dakar senegal prizewinning burkinabé architect francis kéré is designing with indigenous bricks a

stone bricks in koudougou burkina faso the bricks keep building interiors cooler than concrete the key word is localized localized with the country with the climate with local materials says nicolas rondet the french architect who co founded worofila a dakar based architectural firm that collaborates with mr kéré and is behind many other new earthen brick structures in senegal the goal here is not just eco friendly buildings many involved in traditional building say while they certainly want homes to be climate resilient and resource gentle even more so they hope to develop a larger integrity of place one that shifts the understanding of home of community and of individuals role in an ecosystem mr isacksen and ms chandler for their part now offer natural building workshops back in reno it is one part of their be the change reno nonprofit a sustainable homestead that also involves growing food fostering community connections eschewing fossil fuels and creating affordable housing if we re trying to have a paradigm shift he says we need to be building our structures and our homes differently the need for this paradigm shift he and others believe is directly connected to climate change before 1900 most people were natural builders or at least had homes intentionally created for their particular climate zones whether that meant spanish or middle eastern homes with cooling courtyards eastern american houses with shaded porches or adobe brick structures in mexico but technological innovation ushered in an era of both mass construction and standardization and by the end of the 1900s building design had become globalized a glass and steel office tower looked pretty much the same in abu dhabi as it did in vancouver and new homes across the united states started to look quite similar as well courtesy of house alive a hybrid building made of cob straw bale and conventional building materials is located in jacksonville oregon the climate construction connection we now live in a time where a house in florida is built exactly the same as a house in washington state says mr rogue the creator of the house alive community in oregon and the instructor who taught mr isacksen natural building techniques there s no reason for it except that we have heaters and air conditioners and trainloads of lumber going back and forth to make it possible but i don t think it s serving anyone although estimates vary experts agree that the construction industry is responsible for a hefty amount of the world s greenhouse gas emissions as much as 40 according to the united nations if one includes building operations such as electricity use and the construction process itself from making cement to transporting materials and most projections expect the carbon impact of buildings to grow even further in no small part because more people will need and will be able to buy air conditioning according to the international energy agency global energy demand from air conditioners is expected to triple by 2050 and the global stock of air conditioners will rise from 1 6 billion today to 5 6 billion by 2050 a number that equates to 10 new air conditioners sold every second for the next 30 years part of this is because global economic development means that more people will have the financial capability to purchase cooling devices but it s also because more people want or need air conditioning iwan baan courtesy of kéré architecture the lycée schorge a high school and dental clinic designed by burkinabé architect francis kéré was built in 2016 in koudougou burkina faso wood screens help shade and protect the brick exterior from the hot west african sun last year researchers from the university of st andrews in scotland published a report predicting that climate change will amplify the hottest days in the tropics with the hottest 5 of days warming 20 more than the average day a trend that would mean dangerous heat waves in large swaths of africa asia and the americas last month the first street foundation a nonprofit climate research group based in new york released a report predicting a dramatic increase in the number of days reaching a heat index of 125 degrees in the u s over the next decades i think there s always been this idea that climate change is going to happen to some people somewhere but it s happening to everybody everywhere now says rachel kyte dean of the fletcher school at tufts university in medford massachusetts who has studied the energy implications of increased air conditioning if you re rich you ve got more resources to throw at the problem but you can t self isolate from warming the problem with using air conditioning to combat the growing heat she and others say is that air conditioning itself adds to global warming this is because the chemical refrigerants in most air conditioners are potent greenhouse gases and the units guzzle electricity which is created primarily by burning fossil fuels climate change drives higher temperatures drives higher air conditioning use which drives higher electricity usage says scott hinson chief technology officer at pecan street a nonpartisan energy research group if we provide that energy with coal or dirty fuels that s a pretty vicious cycle lowering urban temperatures brian dean the head of energy efficiency and cooling for the sustainable energy for all nonprofit based in vienna says that more effective insulation controlled ventilation and correct positioning of the house are all architectural elements that can lower the temperature of a home without air conditioning tree placement and shading also can have a huge impact he says before the invention of the air conditioner societies used a lot of nature based solutions he says it is an approach that urban planners are embracing and perhaps maybe nowhere more than in medellín luis bernardo cano parque la isla is a part of the green corridors project in medellín colombia this south american city of 2 5 million set in colombia s mountainous northwest was once known primarily for its drug cartel violence but in 2016 the year that the colombian government signed a cease fire agreement with the rebel guerrilla group farc a politician named federico gutiérrez took the mayor s office of medellín and decided to focus on climate change along with security he and a team of experts created the green corridors program an initiative to expand greenery replace impermeable heat capturing building materials and establish a network of parks bike paths and other shady public spaces connecting neighborhoods across the city alejandro restrepo montoya an architect who served as director of strategic urban projects in medellín at the time says this approach was an explicit effort to restore the topography of the city to focus on rebuilding an integrity with the natural ecosystem rather than trying to construct over around or against it topography needs to be more of a protagonist in urban development and architecture mr restrepo says cities often overlook it making errors like covering rivers to build streets that s not building a city that s disfiguring a city within three years in those parts of medellín where greening projects took place average surface temperatures fell by more than 10 degrees celsius 18 degrees fahrenheit there are so many trees such rich nature says sandra velázquez who runs a small beauty shop overlooking the playground in the parque la isla an oasis of green near the city s bustling center and on top of that the air feels fresh medellín s green corridors have caught the attention of governments across the globe with similar projects being discussed or already in process in guatemala peru bosnia and elsewhere in europe a growing number of builders are taking a similar concept and applying it to individual homes andreas hofstetter courtesy of stephan brenneisen a praying mantis rests on the green roof of the stücki shopping center in basel switzerland the potential of green roofs was discovered early on with the fabled hanging gardens of babylon one of the seven wonders of the world scandinavian countries also used to cover their roofs with sod for insulation the concept is making inroads today in major cities from new york and london to tehran also known as a living roof a green roof covers the top of the building with vegetation planted over a waterproofing membrane german and swiss cities began experimenting with green roofs in the 1980s and 90s mostly to save energy and promote biodiversity but several studies showed that green roofs could also help counter the heat island effect the warming of urban ecosystems that both raises temperature for residents and disrupts other natural cycles such as rainfall cities are like heat storing ecosystems says stephan brenneisen an expert on urban ecology at the zurich university of applied sciences now climate change is making it much worse in these urban environments this is of course now the main driver when you see the strategies of cities that want to adapt to climate change green roofs are in the first two or three lines of many city plans the green roof offers improved insulation lower power consumption improved air quality and a boost for biodiversity offering habitats for insects and birds but they are not risk free insurance companies for one are often worried about the potential for leakage and damage while building owners tend to worry about the maintenance green roofs require but many city planners have decided that the merits outweigh the risks in basel residents contribute 5 of their energy bills toward an ecological fund that helped subsidize the green roofs basel has made green roofs mandatory since 2000 for new buildings with flat roofs and since 2008 for any such building that is retrofitted today nearly half of the city s flat roofed buildings are green and green roofs are part of the building code in most major swiss cities kim gamel ap file the ruins of the fortress of shali in the egyptian oasis of siwa are seen in 2012 bricks made with salt but in some places there just isn t much greenery to help with the cooling and it is these desert environments architects say that perhaps give the most potent lessons for how to keep homes cool in a warming planet near the border with libya and an imposing expanse of desert lies the egyptian oasis siwa residents of siwa have long had to battle a harsh local climate the city s medieval citadel was built on the oasis s highest hill in order to protect the town from attacks from roving arab tribes but while the bandits might be gone the fortress still has to fight the desert heat that s made easier though by the architecture of the citadel and some of the old homes and buildings built nearby they re constructed from slabs of earth cut from the surrounding salt flats not only do the salt bricks provide a natural local building material but they also with the right building design help keep homes naturally cool wael al awar an architect based in dubai says he has been inspired by these salt flats and similar ones found in the united arab emirates he is now exploring methods of cement production that use magnesium oxide salt as a binding agent instead of the typical and carbon dioxide releasing process of breaking down limestone if you look at cement you quickly learn the problem is in the glue the binder says the lebanese born mr awar co founder of the architecture firm waiwai it s converting limestone to lime that really emits a lot of co 2 jacopo salvi courtesy of waiwai architect wael al awar co founder of the dubai based firm waiwai is developing a salt based cement that would cut down on carbon emissions rather than disturb the sabkha or salt flats that make up the united arab emirates wetlands waiwai is harvesting magnesium oxide from the brine left over from the gulf country s plethora of desalination plants while mr awar and his colleagues have only figured out how to use this magnesium oxide salt for single story buildings salt corrodes steel which is typically used for beams and reinforcements in taller load bearing structures they say there are lessons to be learned by this limitation shorter thick walled structures with fewer openings are probably the most suited for the climate they point out fewer windows means less sunlight pouring into a building which makes sense in a region where the sun is 90 blazing mr al awar says and which will also help in reducing your energy consumption wisdom in old buildings but there is more to traditional building he and others point out than simply swapping out concrete and glass for salt or mud or timber or even adding plants to the roof jill gotthelf for instance is a new york architect who tries to bridge the divide between historic preservation and green building two factions of the architectural profession that have long been at odds while she says she recognizes the potential in new technology to mitigate heat she also sees a wisdom to old buildings they have natural attributes for energy and sustainability she says rather than trying to rehab historic structures with an eco tech approach she urges colleagues to pause and instead research how a building fits into its environment and its community how historic masonry for instance worked as a temperature regulator how radiant heat can be maintained but tweaked into a climate efficient system how porches and other outdoor spaces were not only part of one building but often integral to a wider community federico torra for plane site courtesy of the national pavilion uae la biennale di venezia waiwai the display wetland made of salt based cement inspired by the united arab emirates wetlands and salt flats won an award at the venice biennale restoring this integrity of place and design often can end up as climate friendly as a new build with modern technology she says the natural builders take this philosophy a step further it is often countercultural to eschew what is labeled as progress whether that means more modern cement not brick homes in dakar mini mansions in a tony american neighborhood or the latest hyperinsulated green buildings in europe but there is an integrity that comes from reclaiming one s home the literal place one s life unfolds from an ideology that has often worked against the planet these builders say build with mud and all of a sudden the latest and greatest tech seems unnecessary says mr rogue it turns out that what s needed for comfort and satisfaction is inexpensive not controlled by an international supply chain independent from fossil fuels and part of the earth itself and that he says can lead to a new outlook on what one actually needs and wants in the climate debate so much is focused on electric cars and the way we produce electricity he says my big worry is that if we do insulate our houses better and we all have electric cars the next thing is going to be the demand for bigger homes or two electric cars natural building he says is a bridge toward thinking differently about consumption and lifestyle which in turn makes the most climate impact i teach not so much because i hope that everybody will live in a mud hut although that would be nice mr rogue says i hope that in building with earth the lack of speed that we build with the community aspects of it it will have an impact on the human spirit

plants while mr awar and his colleagues have only figured out how to use this magnesium oxide salt for single story buildings salt corrodes steel which is typically used for beams and reinforcements in taller load bearing structures they say there are lessons to be learned by this limitation shorter thick walled structures with fewer openings are probably the most suited for the climate they point out fewer windows means less sunlight pouring into a building which makes sense in a region where the sun is 90 blazing mr al awar says and which will also help in reducing your energy consumption wisdom in old buildings but there is more to traditional building he and others point out than simply swapping out concrete and glass for salt or mud or timber or even adding plants to the roof jill gotthelf for instance is a new york architect who tries to bridge the divide between historic preservation and green building two factions of the architectural profession that have long been at odds while she says she recognizes the potential in new technology to mitigate heat she also sees a wisdom to old buildings they have natural attributes for energy and sustainability she says rather than trying to rehab historic structures with an eco tech approach she urges colleagues to pause and instead research how a building fits into its environment and its community how historic masonry for instance worked as a temperature regulator how radiant heat can be maintained but tweaked into a climate efficient system how porches and other outdoor spaces were not only part of one building but often integral to a wider community federico torra for plane site courtesy of the national pavilion uae la biennale di venezia waiwai the display wetland made of salt based cement inspired by the united arab emirates wetlands and salt flats won an award at the venice biennale restoring this integrity of place and design often can end up as climate friendly as a new build with modern technology she says the natural builders take this philosophy a step further it is often countercultural to eschew what is labeled as progress whether that means more modern cement not brick homes in dakar mini mansions in a tony american neighborhood or the latest hyperinsulated green buildings in europe but there is an integrity that comes from reclaiming one s home the literal place one s life unfolds from an ideology that has often worked against the planet these builders say build with mud and all of a sudden the latest and greatest tech seems unnecessary says mr rogue it turns out that what s needed for comfort and satisfaction is inexpensive not controlled by an international supply chain independent from fossil fuels and part of the earth itself and that he says can lead to a new outlook on what one actually needs and wants in the climate debate so much is focused on electric cars and the way we produce electricity he says my big worry is that if we do insulate our houses better and we all have electric cars the next thing is going to be the demand for bigger homes or two electric cars natural building he says is a bridge toward thinking differently about consumption and lifestyle which in turn makes the most climate impact i teach not so much because i hope that everybody will live in a mud hut although that would be nice mr rogue says i hope that in building with earth the lack of speed that we build with the community aspects of it it will have an impact on the human spirit

washington d c according to department of energy data released this week u s emergency crude oil stocks dropped by 8 4 million barrels last week to 434 1 million barrels the lowest level since october 1984 in the week ending 9th september some 6 3 million barrels of sweet crude and 2 million barrels of sour crude were released from the strategic petroleum reserve which was the steepest draw since may to tackle rising fuel prices which contributed to surging inflation in march president joe biden announced a plan to release 1 million barrels per day from the strategic petroleum reserve over six months in an interview with reuters last week energy secretary jennifer granholm said the biden administration is considering further strategic petroleum reserve releases after the current program ends in october meanwhile research analyst paul sankey said if benchmark oil futures continue to drop the biden administration is less likely to release barrels from the strategic petroleum reserve after october due to sales following congressional mandates and biden s price initiative us stocks also declined the biden administration said it believes the plan to begin after october would help boost domestic oil production the oil is sold to qualified oil companies through online auctions and prices set using a five day average bracketing the delivery date
vcs look the other way as they give 205m more to verkada whose tech has been abused repeatedly verkada a six year old maker of building security tools it sells video security cameras door based access control environmental sensors and alarms all connected on a cloud based platform just raised 205 million in series d funding at what it says is a 3 2 billion valuation altogether verkada has raised 360 million in funding it says on the one hand it s easy to appreciate what attracted investors like linse capital to verkada s newest round which also included michael dell s msd partners sequoia capital next47 meritech capital and felicis ventures surveillance is a lucrative industry and based on what verkada says since its previous funding round in 2020 it has quadrupled its headcount adding more than 1 000 new employees it has opened six new offices and it has quadrupled its customer count to more than 13 000 among the wide range of customers listed at its website is virgin hyperloop the hartford police department and san rafael city schools in california but boy did investors have to look away from a lot of alleged terribleness in order to keep funding the company with the same management team in place indeed numerous reports in recent years that have become surprisingly hard to find online might easily have driven investors in the opposite direction in march 2021 for example bloomberg reported that more than 100 employees at verkada could peer through the cameras of its thousands of customers including schools and police departments as well as global corporations like the internet services company cloudflare according to the report security inside the security company was so lax that verkada was breached by hackers who gained access to an account that allowed them to see all of the live feeds and archived videos of verkada s customers at the time that included 150 000 cameras including inside tesla police departments and hospitals a related finding by bloomberg based on interviews with then current and former employees was that although verkada offered a privacy mode to customers certain accounts would allow verkada employees to turn off that feature and see the camera footage tesla s china branch later told reuters that the breach only affected one of its supplier s production facilities in the henan province west of shanghai further a swiss computer hacker named tillie kottmann was quickly indicted by the u s government on multiple accounts of wire fraud conspiracy and identity theft tied in part to the verkada hack still some damage was done worse for verkada bloomberg weeks later reported that according to then current and former employees the inattention to data protection was emblematic of a larger bro culture that was sophomoric and sales obsessed and which tolerated the harassment of women frequent partying and misleading marketing claims glassdoor reviews of the company of which many were posted this summer paint a similar picture while there are plenty of exceedingly positive employee comments a rare startup that has hit the perfect growth culture curve where there really aren t cons that come to mind others warn potential hires to stay away completely toxic environment made complete with sales leadership who prioritize all of the wrong behaviors reads one review meanwhile both stories pale in comparison to an earlier incident that was first reported by ipvm a security and surveillance industry research group and verified later by vice what happened in 2019 a sales director at verkada s offices in downtown san mateo california used the company s own security cameras inside the building to take and post photos of female colleagues in a slack channel called rawverkadawgz where per vice they made sexually explicit jokes about those colleagues who worked at the company reportedly in one instance a picture of a female employee with her mouth wide open was captured and commented on in the channel which included the sales director and at least several other employees in sales that kind of toxic environment was not only allowed but encouraged numerous employees suggested to vice at the time the article was written either way verkada s staffers and investors had reason to question management s judgment per vice after the slack channel was reported to the company s hr team verkada s ceo filip kaliszan announced in a company all hands meeting that an undisclosed number of employees active in that slack channel were given the choice between leaving the company or having their share of stock reduced they were not fired a seemingly obvious move until vice reported on the matter further action does not seem to have been taken at least kaliszan who co founded the company with two of his fellow computer science graduates from stanford james ren and benjamin bercovitz remains at the helm verkada has been adding to its senior ranks in the interim in april it brought aboard bill berry who is no stranger to dysfunction as its general counsel berry who has been practicing law for more than 20 years stepped down late last year as vice president of legal at tesla
