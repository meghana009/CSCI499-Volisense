need for rates to head higher and remain restrictive in order to bring inflation to heel rodrigo catril a strategist at national australia bank wrote in tuesday note the u s dollar could strengthen further uob says the u s dollar and bond yields are poised to rise further as interest rates rise said anthony raza head of multi asset strategy at uob asset management we think there s still a lot of upward opportunity in the dxy he told cnbc s squawk box asia referring to the dollar index and we think that bond yields generally will be having some sort of gravity upwards as i think the market really gets locked into a fed funds rate path that is going to be upward the u s dollar has strengthened against a basket of six peers this year and last traded at 108 515 that will increase pressure on other countries but the economy and markets appear to have adjusted to a strong greenback and higher yields we re not necessarily overly bearish about it raza said abigail ng china s stimulus measures encouraging despite weak consumer confidence jpmorgan recent stimulus measures introduced by the chinese government are a good sign but consumer confidence remains weak said marcella chow a global market strategist at jpmorgan asset management we are encouraged by recent stimulus measures she said adding that she will pay attention to purchasing managers index readings due this week and whether additional measures are passed at its next parliamentary session what we are looking for is consumer confidence and also consumer conviction as well as investor conviction back into the market she told cnbc s street signs asia chow also said she remains constructive on china in the long term because valuations are low and structural themes remain strong in the long run abigail ng the u s

pointing to the recent spike in virus cases in the nation that would result in the stalling of the improvement in the labor market and today s stagnation in the in the unemployment rates is consistent with that he said abigail ng cnbc pro strategist reveals why this faang stock is a safe bet heading into september a seasonally weak period for equities is just around the corner and that could mean

sank 9 5 friday in more than 8x their 90 day average volume the selloff was in response to an indiana bankruptcy court denying aearo technologies request for an injunction to the legal action against 3m in relation to aearo s combat arms earplugs the 3m subsidiary is the subject of more than 200 000 lawsuits that claim the faulty battlefield earplugs caused hearing loss for u s soldiers the move was designed to halt the claims on the grounds that aearo technologies is insolvent and encourage the accusers to engage in settlement discussions an unfavorable decision now has 3m on the path to a jury trial that according to bloomberg could force the company to pay over 100 billion in damages although 3m said it plans to appeal the bankruptcy court decision the market sees little chance of

toronto rbc s climate policies have been deemed mild enough to pass a texas test on whether banks are boycotting oil and gas companies state comptroller glenn hegar last week named 10 financial institutions including blackrock inc credit suisse group ag and ubs group ag that it deems to be boycotting fossil fuels which under a law passed last year means they are barred from participating in the state s sizable bond market the environmental social and corporate governance esg movement has produced an opaque and perverse system in which some financial companies no longer make decisions in the best interest of their shareholders or their clients but instead use their financial clout to push a social and political agenda shrouded in secrecy said hegar in a statement he said that while the state s investigation focused on boycotts rather than the wider movement it found a systemic lack of transparency especially the use of doublespeak by some financial institutions as they engage in anti oil and gas rhetoric publicly yet present a much different story behind closed doors the state s definition of boycotting energy companies includes any action without ordinary business purpose taken to limit a bank s commercial relations with an oil and gas company because it does not go beyond minimum environmental requirements rbc was one of 19 financial institutions that texas flagged for further investigation in part because of the bank s commitment to net zero lending by 2050 such commitments could lead banks to have to make tough decisions about what companies they lend to based on their environmental performance while the state said it also factored in wider esg ratings when trying to narrow down the list in a written response to the state s inquiry rbc said it greatly values its relationship with texas and asserts it does not boycott energy firms rbc provides a wide range of financial services including financing underwriting and advisory services to many companies in the oil and gas industry including those located in texas the bank notes it has a credit risk exposure to the oil and gas sector of about 25 billion rbc engages in billions of dollars of financial activity with energy companies and counts many energy companies among its clients indeed the bank s substantial funding of fossil fuel projects has been criticized by environmental groups that have pushed canadian banks to limit their funding to the sector we ve seen no evidence that rbc is curtailing its massive fossil fuel financing or even setting credible climate targets so it s not surprising they didn t end up on the texas list inaccurate though it may be said matt price director of corporate engagement at investors for paris compliance a july report on bank climate action by the transition pathway initiative found that rbc lagged banks like ubs and credit suisse on its decarbonization strategy while also highlighting how most banks are still falling short on setting targets rbc said in its letter to texas that along with funding fossil fuel companies it is at the same time committed to addressing climate change it cites as examples its net zero commitments including setting interim financed emission reduction targets by 2023 and its 500 million sustainable financing target it also says that in the ordinary course of business it may decline to provide financial services that expose it to undue risk noting its limits on greenfield coal fired power plants and funding oil and gas exploration in the arctic national wildlife refuge the texas energy boycott law along with a similar one targeting banks that boycott gun manufacturers and associations pushed several major u s banks including citigroup goldman sachs bank of america and jpmorgan chase out of the market last year according to a research paper by university of pennsylvania professor daniel garrett published in june his paper written with ivan ivanov a principal economist at the u s federal reserve board found that the texas laws would mean citizens of the state would likely have to pay between about 300 million and 500 million in added interest costs because of the reduced competition in the state the paper also noted that td securities had submitted a letter last year attesting that it too was in compliance with the energy and gun laws but withdrew the letter in march to potentially signal it was withdrawing from the market td did not respond to a request for clarification while the withdrawal by several banks from the market might not be great for texas taxpayers it has likely benefited rbc according to bloomberg the bank was able to jump up last year to become the no 1 bond issuer in the state this report by the canadian press was first published aug 29 2022 companies in this story tsx rbc

us steel corp upgraded to bb from b on debt reduction and liquidity preservation amid strategic spending s p global ratings united states steel corporation nyse x u s steel has had record trailing

greenfield steel mini mill and other strategic projects at the same time we affirmed our bb issue level rating on u s steel s unsecured debt and revised the associated recovery ratings to 3 from 2 we also raised the issue level rating on big river steel s secured debt to bb from b and affirmed the associated recovery ratings at 3 the stable outlook reflects our expectation of ample liquidity to

today took the rating actions listed above strong market conditions have persisted through first half 2022 positioning the company for another year of low leverage u s steel generated about 1 4 billion of s p global ratings adjusted ebitda in the second quarter of 2022 about a 50 increase from the same quarter in 2021 this gain was spurred by continued solid demand in key markets and by persistently elevated hot rolled coil hrc prices however we expect a moderation in earnings for the second half of the year assuming prices trend down toward 1 000 per metric ton mt from highs in the 1 500 plus area we assume prices will further moderate in 2023 and 2024 trending down toward 700 900 mt however this is still higher than historical averages of about 600 mt as a result we project earnings will temper in the second half of the year after the company generated about 2 6 billion of s p global ratings adjusted ebitda in the first half of 2022 we project full year 2022 ebitda in the range of 4 billion to 5 billion this compares with s p global ratings 2021 adjusted ebitda of about 4 8 billion as a result we project s p global ratings adjusted leverage could remain below 1x for the second year in a row united states steel s strategic capex the company took steps to shore up its balance sheet when it repaid approximately 1 billion of absolute debt during 2021 and ended the year with a pension surplus the company also continues to provide shareholder returns as it repurchased approximately 400 million of shares in second quarter 2022 this completed its 800 million share repurchase program in less than a year while at the same time announcing an additional 500 million program nevertheless we expect that the company would curtail purchases to preserve the momentum on its strategic capex if necessary u s steel is bolstering liquidity as it undertakes its largest capital project ever the company selected the osceola ark site for its announced 3 billion 3 million ton mini mill 2 project u s steel projects the new mill could provide an additional 650 million of ebitda once the mill is fully operational by 2026 while we expect free cash flow will remain meaningfully positive in 2022 amidst record earnings we project a dramatic drop in 2023 if earnings moderate in a lower pricing environment still the company will aim to deliver on its publicly stated goal to maintain cash balances of at least 12 months expected capex or greater than 1 5 billion as of june 30 2022 the company had cash balances of about 3 billion which was well within their target the construction of a new mini mill similar to the big river acquisition should help u s steel with its target to reduce its global greenhouse gas ghg intensity by 20 by 2030 highlighted by its strategic repositioning to electric arc furnaces eafs from high carbon emitting coal fired blast furnaces it also further solidifies our belief that big river is a core asset for u s steel and a strategic part of the company s future success as a result we removed the icr on big river steel as its credit profile except for recovery is now incorporated fully within u s steel our stable outlook on u s steel reflects our expectation of ample liquidity and continued strong cash flow to support the ongoing construction of its mini mill over the next two years even if steel market conditions moderate we project the company s extraordinary cash flow amid a period of record steel prices could yield debt leverage s p global ratings adjusted below 1x in 2022 even if steel prices moderate sharply toward 1 000 by year end 2022 we will closely monitor construction as on time on budget completion is especially meaningful for a company with a history of unsteady cash flow the company has put in place targets to ensure proper funding and liquidity such as maintaining cash balances of greater than next 12 months capex we could lower our rating on u s steel if we expect its leverage will increase towards 4x we believe this could occur if there was an accelerated deterioration in cash flows which severely diminished the company s liquidity buffer for its strategic capital projects we could also lower our ratings if the company experienced significant cost overruns associated with its strategic capex which could be funded with additional debt we view an upgrade in the next 12 months as unlikely considering the company s risks in capex and earnings amidst a strategic transformation that said we could raise the ratings if u s steel were to continue executing on business priorities and capital investments while maintaining solid credit ratios which could include debt reduction namely we would continue to expect debt to ebitda of about 2x or better amid the current pricing environment and less than 3x in a more normalized pricing environment with good indications of double digit margins and returns for several years confirming a stronger competitive position from strategically important investments esg credit indicators e 4 s 2 g 2 environmental factors are a negative consideration in our credit rating analysis of u s steel the company s competitive position has degraded over the past decade while more cost competitive and lower ghg competition has taken market shares for the most commoditized steel products in north america more recently the company has rapidly transitioned its production footprint to include more eafs while closing inefficient and higher emitting blast furnaces on the way to its target of reducing its ghg intensity by 20 by 2030 u s steel acquired big river and its eaf assets in 2021 for the 12 months ended june 30 2022 big river accounted for approximately 22 of the company s reported ebitda and we expect the percentage from eafs will continue to increase namely with the announced 3 billion mini mill project at u s steel which the company expects will add about 3 million metric tons of capacity still the company continues to mine iron ore in the u s with the attendant land use considerations for mining u s steel has reduced its employee related injuries by almost 90 in the past 10 years by improving its safety training and procedures in an industry that operates large machinery

north american markets edge lower as investors account for hawkish u s fed original publication date august 29 2022 8 36 am north american stock markets were down slightly monday as investors continued to adjust to the idea that inflation as well as the efforts by central banks to curb it is not going to go away anytime soon i think the old adage don t fight the fed is back in play said mona mahajan investment strategist at edward jones i think markets are facing at least four more rate hikes and that puts a little bit of pressure especially on the growth and higher valuation parts of the market the s p tsx composite index was down 37 17 points at 19 836 12 in new york the dow jones industrial average was down 184 41 points at 32 098 99 the s p 500 index was down 27 05 points at 4 030 61 while the nasdaq composite was down 124 04 points at 12 017 67 still markets were far calmer monday than they had been the previous friday when a surprisingly hawkish speech by u s federal reserve chair jerome powell sent markets tumbling investors had hoped powell would use his remarks friday at an annual economic summit in jackson hole wyo to signal the fed s willingness to begin easing its interest rate hiking cycle perhaps even reversing some of its already instituted hikes as early as 2023 the fed s last two hikes have been by three quarters of a percentage point instead powell made it clear that interest rates will need to continue to rise and will stay high for longer than many investors had hoped what was interesting on friday in terms of market reaction was that we saw markets not only price in potentially a 75 basis point hike in september but they also priced out the possibility of a fed rate cut in mid 2023 mahajan said that s significant she added because the six week rally in equities markets that occurred in july and august was due in large part to a prevailing sentiment that the u s central bank could begin cutting rates as early as next year i think jerome powell s message on friday was clear we are nowhere near a fed pivot mahajan said bond yields continued to move up monday and the yield curve remains inverted an economic warning sign of possible recession ahead mahajan pointed out september and october are typically volatile months for stock markets anyway she added another factor that points to rocky times ahead still mahajan said she doesn t believe markets are heading back to the bear market lows of june when recessionary fears were rampant inflation data from both canada and the u s for the month of july indicated that inflation while still high is beginning to ease off if those numbers continue to move in the right direction mahajan said markets should be able to look forward to at least a pause in the rate hike cycle by the end of 2022 the price of gold which investors typically purchase as a hedge against inflation dropped monday another indication that markets believe peak inflation has already happened the near term is challenging but perhaps as we head towards year end there s light at the end of the tunnel she said on the tsx the best performing sector monday was the energy sector which rode an increase in crude oil prices to gain 1 70 per cent on the day hardest hit was the capped materials index which was down 1 33 per cent the materials sector is home to canada s mining sector including gold stocks like centerra gold inc and barrick gold corp which were dragged down 1 70 per cent and 1 04 per cent respectively as gold futures fell the canadian dollar traded for 76 87 cents us compared with 76 99 cents us on friday the october crude contract was up us 3 95 at us 97 01 per barrel and the october natural gas contract was up seven cents at us 9 34 per mmbtu the december gold contract was down ten cents at us 1 749 70 an ounce and the december copper contract was down nine cents at us 3 61 a pound this report by the canadian press was first published aug 29 2022 companies in this story tsx gsptse tsx cadusd x

the factor xia inhibitor asundexian envisioned as a safer alternative to current oral anticoagulants didn t cause excess bleeding when given with antiplatelets in a pair of large phase 2 dose ranging trials in different secondary prevention settings asundexian displayed nuanced potential for prevention of recurrent ischemic events in a subset of patients with recent noncardioembolic stroke in one of the studies pacific stroke with about 1800 patients its use didn t up the risk of bleeding of any type despite almost totally suppressing factor xia at one of the tested dosages even when given on top of dual antiplatelet therapy dapt after percutaneous coronary intervention pci for acute myocardial infarction mi in the 1600 patient pacific ami trial in that study those who took asundexian at the highest dosage of 50 mg daily showed a more than 90 drop from baseline in factor xia activity after 4 weeks of treatment they experienced no more bleeds than patients given placebo at that or lower tested dosages and their risk for ischemic events cardiovascular cv death mi stroke or stent thrombosis was reduced over a median follow up of about 1 year reported john h alexander md mhs duke clinical research institute durham north carolina august 28 at the european society of cardiology esc congress 2022 held in barcelona spain pacific ami was published in circulation with lead author sunil v rao md also from duke clinical research institute to coincide with alexander s presentation both phase 2 studies are by definition exploratory and vastly underpowered for clinical outcomes they are useful mainly for guidance on whether a drug in development should be pursued further there seems to be consistent agreement that given asundexian s performance in the phase 2 trials along with its mass of preclinical data the drug should advance to more statistically powerful potentially more decisive phase 3 trials in pacific stroke also presented that morning at the esc congress patients with recent acute noncardioembolic stroke given asundexian at any of several dosages or placebo showed no significant reduction in risk for the primary endpoint of ischemic stroke or covert brain infarction at 6 months the neutral finding apparently stemmed from the second endpoint component silent strokes revealed on mri for which there was absolutely no effect said ashkan shoamanesh md mcmaster university hamilton ontario canada during a press conference on the pair of phase 2 trials a pacific stroke post hoc analysis showed a sharp dose dependent decline in the exploratory endpoint of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack tia shoamanesh noted it was a significant 36 risk reduction with the 50 milligram dose that appeared to favor the prespecified subgroup of patients with disease in large arteries such as the aorta or carotids indeed patients with any degree of extracranial or intracranial atherosclerotic disease on vascular imaging showed a robust 61 relative risk reduction for the ischemic stroke tia outcome the upshot shoamanesh said is that in patients with noncardioembolic stroke the addition of a factor xia inhibitor on top of background antiplatelet treatment seems to be targeting those with atherosclerotic disease contributing to their stroke the working hypothesis asundexian s apparent benefit for ischemic events in pacific stroke patients with large artery atherosclerosis might be at first glance somewhat at odds with the neutral clinical outcome in pacific ami but the researchers attributed that to differences between the two patient cohorts as well as to background therapies the addition of a factor xia inhibitor to antiplatelets shoamanesh told theheart org medscape cardiology might more effectively prevent ischemic events related to large artery atherosclerosis than coronaries involved in an acute mi large artery plaque rupture is more likely to cause clots that embolize whereas ruptured coronary lesions are more likely to trigger occlusive plaque thrombosis also factor xia s mechanism of action is directed more at thrombosis progression and is less involved in hemostatic responses he explained so factor xia inhibition might have more opportunity to prevent ischemic events related to large artery disease than those stemming from coronary disease at least shoamanesh said that s the current working hypothesis clinical outcomes might have differed in pacific ami also because our background antiplatelet therapy and our procedural therapies were very different alexander told theheart org medscape cardiology in pacific ami almost everybody was stented prior to randomization and everybody was on dual antiplatelet therapy and that s different from acute stroke in practice currently the two trials follow the previously reported phase 2 pacific af study in which asundexian given as 20 mg or 50 mg per day significantly cut the risk of major bleeding compared with the twice daily factor xa inhibitor apixaban eliquis in patients with af in that trial asundexian supressed factor xia activity about as thoroughly as it did in pacific ami advancing to phase 3 on the day the two studies were presented manufacturer bayer said it is launching a phase 3 asundexian program that is expected to involve tens of thousands of patients starting with trials called oceanic af and oceanic stroke discussion after alexander s pacific ami presentation turned to potential lessons that might inform the upcoming phase 3 trials for example what did the phase 2 studies say about the best dosage to explore in pacific ami there was no clear signal toward either efficacy or bleeding observed michelle l o donoghue md mph brigham and women s hospital boston the invited discussant after the presentation therefore one must largely rely on factor xia assays to guide phase 3 dose selection and their correlation with major adverse cardiac events and bleeding remains incompletely defined however o donoghue added it is encouraging that there was no clear bleeding signal still said alexander of the doses we studied in pacific ami the 50 mg dose looks very attractive it doesn t seem to cause bleeding at least not in a modest sized phase 2 trial and it almost completely inhibits factor xi so taking that forward would be interesting also attractive he offered are prospects for the de escalation of antiplatelet therapies that accompany factor xia inhibitors if the drugs are clinically effective it would certainly be interesting to know what happens if you back off on antiplatelet therapy do you do you lose efficacy or do you maintain efficacy and get rid of bleeding the pacific stroke numbers as presented by shoamanesh pacific stroke enrolled 1 809 patients who were within 48 hours from the symptoms of a non cardioembolic stroke they were randomly assigned to placebo or one of 3 daily oral doses of asundexian and followed for an average of about 10 months there were no significant differences in the primary endpoint ischemic stroke or covert brain infarct at 6 months across the 4 groups and no trace of a variable response by dosage but the post hoc exploratory endpoint of recurrent ischemic stroke or tia was significantly reduced at about 10 months in the asundexian 50 mg group compared to the control group with a hazard ratio hr of 0 64 90 ci 0 41 0 98 primary efficacy and post hoc exploratory outcomes by asundexian dosage endpoints 10 mg d n 455 20 mg d n 450 50 mg d n 447 placebo n 456 ischemic stroke or covert brain infarction 18 9 22 0 20 1 19 1 recurrent ischemic stroke or tia 7 7 6 2 5 4 8 3 as the formal discussant after the pacific stroke presentation elaine m hylek md mph boston university school of medicine pointed to the interesting dramatic effect on tia by asundexian in the exploratory analysis although tia could be considered a softer endpoint she said i think the validity of tia in a double blind design especially in a stroke trial where stroke neurologists are adjudicating these events really increases the robust nature of this finding the study s home run was the ischemic stroke tia endpoint s very clear dose response as you look from the 10 to the 20 to the 50 milligram dose of asundexian hylek said it s difficult to attribute that type of a finding to chance bias or confounding the rate of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding ranged from 3 1 to 4 3 across the four dosage levels and it was 2 4 for placebo with no significant differences the rate of any bleeding ranged from 8 3 to 10 8 across the asundexian groups and was nonsignificantly different at 9 7 for placebo shoamanesh reported the pacific ami numbers this trial assigned 1600 patients with acute mi about half and half st segment elevation mi and non st segment elevation mi almost all of whom underwent pci and received dapt to asundexian at one of the three dosage levels or placebo they were followed a median of 368 days their dapt included other than aspirin ticagrelor in 53 prasugrel in 27 and clopidogrel in 20 of cases factor xia activity after 4 weeks compared with baseline had dropped by more than 70 in the 10 mg group more than 80 in the 20 mg group and by more than 90 in the 50 mg group alexander reported safety efficacy and other outcomes by asundexian dosage endpoint 10 mg d 20 mg d 50 mg d placebo barc type 2 3 or 5 bleeding 7 6 8 1 10 5 9 0 any bleeding 17 7 18 9 20 4 21 3 cv death mi stroke or stent thrombosis 6 8 6 0 5 5 5 5 barc bleeding academic research consortium prespecified safety outcome prespecified efficacy outcome the phase 2 study is important showing the apparent safety of asundexian in addition to dapt in although the lack of signal for reducing ischemic events is disappointing notes an editorial accompanying the pacific ami report in circulation however the apparent safety yet the numerically fewer ischemic events seen with the 50 mg asundexian dose is encouraging and suggests the need to properly evaluate the potential ischemic benefit of this dose states the editorial with lead author ying x gue mbchb phd and senior author gregory y h lip md both from the university of liverpool united kingdom bayer s upcoming oceanic af trial will pit asundexian directly against apixaban as the antithrombotic given to patients with af and will track stroke or systemic embolism as the primary endpoint bayer said the first patients are expected to be enrolled later this year the oceanic stroke trial will test asundexian against placebo in patients with recent noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or high risk tia it s primary goal the company said will be to show a lower risk for ischemic stroke in comparison to placebo without a significant increase in

as an elected member of the avon town council back in the mid 90s i was an outspoken critic of government misuse of tax dollars still am at that time it was concerning tax dollars being used to fund local organizations that just happened to include family members of council members but more importantly six figure art projects to pretty up the town while funding a local scout troop and decorating the new roundabouts were both worthwhile endeavors to pursue with private money funding either with tax dollars is not the reason avon locals paid an extra 4 when buying a pack of underwear at walmart i lost the battle but the war of how governments spend the tax dollars we are legally forced to pay is endless and even more flagrant when federal governments lend those tax dollars to a naive 18 year old fresh out of high school who has been told by every adult in their life they wouldn t amount to anything if they didn t go to college support local journalism donate loaning 100 000 in anticipation that he or she would graduate in four years and begin paying the loan back with interest is not an action any banker would ever consider but our federal government has been doing it for decades and now we find that same government deciding meh you don t have to pay it back just promise to make wiser financial decisions in the future and oh while you re at it vote blue this november too cynical perhaps but don t get me wrong i m not bothered that some are receiving debt relief especially those whose 100k debt has ballooned to 125k although they ve never missed a minimum payment in 20 years i am bothered that tax dollars were used to fund extremely high risk loans at even higher interest rates in the first place forcing graduates into the kind of debt usually reserved for mortgage payments thus allowing higher education institutions to raise costs for attending to astronomical levels but then again this whole mess is sort of the american way right mortgage bank and auto industry bailouts billions in annual subsidies to the fossil fuel industry the 2017 1 7 trillion dollar tax break primarily used for stock buybacks and how about the ppp loans to help businesses hurt during the pandemic did you know at least 7 5 million of your tax dollars were used for ppp loans right here in happy valley and they were all forgiven yep and that s just the first hundred on the list under zip code 81620 some even had multiple loans all forgiven all provided by our tax dollars bartenders servers cooks shop clerks lifties ski instructors construction workers and every other american worker who never went to college is paying for this new handout with their taxes sure life s not always fair but the person who just made their last school loan payment a few weeks ago on aug 1 and the other who just signed for a school loan on the same day both have a damn good reason to be upset the hypocrisy from both political sides is predictably appalling yet the fact remains that loaning tax dollars should not be a function of government what s next someone declaring their mortgage identifies as a student loan anyway the morals behind this debt forgiveness are perhaps to be applauded for the right reasons but the ethics of using tax dollars to do so however not so much richard carnes of avon writes weekly he can be reached at poor vail net

rate to 3 as it struggled to contain soaring inflation rising house prices and acute labour shortages have pushed annual inflation in q3 2022 to a 32 year high with labour shortages adding pressure to inflation what is the interest rate forecast in new zealand for the next five years new zealand has been leading the global monetary tightening cycle by rising rates earlier than other developed nations we examine the country s interest rate history and economic indicators to see whether new zealand will retain its lead in spearheading monetary contraction what is the reserve bank of new zealand the reserve bank of new zealand rbnz is the central bank of new zealand it was founded on 1 april 1934 through the enactment of the reserve bank act in the early days the bank was partly privately owned with its main role restricted to maintaining exchange rate stability in 1935 a newly elected labour government nationalised the bank and authorised it to underwrite loans the bank s functions expanded over the years in line with the act s amendments significant reform took place in 1964 when the bank was tasked with using monetary policy to promote growth employment and other economic goals by 2009 the rbnz had a complete set of policy tools at its disposal these included carrying out monetary policy supervising the financial system conducting financial market operations providing clearing and settlement services managing and monitoring the liquidity in the banking system and issuing money to the general public the bank s monetary policy committee mpc formulates policy to achieve price stability over the medium term and support maximum sustainable employment in 1999 the bank introduced the official cash rate ocr as its main tool to keep inflation within its average target of between 1 and 3 it works to keep average inflation near the 2 target midpoint the mpc meets seven times a year to discuss and modify the ocr and broader monetary policy the body also meets to make arbitrary changes to the ocr in response to unforeseen developments according to the bank these meetings have taken place twice the first came after the world trade centre attacks in new

key rate was established in 1999 was 8 25 percent in july 2007 that was during the global financial crisis 2007 2008 brought on by the us housing bubble the reserve bank of new zealand s interest rate

75 basis points bp lowering the ocr to 0 25 from 1 in february 2020 as the negative impact of covid 19 on the country s economy rose the bank said in its statement the rbnz kept the key new zealand interest rate unchanged at 0 25 until august 2021 in october 2021 the bank started to ease its monetary stimulus raising the reserve bank of new zealand interest rate by 25bp to 0 50 as the economy showed signs of recovery however the bank noticed risks from rising costs coming from higher oil prices and transportation costs and supply shortfalls at that time the rbnz expected inflation to increase above 4 in the near term the bank lifted the ocr by another 25bp in november 2021 bringing the interest rate to 0 75 by the end of 2021 since february 2022 as of 29 august the bank has increased the new zealand interest rate five times four of the hikes at 50bp the series of rate increases took the ocr to 3 at the bank s latest 17 august meeting up from 1 in february drivers for rbnz monetary decision inflation unemployment and the country s economic growth are factors that the bank usually looks for to adjust the new zealand interest rate let s look at how these have developed this year inflation seen easing inflation in new zealand climbed to 7 3 in the second quarter to june 2022 the largest annual increase in 32 years according to the country s statistics office stats nz it was more than double the bank s inflation target of a maximum of 3 the june 2022 quarter inflation was also higher compared to 6 9 in the first quarter of 2022 and 3 3 in the second quarter of 2021 as shown in the chart housing and household utilities mainly rising prices for construction and rentals for housing are the main drivers for the 7 3 annual inflation up to the june 2022 quarter stats nz said in its monetary policy statement in august the rbnz forecast annual cpi inflation to decline to 6 4 in q4 2022 over 2023 the bank has projected annual headline inflation to gradually drop returning to the top of the 1 to 3 target band by early 2024 the bank s survey of expectations which polled 35 business leaders and forecasters and was released on 8 august forecast inflation to decline to 4 86 in one year and 3 07 in two years the five year inflation expectation was set at 2 33 anz research expected inflation in new zealand to come down to 6 7 in september and 6 1 in december 2022 inflation is forecast to continue its downward trajectory until it falls within the bank s target at 2 5 in december 2023 and 2 3 in march 2024 unemployment rate adds pressure to inflation acute labour shortages have kept new zealand s unemployment rate low stats nz announced on 3 august that the annual unemployment rate stood at 3 3 in q3 2022 practically unchanged from 3 2 in q2 2022 in august s monetary policy statement the rbnz attributed labour shortages to higher than usual levels of sickness from covid 19 and other illnesses as well as an outflow of new zealanders heading overseas following the reopening of the country s border a very tight labour market is adding to high consumer price index cpi inflation with wage growth continuing to increase as businesses compete to attract or retain staff the bank said in the statement the bank s survey expected one year ahead unemployment to increase to 3 77 and to 4 31 in two years on 26 august anz research forecast new zealand s unemployment rate to rise to 3 4 in december 2022 and remain steady at that level in the first quarter of 2023 the unemployment rate is expected to pick up to 4 in q4 2023 rising further to 4 8 in q1 2024 gdp growth seen slowing the country s economy grew by 5 1 in the first quarter of 2022 but fell by 0 2 on a quarterly basis from 3 to december 2021 according to stats nz the drop was primarily due to a decrease in primary industry s gross domestic products gdp new zealand s central bank forecast the country s gdp growth to slow to 3 9 in 2023 from an estimated 5 4 in 2022 it expected the gdp to have 0 6 contraction in 2024 before rebounding to 0 7 in 2025 the rbnz s survey of expectations projected gdp growth to reach 1 49 in a year and achieve 1 89 annual growth in the june 2024 quarter the economy is then expected to grow faster in the year after though still slower than what was previously expected two years ahead the survey said anz research forecast new zealand s gdp to grow by 4 4 in the september 2022 quarter slowing to 2 2 in the december quarter the country s gdp growth picked up slightly to 2 8 in the march 2023 quarter before gradually declining to 1 in the march quarter of 2024 impact on nzd usd while the rbnz s interest rate policy has a direct impact on new zealand s national currency the nzd usd rate has lately been strongly influenced by announcements from the us federal reserve fed nzd usd live chart on 10 august netherlands based ing group s research arm think weighed in on the prospects for the nzd usd rate in the upcoming months noting while the kiwi dollar can continue to count on the most attractive carry in the g10 we suspect more instability in global risk sentiment may delay any benefits for high yielding currencies to 4q or the start of 2023 we think nzd usd could sink back to 0 62 by the end of this quarter before starting to turn higher later this year and touch 0 64 by year end roger j kerr executive chairman of investment firm barrington treasury services recently said that the nzd usd rate is dominated by the decisions made by the fed with local factors such as labour shortages and low consumer confidence being practically irrelevant the nzd usd exchange rate has plunged back to the low of 0 6140 last seen in june following the speech at jackson hole by us federal reserve governor jerome powell on friday 26th august the kiwi dollar was hit hard by the risk aversion investment market sentiment as the dow jones index on the us equities market dropped over 1 000 points on the day following the powell speech whilst the nz economy paints a decidedly negative picture the nz dollar value is unlikely to suffer as a result as there has been absolutely no offshore interest in the kiwi for quite some time the nzd usd exchange rate movement will continue to be dominated by the usd side and the local nz economic factors will continue to be totally irrelevant rbnz interest rate forecast 2002 target and beyond what are the long term new zealand interest rate predictions from analysts and the rbnz in its asia economic weekly outlook on 26 august bank of america bofa predicted new zealand interest rates to rise by 50bp when the central bank s mpc convenes in october and another 50bp hike in november taking new zealand s interest rate to 4 by end of the year bofa expected the rbnz to put any rate adjustment on hold in 2023 the bank also forecast a significant slowdown in the country s economic growth as tighter financial conditions gain traction slowing the pace of household and business spending growth ongoing capacity constraints and high inflation are unlikely to be resolved soon yet there is increased uncertainty around the global and domestic economic outlook with domestic demand holding up relatively well outside of the housing market there is increased risk for the hiking cycle to be extended into 2023 the bank said in the note in its new zealand interest rate outlook on 26 august anz research forecast the rbnz to increase ocr to 4 by december 2022 and hold the rate at that level until december 2023 anz had previously forecast that the bank may cut the ocr from a peak of 4 in the second half of 2024 to 3 5 in the fourth quarter 2024m but it has removed the rate cut in the latest estimate anz noted while obviously what 2024 looks like is subject to extreme uncertainty we ve now taken those cuts out of our forecast to make it consistent with our current thinking we continue to expect the rbnz to lift the ocr to a peak of 4 by year end though we see the risk profile tilted to more but we no longer expect the rbnz will be cutting the ocr over the duration of our forecast horizon barring some miraculous recovery in the supply side of the economy or some unforecastable shock hitting the economy in its august monetary policy statement the rbnz estimated that it may hike the ocr to 3 7 by december 2022 and 4 by q1 2023 the ocr may be lifted to 4 1 in q2 2023 and held there until the second half of 2024 before being lowered to 3 6 in september 2025 the national australia bank nab has predicted that the new zealand interest rate will be lifted to 3 5 by december 2022 and stay at that level until september 2023 the rbnz is forecast to cut the key rate to 3 25 in december 2023 and continue to gradually lower it to 2 25 in december 2024 according to nab s forecast anz bofa and the rbnz did not offer forecasts beyond 2025 australian lender westpac predicted interest rates in new zealand to rise in the short term forecasting the rbnz to lift the ocr to 4 by the end of 2022 from 3 in the q3 2022 the bank predicted that the interest rate in new zealand may be held at 4 until the second quarter of 2024 before the country s central bank cuts the rate in the third quarter to 3 5 continuing to lower the ocr until it reaches 2 in december 2025 the rbnz is forecast to pause any adjustment on the ocr and keep the rate at 2 until the end of 2028 final thoughts forecasts in this article showed that the reserve bank of new zealand could raise the interest rate to 4 by the end of the year before lowering it in the

nearly half of cfos anticipate the north american economy will be in recession by next year but they re more concerned about inflation than a recession according to a new survey by deloitte the big four firm s q3 cfo signals survey released monday polled 112 cfos in the u s canada and mexico and found 46 of them expect the economy to be in a recession in 2023 compared to 39 who expect the economy to hit a period of stagflation and 15 to grow with moderate inflation however nearly three quarters of cfos 73 are more concerned about persistent inflation than a recession concerns about the economy and inflation have been increasing this year the first quarter of 2022 is when we really started to see the pressure on inflation begin to begin to mount and the subsequent moves by the fed said steve gallucci deloitte s north america leader of the cfo program that along with some geopolitical challenges both in china as well as in the ukraine have really dampened any of the optimism that we saw throughout the pandemic for the most part in terms of companies projected revenues earnings capital spending etc jack taylor getty images however despite the worrisome economic conditions a growing number of cfos expect better conditions in a year with 29 of cfos expecting north america s economy to be better in a year up from 18 in 2q22 the percentage of cfos saying now is a good time for greater risk taking rose to 38 from 35 in the second quarter of 2022 we did see some data points which would indicate that cfos are beginning to look beyond what would be a pending recession towards potentially starting to think about taking more risk potentially seeing the economy begin to perform a little bit better in the out quarters said gallucci but they certainly continue to be cautious and prudent with things like headcount operating expenses and the like cfos who anticipate the north american economy will be in a recession by 2023 are preparing by reducing or closely managing their companies operating expenses controlling headcount limiting hiring boosting productivity conserving or strengthening liquidity and reprioritizing or deferring capital expenditures they re also modeling to test cash flows under different scenarios managing pricing and contracts reducing capital expenses and trying to manage their customers and market share better cfos also have lower expectations for year over year growth for some key metrics revenue growth is expected to be 6 2 this quarter down from 7 8 in the second quarter while earnings growth expectations are at 6 4 down from 8 4 in the second quarter and capital spending growth at 4 3 is also down from 11 2 in q2 stock market volatility has contributed to overall uncertainty as evidenced by the steep drop in the dow last friday the proportion of cfos who considered u s equities overvalued in this quarter s survey fell to 30 from 43 in the prior quarter i guess in a strange way you d say that less people thought it was overvalued today said gallucci nearly half 46 of the cfos polled indicated u s equities were neither overvalued nor undervalued while 24 viewed them as being undervalued thanks to the ongoing labor shortage cfos have also cut their growth expectations for domestic wages and salaries as well as domestic hiring to 4 8 and 2 6 respectively compared to 5 3 for both in q2 cfos have also been responding to concerns about climate change including in last quarter s surveys by deloitte in which they were asked about their decarbonization strategy their comments fell into key categories such as clarity on measurement strategy costs lack of universal guidance technology data capture stakeholder buy in competing priorities and resources it was very much a mixed bag said gallucci there were some that indicated that a third would get there by 2030 and a third by 2050 and about a third were still trying to figure it out

expected to be accretive to heico s earnings per share within a year of the transaction s closing as we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2022 we expect global commercial air travel to continue growing despite the potential for additional covid 19 global pandemic the pandemic variants we remain cautiously optimistic that the ongoing worldwide pandemic vaccines and boosters rollout will continue to positively influence global commercial air travel and benefit the markets we serve but it still remains very difficult to predict the pandemic s path and effect including factors like new variants and vaccination rates potential supply chain disruptions and inflation which can impact our key markets therefore we feel it would not be responsible to provide fiscal 2022 net sales and

a federal appeals court heard arguments monday in a lawsuit seeking to overturn the securities and exchange commission s approval of a nasdaq stock exchange rule on corporate board diversity under the rule nasdaq listed companies must appoint at least two diverse directors including one self identified as female and another who is either an underrepresented minority or lgbtq or explain why they have not done so if the rule remains intact it could impact a large swath of north american banks and fintech companies and also establish precedent for further actions on the sec s reform agenda more than 300 banks are traded on the exchange last year the securities and exchange commission approved the nasdaq board diversity rule which requires listed companies to appoint at least two diverse directors or explain why they have not done so bloomberg during the hearing monday in new orleans lawyers for advocacy groups argued that the sec s approval of the rule amounted to government sponsored discrimination since it gives preference to women and minorities over other candidates one key issue in the case is whether the diversity mandate is critical for investor decision making when i read the approval order it sure looks like nasdaq and the other exchanges are saying investors want this information judge stephen a higginson said during the hearing he added that lawyers for the groups challenging the rule must show some coercion or strong encouragement by the regulator to prove that the sec exceeded the agency s authority under the securities and exchange act the sec approved the nasdaq rule last august assuming it remains in effect nasdaq listed companies will face different compliance deadlines depending on their size some larger firms will need to have at least one diverse director by aug 7 2023 and two by aug 6 2025 or explain why they do not back in 2020 minority groups including black latino and asian americans represented 20 of board members at 44 large banks surveyed by democrats on the house financial services committee during monday s court hearing lawyers for the two groups that are challenging the nasdaq rule the alliance for fair board recruitment and the new civil liberties alliance argued that the sec is the real driving force behind the rule the sec is trying to get a private actor to do for them what they can t do for themselves said margaret little senior counsel for the new civil liberties alliance when you have a rule that s approved by the sec and can be enforced by the sec it s hard to say that s purely a private rule little said jonathan berry a partner at the law firm boyden gray associates which represents the challengers to the nasdaq rule made a related argument about the involvement of the government it seems to be the case that the sec is letting nasdaq s rule play out before it turns to its own rulemakings related to diversity for all public companies berry said in an interview during the hearing judges on the fifth circuit court of appeals questioned lawyers for the sec about whether the rule is based on consensus evidence that diverse board leadership can have a material impact on a company s financial performance the empirical evidence is inconclusive but it is a matter of reasonable debate responded tracey hardin an assistant general counsel at the sec in a study last year moody s investors service found that greater gender diversity on bank boards has a slight correlation with higher credit ratings at banks with higher credit quality 28 of directors were women compared with 26 of board members at lower rated banks the nasdaq rule is a response to demand from investors for more granular comparable and consistent disclosures said stephen hall legal director and securities specialist at the nonprofit watchdog group better markets i think the judges appreciated that the rule serves an important purpose in responding to clear demand from investors hall said during an interview andrew vollmer who served as the sec s deputy general counsel during the george w bush administration expressed greater skepticism about the rule diversity and equality nasdaq rule adds to pressure on banks to diversify boards the new standards give some 300 listed banks up to five years to meet targets for including women and minorities on their boards or explain why they aren t doing so state officials and investors had already pushed banks about the need to rethink their approaches to recruiting directors august 16 he said that the scope of listing requirements has gotten fairly broad and is treading into corporate governance areas you need to have a reasonably close connection between listing requirements and traditional reasons for having stock exchanges offer services to members of the public vollmer said in an interview vollmer argued that broad changes in corporate governance rulemaking should not receive regulatory approval without the consent of elected officials questions of race gender and sexual identity are among the most sensitive and controversial matters in our society today vollmer said these are moral and social issues that really need some type of congressional approval

could china s yuan replace the u s dollar as the world s dominant currency here s how the asian nation s trade supremacy is rapidly boosting its reserve status could china s yuan replace the u s dollar as the world s dominant currency here s how the asian nation s trade supremacy is rapidly boosting its reserve status china s economy has been immensely successful by most measures its gross domestic product gdp of 17 7 trillion is second only to the united states it s also the third largest trading nation in the world behind only the u s and e u however china s currency the renminbi only accounts for 3 of global trade compare that to the 87 market share of the u s dollar despite its economic and political power the country doesn t dominate the global flow of fiat currency now it s looking to change that advertisement advertisement here is china s multitrillion multidecade plan to replace the u s dollar as the world s reserve currency don t miss mitt romney says a billionaire tax will trigger demand for these two physical assets get in now before the super rich swarm you could be the landlord of walmart whole foods and kroger and collect fat grocery store anchored income on a quarterly basis what do ashton kutcher and a nobel prize winning economist have in common an investing app that turns spare change into a diversified portfolio how do currencies achieve reserve status achieving reserve currency status isn t a formal process instead it s like winning a popularity contest the most popular currency for global trade and cross border commerce emerges as the de facto reserve currency the popularity of a currency is simply based on the perception of security and resilience of the issuing country this is the asset or currency that most central banks across the world prefer to hold in reserve which is why the dominant asset earns the label of reserve currency since 1450 there have been six major reserve currency periods portugal dominated the global reserves until 1530 when spain became stronger currencies issued by the netherlands and france dominated world trade for much of the 17th and 18th centuries but the emergence of the british empire made the pound sterling the reserve currency until the end of the first world war the u s dollar displaced the pound just as america gained economic superiority over britain more than 75 of global transactions have been completed in u s dollars since 2008 the dollar also accounts for more than 60 of foreign debt issuance and 59 of global central bank reserves although the dollar s grip on all these markets and instruments has been gradually declining in recent years no other currency comes close to these levels the chinese renminbi certainly isn t a viable alternative but geopolitical and macroeconomic trends support its rise to dominance china s plan this year chinese leaders made it clear that they wanted to boost the renminbi s profile as a reserve currency china s economy and trade flows are large enough to support such a move however the country now needs to convince foreign central bankers to start holding the chinese yuan the principal unit of the renminbi in reserve story continues in july the people s bank of china announced a collaboration with five nations and the bank for international settlements to achieve this china along with indonesia malaysia hong kong singapore and chile would each contribute 15 billion yuan about 2 2 billion to the renminbi liquidity arrangement meanwhile the chinese yuan has already become a de facto reserve currency in russia russian leadership turned to china after facing sanctions from the west due to its invasion of ukraine earlier this year now 17 of russia s foreign reserves are denominated in yuan the yuan is also the third most demanded currency on the moscow exchange advertisement advertisement as these partnerships become stronger the yuan s status as a reserve currency could be further entrenched the global impact economists including barry eichengreen of the university of california berkeley and camille macaire of france s central bank published a paper analyzing the yuan s potential as a reserve currency the researchers argue that replacing the dollar isn t going to be easy or quick however they found evidence that yuan reserves were steadily increasing in countries that had tighter trade relations with china this growing influence could make the yuan an alternative to the u s dollar in a multipolar world in other words china might chip away at the dollar s influence over time the study s authors said the renminbi s current position was similar to the u s dollar in the 1950s based on that comment it could be just a few decades before the yuan gains parity if the forecasts are correct long term
