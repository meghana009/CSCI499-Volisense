text size like a tightrope walker about to take their first steps across a chasm reserve bank governor philip lowe can see his goal and the danger beneath his feet he like central bankers around the world are all heading out onto a very thin wire balancing the need for strong economic growth on one hand with the battle to bring inflation under control on the other reserve bank governor philip lowe this week outlining the case for higher interest rates credit aap speaking this week about the situation facing the reserve bank and through it the australian economy lowe conceded the way ahead was not for the faint hearted especially for those who may have a job it s a fairly narrow path we re on we re trying to get demand and supply to increase at the same rate and achieving that s difficult he said it s quite possible that at some point in time the unemployment rate will rise but i don t think it needs to rise while lowe s words are often parsed to understand what the rba s interest rate settings may mean for home buyers little was said about these utterances advertisement but they went to the heart of the problem facing lowe and other central banks after spending the covid recession using policy to drive unemployment down to the lowest level in half a century people may lose their jobs as the bank tries to take inflationary pressures out of the economy to bring inflation to heel currently 5 1 per cent and now likely on its way to 7 per cent by year s end the rba is increasing interest rates it s already taken the cash rate from 0 1 per cent to 0 85 per cent at its past two meetings when board members sit down on july 5 for their next meeting they will debate whether to hike rates by either a quarter of a percentage point or a half apart from making your home loan repayments more expensive higher interest rates have a much broader economic impact the nsw treasury this week gave some insight into what higher interest rates may mean in sensitivity analysis released as part of the state budget it looked at the economic fallout from interest rates running about a percentage point higher than treasury expects advertisement it expects the rba to have official interest rates at 1 75 per cent by year s end and 2 5 per cent by the end of 2023 but financial markets reckon they could be closer to 4 per cent just as australians are decorating their christmas trees so the nsw treasury had a look at what might transpire if its assumptions prove to be wrong official interest rates could be well above 2 per cent by christmas credit nick moir it found the state economy would be 0 9 percentage points smaller than expected employment growth would be 0 3 percentage points lower in 2022 23 and 0 4 percentage points lower the following year while the jobless rate would be higher across the next four years wages growth would be slower while inflation in sydney would be about a half percentage point lower overall this means consumers will spend less and businesses will invest less leading to a reduction in domestic economic activity and consequently lower employment it found replicate that across the country and you re talking about 100 000 or more people out of work it means fewer small businesses it means tens of thousands of first time home buyers owing more on their property than it s worth advertisement this is not just an australian problem central banks around the world which slashed interest rates to zero or lower while creating trillions of dollars as part of quantitative easing programs are rapidly reversing direction last week america s central bank increased official interest rates there by 0 75 percentage points with more increases to come inflation is pushing up prices for everyday goods forcing australians to consider reducing their spending on things like chocolate snacks credit getty images this week the bank of england got a sharp wake up call with inflation across britain climbing to 9 1 per cent its job is to have inflation around 2 per cent britain s official interest rate is at 1 25 per cent but it will be pushed much higher at its early august meeting the central banks of europe new zealand and canada are all increasing their interest rates advertisement one senior global economist told the sydney morning herald and the age that the current situation is a first order global challenge all of these central banks have the same goal achieving a so called soft landing for their economies but saying soft landing is much easier than actually achieving one the rba does have history on its side when it comes to lowe s high wire act apart from one glaring mistake which directly contributed to the 1990 91 recession the reserve bank has a pretty reasonable track record when it comes to increasing interest rates without flattening the economy in 1994 over a five month period the rba lifted interest rates by 2 75 percentage points it remains the most aggressive tightening of monetary policy over the past 30 years people outside a centrelink office early in the covid recession higher interest rates often contribute to a lift in unemployment credit louie douvis while this episode caused political problems for then prime minister paul keating the economy withstood the lift in rates unemployment actually edged down through the period albeit it was still in the high 8s advertisement
by sam pizzigati how far off the charts has compensation for america s top corporate ceos soared let s use peter drucker as our reference point management theorists today generally give drucker a refugee from nazism in the 1930s the credit for essentially laying down the foundations of management as a scientific discipline after world war ii drucker s classic 1946 study of general motors established him for leaders throughout business and academia as the nation s foremost authority on corporate enterprise effectiveness that effectiveness drucker believed had to rest on fairness corporations that compensated their top execs at rates that far outpaced worker pay created cultures where a systematic commitment to organizational excellence could never take root in the two decades after world war ii america s leading corporate chiefs by and large accepted drucker s perspective they may have felt they didn t have much of a choice from distinguished thinkers like drucker outside corporate boardrooms came exhortations for fair minded pay policies from unions inside the nation s most powerful corporate empires came fierce pressure to share the wealth and that wealth did get shared in 1965 the economic policy institute notes major corporate ceos in the united states were only realizing 21 times the pay their workers were pocketing that gap would remain fairly modest over the next dozen years only reaching 31 times in 1978 but this relatively slight upward nudge unsettled drucker corporate outliers he believed were beginning an about face from america s post war corporate pay consensus a relative handful of top corporate execs drucker noted in a 1977 wall street journal analysis were actually taking in pay packages nearing an until then unimaginable 1 million a year don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free for drucker the rationales corporations offered for these new enormous pay packages amounted to nonsense and pure hokum companies faced no unforgiving need to pay market price for their execs stock options did not promote performance those options and other maneuvers designed to escalate executive take homes drucker added were doing enormous damage excessive rewards for top executives he explained nurture the bureaucratic structures that undercut organizational effectiveness how so in any bureaucracy every level of hierarchy must get compensated at a higher rate than the level below the more levels the higher the pay at the summit endless levels of hierarchy would remain appealing to executives drucker argued as long as they prop up and push up executive pay his solution to make bureaucratic hierarchies less appealing to top execs limit executive pay no executives drucker believed should be allowed to make more than 25 times the compensation of their workers a ratio of 25 to 1 is not equality drucker acknowledged but it is well within the range most people in this country including the great majority of rank and file workers consider proper and indeed desirable drucker lived long enough he died in 2005 at age 95 to see corporate america make a mockery of his 25 to 1 standard but research since his death has consistently reaffirmed his take on the negative impact of wide ceo worker pay differentials on organizational effectiveness the mockery of drucker s contribution meanwhile continues as the just released 28th annual edition of the institute for policy studies executive excess report details in eye opening detail this year s executive excess zeroes in on the 300 major u s corporations that pay their median most typical workers the least at these 300 companies ceo pay last year jumped an average 2 5 million to 10 6 million typical worker pay at the 300 firms increased on average as well but the increase still left median annual worker earnings at the 300 companies under 24 000 overall ceos at the 300 major u s corporations with 2021 s lowest median worker pay averaged 670 times the annual earnings of their most typical workers up from 604 times the year before workers at over 100 of these firms did far worse than the average figures in 106 of the 300 corporations median worker pay didn t even keep with inflation did the workers at these 106 companies lose ground to inflation because their employers lacked the wherewithal to make sure wages kept up with rising prices the new executive excess report asks hardly in fact 67 of these firms spent many millions last year buying back their own shares these repurchases totaled 43 7 billion so what can we do to restore the reasonableness in corporate compensation that peter drucker spent six decades of his life working toward the new institute for policy studies executive excess report offers up a list of concrete steps that could make a fairness and effectiveness difference given the current make up of congress most of these steps have no shot at near run enactment but executive excess 2022 does highlight one step that the biden administration could implement to great effect via executive action the administration could use that action to give corporations with narrow pay ratios preferential treatment in government contracting various federal programs already offer a leg up in contracting to targeted groups typically small businesses owned by women disabled veterans and minorities these programs sometimes involve set asides other times give up to a 10 percent credit in bidding competitions all these existing preference programs the new executive excess notes tap the power of the public purse to level the playing field and expand opportunities for the disadvantaged using public procurement to address extreme disparities within large corporations the report adds would be a step towards the same general objective and a step in that direction as peter drucker told wall street journal readers back in 1977 would do honor to the great achievement of american business in the middle of the 20th century the steady narrowing of the income gap between the big boss and the working man previously published on inequality with creative common license don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy

american record label 300 entertainment and financial services company nasdaq joined forces on friday morning june 24 for a special intimate conversation between legendary music executive kevin liles and civil rights activist al sharpton the event brought people from all over the media industry to the nasdaq marketsite in the heart of new york city to hear the gems and knowledge liles and sharpton have developed throughout their careers 300 and nasdaq treated guests to a complimentary breakfast before activist and former organizer of the women s march tameka mallory opened the event with a moving introduction that reflected on the efforts kevin liles and al sharpton have put forth in their respective fields more from billboard despite the early start time the audience was fully locked into liles and sharpton speaking on topics such as uplifting and protecting black culture sticking to your beliefs despite outside influences preventing that black music month ways to push the needle and more billboard was at the event on friday morning and compiled a list of five things we learned from the nearly hour long conversation check out the selections below they believe roe v wade was overturned due to low voter turnout in 2016 presidential election hours before kevin liles and al sharpton had their conversation the supreme court overturned the landmark roe v wade decision that protected women s rights regarding abortion liles and sharpton wasted no time discussing the controversial move which they believed wouldn t have happened if people actually came out to vote in the 2016 presidential election as sharpton said the reason why they did us in with roe v wade this morning is donald trump put three people on the supreme court it s just that simple if donald trump had not been president he couldn t have done that liles added because after eight years of i knew something wasn t going to be right whether we had the right candidate or not trump got in office because we did not vote godfather of soul james brown inspired al sharpton s hairstyle kevin liles had al sharpton speak on his close friendship with the legendary james brown whom he met through a mutual friend in new york city brown s late son terry was a fan of sharpton s activism and his death in a car accident was the catalyst that brought al and james together the musician was advised to meet with the civil rights activist to set up a show for his son and the rest was history over time brown became a father figure to al and inspired him to style his hair just like the musician according to sharpton s recollection brown told him i want you to keep your hair like that as long as i m alive and revealed the singer gave him validation as a man that he never got from his biological father james brown and elijah muhammad were the only two blacks in the 60s 70s to own a jet in the middle of telling a story about flying alongside james brown in first class because his private jet was getting repaired sharpton revealed his good friend was the only black person other than former nation of islam leader elijah muhammad with their own plane some guests in attendance let out a resounding wow in shock at hearing no other black person owned a private jet but understood why that was the case given how different the world was back in those days russell simmons 1992 black enterprise cover pushed kevin liles to be a music executive liles is one of the most iconic music executives that helped propel hip hop into what it is today he gained recognition as president of def jam recordings and executive vice president of the island def jam music group from 1999 to 2004 after spending time with def jam liles served as evp of warner music group before venturing out on his own in 2009 and creating 300 entertainment alongside lyor cohen roger gold and todd moscowitz during their conversation liles explained def jam founder russell simmons was his james brown if it wasn t for simmons classic 1992 black enterprise cover shoot liles wouldn t have set out to achieve everything he s done throughout his career i just think about when i saw russell on the cover of black enterprise and i said oh we can do that we can have an hbcu hoodie on sitting on top of a rolls royce and they talk about a 34 million rap business oh we can do that ok there was nothing i could ever think to do but to learn from them kevin liles preaches the idea that they not us toward the end of the conversation liles began breaking down how simmons sold def jam for 140 million compared to barry gordy who sold motown for 60 million liles then spoke about building a company in eight years and selling it for over 400 million that tidbit was even more shocking when the music executive said it took 20 plus years to sell geffen for 340 million y all can t tell me it ain t possible liles said but you have to put in the work i have this saying that i say all the time they not us they don t

dmi and nmpf dairy farmers and the entire industry continue to deal with a high price high cost environment unlike any seen for at least a decade and in many ways not in the past four decades march and april set consecutive all time highs for the monthly average all milk price in the u s while the four federal order class prices set a collective record in may monthly retail prices of whole and lowfat milk butter ice cream and yogurt also reached all time highs meanwhile monthly u s dairy exports posted a strong recovery in april from a recent low in january amounting to 18 7 percent of u s milk solids production the third highest ever for a single month by this measure the combination of continued lower u s cow numbers milk production and record high milk and retail dairy prices is beginning to show signs of impacting domestic dairy product consumption at retail and also food service however since retail price inflation is occurring for all food and beverages and throughout the entire economy it is unclear how or whether this will play out differently than if higher dairy product prices were an exception in an overall non inflationary economy commercial use of dairy products domestic yogurt consumption growth was almost entirely robust during the first two years of the covid pandemic but it has turned negative during 2022 consumption of other than american type cheese has been generally stronger than for american types during the past year year over year changes in domestic consumption of most skim milk ingredient products including dry skim milk dry whey and lactose has been mostly negative during the months of the pandemic with whey protein concentrate an exception domestic use of milk in all products was about 2 percent lower than a year earlier during february april u s dairy trade 18 71 percent of u s milk solids production was estimated to have been exported in april the third highest ever for a single month by this measure potentially positioning the industry for another strong calendar year of exports following an uncertain start and a sign of how export demand may be structurally higher than in the past given that the strength is occurring in spite of high prices april exports represented a more than 5 percentage point increase from the recent low of 13 63 percent in january this year over half of this net volume recovery was contributed by lactose skim milk powder dry and modified whey u s dairy imports were moderately higher than a year ago during february april with the major product categories of cheese and dairy proteins mostly increasing between 6 and 8 percent year over year milk production april u s milk production reported by usda shows production continuing in contraction territory with little indication of when it might return to growth total dairy cow numbers in the country also continued to decline from year earlier levels in april very modest growth occurred during february april in milk production per cow as well as in production of total milk solids the only real supply side expansion to take place during this period was total u s milkfat production which was 1 3 percent higher during these three months than a year earlier dairy products butter production was close to flat during february april indicating some recovery from several prior months of annual reductions continued lower dry skim milk production would indicate that reduced milk production is still being claimed preferentially by cheese production at the expense of butter powder however higher milkfat production would suggest that cream supply was not necessarily the primary cause of earlier tighter butter production cheese supply growth is still noticeably greater for other than american types of cheese used heavily in food service upticks in american type cheese use in summer grilling had not yet shown up in production data as of april dairy product inventories cold storage stocks of other than american type cheese and stocks of all types of cheese reached record single month levels at the end of april manufacturers stocks of dry skim milk and dry whey also showed some tendencies toward excessive although not record levels at that time dairy product and federal order class prices none of the four ndpsr reported dairy product prices attained anywhere near an all time high level in may but the four federal order class prices narrowly missed setting such a record collectively it was widely expected based on the futures markets that the may class i ii iii and iv prices quoted at the standard 3 5 percent fat level would each exceed 25 00 cwt for the first time ever however the may class iv price just missed this mark by coming in at 24 99 cwt nevertheless that was still the highest minimum level ever for all four class prices u s average retail prices reported by the bureau of labor statistics for may were the highest ever in nominal terms for whole milk and for ice cream and although there are some gaps in their bls data they were also likely the highest ever for lowfat milk butter and yogurt the annual rate of retail price inflation has rapidly accelerated in recent months into double digit percentages throughout the entire dairy product spectrum including whole milk lowfat milk butter and the dairy category as a whole by comparison the overall rate of inflation in may was 8 6 percent of the bls reported dairy products cheese has consistently shown the slowest rate of retail price inflation at 8 7 percent for may milk and feed prices the usda nass reported u s average all milk price is busy setting records first in march by beating the prior highest monthly price in 2014 by 0 20 cwt and then by blowing away that short lived record a month later when it jumped above march by 1 20 cwt to hit 27 10 cwt for april the april dmc margin was 12 29 cwt 0 74 cwt higher than in march as the april dmc feed cost rose 0 46 cwt that month this increase was driven entirely by a higher corn price while the soybean meal price dropped and the premium alfalfa price showed a very small increase looking ahead usda s world agricultural supply and demand estimates wasde monthly update for june lowered the department s estimate of calendar year 2022 u s milk production from its may estimate which it had raised from the prior month this illustrates the difficulty of foreseeing how much longer u s milk production will be constrained in the current unique environment of record high milk prices paired with extremely high production costs and supply chain disruptions the department s june cy 2022 forecast is marginally higher than cy 2021 actual production january through april production is down this year from 2021 by 1 0 percent together this indicates usda expects u s milk production to grow by about half a percent from a year earlier during the last eight months of the year usda also expects dairy demand to stay strong and accordingly raised its 2022 outlook for most dairy product and milk prices from may to june with the exception of dry whey in particular the department raised its calendar year 2022 forecast of the u s average all milk price from may to june by 0 45 cwt to 26 20 cwt this was still about 0 40 cwt below where the dairy futures indicated this annual price would come in but was also about 0 15 cwt above where the dmc decision tool on the usda website was projecting at the same time all forecasts are currently indicating that the dmc margin will not drop below 9 50 cwt during any month of 2022

an australian pioneer of infrastructure investment lazard asset management s warryn robertson heads up a team managing more than 20 billion of assets he lives and breathes the asset class which has been a focus for almost his entire career this includes his two decades at lazard where he is portfolio manager of the lazard global infrastructure fund and the global equity franchise and the years prior as an adviser to infrastructure investors the latest guest on livewire s rules of investing podcast robertson joined james marlay to discuss ranking the big three inflation hedges the perfect storm and how it formed why us infrastructure is risky the closest thing to a perfect monopoly investment theme the best inflation protection you can get view the big three inflation hedges when looking to add inflation protection to their portfolios these are the main areas investors favour commodities gold aluminium copper and coal real estate reits and property assets more generally infrastructure and there are stark differences between those in terms of why they provide inflation protection robertson says for the first the long term prices of mining companies hinges on the price of the commodity this in turn is set by the marginal cost of production so inflation is implicit through the cost base it s not explicit he says reits also provide inflation protection but they re also typically shorter term contracts landlords will have three to five year contracts and they usually have an inflation element built into those after which you can make your choice so it s a bit more like commodities in that it s supply and demand driven and then there s infrastructure where the inflation protection is regulated it s not something that s related to supply and demand and that s the key difference robertson says the other key advantages in robertson s eyes are that infrastructure assets are monopoly like and they re essential services this means their volume demands pandemics aside are more stable and consistent than those for commodity producers and reits i think everyone should have some infrastructure in their portfolios and with inflation becoming an issue its protection attributes are unique robertson says inflation runs rampant recession fears rise turning to his views on the current macro environment robertson emphasises that lazard s process of selecting assets is unchanged his team looks over a three to five year period to assess where they believe long term yields will be using this to decide what is an appropriate risk free rate they then apply a discount rate and company cash flows that link to their long term outlook on gross domestic product robertson also emphasises his view that cash flows and the discount rate are explicitly linked but markets have become very easily influenced by the belief that we re going back to trend growth rates but that we ll always have low interest rates he says the big error he saw coming robertson regards this mistaken belief as one of the big mistakes that have led markets to the current situation but the biggest underpinning factor here is something he says lazard has been warning against for at least the last two years the combination of low interest rates and people believing that would remain the case for years to come as well as the conundrum of when the pandemic hit and the supply curve shifted to the left creating inflation has created the perfect storm for inflation that we have today he says the key error almost everyone made was to look at the pandemic as a normal recession but in economic terms nothing could be further from the truth he says why because in a normal recession demand for goods falls when people make the choice not to consume the same level of goods while supply remains relatively fixed that means you re going to have deflation robertson says what happened during the pandemic was in economic terms almost unique as he explains it the supply curve moved to the left first and then the demand curve moved with it it wasn t that we didn t want to go and buy things but we just physically couldn t businesses couldn t go and hire people not because they didn t want to but because there was no one around who could leave their home robertson says a key point here is that with supply moving first rather than demand the prices for goods didn t deflate as they would in a normal recession and yet the response from central banks was the same as it would be in a more orthodox recession governments and central banks around the world said recession all we ve got to do is throw money at the situation just loosen the supply curve and up up up the money supply robertson says we looked at it based on first principles and said this is different we think this could lead to an inflationary outbreak and that s exactly what s happened what happens next for all the problems the global economy and financial markets are grappling with now lazard s not currently betting on a recession reflecting on lazard s response during the gfc he says we sat down as a team and came up with two likely scenarios and they were called fire and ice we were either going to have an outbreak of inflation pump priming the economy to inflate away the debt problem or you were just going to bore it out with low levels of economic growth low deflationary levels robertson says we got something in the middle in 2007 when central banks did a remarkable job of keeping the world out of the danger it could ve fallen into but they really just kicked the problem down the road the big risk of us infrastructure in infrastructure that means they ve tilted the portfolio away from the us particularly the utilities space toward europe the uk specifically and australia this leads to an important point about the role of infrastructure within investment portfolios as robertson emphasised earlier he believes every investor should have some exposure to it but he says a blanket assumption that listed infrastructure provides inflation protection is a furphy you must understand how infrastructure is translated through regulatory concerns and concession toll increases to investors there are subtle nuances that are incredibly important today robertson says there s a key difference in the way regulators in the us and other developed markets in europe the uk and australia control the nominal rate of returns of infrastructure assets in the uk and australia there is explicit inflation protection the hard numbers of the retail pricing index uk and consumer pricing index australia is used to set these rates of return but that s not the case in the us where the regulator decides what is the right return allowable for regulated utilities robertson believes this has created a situation where us utilities have been over earning for most of the last decade also driven by a belief that bond yields will stay low forever we think us investors will stop paying historically high multiples for these utilities they were traditionally trading on 12 13 times earnings but last couple of years they ve traded on 20 times he says why because the regulator was giving them a 10 return and the investment community was saying that s only 2 risk free that s a free lunch so we re going to bid these stocks up this is why he expects a big de rating lies ahead for us utilities and it s why lazard s infrastructure funds have only a 10 allocation to us utilities compared with around 50 for most other infrastructure portfolios and sector specific indices where is lazard infrastructure investing assets in europe particularly the uk and some in australia are where lazard has been emphasising its capital allocation but on the latter he notes the wave of takeovers in the last 12 months has been reducing the number of local investment options most recently sydney airport was in april sold to a consortium led by us private equity firm kkr this followed the sale of energy infrastructure firm spark infrastructure at the end of 2021 this is a global phenomenon robertson refers to research that shows pe firms have amassed a us 250 billion war chest to invest in infrastructure assets and he suggests this sum is more like us 500 billion once debt reserves are included we ve seen a lot of activity and i think that will continue but there are also many infrastructure assets globally that could be privatised and that s something europe and the uk have embarked upon and the us did it around 100 years ago the biggest issue is political will and whether governments are prepared to sell assets to foreigners that s the biggest issue that they face value opportunities still exist but given the issues discussed they re becoming increasingly hard to find as robertson explains its why the lazard global infrastructure fund is concentrated holding 27 companies as of the end of may one of the top holdings he calls out is spanish tollroads operator ferrovial which robertson says is considered a diversified infrastructure owner around 80 of the firm s value lies in four assets with a tollway in ontario canada one of the largest and this is the closest thing to a monopoly you would ever wish to see he says some 88 years remain on the concession lease and there are only minimal restrictions on toll increases as long as it doesn t double tolls inside of six months it can charge whatever it wants to whoever comes robertson says ferrovial also owns three motorways in fort worth texas that are dynamically tolled which means the toll price rises as roadway congestion builds it s a great asset that we think is underappreciated when you look at the world through our lens we think they re unique assets and on conservative assumptions it s inexpensive robertson says managed fund lazard global listed infrastructure fund alternative assets view never miss an insight if you re not an existing livewire subscriber you can

menafn caribbean news global by tobias adrian fabio natalucci and mahvash s qureshi the imf s global financial stability report introduced in 2002 was a step toward a more comprehensive assessment of risks in financial markets and cross border capital flows twenty years ago the imf released its inaugural global financial stability report to strengthen surveillance of financial markets after a series of crises in emerging market economies and the dot com bust this semiannual publication by the monetary and capital markets department has since evolved through years of seismic shifts in the global economic and financial landscape into one of our key multilateral surveillance tools along with the world economic outlook and the fiscal monitor this flagship report aims to foster international monetary and financial stability the beginning monitoring the health and outlook of the global economy and member countries is the bedrock of the fund s work this surveillance role outlined in amendments to our articles of agreement first adopted at the 1944 bretton woods conference charges us with overseeing and safeguarding the international monetary system in the early years surveillance focused on the macroeconomic and exchange rate policies of member nations but growth in international banking in the early 1970s highlighted a need to better track global capital markets and assess financial stability implications consequently the fund started discussions with monetary authorities in major financial centers and in 1974 initiated internal reports on market developments and prospects starting in 1980 the report known as international capital markets became our main vehicle to monitor conditions in financial markets warn of risks and analyze disruptions like latin america s debt crisis of the 1980s or europe s exchange rate mechanism crisis in the early 1990s but that era s rapid expansion and integration of global capital markets and the ensuing financial crises in asia and several other emerging markets highlighted the need to better assess systemic risks the introduction of the global financial stability report marked an important step toward a more comprehensive and frequent assessment of cross border capital flows and financial market risks in his forward to the first gfsr the then managing director horst köhler noted how the report had its roots in crisis the rapid expansion of financial markets has underlined the importance of a constant evaluation of the private sector capital flows that are the engine of world economic growth but sometimes at the core of crisis developments as well he wrote opportunities offered by the international capital markets for enhancing global prosperity must be balanced by a commitment to prevent debilitating financial crises turning point the gfsr has since focused on identifying cyclical and structural vulnerabilities in the bank and nonbank sectors of advanced and emerging market economies the risks they pose and the policy options to mitigate these risks vulnerabilities such as leverage tend to build up when financial conditions are easy and investor risk appetite is strong and in times like that our stability reports place more emphasis on potential threats we see building one of the most pivotal moments for the gfsr arrived in 2007 when contagion from the us housing slump shook the world s economies and markets in a tightly integrated world the global financial crisis underscored just how critical it is to better connect the dots between institutions sectors and countries since then the fund has increased its efforts to analyze and understand interlinkages and systemic risks cross border interconnectedness and spillovers and the role of macroprudential policies in strengthening financial system resilience in recent years we have adopted a conceptual framework for more systematic assessment and monitoring of financial stability risks it centers around vulnerabilities that amplify negative shocks creating an adverse feedback loop between falling asset prices and tightening financial conditions deleveraging by financial firms and weakening economic activity the empirical implementation of the framework relies on two tools a broad set of key vulnerability indicators for the financial and real sectors such as debt servicing capacity and the ratio of liquid assets to short term liabilities that can serve as intermediate targets for macroprudential policies such as capital buffers and liquidity coverage ratios and an aggregate measure of how financial stability risks could affect expected global economic activity which we call growth at risk these tools are complementary for monitoring and policymaking purposes as a granular analysis of specific exposures provides the necessary nuance and depth to the summary measure of threats to economic growth the gfsr has also actively called for an overhaul of the international regulatory landscape to address the gaps revealed by the global financial crisis in addition it has backed strengthening oversight of nonbank financial institutions which have taken on a bigger role in intermediation since the crisis and could make the system more vulnerable constant vigilance though we have made progress the continuous evolution in global financial markets not least because of the dizzying pace of technological innovation is always introducing new vulnerabilities and risks that demand constant vigilance for instance the advent of fast and highly sophisticated computer technology has facilitated the growth of high frequency trading which can improve market efficiency but can also be a source of market instability other emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and distributed ledger are revolutionizing financial markets through fintech and crypto assets that carry opportunities but also fundamental risks that the gfsr is bringing to the fore climate change poses another stability threat that we are increasingly analyzing along with the role that sustainable finance and the private sector can play in fostering a green transition and now as our recent reports have highlighted the enduring pandemic and war in ukraine have further compounded financial risks by exacerbating pre existing fragilities contributing to the greatest inflationary pressures in decades and confronting international capital markets with greater risk of fragmentation more than ever rapid technological change as well as frequent and varied shocks make our surveillance crucial for safeguarding international monetary and financial stability in order to promote growth and inclusion and it s increasingly clear that to do so we must constantly adapt and sharpen our tools for assessing risk to better scan the global financial landscape and strengthen its resilience
alex mills president joe biden proposed a 90 day suspension of the federal gasoline tax this week and it was promptly met with skepticism by many members of congress and economists it s an idea that has been around for many years former president obama called it a gimmick in 2008 the proposal which must be enacted by the u s house and senate is estimated to lower gasoline prices by about 3 at today s price however gasoline prices were already retreating according to the wall street journal american drivers are starting to buy less gasoline as they feel the economic burden of record prices that continue to hover near 5 a gallon the wsj reported this week in the first full week of june gasoline sales at u s stations were down about 8 2 compared with the same week last year the 14th consecutive week that sales have lagged behind 2021 levels according to surveys by energy data provider opis the president accused oil companies of not increasing drilling and oil production on wednesday however data from the baker hughes rig count shows the number of drilling rigs has increase 54 in the u s from 470 a year ago to 740 this week oil production has increased too energy information administration data puts u s oil production up 700 000 barrels per day or 6 as of march the most current production figures available president biden claimed oil companies were greedy because they were using capital to buyback their stock rather than using capital for exploration and production the market typically perceives a buyback as a positive indicator for a company and the share price often shoots up following a buyback according to investopedia a firm s management is likely to say that a buyback is the best use of capital at that particular time after all the goal of a firm s management is to maximize return for shareholders and a buyback typically increases shareholder value investopedia stated biden also criticized refiners he wants refineries to produce more gasoline but refineries in the u s which have maximum capacity of around 17 million barrels per day are working at 94 capacity american oil producers and refiners were not the only targets on wednesday he blamed vladimir putin too for raising oil prices actually putin did not raise oil prices prices increased following the implementation of sanctions by the u s president biden and other countries on oil produced in russia following the invasion of ukraine in february the sanctions on russian oil indicated to global oil traders that supplies of oil were going to be reduced and demand was going to continue upward when supply weakens and demand strengthens prices escalate president biden never talked about supply and demand issues during his announcement wednesday his negative comments about an american industry and even accusing their business practices as being un american are counterproductive biden should embrace american workers and encourage them instead of threatening them with additional rules and regulations alex mills is the former president of the texas alliance of energy producers
washington remains split over whether his election disinformation campaign file a series of blockbuster congressional hearings that have shocked americans with eye popping allegations of a plot by donald trump to steal the 2020 election went on a break this week as investigators began taking stock of new evidence legal experts say the damning testimony against trump provided by figures from the republican political establishment over the last two weeks have amply confirmed a pattern of presidential misconduct that led inexorably to the january 6 2021 insurrection but washington remains split over whether his election disinformation campaign and intense pressure on local officials and poll workers to overturn his defeat to joe biden amount to prosecutable crimes with no more public presentations expected until mid july here are some key takeaways from the committee s first five hearings the story so far with the committee attempting to distill documents and testimony from 1 000 plus witnesses the hearings could easily have been messy instead it has been able to tell a credible compelling and straightforward story about a desperate politician unable to accept defeat and resorting to extreme measures to cling to power across five hearings dealing with different aspects of the plot the committee has shined a light on what it describes as a seven step conspiracy directed by trump in short they are trump s election fraud disinformation campaign his effort to corrupt the justice department his intense pressure campaign on pence his bullying of state officials his legal team s effort to create fake slates of electors his assembling and directing the january 6 insurrectionists and his refusal to call off the mob as it rioted at the capitol for hours other falls from grace it s not just trump who has seen his reputation hit by allegations of mendacity illegal conduct or plain old incompetence his attorney rudy giuliani was once a widely respected mayor of new york but became a figure of ridicule as he pushed his boss s stolen election fantasies in a series of eccentric media appearances witnesses said trump was persuaded by giuliani to falsely declare victory on election night throwing america into crisis after the advisor had spent one of the biggest evenings of his boss s life getting drunk the mayor was definitely intoxicated but i do not know his level of intoxication when he spoke with the president trump campaign strategist jason miller said there was bad publicity for a host of opportunists who had insinuated themselves into trump s orbit hoping to advance their careers including jeffrey clark the former president s one time attorney general choice turned fbi suspect other figures with possible criminal exposure include john eastman the architect of the alleged conspiracy and six of trump s closest allies in congress who asked to be put on a white house pardon list unlikely darling of the left it s hard to believe that wyoming congresswoman and republican scion liz cheney was being lined up as the party s first female house speaker a little over a year ago the daughter of former vice president dick cheney is now a pariah in her home state and in washington after committing the heresy of joining the leadership of the panel investigating trump an unexpected corollary of the hearings is that the politician with one of the trumpiest voting records in congress has been claimed by many democrats as one of their own while her conservative political philosophy hasn t actually changed since she became a target of the right she is courting democrats in wyoming to briefly change affiliation and vote for her in the august republican primary heroes but just for one day with the exception of a handful of private citizens the witnesses who have damned trump with their matter of fact apolitical testimony have all been republicans most were tapped for administration and campaign positions by trump and some are still supporters giving the lie to accusations that the investigation is a democratic witch hunt senior officials from the justice department state governments white house trump campaign and vice presidents office have been described as heroes for speaking out critical commentators have noted however that none was willing to stand up and be counted during trump s second impeachment before politicians the media and the public lionize those who have assisted the committee they might consider the cavalcade of republicans who could have stopped this well in advance of january 6 2021 and chose not to political analyst jennifer rubin wrote in the washington post what happens next thursday s hearing on trump s campaign to co opt the entire justice department into his scheme to stay in office will be the last until the second week in july at the earliest investigators say they have a trove of evidence to sift through that came in as the hearings were underway including hundreds of leads from a tip hotline and hours of footage of trump and his family filmed for a documentary the july hearings are expected to focus on the far right groups that led the violence at the capitol and

following up on what allahpundit wrote earlier it s easy to lose sight of what s happening up in maine but plenty of mainers are clearly hopping mad about the overturning of roe v wade and they re not venting their anger at the supreme court or at least not all of their anger they are launching broadsides against senator susan collins who curiously enough is not an opponent of abortion they are blaming her for putting brett kavanaugh and neil gorsuch on the bench enabling the final decision in dobbs some are demanding an apology while others are calling for her resignation associated press some opponents took to name calling and attacked collins for being naive or complicit others called for her resignation university of maine professor amy fried said collins helped make this happen and the maine democratic party said part of the blame lies at collins feet sen susan collins was blasted friday for the overturning of roe v wade as opponents targeted her votes to confirm two justices to the supreme court who were in the majority opinion allowing states to ban abortion while this isn t the main issue here it s worth noting that 49 other senators voted for kavanaugh and any one of them could have derailed his nomination if they had chosen to do so i understand that collins is their senator so she s an obvious target but the point remains as for gorsuch he received 54 votes so collins couldn t have blocked him anyway the bigger concern in this debate is whether or not kavanaugh gorsuch or coney barrett actually lied during their confirmation hearings as many are now accusing them of doing collins herself quickly blasted kavanaugh and gorsuch for misleading her both during the hearings and in private meetings she took with them while considering their nominations collins voted against barrett so that point is off the table there s a lot of misinformation and misleading descriptions making the rounds this weekend when it comes to what the justices did or didn t say during their confirmation hearings media talking heads and high ranking democrats are repeating the accusations of lying and misleading the senate but the transcripts of the justices confirmation hearings say otherwise at heritage foundation tom jipping has pored through the actual transcripts and found that the answers that all three associate justices gave when being asked about roe and casey were not only consistent but they followed the stock answers given by virtually all justices nominated by presidents from both parties when they are asked to comment on past rulings or predict how they might vote on hypothetical future cases he notes that some of the most inflamed accusations have come from democrats including kirsten gillibrand of new york she is quoted as saying several supreme court justices including justice alito stated during their confirmation hearings that they would not overturn roe v wade she goes on to expand on that claiming that they said they would actually preserve roe as jipping goes on to document this is complete and utter malarkey as joe biden would say none of them including the most recent three members to join the court ever said any such thing no supreme court nominee has ever come close to saying any such thing about any precedent in fact for decades nominees of both parties have studiously avoided giving even what justice ruth bader ginsburg described in her 1993 hearing as hints forecasts previews transcripts of those hearings which are available here here and here show exactly what the justices said and expose how accusations of lying are pure fiction republican nominees have carefully duplicated the sotomayor kagan strategy during gorsuch s march 2017 hearing for example he told sen al franken d mn that obergefell v hodges holding that the constitution protects a right to same sex marriage is absolutely settled law similarly gorsuch told sen richard blumenthal d ct that griswold v connecticut and eisenstadt v baird which created and extended a constitutional right to use contraception are precedents of the u s supreme court that have been settled he told sen chris coons d ct that casey lawrence v texas which created a right to same sex sodomy and obergefell are all settled law in the sense that decision of the u s supreme court entitled to the weight of precedent jipping notes the way that both kagan and sotomayor used the phrases precedents of the court and settled law when being asked about favorite democratic targets such as citizens united chuck schumer and the democrats were not put off by those answers because they all knew what they meant settled law means that the law is currently settled based on the precedents established by previous court decisions but that does not indicate any sort of contract suggesting that the law might not become unsettled in the future and the supreme court has overturned many of its precedents over the years with a mixed bag of results do any of these accusers want to suggest that dred scott shouldn t have been overturned all of the current justices nominated by both republicans and democrats have refused to make predictions about how they might vote on hypothetical future cases they are trained to do that when preparing for their confirmation hearings jipping offers a plethora of examples so these current accusations of lying by people who were unhappy with the most recent decision should ring hollow

americans were taking stock a day after the supreme court overturned a woman s constitutional right to an abortion as states began implementing bans and supporters and foes of abortion rights mapped out their next moves the depth of emotion unleashed by friday s decision led to protests and prayer vigils across the country with arizona lawmakers even hiding in a basement for a time while police fired tear gas into a crowd in charleston west virginia at least 200 abortion supporters gathered on friday night for a candlelight vigil in front of the federal courthouse after the state s last abortion clinic was forced to cancel all of its appointments katie quinonez executive director of women s health centre of west virginia told the crowd she threw threw her phone against the wall of her office when she learned that roe v wade had been overturned after almost 50 years her staff called 70 patients scheduled over the next month to tell them that their abortion was cancelled and we would have to send them out of state and that was it quinonez vowed that the fight for abortion rights will continue this is not the end whatsoever tonight we mourn we rage tomorrow we get to work in arizona thousands of demonstrators split between those who support and oppose abortion rights gathered outside the state capitol on friday night police fired tear gas to disperse anti abortion demonstrators who banged on the glass doors of the senate building and lawmakers rushing to complete their 2022 session huddled briefly in a basement clinics in arizona stopped performing abortions after the decision as did those in alabama arkansas kentucky missouri south dakota west virginia and wisconsin women considering abortions already had been dealing with a near complete ban in oklahoma and a prohibition after roughly six weeks in texas in ohio a ban on most abortions from the first detectable fetal heartbeat became law when a federal judge dissolved an injunction that had kept the measure on hold for nearly three years another law with narrow exceptions was was triggered by the ruling in utah and went into effect mississippi s only abortion clinic which was at the centre of the case before the supreme court continued to see patients on friday outside men used a bullhorn to tell people inside that they would burn in hell clinic escorts wearing colourful vests used large speakers to blast tom petty s i won t back down at the protesters the ruling is likely to lead to abortion bans in roughly half the states and people on both sides of the issue predicted the fight would continue in minnesota where abortion remains legal gov tim walz signed an executive order to help shield people seeking or providing abortions in his state from facing legal consequences in other states in neighbouring south and north dakota the supreme court ruling triggered respectively an immediate abortion ban and one that takes effect in 30 days walz also has vowed to reject requests to extradite anyone accused of committing acts related to reproductive health care that are not criminal offenses in minnesota my office has been and will continue to be a firewall against legislation that would reverse reproductive freedom he said in fargo north dakota the the state s sole abortion provider plans to move across the river to minnesota red river women s clinic owner tammi kromenaker said on saturday that she has secured a location in moorhead but gave no further details thirteen states mainly in the south and midwest already had laws to ban abortion in the event roe was overturned another half dozen states have near total bans or prohibitions after six weeks before many women know they are pregnant in roughly a half dozen other states including west virginia and wisconsin the fight will be over dormant abortion bans that were enacted before roe was decided in 1973 or new proposals to sharply limit when abortions can be performed wisconsin s democratic gov tony evers told the associated press on saturday that he will support legal action to overturn a 173 year old state abortion ban he also said he would not appoint district attorneys who would enforce the law and would commute prison sentences for anyone convicted under it we re looking at everything he said four years after winning election by a narrow margin evers said he believes this issue will energise independents and he hopes to translate anger over roe s demise into votes this fall any time you take half the people in wisconsin and make them second class citizens i have to believe there s going to be a reaction to that evers said
the soon to be undisputed e cig leader is on a roll the food and drug administration fda is trying to remove one of the biggest most popular electronic cigarettes from the market opening the way for its rival to become the unassailable leader in smoking alternatives although the regulatory agency delivered what appeared to be a death blow to juul labs by rejecting its marketing application for the juul device and requiring it to take all its products off store shelves juul won a temporary reprieve from an appeals court which stayed the order until it can decide on the merits of the case juul is partially owned by tobacco giant altria mo 0 24 which acquired a 34 stake in the e cig maker in 2018 for 12 8 billion if juul cannot convince a court that the fda s decision is arbitrary and capricious and lacks substantial evidence as it contends in its filing with the u s court of appeals for the d c circuit it will be a knockout punch for what at one time was the dominant e cig that may ultimately lead to bankruptcy it would be an inglorious end to this one time high flier that saw its fortunes falter as it came under fda scrutiny for increased teenage e cig usage but one that would open the gates for altria rival british american tobacco bti 0 38 to virtually own the market with its vuse e cig hail to the new king juul had been the undisputed e cig leader with a near 80 share of the market but the fda hammered the company over its design marketing and ingredients which it alleged induced teenagers to take up vaping the agency cracked down hard on the e cig industry including retailers by targeting illegal sales to underage users the fda also banned all flavored e cigs despite their popularity with adults because teens also liked them juul responded by launching a 30 million marketing campaign against teen vaping and came out in support of raising the legal age to buy tobacco but the drumbeat of negative press surrounding the device took a toll on sales juul s market share evaporated and vuse surpassed juul for the first time earlier this year the latest nielsen data puts vuse s share at 35 1 compared to 33 1 for juul third place njoy is far behind the leaders with a comparatively microscopic 3 1 share while njoy and other e cig makers will undoubtedly pick up a few juul users after the device has been banned it is british american s vuse brand that will almost certainly be crowned the indomitable king of e cigs defeating all comers british american tobacco is on a roll last year it secured a u s international trade commission ruling that philip morris international s pm 0 28 iqos heated tobacco device infringed on its patents and that device was prohibited from being imported and sold in the u s altria had partnered with philip morris the global e cig leader to market and distribute iqos in the u s it had already introduced it into three states and was planning to roll the device out nationally by the end of last year but the itc ruling put the kibosh on those plans because altria had also previously shelved its own markten brand of e cigs in favor of joining forces with philip morris it is the only major tobacco company with no e cig device of its own to sell and the fda has all but wiped out the rest of its investment in juul as of the end of the first quarter altria has reduced the fair value of its juul position to just 1 6 billion if the fda is successful in killing off juul british american tobacco will essentially have no roadblocks in its way to market dominance a profitable venture vuse turned profitable in the u s for british american in the second half of last year and it s been able to grow its share because it discounted the device and the consumables to attract users earlier this month it said it was now ready to raise prices on both which with a major competitor removed from the market should give the tobacco stock a big boost in profits vapor revenue grew 59 last year to 927 million british pounds while its own heated tobacco products marketed under the glo brand saw a 46 rise in sales to 853 million british pounds while british american still generates 85 of its revenue from cigarettes and other combustible products the smoking alternative segment is its fastest growing business now that the fda has crowned it king of electronic cigarettes look for vapor and heated tobacco sales to build a deep competitive moat that few rivals may be able to cross

by doug french via mises it seems a short leap from robinhood or coinbase to a ponzi scheme investing is simple here robinhood s website leads start building your portfolio with just 1 scroll down a bit on coinbase com and it says take control of your money charles ponzi himself called a wizard of finance in 1920 was the discoverer of wealth and happiness common folk cheered the dapper five foot two inch italian while lining up desperate to hand ponzi their savings and earn a 50 percent return in forty five days get rich quick schemes never go out of style robbing peter to pay paul excels in its simplicity forget gauging the winds of the markets or the bouncing ball on a roulette wheel phony promises work on a gullible public to this day we are all gamblers ponzi believed we all crave easy money and plenty of it if we didn t no get rich quick scheme could be successful get rich quick promoters generally take a wholesale approach to generating wealth mitchell zuckoff wrote in his book ponzi s scheme the true story of a financial legend when critical masses of people have ostensibly prospered their friends and neighbors come running setting off a financial frenzy in 2017 with the public suffering from the effects of the federal reserve s financial repression las vegas attorney matt beasley and former pharmaceutical salesman and mortgage loan officer jeffrey judd cooked up a scheme that enticed investors into funding investments in personal injury settlement contracts that offered high returns as with all ponzi schemes there was the appearance of something legal just as in the case of ponzi who was to trade international reply coupons arbitraging foreign currencies with investor money katelyn newberg reporting for the las vegas review journal in mid april wrote that by march of this year at least 449 million from more than 600 investors flowed into the scheme through a beasley law group bank account the amount of the fraud and the number of investors will no doubt increase after all just three weeks before newberg reported the scam totaled 300 million the number of lawsuits will continue to grow as duped investors sue promoters who sold them on the phony settlement contracts ponzi schemes since the days of ponzi himself metastasize through the use of promoters who take a cut of the return to funnel more money into the scheme what begins as a 50 percent return is trimmed to 40 and eventually to 7 5 percent as more sales commissions are paid the confident ponzi even panicked when luring his first investor ettore giberti a conservative grocer what it took to land the giberti was making the grocer his first salesman at 10 percent of whatever money he brought in promoters of the settlement schemes didn t peddle the scam in dark alleys or on abandoned street corners most investors were mormons living across the western u s according to the wall street journal ben foldy writes mr judd and several of the marketers also identified as mormons in one taped chat a marketer said he thought of spreading the investment opportunity as a way to build up the church according to news reports the church didn t receive much as the cash went to acquiring a private jet millions of dollars worth of real estate in nevada and utah and top end cars including a rolls royce dawn two bentley continental gts a porsche taycan an aston martin vantage and a 500 000 rv in 1920 ponzi purchased a locomobile for 1 000 cash above the 12 600 sticker price to outbid a new york financier for the fancy automobile for the same price a man could own twenty model t s with enough change to buy a modest house wrote zuckoff ponzi s scheme started in the italian enclaves then spread throughout boston s irish jewish armenian polish swedish and brahmin neighborhoods as part of the beasley and judd ponzi scheme licensed las vegas cpa mark a murphy instead of pushing a pencil pushed phony settlements virtually from the beginning the canny and charming accountant has tried to get out ahead of his legal problems by suing beasley judd and their entities in his motion he described the scheme in 2017 judd told me that he and matthew beasley beasley an attorney had started a company together where they would provide financial assistance to people who were suffering from various types of injuries in which an attorney was working toward obtaining monetary settlements from insurance companies a scammed investor suing murphy still a licensed cpa in good standing in nevada was promised only 7 5 percent every ninety days meaning murphy was skimming plenty off the top of the settlements which all seemed to be slip and fall cases with 200 000 settlements in his wsj story foldy pointed out that a study by three academics that looked at thousands of settlements found the median post settlement financing for a major industry lender was 6 000 per case foldy wrote the contracts were said to provide a 12 5 payout after a loan was repaid in 90 days they were sold as risk free in the court filing against murphy jongeward further represented that the company was at 20 000 contracts successfully closed with zero defaults the state of nevada caught wind of murphy s chicanery in summer 2021 putting him under investigation this didn t deter the accountant as he continued to promote the settlement scheme and accept investor money until the fbi raided beasley s residence in march when the agents rang his doorbell beasley in a move straight out of a hollywood crime flick as the new york post reported put his pistol to his temple he then swung his arm pointing the gun at the agents who shot him twice he closed the door and holed up for four hours before emerging with two gunshot wounds to his chest agents arrived a few days after nate anderson of hindenburg research a wall street firm that investigates potential frauds at public companies set up a sting outing judd beasley and their known confederates anderson got his start investigating ponzi schemes and worked with harry markopolos bernard madoff s nemesis for years before madoff s scheme blew up we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us a hindenburg partner had a friend mark holt who was judd s classmate mr holt a former tech executive who now runs a private jet charter company told the j j marketers he had a large sum to invest foldy wrote he flew to las vegas on a chartered private jet secretly wired by hindenburg with microphones and cameras to meet with j j marketers holt then spoke with judd on the phone the conversation was taped judd and his marketers had said they hadn t had a default in sixteen thousand contracts hindenburg consulted with professors who said the default rate on these types of contracts was around 1 for j j to have zero losses on 16 000 contracts was statistically near impossible hindenburg figured foldy wrote judd s entity j j purchasing was not surprisingly formed in florida the sunshine state is the scam capital of the country according to the south florida sun sentinel doreen christensen wrote of 1 4 million frauds reported to the more than 210 000 consumers in florida made complaints with losses of more than 84 million that s up from 54 7 million in 2017 georgia and nevada rounded out the top three states reporting fraud per 100 000 in population hysterically j j purchasing offered investors promoters a code of ethics and business conduct dated october 15 2021 the company s mission is to operate consistent with the highest ethical business conduct both as to our relationships amongst each other and as it relates to our investors and all third parties this is our commitment to our investors and ultimately to the marketplace and so it

by and large market commentators now begrudgingly concede that the odds of a us recession occurring over the next 12 to 24 months are very elevated generally speaking though they stubbornly insist any downturn will be mild such wishful thinking is a spurious landmark we pass at this stage in the cycle before all hell breaks loose and both the economy and markets collapse that s according to socgen s albert edwards who on wednesday wrote that with both a recession and a market meltdown looming familiar phrases are returning to greet me like long lost friends one of those phrases is the contention that a recession assuming it occurs will be shallow another is the notion that stocks have already priced it in as you can imagine edwards doesn t agree with either it s not just that the atlanta fed s gdpnow tracker is sitting un comfortably on the flatline the leading indicators look grim as well edwards said citing the conference board and noting that ism has some catching down to do specifically to sub 50 contraction territory we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us he also mentioned last week s update to the new york fed s dsge model which produced unofficial forecasts that are considerably more pessimistic to quote researchers including marco del negro than they were just three months ago among other things the model now sees a not so soft landing characterized by negative growth this year and next figure below read more heisenbergreport com 2022 06 22 albert edwards gently warns of imminent collapse meltdown

2 2 reuters photo file police officers walk outside the us supreme court in washington us may 3 2022 reuters evelyn hockstein photo file 2 2 by lawrence hurley and andrew chung washington reuters the us supreme court on friday overturned the landmark 1973 roe v wade ruling that recognized women s constitutional right to abortion a decision condemned by president joe biden that will dramatically change lives for millions of women in america and exacerbate growing tensions in a deeply polarized country the court in a 6 3 ruling powered by its conservative majority upheld a republican backed mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy the vote was 5 4 to overturn roe with conservative chief justice john roberts writing separately to say he would have upheld the mississippi law without taking the additional step of erasing the previous roe altogether the reverberations of the ruling will be felt far beyond the court s high security confines potentially reshaping the battlefield in november s elections to determine whether biden s fellow democrats retain control of congress and signal a new openness by the justices to change other long recognized rights the decision will also intensify debate over the legitimacy of the court once an unassailable cornerstone of the american democratic system but increasingly under scrutiny for its more aggressively conservative decisions on a range of issues the ruling restored the ability of states to ban abortion twenty six states are either certain or considered likely to ban abortion mississippi is among 13 states with so called trigger laws to ban abortion with roe overturned for related graphic click in a concurring opinion that raised concerns the justices might roll back other rights conservative justice clarence thomas urged the court to reconsider past rulings protecting the right to contraception legalizing gay marriage nationwide and invalidating state laws banning gay sex the justices in the ruling written by conservative justice samuel alito held that the roe decision that allowed abortions performed before a fetus would be viable outside the womb which occurs between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy was wrongly decided because the us constitution makes no specific mention of abortion rights women with unwanted pregnancies in large swathes of america now may face the choice of traveling to another state where the procedure remains legal and available buying abortion pills online or having a potentially dangerous illegal abortion justice brett kavanaugh in a concurring opinion appeared to nix an idea advocated by some anti abortion advocates that the next step is for the court to declare that the constitution outlaws abortion the constitution neither outlaws abortion nor legalizes abortion kavanaugh wrote kavanaugh also said that the ruling does not let states bar residents from traveling to another state to obtain an abortion or retroactively punish people for prior abortions sad day biden condemned the ruling as taking an extreme and dangerous path it s a sad day for the court and for the country biden said at the white house the court has done what it has never done before expressly take away a constitutional right that is so fundamental to so many americans empowering states to ban abortion makes the united states an outlier among developed nations on protecting reproductive rights the democratic president added biden urged congress to pass a law protecting abortion rights an unlikely proposition given its partisan divisions biden said his administration will protect women s access to medications approved by the u s food and drug administration including pills for contraception and medication abortion while also combating efforts to restrict women from traveling to other states to obtain abortions britain france and some other nations called the ruling a step backward although the vatican praised it saying it challenged the world to reflect on life issues new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern said the decision was a loss for women everywhere watching the removal of a woman s fundamental right to make decisions over their own body is incredibly upsetting she said in a statement us companies including walt disney co at t n and facebook nasdaq parent meta platforms inc said they will cover employees expenses if they now have to travel for abortion services damaging consequences a draft version of alito s ruling indicating the court was ready to overturn roe was leaked in may igniting a political firestorm friday s ruling largely tracked this leaked draft the constitution makes no reference to abortion and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision alito wrote in the ruling roe v wade recognized that the right to personal privacy under the constitution protects a woman s ability to terminate her pregnancy the supreme court in a 1992 ruling called planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania v casey reaffirmed abortion rights and prohibited laws imposing an undue burden on abortion access friday s ruling overturned the casey decision as well roe was egregiously wrong from the start its reasoning was exceptionally weak and the decision has had damaging consequences and far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue roe and casey have inflamed debate and deepened division alito added the court s three liberal justices stephen breyer sonia sotomayor and elena kagan issued a jointly authored dissent whatever the exact scope of the coming laws one result of today s decision is certain the curtailment of women s rights and of their status as free and equal citizens they wrote as a result of friday s ruling from the very moment of fertilization a woman has no rights to speak of a state can force her to bring a pregnancy to term even at the steepest personal and familial costs the liberal justices added the ruling empowered states to ban abortion just a day after the court s conservative majority issued another decision limiting the ability of states to enact gun restrictions the abortion and gun rulings illustrated the polarization in america on a range of issues also including race and voting rights overturning roe was long a goal of christian conservatives and many republican officeholders including former president donald trump who as a candidate in 2016 promised to appoint justices to the supreme court who would reverse roe during his term he named three to the bench all of whom joined the majority in the ruling asked in a fox news interview whether he deserved some credit for the ruling trump said god made the decision crowds gathered outside the courthouse surrounded by a tall security fence anti abortion activists erupted in cheers after the ruling while some abortion rights supporters were in tears i m ecstatic said emma craig 36 of pro life san francisco abortion is the biggest tragedy of our generation and in 50 years we ll look back at the 50 years we ve been under roe v wade with shame hours later protesters angered by the decision still gathered outside the court as did crowds in cities from coast to coast including new york atlanta chicago denver los angeles and seattle house of representatives speaker democrat nancy pelosi a democrat denounced the decision saying that a republican controlled supreme court has achieved that party s dark and extreme goal of ripping away women s right to make their own reproductive health decisions the number of us abortions increased by 8 during the three years ending in 2020 reversing a 30 year trend of declining numbers according to data decline us abortions reverses showing rising need abortion supreme

monkeypox could soon have a new name after scientists called for a change to dispel stereotypes that africa is seen as a disease melting pot the world health organization announced last week that it was working with partners and experts from around the world to change the name of the monkeypox virus its clades and the disease it causes the monkeypox clades which represent different branches of the virus family tree have been particularly controversial because they are named after african regions last year the who officially named covid 19 variants after greek letters to avoid stigmatizing the places where they were first discovered just days before the who announced it would change the name of monkeypox a group of 29 scientists wrote a letter stating that a non discriminatory and non stigmatizing nomenclature for the virus is urgently needed the letter signed by several prominent african scientists called for the names of the west africa and central africa or congo basin monkeypox clades to be changed until a few months ago monkeypox was largely confined to west and central africa but since may a new version has spread across much of the world the signers of the letter suggested naming this version a new clade and giving it the placeholder label hmpxv for human monkeypox virus of the more than 2 100 monkeypox cases recorded worldwide this year 84 percent were in europe 12 percent in the americas and just 3 percent in africa according to the who s latest update last week no monkey disease oyewale tomori a virologist at redeemer s university in nigeria said he supports changing the name of the monkeypox groups but even the name monkeypox is different it s not the right name he told afp if i were a monkey i would protest because it s not really a monkey disease the virus was named after it was first detected in monkeys in a danish laboratory in 1958 but humans have contracted the virus primarily from rodents the letter pointed out that almost all outbreaks in africa have been caused by people who caught the virus from animals not other people but the current outbreak is unusual in that it spreads solely through human to human transmission said olivier restif an epidemiologist at the university of cambridge so it s fair to say that the current outbreak has very little to do with africa just as the waves and variants of covid 19 that are still plaguing us have little to do with the asian bats of which the virus originally came out a few years ago stigmatization of africa moses john bockarie of njala university in sierra leone said he agrees with the call to change the name of monkeypox monkeys are typically associated with the global south particularly africa he wrote in the conversation in addition there is a long dark history of comparing black people to apes no disease nomenclature should provide a trigger for this restif said it was important to emphasize that this debate is part of a larger issue with stigmatizing africa as a source of disease we saw it most clearly with hiv in the 1980s with ebola during the 2013 outbreak and again with covid 19 and the responses to the so called south african variants he told afp an african press group has also expressed its displeasure at the media use of images of black people alongside stories about the monkeypox outbreaks in north america and the uk we deplore the perpetuation of this negative stereotype that attributes misery to the african race and privilege or immunity to other races the foreign press association africa tweeted last month restif pointed out that the old stock photos of african patients used by western media usually show severe symptoms but the monkeypox that s spreading around the world is much milder which partly explains how easily it s transmitted he said the who will announce the new monkeypox names as soon as possible said its chief tedros adhanom ghebreyesus
but the creeping advances are dependent almost entirely on the expenditure of vast quantities of ammunition notably artillery shells which are being fired at a rate almost no military in the world would be able to sustain for long said the senior western official russia meanwhile is continuing to suffer heavy losses of equipment and men calling into question how much longer it can remain on the attack the official said officials refuse to offer a time frame but british prime minister boris johnson citing intelligence assessments indicated this week that russia would be able to continue to fight on only for the next few months after that russia could come to a point when there is no longer any forward momentum because it has exhausted its resources he told the german newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung in an interview ukrainian forces have been digging new defensive trenches in the eastern city of lysychansk in anticipation of a brutal battle with the russian military credit the washington post heidi levine russian commentators are also noting the challenges emphasising a chronic shortage of manpower russia does not have enough physical strength in the zone of the special military operation in ukraine taking into account the almost one thousand kilometre or more line of confrontation wrote russian military blogger yuri kotyenok on his telegram account he estimated that russia would need 500 000 troops to attain its goals which would only be possible with a large scale mobilisation of military men a potentially risky and unpopular move that president vladimir putin has so far refrained from undertaking the russian onslaught has already outlasted forecasts that russia s offensive capabilities would peak by the summer aggressive recruitment of contract soldiers and reservists has helped generate as many as 40 000 to 50 000 troops to replenish those lost or incapacitated in the first weeks of the fighting according to ukrainian officials russia has been hauling ancient tanks out of storage and away from bases across the vast country to throw onto the front lines in ukraine the russians still have the advantage over ukrainian forces who are suffering too ukrainian officials put the number of their soldiers killed in action at as many as 200 a day the ukrainians have also almost entirely run out of the soviet era ammunition on which their own weapons systems rely and are still in the process of transitioning to western systems but conditions for ukrainian troops are only likely to improve as more sophisticated western weapons arrive while those of russian forces can be expected to deteriorate as they dig deeper into their stocks of old outdated equipment said retired gen ben hodges a former commander of u s forces in europe who is now with the centre for european policy analysis at some point in the coming months the ukrainians will have received enough western weaponry that it is likely they will be able to go on the counteroffensive and reverse the tide of the war he said loading i remain very optimistic that ukraine is going to win and that by the end of this year russia will be driven back to the february 24

it has been a painful start to the year for investors global markets have lost 12pc in the past six months yet savers must make double digit returns if they want to prevent inflation which is forecast to hit 11pc this year eroding the value of their money relying on share price rises may not be enough instead investors should turn to dividends experts have advised emma mogford of the asset manager premier miton said at the moment the london stock market yields 3 5pc but if you look for funds that specialise in income paying stocks you could get a yield as high as 4pc if you hope to match inflation dividends have already achieved almost half of that for you suddenly you are less reliant on share price rises yields from investments have historically been comfortably ahead of inflation the most popular dividend focused investment trust sectors such as uk equity and bond income have delivered a yield of more than 4pc since 2017 and as much as 5 7pc in the first quarter of this year according to the association of investment companies darius mcdermott of the fund shop chelsea financial services said that over the past century reinvested dividends had been the main driver of investors returns dividends have made up around two thirds of total returns over the past 100 years he said it s true that the past decade has been driven by exciting growth investments in areas such as technology but the bigger picture tells us that old fashioned dividends are equally important ms mogford added that the london stock market looked particularly attractive for income investors we like industries such as housing and infrastructure for income she said for example the housebuilder barratt developments looks very appealing we think it will benefit from the government s levelling up agenda it pays a dividend yield of 7 2pc she also highlighted ibstock a brickmaker which yields 4 4pc

triple effect of declining stock markets low interest rates on bonds and unrelenting high inflation it s a troublesome time for all retirees as they are spending more to buy less goods and services a world bank report addressed the challenges faced by developing countries with numerous overlapping crises such as the ongoing impact of the pandemic climate change price increases food security a

spending at this time for retirees who invest in stocks now is not the time to panic and sell withdrawing funds from the stock market during a decline will sabotage future growth as more retirees are

sign up for daily news updates from cleantechnica on email or follow us on google news it used to be that leasing a car was a way for some people to drive more car than they could afford if they were to buy it outright and it allowed dealers to obscure lots of fees up charges and extras in the paperwork for all practical purposes the lease customer only cares about one thing the monthly payment one of the advantages was the person leasing the car could purchase it at the end of the lease period for a predetermined price a lot of people liked that degree of certainty leasing was good for dealers because it encouraged people to get a new car every two to three years instead of driving it until the wheels fell off it was a way of pumping up the market for new cars and provided a good supply of off lease cars for dealers to stock their used car lots with in other words everyone was happy but a funny thing happened thanks to the covid pandemic suddenly supply chain issues made new cars harder to come by which in turn drove up the price of used cars for those who had leased their vehicles they found they could make a handsome profit by buying the car for the agreed upon price at the end of the lease and then reselling at a profit sometimes a significant profit in the superheated used car market well if there s one thing the auto industry is good at it is maximizing the amount of money it realizes from every opportunity having private parties profit from being in the right place at the right time doesn t sit well with the industry they think of those profits as money that rightfully belongs to them so they have come up with a plan many new leases now prohibit lease customers from buying their cars when the lease is over tesla was one of the first companies to do this at first the policy applied only to model 3 sedans because in theory the company was going to make all those off lease cars the basis of its robotaxi fleet then early this year the word came down from on high that all leased teslas must now be returned to the company the mercurial mr musk may be raging in the press about the company losing billions but in fact the company is making a tidy profit reselling its off lease cars in the used car market musk and his minions are anything but dumb now autoweek reports that ford has sent a letter to its dealers eliminating the end of lease purchase option for the f 150 lightning mustang mach e and e transit van yup all 100 electric vehicles in the plainest language possible ford s new prohibition tells lessees you do not have the option to purchase the vehicle at the end of the lease term the change took effect on june 15 in 37 states and will be enacted in the remaining 14 states plus the district of columbia by the last quarter of this year cars direct was the first to catch wind of the new policy it s for your own good ostensibly the change is a step toward ford s pledge of carbon neutrality by 2050 and an industry wide effort to lower the msrps of evs the letter explained to dealers the purchase of the bev lease is to aid in our goal of delivering carbon neutrality by 2050 by controlling the vehicle battery through its life keeping it in the ford network ford motor company is committed to making battery electric vehicles bevs more sustainable and affordable for our customers by localizing the complex battery supply chain network creating recycling options for end of life vehicles and increasing u s battery production that last part may be the critical feature companies like redwood materials which has attracted a 50 million investment from ford are finding they can recover and recycle 95 of the chemicals and materials in an ev battery and use them to make new batteries the upshot is the company sees gold in them thar hills in the form of precious commodities that they want to control for themselves maybe there s nothing ulterior about that maybe if the world is to transition to battery electric cars there aren t enough raw materials available at affordable prices to manufacture as many as the world will need but then again maybe this is an extension of the paradigm shift that has happened with computer software in that shiny new ev of yours do you the customer own it or does the manufacturer continue to own it even though you paid the purchase price of the car when you bought it as the ev revolution rolls forward it seems we the consumers are only renting much of the vehicles we thought we are buying the programming belongs to the manufacturer and now much of the battery does too are we seeing a trend here last year gm and honda began mandating that lessees who wanted to sell their vehicles at the end of their leases had to sell them back to the automakers at the price in the lease contract if anyone was going to take advantage of a pressurized used car market it was the companies and not the customers ford reportedly has also informed its dealers that they may insert language into the sales contracts for f 150 lightning pickup trucks that prevents buyers from reselling the vehicles within 1 year of the original purchase date we don t know how many dealers are doing so but there are reports of nearly new evs crossing used car auction blocks at prices considerably more than the original purchase price something that makes dealers frown things are changing tesla shook up the automotive industry with its model of selling directly to customers over the internet something that dealer associations oppose with every fiber of their being they like to puff out their chests and tout the contributions they make to the community through little league and pop warner sponsorships and such but the truth is they have what amounts to a monopoly that should have been outlawed years ago ford itself has hinted that it might like to try a little of that online sales strategy itself it is simply too costly to have hundreds of unsold cars and trucks on dealer lots waiting for buyers to discover them so the relationship between manufacturers and dealers is coming under renewed scrutiny as well as everyone tries to figure out how to make money in the brave new world of electric cars interesting times for buyers dealers and manufacturers ahead please keep your seatbelt fastened until the ride comes to a complete stop have a tip for cleantechnica want to

as australia braces for another covid wave and continues to battle a cost of living crisis survivalists have shared their tips for shopping frugally and getting in touch with nature doomsday prepper trevor andrei told daily mail australia he s been inundated with calls asking for advice about how to save money he s spent most of his life preparing for all case scenarios fearing everything from nuclear war cyber attacks and natural disasters to new pandemic and even alien invasions mr andrei in his 40s runs the survival shop and lives on a property in rural victoria where he practices foraging and stores years worth of canned food and other non perishable items i teach people to prepare for all case scenarios but i m not here to be captain crazy it s just about self sufficiency mr andrei who last year featured in the abc documentary series prepping australia said does it actually take a pandemic to work out that when things are on special and in plentiful supply at half price that you should stock up doomsday prepper trevor andrei stores years worth of canned food and other non perishable items pictured doomsday preppers stock up for all case scenarios fearing everything from word war iii cyber attacks natural disasters another pandemic or even an alien invasion pictured some of the events preppers get ready for he claims to have warned about the risk of pandemics long before covid hit australia in march 2020 and argues his strange lifestyle is nothing new prepping has been around for thousands of years so putting grain in silos making aqueducts salting fish preserving food this is nothing new mr andrei said evidence cost of living is getting worse transport costs up 13 7 per cent fruit and vegetables up 6 7 per cent wholesale electricity prices up 141 per cent wholesale gas prices up 50 fold sources australian bureau of statistics australian energy regulator australian energy market operator advertisement most people don t even have a week s worth of food in their house and these are professionals who make good money the cost of food in australian has skyrocketed in 2022 with inflation now sitting at 5 1 per cent and expected to soar even higher massive government subsidy programs during the pandemic have sparked the increase with the issue exacerbated by surging oil prices following russia s invasion of ukraine in february fuel prices are now over 2 a litre on average nationwide record floods on the east coast of australia have also compounded the cost of living crisis choking the supply of many fresh vegetables including iceberg lettuce which is now selling for 11 a head in some parts mr andrei says those worried about rising prices should live like our grandparents used to go to farmer markets or supermarkets five minutes before they close and buy boxes full of vegetables at slashed prices and then go home and preserve them in jars mr andrei said i go to coles like everyone else but do you know when i go to coles when all the specials are on while the life of a prepper might be a step too far for some wilderness survival expert ky furneaux told daily mail australia that covid cemented this idea that the world is unpredictable and now people are looking to shake things up by getting back to nature ky furneaux pictured is not a doomsday prepper but said developing skills to live off the land is something everybody should get excited about the 48 year old pictured once survived 21 days in the us bayou with nothing but a machete as part of the discovery channel series naked and afraid the australian tv host and award winning stunt woman who has doubled for hollywood stars sharon stone anne hathaway jennifer garner and camilla belle is not a doomsday prepper but said becoming more self sufficient is something everybody should get excited about people are now more aware they could be thrown into a really unpredictable situation at some point in the future she said and of course during that time so many of us were just indoors so people are just looking for a way to shake things up and have an adventure the pandemic made people reassess what s actually important and i think fitness family and just getting outside were top of most people s list the 48 year old once survived 21 days in the us bayou with nothing but a machete as part of the discovery channel series naked and afraid and has also trekked 160km across the blistering hot sierra nevada mountains carrying only a pocket knife the australian tv host and award winning stunt woman pictured who has doubled for hollywood stars sharon stone anne hathaway jennifer garner and camilla belle furneaux said a horrific car crash when she was 19 inspired her to push herself to new limits after doctors told her she would never be physically able after breaking a bone in her back anyone can do this she said but my advice would be to take it slow you don t just want to head out into the bush with nothing for two weeks because you ll have a miserable experience but if you go outdoors well prepared can be a life changing experience she said a two hour hike for someone living in a major city is a good place to start the oxygen the trees and the views can give you energy and improve your mood and mindset but bring a snack a basic first aid kit and a couple of litres of water furneaux said a horrific car crash when she was 19 inspired her to push herself to new limits the pandemic caused an exodus of more than 70 000 people moving out of major cities for more affordable regional areas but some are choosing to live off the grid altogether it comes as australian scientists report the omicron ba 4 and ba 5 sub variants will dominate in coming weeks and will be the cause of rising infections recently the ba 2 sub variant of the omicron strain has dominated genomic testing but ba 4 and ba 5 appear to be taking over survivalist expert dr bradley garrett from the university college dublin said covid in australia kick started a doom boom and a massive interest in living an off grid bunker the bunker mentality is about resiliency dr garrett told news com au in 2020 so anyone who s spending a lot of time thinking about going off grid digging their own well going onto septic and disconnecting from infrastructure so that they can become more self sufficient that is completely a bunker mentality social

over the past 30 years more than 50 per cent of reefs have disappeared and more than 75 per cent are damaged another 40 per cet of the remaining coral may disappear in the next 30 years unless there is a global conservation rethink with every reef lost essential food protection and spawning grounds for marine life disappears and biodiversity decreases with coral on the wane across the globe the marine food chain is under strain and commercial fishing stocks are threatened anuar abdullah studied oceanography in florida and began looking at ways to regrow coral in the perhentian islands in malaysia in 1981 at first the 61 year old malaysian s efforts proved futile locals used to come and watch me on the beach tying bits of coral to rocks and they laughed for twenty years i observed the behaviour and life cycles of coral and at first i failed to grow coral but looking back i needed to fail many times to get it right in the end on land we have been planting growing and cultivating trees for thousands of years with coral we have only recently become aware in the last 35 years of the need to take action abdullah persevered and eventually came up with a new way to regrow coral we worked on reefs destroyed by typhoon hayan in the philippines in late 2013 which suffered 99 8 per cent damage but we still managed to bring the coral back anuar abdullah founder ocean quest i realised that artificial reefs are a mistake adding anything man made to the reef environment such as metal grids pvc piping or leather doesn t make sense as these structures eventually fall apart and are potentially poisonous they also cost money fabricating structures and transporting them to the sea and then placing them in the water is not cheap abdullah developed new techniques and methodologies that required no frames to be added to the marine environment instead he used lumps of dead coral to grow new coral back in the 1980s many reefs were suffering but the decline really picked up in the 1990s when southeast asian economies developed rapidly and when mass tourism started to make inroads businesses back then didn t think about sustainability and often built on top of reefs to extend available land now there s a growing awareness that the coral needs to be saved by 2010 abdullah had refined his technique and founded coral conservation group ocean quest initially active in malaysia the organisation soon began to work in thailand indonesia and the philippines and began taking on projects outside asia in 2017 as we are registered as a social enterprise we are primarily engaged in training we work with local stakeholders and we engage the local community on every coral reef rehabilitation project in fact we only work with governments if they come to us and ask us for help it is much easier working with resorts or associations of course our strategy depends on many factors not every reef is the same local climate and the amount of damage done play a role in how we work the measure of our success becomes apparent through how much a project is able to give back to the community and the environment ocean quest enters four year agreements with stakeholders the organisation then typically builds a coral nursery and trains local people to look after it and how to help the coral grow we take direct action without delay and work in hectares acres and square kilometers our approach is industrial we rehabilitate entire reefs we have developed a simple education system that allows the public to take part in coral reef rehabilitation and we apply this method everywhere we go we worked on reefs destroyed by typhoon haiyan in the philippines in late 2013 which suffered 99 8 per cent damage but we still managed to bring the coral back ocean quest currently runs 13 projects around borneo off the island s west coast on sepanggar island the local communities cut all the sea grass three years ago that grew along the coast line it had made the beaches look dirty as a consequence run off from monsoon rains washed straight into off shore coral reefs the filtering function of the sea grass gone the reefs silted up and died there s no point regrowing coral here unless we also regrow the sea grass we need to look at the bigger picture so we can develop a particular strategy for every situation we encounter so we re now engaged in two projects first regrow the sea grass then regrow the coral reefs die for a variety of reasons all of them man made on the opposite side of borneo at mabul island ocean quest was faced with an entirely different challenge the reef here has been overharvested by fishing with dynamite and poison in thailand abdullah initiated the rehabilitation of maya bay famous for having served as a location in leonardo dicaprio s the beach movie 2000 the thai government closed maya bay in 2018 after decades of mass tourism had destroyed the coral and alienated the resident reef sharks abdullah created a tourism sustainability strategy for the 300 metre long bay working with the national park and private stakeholders ocean quest developed a sustainable tourism strategy and initiated coral growth the bay reopened in spring 2022 with restrictions visitors are no longer aloud to swim and long tail boats are not allowed into the bay but visitor numbers were still too high and maya bay is closing again over the summer the national park largely followed our recommendations but they need to stay the course if maya bay is really to recover abdullah told eco business with large projects running near the red sea resort town hurghada in egypt and in french polynesia abdullah spends most of his time on the road he s particularly excited to travel to the mergui archipelago in the andaman sea off the coast of myanmar here coral grounds have been devastated by dynamite fishing and a resort island has asked ocean quest to take a look at what can be done to restore coral in the area in november ocean quest will be presenting its work at the 2022 united nations climate change conference cop27 in egypt to convey the urgency of coral conservation to a global audience after 40 years of research failure and success abdullah remains an optimist at heart although a fair amount of the ocean s paradise is broken ocean quest made it its purpose to tend to it and heal it through conservation

berlin germany to prevent large increases in food prices officials from g7 countries including germany and the uk will push for temporary waivers on biofuel mandates next week according to reuters a food versus biofuel debate has been ongoing due to the food crisis caused by the war in ukraine and in a bid to increase the supply of global grain and vegetable oil some policymakers are calling for an easing of mandates for blending biofuels into petrol and diesel we are quite keen to look at the issue of biofuel mandates to ensure that crops are prioritized for food consumption and not necessarily for use in fuels said a british government official as reported by reuters however whether there is wide support for a temporarily biofuel mandate waiver among g7 members which include canada france germany italy japan the uk and the u s is unclear surging oil and gas prices have also increased the demand for crop sourced energy the issue of biofuel mandates is at a preliminary stage of discussion at the working level said a spokesman for canada s agriculture ministry next week the group begin a three day meeting in germany with food security expected to be on the agenda amidst the launch of a global alliance for food security in may aimed at eliminating hunger it is not clear whether germany or britain are considering waivers on biofuel mandates in their domestic market these regulations really do need an off ramp during times of high food prices said joe glauber of the international food policy research institute adding that while a waiver on biofuel mandates could help bring down food prices it make fuel prices slightly higher in some countries as quoted by reuters he added that as corn based ethanol is more competitive than biofuel produced elsewhere in the world a waiver on biofuel mandates is not expected to have much impact on the u s industry though it would have a greater impact on europe environmental groups and some governments have raised concerns over biofuels contributing to record rates of cropland expansion including through deforestation and questioning their environmental benefits however most governments have included biofuels in plans to reduce carbon emissions biofuel producers and farmers are not expected to support a waiver on mandates
this post is also available in spanish french greek at the head of the office of the pilot plan to implement the universal basic income sergi raventós and his team are making progress in the design of an experiment that aims to reproduce as closely as possible what life would be like for a population in which everyone s basic needs are covered by sara babiker el salto diario the office of the pilot plan for the implementation of the universal basic income of the generalitat de catalunya overlooks the plaça de sant jaume from there its director sergi raventós and the team that makes it up can see what s going on in the street up close follow through the windows the different protests that converge in front of the building this office is indeed looking outwards but beyond that since it took off last autumn it has intensified its activity to gather all the data it needs on the municipalities and towns where an innovative pilot project will be implemented in a few months time with the team in place and an intense agenda of meetings behind them raventós takes stock of the first months of work and the path to follow in order to be able to put this experiment into practice with which they hope to obtain experience and information to base the political proposal for a basic income to this end they also have an advisory committee and are setting up a scientific committee and an ethical committee to ensure the content effectiveness and coherence of an initiative which they hope will be a firm step towards basic income as a reality how are you coming to the summer break after these first months of activity now is a time when you want to close issues and you have the feeling that you are not going to make it to the summer it s true that things are moving we feel that the pieces are falling into place some faster than others for example yesterday i had an important meeting on how the department that manages the benefits which is social rights is getting involved in this issue and can help us in everything this is a key issue because if we can move forward it will be among other things because the application the management of the pilot plan can be done for this we need professionals who are involved and with whom we can coordinate a couple of months ago you had a conference with key figures from other pilot schemes what did this conversation bring yes it was at the end of march april and several experts from pilot schemes participated it was good because the workshops were held with the aim of commenting on the different previous experiences and they also allowed us to see the different mistakes that have been made what things we should also take into account in terms of communication pedagogy and storytelling we were able to talk about all of this with these people who have been in canada finland and the united states trying out different pilot schemes these are experiences that have left a legacy from which lessons can be learned of course it is true that here in catalonia we are carrying out a very special pilot scheme a type of approach that is quite similar to what a basic income would be applied to a territory we are going to give 800 for adults and 300 for children under 18 to 5 000 people of these 5 000 2 500 will be in two municipalities they are small towns of a thousand or so inhabitants and then the rest will be chosen randomly throughout catalonia regarding the random part this is what has been done most previously at a global level on the other hand the fact that everyone will receive basic income in two municipalities is quite original the amount we are going to grant is also quite considerable and then the fact that we are not going to make any specific group here the unemployed people in poverty etc no no everybody is going to receive it as far as the random part is concerned we are looking at whether we can assign the basic income to complete cohabitation units so that all the people in the selected household receive a basic income we had the debate on whether we would do it with one person per household or whether we would provide the basic income to all members in the end the second option won out because we believe that this way the impact will be considerable here we will be able to find things like a young person being able to emancipate himself or a woman deciding that this is the time to leave to leave this guy or not otherwise with a basic income for a household of three or four people the basic income would be somewhat diluted in order to put this into practice the statistical institute of catalonia has to provide us with the data to see if we can really detect how many people live in each of the 800 000 households there are that s the slightly more complicated part i understand that a large part of the work now in addition to defining exactly what this basic income is going to be like is to establish dialogue and involve all the necessary institutions that s right in this sense the whole process ahead of us is very interesting but also very thorough and laborious on the one hand we have the dissemination of the pilot plan we are attending different localities both in catalonia and abroad we have held online meetings of course but we are also being invited in person i was in palma a few days ago a couple of weeks ago in almeria and next week there are people from the office who are going to freiburg here in catalonia we have held events in different places and we are going to do more on the other hand we are meeting with more or less important organisations from different fields children migration the third sector alternative trade unions and also comisiones obreras important organisations in catalonia such as òmnium or the anc and even caritas we are also coordinating with the different departments of the generalitat we are explaining the pilot plan to them but also asking for data for example in terms of education what indicators do you have on children dropping out of the school system or with the department of social rights what indicators are there at the social level in this way we intend to construct the base survey that we are going to have to draw up soon in order to be able to pass it on first to the whole population and then to the treatment and control group and thus be able to see what changes are produced i guess that mapping is central it is important to develop the indicators that we want to address issues related to debt poverty education and even issues related to people s autonomy data that will allow us to discern what they are going to spend their time on from now on with basic income or if they are going to have a different approach to the one they had without basic income if they have thought about the possibility of setting up a business if they are going to make less use of social services we think that all this information that we want to find out is the part that many pilot schemes have not been able to achieve that is to assess the impact of a basic income in a community where everyone receives basic income we are going to create a small microcosm of what a basic income applied to a territory would be like we will have two municipalities between one and the other there will have to be a separation so that they cannot be contaminated and all the people who are part of those municipalities will receive the basic income in reality it will be 90 because the richest 10 will not receive the income as we cannot make any kind of tax simulation because we do not have the instruments to do so what we are going to do is this kind of approach that from a certain cut off point which we will have to see if it is 40 000 or 40 odd thousand euros or whatever it is that the richest people will be left out it is also a way of showing the population that the richest people would have to contribute more money and therefore in terms of addition and subtraction they would lose out there will be a certain amount of expectation to get all these ideas off the ground when will the actual pilot start initially we were thinking of starting this december because we thought it would be an interesting message to start in the same year that the office started but then we decided to postpone taking into account the fact that fiscal years are better if they are whole years and the need to have a little more margin to be on the safe side we were also beginning to realise that we were not going to have enough time because one thing is the creation of the pilot plan office as a body but then the staff the technicians and technicians who form part of the office joined in february now we have a good team in this sense a marvel at the time i had to think a bit about which profiles were the most suitable in the end it is made up of a lawyer a database specialist a data analyst an economist a sociologist a communications colleague and an administrative technician with this team the truth is that things can already be managed processes can be advanced in this sense since the team has been in place we have been making progress on different fronts at a legal level at a data level it is true that we are already in june and there is less and less time left and nerves are increasing but it is also true that progress is being made how are you going to define the municipalities that will become this microcosm in which all people receive basic income we will have to analyse a database of municipalities we have more or less calculated that for the number of inhabitants we want for the pilot plan around a thousand a thousand and some inhabitants there are around 70 municipalities in catalonia that meet this requirement but of course of these 70 municipalities we have to start by ensuring that they are not very rich municipalities or extremely poor municipalities which in some way distorts the result in short that there are not too many biases from there we will draw lots once we have a pre selection of the municipalities that could be candidates there will be around 40 or 50 municipalities that also combine the rural service and industrial sectors that have schools that have a primary care centre if possible that have some kind of services which would also provide us with complementary data with all this at some point we will have to draw lots in front of a notary and while you are enthusiastically pursuing this project do you think the political will is there we have recently seen the passage of the basque ilp through parliament and how the political parties have killed a proposal that had gained a lot of popular support here unlike the basque ilp we are already in the government and in this sense we have the governing party esquerra on the one hand promoting the issue and on the other hand we have the cup which led to this agreement we will have to see what positions the other parties are taking in relation to the pilot plan for the moment they are waiting in the wings we will also encounter hostile sectors surely but the fact that we are working from the government makes it easier for us to reach important actors and corners from here we are calling on all kinds of entities from entities that work with immigrants to legal offices to people who work with homeless people or people living in poverty in short we have the possibility of being able to dialogue and debate the virtues of a basic income in 2020 when there was a brutal interruption of work the debate on basic income as a way of dealing with this reality gained force two years afterwards we are hearing about falling unemployment and the recovery of the labour market does this optimistic talk about work displace the question of basic income i think the basic income debate is here to stay in many respects the other day for example there was also a debate on prostitution in parliament and the cup member of parliament raised the issue that basic income could be a good proposal for sex workers here in catalonia some organisations from the third sector and the youth sector have also taken a stance regarding the issue of work we will also have to see what contracts are made if the labour market is really improving and if this really allows people to escape from situations of precariousness and poverty as we already know that there is a considerable percentage of people who are still working and are in a situation of poverty we are also coming from a time when we are talking a lot about mental health do you think that when this issue is addressed people s material situation is being taken into account and how measures such as a basic income could be used to tackle this crisis or other broader issues i see that basic income is making inroads in different sectors now i have the possibility to have perhaps a broader perspective from the office we have met for example with organisations that work in the environmental field and see it with sympathy with organisations that work in rural areas or farmers unions the unión de pageses for example who have understood perfectly well that this proposal could provide a response to many of the problems they have young people who leave the villages seasonal workers who work for a few months and then are left in the lurch because they can t accumulate enough time to claim unemployment benefit or even make it difficult for them to claim the guaranteed income of citizenship or the minimum living income in short you can see that basic income is of interest to young people who see that emancipation is becoming increasingly distant to women who also see the factor that it could mean for their emancipation to avoid toxic dependencies to people in the world of cooperatives who see how this tool would make it easier for them to move forward i think that basic income allows us to open up the focus more and not just focus on issues of people living in poverty or allowing material existence and that s it in two weeks the period for the signing of the european citizens initiative for a universal basic income which aims to take the proposal to the eu institutions and from there to the member states will end this is an initiative that started in september 2020 with some force but has fallen far short of its objective what is your assessment of this talking to activists we have agreed that there has certainly been a lack of important figures or people who have made the campaign visible and the media in general have not helped to publicise it i understand that there are very few signatures left to reach the minimum target in the kingdom of spain but overall we are still a long way from the million signatures needed i think that this is a debate that curiously enough may be gaining force at the territorial level we should also reflect on the dynamics that have caused the campaign to have such a limited reach in some countries it seems that in the end perhaps only three countries will achieve the minimum slovenia italy and the kingdom of spain which is on the doorstep and how do you gain force in the territories you have to look for example at dynamics such as the popular legislative initiative in the basque country in this case the 22 000 signatures needed for its ilp were easily obtained but it is possible that the 22 000 people who signed there may not have signed the european initiative it remains to be seen whether this mismatch is due to the fact that people see basic income as something more feasible at the territorial level than at the european level in any case i believe that the ilp in the basque country the pilot plan in catalonia and the european initiative have been three dynamics that have generated some debate it is important to continue to insist now for example in andalusia i also understand that adelante andalucía has already taken up the proposal and we will have to see if we are at a point where we can make a little more progress in the knowledge and dissemination of this possibility because we already know that the pilot plans are very good and can be a good channel for dissemination debate and analysis of the data that they can provide us with but we also know what their limitations are and so we also have to adjust our expectations above all mobilisation is necessary the social movements must continue to insist on the issue it cannot be that here in catalonia as the office of the pilot plan already exists that s it we do nothing more on the contrary i believe that the important thing here is to make progress in the debate and in the dissemination of basic income as a proposal that could provide a solution to many of the problems we face the original article can be found here

author andrew urquhart menafn the conversation bitcoin the original cryptocurrency remains a bellweather for the sector it hit an all time high of more than us 68 000 55 600 in november 2021 when the overall value of the cryptocurrency market was close to us 3 trillion in the months since however most major cryptocurrencies have fallen by more 70 and bitcoin itself has dropped below us 18 000 is this just another crash in the volatile cryptocurrency market or is this the beginning of the end for this alternative asset class when bitcoin was first introduced in early 2009 it was a new type of asset while trading was thin initially price appreciation drove its value to nearly us 20 000 in late 2017 this happened as more retail investors were drawn to cryptocurrencies as a supposed hedge or safe haven versus other asset classes and as the market grew so too did the range of investment opportunities futures and options financial contracts to buy or sell an asset or security at a specific price or date are a common hedging tool used in other markets such as oil or the stock market in december 2017 the first bitcoin futures on a regulated exchange were listed by the chicago board options exchange bitcoin options followed on the chicago mercantile exchange in january 2020 this period of expansion was topped by the launch of the first bitcoin exchange traded fund etf in october 2021 providing investors with exposure to bitcoin without having to buy it on a crypto exchange growing crypto acceptance at the same time the traditional financial sector was becoming increasingly accepting of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class a 2021 study of institutional investors found seven in 10 expected to buy or invest in digital assets in the future this combination of maturity and acceptance however also increased the correlation between the stock market and cryptocurrencies leading to a decline in their safe haven properties bitcoin was fairly disconnected from traditional financial markets in its early days but as it became just another asset the sector began to be affected by the same macroeconomic factors that influence traditional markets the us federal reserve s decision to raise interest rates by 0 75 in june to combat growing inflation the ongoing war in ukraine and the subsequent rise in oil prices have all acted as a drag on cryptocurrencies in recent months moves to regulate the sector have also had an impact but it isn t only macroeconomic factors that have caused this crypto downturn in may and june this year stablecoin values plummetted major cryptocurrency exchange binance paused bitcoin withdrawals due to a stuck transaction and lending platform celsius network froze withdrawals and transfers citing extreme market conditions amid this disruption users of public blockchain platform solana have reportedly voted to temporarily take control of a so called whale account the platform s largest at around us 20 million to stop the account owner liquidating its positions and driving prices down even further together these factors have caused investor confidence to drain from the sector the crypto fear greed index is almost at an all time low of 9 100 which indicates extreme fear the index was at 75 100 when bitcoin reached its november 2021 high an electronic board shows cryptocurrency diving during a trading session in seoul south korea 13 may 2022 yonhap epa efe the crypto outlook so what does the future hold for this alternative asset class as can only be expected in the cryptocurrency ecosystem the range of views is extreme some see this market correction as a great time to buy the dip others believe this is the end of the party for cryptocurrencies resolute bitcoiners can always find positive signs in the market and many use on chain metrics trading signals based on data gleaned from public blockchain transactions to determine good times to buy recently popular metrics including market value to realised value mvrv a ratio showing current versus average coin prices suggest bitcoin is about to start an accumulation period based on past history on the other hand this may be an indication of confirmation bias as investors search for signals that confirm their beliefs others argue this is just one more instance in a long line of bursting cryptocurrency bubbles a typical crypto market cycle comparisons with the dotcom crash of 2000 have been rife in the market but crypto enthusiasts argue the basic premise of dotcom stocks was correct in that the internet was the future they believe the same is true of bitcoin predicting that the sector will recover economists have studied bubbles for centuries however and evidence shows many assets never recover nominal price highs after the market bubble bursts some of these economists including former us secretary of labor robert reich have equated cryptocurrencies to ponzi schemes that unless regulated will go the way of all such schemes and eventually collapse certainly the vision of cryptocurrencies as a decentralised asset available on a peer to peer network with no barriers to entry goes against recent actions such as the freezing of withdrawals by some platforms these moves will not go down well with crypto enthusiasts further the increased correlation of cryptocurrencies to other asset classes is diminishing their value as a diversification tool while growing interest in central bank digital currencies threatens to further erode crypto s attractiveness to its core investors cryptocurrencies also face challenges around energy use privacy and security it is not clear if these issues can be solved without eroding the elements that made cryptocurrencies popular in the first place the recent us launch of a short bitcoin etf which enables investors to gain from declines in the bitcoin price will allow investors to hedge their positions and trade against bitcoin investing in cryptocurrencies is like riding a rollercoaster with large appreciations followed by sudden dips volatility is endemic bubbles and crashes are commonplace and there are divisive opinions on environmental ethical and social benefits the major correction in this market has tested the will of even the most avid crypto enthusiast buckle up because this story is not over yet

trust and alliances between countries that can continue to benefit investors in the future in the words of former secretary of state and first lady hillary clinton the growth of the developing world presents a major economic opportunity for american business today and a thousand opportunities tomorrow not only should foreign aid be a priority morally but economically in this time of covid foreign aid is more important than ever in december of last year japan pledged 3 4 billion to the international development association as a means to provide developing countries with the necessary resources to rebuild after the economic crisis and steep increase in poverty brought on by the pandemic this aid provides both monetary donations and covid vaccinations to developing countries as a means to mitigate the negative effects of covid 19 and reduce health care disparities around the world additionally japan is also donating directly to organizations that distribute vaccines themselves such as

should include obligations to use and store those arms safely my freedom to make a profit should not be absolute especially when such profit comes while poisoning water and air or while sickening or endangering my workforce at some point the common good needs to take preference tradition be damned conversely the tradition of citizens freedom to vote should not be curtailed by recent state laws

our supermajority legislature regularly grants cisgender white men far more rights than women and lgbtqa folks of all colors they refuse even minor gun safety measures that could save many lives they pass measures that assure inadequate and incorrect education of our children they refuse to restrict traditional liberties in common sense ways even in the face of increased violence being incited in their fold they ironically do this while distorting the prince of peace s message democracy and safety demand that they do better arkansans deserve better dr chris jones brings integrity an impressive education and relevant work experience to the table his opponent brings none of these please support him and defeat the supermajority and while you are at it please support the voting rights act to

diesel fuel prices are going out of sight we are no longer energy independent the bottom has fallen out of the stock market more than a million illegals have come across the border since biden has been president baby formula shortages increased drugs coming across the border crime is up biden keeps saying that putin and the ukraine war are the cause of our inflation yet the chairman of the fed jerome powell says inflation was already here yet with all of these things joe biden still has about a 40 percent approval rating that is a lot of people that confuses me because i cannot understand

southfield mich wxyz it s no secret that investments are one of the best ways to achieve financial freedom so for decades people have relied on brokers to turn their dreams into reality but in recent years especially since the pandemic the trend has changed thanks to investment apps robinhood acorns etoro and public are some of the many investing apps that allow anyone and everyone to start their investment journey without depending on a middleman karen mccallum works as a nurse anesthetist and apps give her the flexibility to track her investment during breaks i think it s great that people are able to invest at anytime anywhere said mccallum about why she likes to invest through apps patrick bailey is also on investment apps and has friends that have made a fair amount of money through online platforms by investing a few hundred dollars it truly is amazing especially for teenagers you hear these success stories of them becoming millionaires overnight whether they are doing dogecoin or some other transaction said bailey financial guru dewey stefan says investment apps are great for millennials 40 of millennials don t think they have enough money to get started if there s an app out there that you can invest try starting with 5 or 100 that is an amazing entry point for them to give it a shot said dewey steffen ceo of great lakes wealth a recent survey by the penny hoarder shows that 60 of americans plan to put more money into investment apps in 2022 than they did in 2021 while 66 plan to try new investing apps this year start with a small amount maybe 1000 and then continuously add 100 a week or 100 a month the road map to success is start and then add said steffen dewey says apps also give users the option of investing in cryptocurrency and cannabis the two categories that are not yet available through investment firms dewey emphasized that brokers will not be replaced by apps because serious investors will always seek professional advice something that most apps don t offer every market is basically down from stocks bonds crypto the only one is up is oil and some commodities so again you need to understand what you are doing and why you are doing it steffen said adrienne volk who also invests using apps still feels the digital space meets her needs i am very ambivalent about brokers and financial advisors i think i m going to stick with the online resources for a while volk said dewey says since the market is currently down this is a great time to invest the key is to do your due diligence seek professional advice if you can and don t use your credit card to start your investment journey

lithuania has upped the ante against russia in moscow s war against ukraine closing rail lines to the russian enclave of kaliningrad a direct poke at the russian bear the bear poked back warning that lithuania would face a serious negative impact this follows on a series of warnings by russian officials hoping to deter western nato support for ukraine in may former president dmitry medvedev now deputy chairman of russia s security council threatened nuclear escalation such a conflict always has the risk of turning into a full fledged nuclear war this will be a disastrous scenario for everyone russian defense minister sergei shoigu said the russian military would consider nato transports carrying weapons in ukraine as targets to be destroyed the move by finland and sweden to join the nato alliance prompted kremlin spokesman dmitri peskov to warn that nato is not that kind of alliance which ensures peace and stability and its further expansion will not bring additional security to the european continent he later added that russia would have to rebalance the situation with its own measures maria zakharova russia s foreign ministry spokeswoman threatened military and political consequences if the countries joined the bloc the russian threats were all in all attempts to keep nato out of the war the alliance was never likely to send troops to fight for a non member and there was a limit to how stringent sanctions would be in the fact of european reliance on russian natural gas the only real question then was the level of armament the west was prepared to provide to the zelensky government the answer was a lot rifles and ammunition himars multiple rocket launchers howitzers and towing vehicles drones lots of drones anti tank missiles helicopters procured for afghanistan stinger anti aircraft systems gps jamming equipment night vision goggles artillery shells and more nato training of ukrainian troops helped too prompting european sources to claim ukraine

everything in its path moscow s approach has never been one that considers civilians collateral damage or wreckage in luhansk russian troops have been unable to capture strategic villages on the ground and have resorted to shelling and airstrikes according to the regional governor ukrainian forces control basically only the azot chemical plant which is sheltering fighters and an estimated 500 civilians the destruction of grozny where a tufts university study estimated 25 000 50 000 civilian casualties should have been a warning russian troops entering grozny were not only woefully unprepared for urban warfare but were undertrained even by basic infantry standards heavily armored vehicles like mbts were all but useless in these densely packed highly elevated environments chechen guerilla outfits imposed substantial costs on the advancing russian forces destroying russian armored personnel carriers apc s with relative ease thwarted at every turn the russian military became increasingly reliant on artillery fire mortars and carpet bombing runs to pound grozny into submission but here is this month s parallel the ukrainians have fought the russians valiantly even conducting impressive counterattacks but now the fulcrum has shifted in russia s favor as its massive artillery forces pound the daylights out of ukrainian forces and innocent civilian centers in the donbas region time is not on the side of the ukrainians in what has become an artillery centric war no one helped the chechens and in 2005 the un called grozny the most destroyed city on earth the ukrainians have help lots of help from nato and the u s which means they will continue to fight and the russians with massively more manpower and a willingness to expend that manpower in a slow grinding battle will continue as well there is a warning for america and its allies embedded in this congress has authorized billions in aid to ukraine and billions more to replace war stocks including 634 million to restock stinger missiles as the u s has already sent one third of its stinger and javelin missiles to kyiv but contractor raytheon taking the contract said it could not begin the replacement before next year security analyst stephen bryen notes that the us and europe are increasingly dependent on high tech supplies from asia today there are severe supply bottlenecks shortages and risk dependencies in addition when a contract is completed and there are no immediate follow on purchases production lines are shut down and second and third tier component suppliers also stop production supply shortages and bottlenecks will have an impact america s ability to defend itself its allies and its interests an increasingly belligerent china with increasingly open threats to taiwan and a very unpredictable north korea with its threats to american ally south korea are taking note and planning accordingly threats and warnings go in all directions image ministry

south korean president yoon suk yeol l us president joe biden c and japanese prime minister fumio kishida r will meet together for the first time in around five years on the sidelines of the upcoming nato summit yonhap the leaders of south korea the united states and japan will meet together for the first time in around five years on the sidelines of the upcoming nato summit to discuss coordinated ways to address north korea s mounting threats the south korean presidential office announced sunday but president yoon suk yeol will not have bilateral face to face talks with his japanese counterpart although he plans to participate in a total of 14 meetings during the multilateral summit yoon is scheduled to depart seoul monday afternoon to make his in person debut on the multilateral diplomatic stage at the nato leaders summit held from wednesday to thursday in madrid spain the leaders of four asia pacific countries south korea australia japan and new zealand have been invited to take part in the nato summit for the first time as partners yoon particularly aims to parlay the nato summit into securing wide international support for his government s approach to resolving the north korean nuclear issue the south korean presidential office said on sunday yoon plans to underscore south korea s commitment to achieving north korea s denuclearization in his 3 minute speech delivered during a joint session with nato members and partner nations on wednesday the nato summit will also serve as a venue for a trilateral summit between yoon us president joe biden and japanese prime minister fumio kishida where north korea issues will be discussed as the main topic the three way summit is currently scheduled to be held on wednesday afternoon the occasion will be the first meeting of the leaders of the three countries since september 2017 when the trilateral summit was held on the sidelines of the 72nd session of the united nations general assembly given that the meeting will take place four years and nine months after the last one we expect to have an in depth discussion on the regional security situation south korea s senior presidential official said on sunday during a closed door briefing adding that the trilateral summit will continue up to 30 minutes due to a tight schedule the trilateral talks would focus on discussing ways to enhance security cooperation to handle the north korean nuclear issue the south korean presidential office explained during a briefing last week the summit will be held at a critical juncture when south korea and the united states have said north korea could conduct a nuclear test at any time at the punggye ri nuclear testing site north korea has launched 31 ballistic missiles in just less than six months this year surpassing the record of 25 in 2019 the rare trilateral summit will also come weeks after the south korean us and japanese defense chiefs in mid june agreed to regularize trilateral exercises and come up with further trilateral actions to deter north korea s missile threats during the shangri la dialogue asian security summit in singapore but yoon and kishida will not have separate face to face talks including casual pull aside meetings during the nato summit despite unresolved pending issues the presidential official confirmed sunday the presidential official explained that the meeting between the south korean and japanese foreign ministers should precede to set agenda topics for the bilateral summit the foreign ministerial meeting has been postponed mainly due to japan s triennial election when half of the seats in the 248 member upper house will be selected on july 10 at this juncture there are no topics for the south korean and japanese leaders to discuss even during a casual pull aside meeting as the two countries have not yet held working level talks on historical and territorial disputes the official added japan s upcoming upper house election appears to be the key barrier for south korea and japan to break the longstanding stalemate south korea and japan have concerns about whether the two countries can focus on directly and explicitly discussing critical issues at a meeting held in a third country on the sidelines of the summit and at a sensitive time the presidential office also explained last week but yoon and kishida are expected to interact several times on the occasion of the trilateral summit between south korea the us and japan the nato summit meeting and the royal gala dinner hosted by spanish king felipe vi there is also a slight chance that a quadrilateral summit among the leaders of south korea australia japan and new zealand will take place on the margins of the nato summit the south korean presidential office said sunday in addition yoon is set to hold bilateral talks with leaders from nine countries at the nato summit to discuss a broad range of economic and security issues such as exporting nuclear reactors and weapons and building a secure chip supply chain the south korean presidential office said last week the south korean president is expected to make an effort to win bids to construct nuclear plants during his meeting with his counterparts from the czech republic poland and the netherlands yoon will also seek to expand chip cooperation to strengthen the semiconductor supply chain in his bilateral talks with dutch prime minister mark rutte samsung electronics the world s largest memory chip maker is working to secure additional extreme ultraviolet or euv lithography equipment produced by dutch manufacturer asml holding nv the equipment is essential in producing the advanced processor chips that are used today yoon and danish prime minister mette frederiksen will also combine efforts to figure out ways to expand coordination in a green economy green hydrogen and renewable energy in addition yoon plans to discuss arms exports to poland in his meeting with polish prime minister mateusz morawiecki poland ukraine s closest neighbor has called on south korea to lend support to replenish its weapons stocks sent to the war torn country by accelerating and expanding the export of south korea produced weapons such as k2 black panther tanks and k9 thunder self propelled howitzers but an unnamed senior official last week said the yoon government s basic stance is not to provide lethal weapons to ukraine instead the yoon government will announce additional humanitarian aid worth 50 million to ukraine at the nato summit where 30 members plan to discuss ways to provide sustaining longer term support for ukraine as russia s invasion has continued for more than four months other non members such as sweden finland ukraine and georgia will also attend the crucial nato summit which will discuss a wide range of security issues including russia s armed invasion of ukraine and a new roadmap for the transatlantic alliance
as thaddeus mccotter contends the reproduction of a stalinist show trial is now live in washington that invites a look at the original production of 1936 1937 from one of the keenest observers at the time the moscow trials and the purges that followed them were a turning point in the history of american liberalism for it was irrevocably polarized by the controversies to which the trials gave rise explains the late philosopher sidney hook in out of step an unquiet life in the twentieth century published in 1987 as hook recalled news of the trials burst like a bombshell the principal defendants were all old bolsheviks lenin s comrades in arms who had been glorified as heroes of the october revolution until they fell out of favor with stalin chief among the defendants was trotsky acknowledged by stalin as the architect of the petrograd insurrection that had placed the bolsheviks in power as hook wondered had architects of the great experiment been agents of the western secret police the notion was inherently incredible and the charges against trotsky bukharin radek and others were mind boggling the heroes of the october revolution stalin contended had assassinated kirov in 1934 planned the assassination of stalin under the direction of trotsky and conspired with fascist powers germany and japan to dismember the soviet union in exchange for services rendered by the gestapo they were also charged with sabotaging five year plans putting nails and glass in butter inducing erysipelas in pigs wrecking trains and so forth all the defendants confessed with eagerness but as hook recalled equally mystifying was the absence of any significant material evidence leon trotsky then in exile charged that the trials were an elaborate frame up and defendants had been compelled by torture to play self incriminating roles for american communists and fellow travelers the charges and confessions were all genuine my greatest shock hook writes was the discovery that hundreds of liberals proud of the progressive american heritage they had invoked in criticizing injustices in the united states germany and spain were prepared to turn their backs on it when questions were raised about justice in the soviet union the dewey commission of inquiry named for philosopher john dewey set out to determine the truth of the moscow trials this commission was spurned by liberals many of whom were swayed by walter duranty moscow correspondent of the new york times sidney hook was on to him from the start at the height of the agricultural destitution and famine in the soviet union brought on by the forced collectivization of the peasantry hook recalled duranty sent glowing reports about the state of the soviet economy and countryside for stalin s best apologist the moscow trials were 100 percent legitimate as the new republic had it duranty has been forced to the conviction that the confessions are true and it seems to us that the weight of the evidence supports mr duranty s views trouble was there was never any material evidence even from soviet boss nikita khrushchev or any of his successors if dark court proceedings were a rigamarole played out for some dark purpose of stalin and his regime hook writes then the promise of socialism was revealed as a mockery of the great humanist ideals the dark purpose of stalin iosif dzhugashvili was to eliminate his rivals in that cause stalin was prepared to violate every fundamental norm of human decency that had been woven into the texture of civilized life for stalin rewriting history was in a sense a method of making it and this involved the denial of objective historical truth by agreeing that the trials were legitimate american liberals legitimized stalin and the soviet communist regime that regime rejected the rule of law the presumption of innocence and so forth as so much bourgeois formality the january 6 proceedings in washington violate fundamental and longstanding norms of american justice witness the summary arrests detention without trial solitary confinement denial of bail withholding of evidence and a lot more stalin aimed to eliminate his rivals and the january 6 session targets donald trump first and foremost democrats charge that trump and his followers are guilty of an insurrection the police shooting of trump follower ashli babbitt the only death by gunfire that day is no object to the ludicrous charge stalin s show trial boasted media defenders such as walter duranty of the new york times duranty has been replicated by establishment media defenders of the current show trial these are the same people who peddled the russia and ukraine hoaxes with no regrets after both were proven false stalin charged that his fellow revolutionaries conspired with foreign powers the january 6 proceeding maintains the fiction that donald trump got elected only by colluding with putin and that the american people had no role in his victory the january 6 proceeding does not conduct audits or consider any evidence of voter fraud it simply assumes that the 2000 election was the most secure in american history with no comparisons of voter fraud in past elections the moscow trials were all about stalin and it s hard to exaggerate the veneration of this man by american academics journalists and politicians sociologist anna louise strong for example wrote in i change worlds that one must not make a god of stalin he was too important for that at bottom the january 6 proceeding is all about joe biden by implication the people of america were panting for a man who had achieved little if anything in all his years in the senate they wanted a man who has trouble with basic motor functions and memory a delusional character who believes he served as a liaison during the six day war when he was still in law school america wanted a man who tells african americans they ain t black if they fail to support him a man who says the chinese communists are not bad folks and not even competition for the united states the moscow trials were also a diversion from the economic disaster stalin had inflicted on the soviet union the january 6 proceeding is a diversion from the disasters joe incompetent is inflicting on america by implication this is what the american people wanted in the style of voltaire s dr pangloss joe tells americans they live in the best of all possible worlds the junta s duranty squads chide the people for failure to recognize the great job joe is doing the economy is strong claims government controlled national public radio but voters aren t feeling it tiffany cross of msnbc complains that americans are more concerned with saving money than saving democracy and high prices cause people to be less interested in the compelling testimonies and evidence in the january 6 hearings that is indeed a stalinist show trial and under the biden regime stalinist conditions are expanding on other fronts the disinformation board of the department of homeland security briefly paused is being recast under the leadership of kamala harris the beneficiary of poontronage from democrat queenmaker willie brown professional propagandist nina jancowicz will doubtless be singing backup and as with the ussr s pravda the truth will be only what the government s board declares it to be in the best stalinist style american history is also being rewritten according to the 1619 project critical race theory and so forth america is a bastion of racist oppression except that is for the revisionists tenured positions at prestigious universities and media outlets except for their high level government jobs except for their six figure salaries except for their generous benefits and gold plated pensions except for their stock portfolios fancy electric cars beach houses and so on like those arrested on january 6 2021 anyone less than worshipful of the biden regime is a domestic terrorist the biden junta also applies that description to parents who object to the racist indoctrination of their children if americans thought the nation was becoming more stalinist by the day it would be hard to blame them meanwhile for the moscow trials and stalinism in general sidney hook s out of step is hard to beat for the current stalinist show trial read julie kelly a one woman dewey commission digging deep for the truth

south korean president yoon suk yeol l us president joe biden c and japanese prime minister fumio kishida r will meet together for the first time in around five years on the sidelines of the upcoming nato summit yonhap the leaders of south korea the united states and japan will meet together for the first time in around five years on the sidelines of the upcoming nato summit to discuss coordinated ways to address north korea s mounting threats the south korean presidential office announced sunday but president yoon suk yeol will not have bilateral face to face talks with his japanese counterpart although he plans to participate in a total of 14 meetings during the multilateral summit yoon is scheduled to depart seoul monday afternoon to make his in person debut on the multilateral diplomatic stage at the nato leaders summit held from wednesday to thursday in madrid spain the leaders of four asia pacific countries south korea australia japan and new zealand have been invited to take part in the nato summit for the first time as partners yoon particularly aims to parlay the nato summit into securing wide international support for his government s approach to resolving the north korean nuclear issue the south korean presidential office said on sunday yoon plans to underscore south korea s commitment to achieving north korea s denuclearization in his 3 minute speech delivered during a joint session with nato members and partner nations on wednesday the nato summit will also serve as a venue for a trilateral summit between yoon us president joe biden and japanese prime minister fumio kishida where north korea issues will be discussed as the main topic the three way summit is currently scheduled to be held on wednesday afternoon the occasion will be the first meeting of the leaders of the three countries since september 2017 when the trilateral summit was held on the sidelines of the 72nd session of the united nations general assembly given that the meeting will take place four years and nine months after the last one we expect to have an in depth discussion on the regional security situation south korea s senior presidential official said on sunday during a closed door briefing adding that the trilateral summit will continue up to 30 minutes due to a tight schedule the trilateral talks would focus on discussing ways to enhance security cooperation to handle the north korean nuclear issue the south korean presidential office explained during a briefing last week the summit will be held at a critical juncture when south korea and the united states have said north korea could conduct a nuclear test at any time at the punggye ri nuclear testing site north korea has launched 31 ballistic missiles in just less than six months this year surpassing the record of 25 in 2019 the rare trilateral summit will also come weeks after the south korean us and japanese defense chiefs in mid june agreed to regularize trilateral exercises and come up with further trilateral actions to deter north korea s missile threats during the shangri la dialogue asian security summit in singapore but yoon and kishida will not have separate face to face talks including casual pull aside meetings during the nato summit despite unresolved pending issues the presidential official confirmed sunday the presidential official explained that the meeting between the south korean and japanese foreign ministers should precede to set agenda topics for the bilateral summit the foreign ministerial meeting has been postponed mainly due to japan s triennial election when half of the seats in the 248 member upper house will be selected on july 10 at this juncture there are no topics for the south korean and japanese leaders to discuss even during a casual pull aside meeting as the two countries have not yet held working level talks on historical and territorial disputes the official added japan s upcoming upper house election appears to be the key barrier for south korea and japan to break the longstanding stalemate south korea and japan have concerns about whether the two countries can focus on directly and explicitly discussing critical issues at a meeting held in a third country on the sidelines of the summit and at a sensitive time the presidential office also explained last week but yoon and kishida are expected to interact several times on the occasion of the trilateral summit between south korea the us and japan the nato summit meeting and the royal gala dinner hosted by spanish king felipe vi there is also a slight chance that a quadrilateral summit among the leaders of south korea australia japan and new zealand will take place on the margins of the nato summit the south korean presidential office said sunday in addition yoon is set to hold bilateral talks with leaders from nine countries at the nato summit to discuss a broad range of economic and security issues such as exporting nuclear reactors and weapons and building a secure chip supply chain the south korean presidential office said last week the south korean president is expected to make an effort to win bids to construct nuclear plants during his meeting with his counterparts from the czech republic poland and the netherlands yoon will also seek to expand chip cooperation to strengthen the semiconductor supply chain in his bilateral talks with dutch prime minister mark rutte samsung electronics the world s largest memory chip maker is working to secure additional extreme ultraviolet or euv lithography equipment produced by dutch manufacturer asml holding nv the equipment is essential in producing the advanced processor chips that are used today yoon and danish prime minister mette frederiksen will also combine efforts to figure out ways to expand coordination in a green economy green hydrogen and renewable energy in addition yoon plans to discuss arms exports to poland in his meeting with polish prime minister mateusz morawiecki poland ukraine s closest neighbor has called on south korea to lend support to replenish its weapons stocks sent to the war torn country by accelerating and expanding the export of south korea produced weapons such as k2 black panther tanks and k9 thunder self propelled howitzers but an unnamed senior official last week said the yoon government s basic stance is not to provide lethal weapons to ukraine instead the yoon government will announce additional humanitarian aid worth 50 million to ukraine at the nato summit where 30 members plan to discuss ways to provide sustaining longer term support for ukraine as russia s invasion has continued for more than four months other non members such as sweden finland ukraine and georgia will also attend the crucial nato summit which will discuss a wide range of security issues including russia s armed invasion of ukraine and a new roadmap for the transatlantic alliance

understanding the human mind and behaviour lies at the core of the discipline of psychology but to characterise how people s behaviour changes over time i believe psychology alone is insufficient and that additional mathematical ideas need to be brought forward my new model published in frontiers in psychology is inspired by the work of the 20th century american mathematician norbert wiener at its heart is how we change our perceptions over time when tasked with making a choice from a set of alternatives such changes are often generated by limited information which we analyse before making decisions that determine our behavioural patterns to understand these patterns we need the mathematics of information processing here the state of a person s mind is represented by the likelihood it assigns to different alternatives which product to buy which school to send your child to which candidate to vote for in an election and so on as we gather partial information we become less uncertain for example by reading customer reviews we become more certain about which product to buy this mental updating is expressed in a mathematical formula worked out by the 18th century english scholar thomas bayes it essentially captures how a rational mind makes decisions by assessing various uncertain alternatives author provided when combining this concept with the mathematics of information specifically signal processing dating back to the 1940s it can help us understand the behaviour of people or society guided by how information is processed over time it is only recently that my colleagues and i realised how useful this approach can be so far we have successfully applied it to model the behaviour of financial markets market participants respond to new information which leads to changes in stock prices and the behaviour of green plants a flower processes information about the location of the sun and turns its head towards it i have also shown it can be used to model the dynamics of opinion poll statistics associated with an election or a referendum and drive a formula that gives the actual probability of a given candidate winning a future election based on today s poll statistics and how information will be released in the future in this new information based approach the behaviour of a person or group of people over time is deduced by modelling the flow of information so for example it is possible to ask what will happen to an election result the likelihood of a percentage swing if there is fake news of a given magnitude and frequency in circulation but perhaps most unexpected are the deep insights we can glean into the human decision making process we now understand for instance that one of the key traits of the bayes updating is that every alternative whether it is the right one or not can strongly influence the way we behave if we don t have a preconceived idea we are attracted to all of these alternatives irrespective of their merits and won t choose one for a long time without further information this is where the uncertainty is greatest and a rational mind will wish to reduce the uncertainty so that a choice can be made but if someone has a very strong conviction on one of the alternatives then whatever the information says their position will hardly change for a long time it is a pleasant state of high certainty such behaviour is linked to the notion of confirmation bias interpreting information as confirming your views even when it actually contradicts them this is seen in psychology as contrary to the bayes logic representing irrational behaviour but we show it is in fact a perfectly rational feature compatible with the bayes logic a rational mind simply wants high certainty the rational liar the approach can even describe the behaviour of a pathological liar can mathematics distinguish lying from a genuine misunderstanding it appears that the answer is yes at least with a high level of confidence if a person genuinely thinks an alternative that is obviously true is highly unlikely meaning they are misunderstanding then in an environment in which partial information about the truth is gradually revealed their perception will slowly shift towards the truth albeit fluctuating over time even if they have a strong belief in a false alternative their view will very slowly converge from this false alternative to the true one however if a person knows the truth but refuses to accept it is a liar then according to the model their behaviour is radically different they will rapidly choose one of the false alternatives and confidently assert this to be the truth in fact they may almost believe in this false alternative that has been chosen randomly then as the truth is gradually revealed and this position becomes untenable very quickly and assertively they will pick another false alternative hence a rational in the sense of someone following the bayes logic liar will behave in a rather erratic manner which can ultimately help us spot them but they will have such a strong conviction that they can be convincing to those who have limited knowledge of the truth for those who have known a consistent liar this behaviour might seem familiar of course without the access to someone s mind one can never be 100 sure but mathematical models show that for such behaviour to arise from a genuine misunderstanding is statistically very unlikely this information based approach is highly effective in predicting the statistics of people s future behaviour in response to the unravelling of information or disinformation for that matter it can provide us with a tool to analyse and counter in particular the negative ramifications of disinformation

it is germany s turn to host the annual summit of g7 leaders this year and while the war in ukraine will be top of the agenda at the gathering in bavaria the economic damage caused by russia s invasion will come a close second nobody saw what was coming when the g7 last met in cornwall a year ago back then the talk was of global post pandemic recovery now the fear is of imminent recession as central banks turn hawkish and vladimir putin plays the energy card the kremlin has cut supplies of gas through the nordstream pipeline by 60 in the past two weeks and alarm bells are ringing in berlin as the downside of being so dependent on russian energy becomes apparent olaf scholz germany s new chancellor is in the unfortunate position of having to clear up a mess caused by his predecessor angela merkel a politician whose reputation will certainly not improve with time last week the german government triggered the second stage of an emergency gas plan there is no rationing as yet but such a step is possible as is the re opening of coal fired power stations one of germany s goals for the g7 is strong alliances for a sustainable planet which sits oddly with german energy companies being told to get ready to burn more coal this winter as far as the g7 is concerned the wheel has turned full circle the first meeting of the group which then included only six countries was held in france in 1975 as the big western economies struggled to find a response to the oil shock that had put an end to the long post second world war boom now all of them once again face the prospect of recession the us federal reserve raised interest rates by 0 75 points earlier this month and has signalled further such increases are on the way its chairman jerome powell said recession was a possibility when he gave testimony to congress last week that s some admission the outlook has to be pretty grim before a central banker uses the r word but powell made it clear when faced with the choice between recession and embedded inflation he would choose the former the bank of england is also tightening policy compared with the fed threadneedle street s monetary policy committee is moving in baby steps so far raising interest rates in 0 25 percentage point increments it is doing so against the backdrop of an economy which despite the continued strength of the labour market appears to be slowing rapidly the bank is trying to engineer a soft landing for the economy in which inflation currently 9 1 falls back towards its 2 government target without triggering a recession good luck with that the european central bank has not yet joined other western central banks in raising rates although it has signalled higher borrowing costs are coming next month its cautious approach is unsurprising because the stakes for the eurozone are especially high if the federal reserve or the bank of england make a hash of responding to the highest inflation in 40 years the consequence will be needless economic pain if the ecb gets it wrong the future of the single currency will once again be put in doubt europe is vulnerable to a prolonged war in ukraine it was growing less strongly than the us before the invasion in part because the fiscal package tax cuts and spending increases in america was greater unemployment is higher and unlike the us the eu is not self sufficient in energy europe is closer to the fighting and has suffered more of a supply shock as a result of the conflict that s one reason for the ecb to be careful another is the impact tougher monetary policy higher interest rates and a reversal of the money creation programme known as quantitative easing will have on the eurozone s weaker members monetary union is an unfinished project member states share the same currency but run their own tax and spending policies subject to certain common rules and issue their own bonds when they borrow from the financial markets the interest rate or yield on italian bonds is higher than that on german bonds because investors see italy as riskier than germany since the ecb signalled it would join other central banks in raising interest rates the gap or spread has widened between german bond yields and those of italy spain portugal and greece investors are worried about how these countries will cope with higher borrowing costs and slower growth sign up to the daily business today email or follow guardian business on twitter at businessdesk a decade ago italian and spanish bond yields reached levels that called into question whether the eurozone would splinter into a hard core based around germany and a softer outer ring on that occasion the then head of the ecb mario draghi pledged he would do whatever it takes to safeguard the single currency it did the trick now christine lagarde draghi s successor faces the same fragmentation problem at 8 1 the eurozone s inflation rate is much too high for the ecb s comfort the question is how to raise borrowing costs without causing such damage to the weaker members of the eurozone that their bond yields rocket the ecb has pledged to come up with an anti fragmentation device under which the central bank would ensure bond yields in heavily indebted countries such as italy don t rise excessively this though is not going to be easy scholz will have trouble selling a bond buying scheme to a sceptical german public especially since it could lead to losses as interest rates rise time is not on lagarde s side and if she gets it wrong the next unwelcome shock to the global economy will be a eurozone crisis

operating above 90 capacity according to the energy information administration and expected to run at 95 for the rest of the summer george frey getty images getty images salt lake city ut may 24 a driver unloads raw crude oil from his tanker to process into gas at marathon refinery on may 24 2022 in salt lake city utah photo by george frey getty images as for turning back on idled refineries that s not a quick fix either it would take months to bring the refineries back online and it would be costly for the refiners cinquegrana from oil price information service says that from the refiners perspective it doesn t make financial sense to invest in additional oil refining given the broader transition you re talking about a lot of money to get these refineries that are idled up and running when i m being told five years from now we hope you don t exist cinquegrana says the united states hasn t seen a major new refinery built since the 1970s and there s a good chance it never will chevron ceo mike wirth recently stated as much in an interview with bloomberg my personal view is there will never be another refinery built in the united states wirth said copyright 2022 npr to

in tough times buying stocks with staying power at low prices can help you sleep at night and hold for the long term in a brutal bear market one of the things that may allow you to sleep well at night is investing in value stocks value is a somewhat relative term but generally it denotes low priced stocks based on a multiple of earnings or book value while high flying growth stocks trading at lofty multiples have huge downside potential if sentiment changes around their prospects value stocks have a more solid ground on which to stand right now the following high quality stocks have fallen to bargain levels while their prices could fall further from here and results could suffer in the near term these are resilient companies that should bounce back eventually making them solid long term picks for your portfolio today meta platforms warren buffett once said you pay a high price for a cheery consensus and you couldn t get a less cheery consensus than investors have on meta platforms meta 2 28 right now perhaps that s why the dominant social media platform with outstanding financial characteristics trades at less than 12 times earnings meta s problems are many last year s ios changes to apple s identity for advertisers made facebook s ad targeting less precise ditto for a recent settlement with federal housing officials on tuesday by which facebook will have to change its algorithms on housing employment and credit to exclude certain characteristics around race religion and sex these new regulations threaten facebook s price per ad since ads in these areas will be less targeted then there s the tiktok threat the ascendant short video app has been eating into teenagers online engagement at the expense of facebook and instagram meta s response to make its app look more like tiktok management has been rolling out new changes to facebook which include showing more tiktok like reels specifically from creators and not just immediate friends and family a final change includes reintegrating messenger into facebook to mimic tiktok s messaging functionality finally investors have also soured on the company s metaverse bet if we are in fact going into a slowdown or recession as some predict then spending tens of billions of dollars with no payoff for five or 10 years is not what investors want to see yet if one is really looking out years meta s stock seems awfully cheap and it has a history of successfully adapting its platform to counter rivals in fact backing out the company s losses from its reality labs metaverse segment and operating profits would have been about 25 higher last quarter that essentially means if the company stopped investing in the metaverse it would trade around 10 times earnings meanwhile meta still had 44 billion in cash on its balance sheet and it continues to repurchase stock meta s huge cash flows should also allow it to outspend tiktok in attracting creators to make more high quality reels for facebook to counter tiktok s recent success meanwhile the overall digital advertising segment is still growing strongly so even if meta loses market share it should still grow and of course there is always the possibility facebook s new reels feature actually finds success just as stories eventually defended meta s platform against snap if that happens shares could go significantly higher as long as we don t have a long and deep recession micron technology micron technology mu 0 94 is one of only three manufacturers of dram memory and one of five manufacturers of nand flash storage chips with huge barriers to entry in this capital and research intensive sector furthermore the memory industry is set to grow over the long term as memory use is growing not only in pcs an smartphones but increasingly in memory hungry data centers industrial applications and electric and autonomous vehicles moreover micron has been outperforming the industry in recent years reaching today s most leading edge nodes before rivals yet when fears of a recession are in the air micron tends to sell off to very cheap levels that s the case today with the stock at around 1 3 times book value and just seven times trailing earnings of course since the price of memory fluctuates micron s cyclicality means its low p e ratio doesn t tell us much however micron s price to book ratio is now in the neighborhood of previous troughs not only that but as you can see micron s price to book valuation tends to bottom out at a higher level with each passing cycle this is because greater and greater scale consolidation among top memory producers over time and the increasing difficulty of producing leading edge supply has made memory companies more profitable with margins reaching higher highs and lows through each cycle not only that but micron s book value is also understated at the moment the company is set to report its fiscal third quarter earnings on june 30 in which it s expected to earn 2 46 per share subtracting out its 0 10 dividend micron should probably add about 2 36 to its book value per share which would probably bring micron s book value to around 45 at present that means the current price to book ratio is really around 1 25 no doubt the next few quarters could be rough but for long term investors this valuation could end up being a nice entry point given the long term growth trajectory for memory chips bank of america another stock that has cratered on cyclical fears is bank of america bac 0 45 which is buffett s favorite bank bank of america currently trades at just 9 3 times earnings because of fears of an oncoming recession however the company is well positioned to ride out any particular storm ceo brian moynihan has pursued a strategy of smart growth selectively growing the business while keeping risk low charge offs are currently near historic lows for the bank and bofa s balance sheet is sound with a common equity tier 1 ratio of 10 4 moreover bank of america s lending centric model is more interest rate sensitive than most other large banks management said in its first quarter presentation that a 100 basis point parallel increase in rates would add about 5 4 billion in net interest income to the bank s revenues over 12 months a 12 increase over its trailing 12 month figure as mortgages and other rates have climbed recently bank of america should benefit as that extra interest income will fall to its bottom line while the bank s investment banking wing is currently suffering from a lack of new ipos and debt issuances bank of america is less exposed there than are other large money center banks the company also continues to wring costs out of its system with non financial expenses decreasing 1 compared with last year s first quarter despite an increase in salaries this has been a pleasant ongoing theme as bank of america continues to benefit from lower costs brought on through digital transformation these cost reductions occurred even as the bank continued to grow its loan book 10 last quarter in all bank of america looks really cheap but even if the worst happens it looks as if it can weather the storm meanwhile shareholders will continue to receive its 2 6 and growing dividend along with share repurchases while they wait for the economic cycle to turn more positive
buffett owns a lot of bank stocks which are staring at a possible recession warren buffett and his company berkshire hathaway own many bank stocks which make up a large part of berkshire s roughly 317 billion equities portfolio banks are cyclical and tend to be tightly linked to the economy which if you haven t heard may well be in a recession at some point this year or next luckily for bank investors the federal reserve recently released the results of its annual stress tests which put the largest banks in the country through a set of hypothetical adverse economic scenarios to see how they would hold up this year banks were put through a scenario in which unemployment would rise and peak at 10 3 between the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2024 during this scenario encompassing nine quarters commercial real estate and stock prices would also fall 40 and 55 respectively stress testing is important for banks because it helps determine how much regulatory capital they must hold which in turn determines how much capital they can return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases banks return capital to shareholders based on the excess amount they have above their regulatory requirements banks are expected to announce their new regulatory capital requirements and new capital return plans on june 27 as expected all banks put through the exercise passed maintaining enough capital to absorb loan and trading losses and still be able to lend to individuals families and businesses during a severe economic downturn let s look at how buffett s bank stocks fared on an individual basis 1 bank of america bank of america bac 0 45 is berkshire s second largest holding in its portfolio making up roughly 10 5 a big way that the fed and investors evaluate capital is through the common equity tier 1 cet1 capital ratio a measure of a bank s core capital expressed as a percentage of its risk weighted assets such as loans bank of america the u s s second biggest bank with 2 5 trillion in assets would see its cet1 ratio of 10 6 at the end of 2021 fall to 7 6 under the severely adverse scenario which is still well above the bare bones requirement of 4 5 however during the nine quarter stress period bank of america would end up taking a loss before taxes of close to 44 billion which was actually the highest of any bank tested it would incur 52 5 billion of loan losses which is equal to 5 2 of its total loan portfolio and almost 13 billion of trading and counter party losses bank of america is one of the largest commercial lenders so a 40 drop in commercial real estate prices would hit it hard but the fed scenario also severely dinged up commercial and industrial c i loans which are made to businesses for working capital or capital expenditure needs the bank would see 17 4 billion of c i loan losses in the fed s hypothetical scenario the silver lining is that bank of america can withstand an enormous amount of losses and still maintain reasonable capital levels but the fed s test was more adverse this year and could result in higher regulatory capital requirements for the bank and therefore smaller capital returns 2 american express the large credit card lender and payments company american express axp 0 09 is the fifth largest holding in berkshire s portfolio at 6 8 the company performed very well in this round of stress testing amex started the stressed period with a 10 5 cet1 ratio only saw it fall to 9 9 which is more than double the 4 5 requirement and then ended the period at 12 5 higher than what it began with perhaps even more impressive is the fact that during the nine quarter period while amex would incur about 14 billion of loan losses it also would be able to generate a pretax profit of 5 1 billion the second highest of the 33 banks tested this should bode well for the bank s regulatory capital requirements this year 3 u s bancorp u s bancorp usb 0 34 with 573 billion in assets is another fairly big position in buffett s portfolio at 2 1 of berkshire s total holdings the bank also managed capital very well through the severe scenario it began with a 10 cet1 and only hit a low of 9 3 before rising back to 9 8 by early 2024 the bank would incur more than 18 billion in loan losses almost 6 of total loans in the period and end up with just a slight loss in the period u s bancorp has long managed credit prudently through a number of difficult environments which is why it trades at the strong valuation it does after the sell off this year it also has a dividend yield of almost 4 which is likely one of the reasons buffett likes the stock so much i m sure the oracle of omaha wouldn t hate to see that dividend keep marching higher 4 citigroup as one of the new additions buffett made in the first quarter of this year citigroup c 1 88 makes up less than 1 of berkshire s portfolio but berkshire hadn t invested in the bank since 2001 which makes it interesting especially considering the discount citigroup trades at during the stressed scenario citigroup would see its cet1 ratio fall from 12 2 to a low of 8 6 before rebounding to 9 5 during the period citigroup would take more than 43 billion of loan losses the bulk of which would come from its large credit card business the bank would also see another 13 6 billion of trading and counterparty losses on its way to a pretax loss of almost 27 billion the largest banks like bank of america and citigroup with more sizable credit card and commercial lending operations as well as large investment banking businesses are going to take bigger hits than other banks in this kind of stress testing similar to bank of america i wouldn t be surprised to see citigroup s regulatory capital requirements increase but overall the bank remained well capitalized during the hypothetical scenario 5 ally financial another new position for berkshire in the first quarter ally financial ally 1 72 runs a large digital bank focused on auto lending making it a bit different than the other banks above the stock only makes up 0 10 of berkshire s portfolio ally performed solidly in the fed s stress test its cet1 ratio started at 10 3 and then fell to 8 9 which is where it would also end in the first quarter of 2024 this branchless bank would incur about 7 8 billion of losses mostly from auto loans and would end up losing about 1 9 billion before taxes at the end of the period
amid struggles these stocks could shoot dramatically higher in a market recovery warren buffett is better known for not favoring higher risk stocks however since he has turned some of the stock picking duties over to his lieutenants berkshire hathaway s portfolio has taken on some riskier investments particularly in the tech sector these lieutenants have also bought ipo stocks a practice buffett previously avoided still some of these stocks hold potential for massive gains to this end investors would do well to take a closer look at three higher beta stocks warren buffett owns nu holdings nu 3 01 snowflake snow 4 15 and stoneco stne 2 79 1 nu holdings u s based investors are unlikely to be familiar with nu holdings the sao paulo based fintech financial services platform serves customers in brazil colombia and mexico this is notable because latin america s fintech sector differs significantly from those in more developed parts of the world in nu s chief markets large percentages of the population have neither bank accounts nor credit cards part of nu s competitive advantage is that it maintains less of a physical footprint than traditional banks do and it passes on the cost savings from that model to its customers by keeping its fees low with this approach nu has extended services to more than 60 million customers almost 6 million of whom joined in the first quarter of 2022 alone nu generated 877 million in revenue in q1 up 258 from year ago levels however the total cost of the financial and transactional services it provided rose by over 350 during that time even with slower growth in operating expenses the company lost 45 million during the quarter only slightly less than its 49 million loss from a year earlier analysts expect its revenue growth to slow to 121 for the year nonetheless the stock has declined by more than 70 from its 52 week high with its price to sales ratio down to 12 the stock has begun to appear more reasonably valued as nu expands the availability of financial services to people in its heavily unbanked markets it could turn profitable benefiting both buffett and the investors who join him in taking a chance on this stock 2 snowflake snowflake has emerged as a leader in the data cloud business the data cloud is a network of thousands of organizations exchanging vast amounts of data across public clouds through secured access managed by snowflake this network lets users share governed data within businesses with business customers and with business partners according to snowflake about 400 million data sets are still siloed leaving it a vast potential market admittedly companies like amazon or microsoft can in theory compete with snowflake as they also offer data cloud software but while amazon and microsoft use specific protocols designed for their networks snowflake s protocols are agnostic and work with multiple cloud providers eliminating a potential bias from a cloud infrastructure provider as of april 30 the end of its fiscal 2023 first quarter snowflake s customer count was 6 322 up 40 year over year the company believes the value of its addressable market will rise to 248 billion by 2026 so far snowflake has only claimed a tiny fraction of that market in its fiscal q1 its revenue rose 85 year over year to 422 million its cost of revenue and operating expenses also grew at a rapid pace albeit a slower one than the top line the result was a loss of 166 million down from a 203 million loss in the same quarter last year snowflake stock has fallen by nearly 70 from its 52 week high its price to sales ratio prior to that decline often exceeded 100 and that high valuation may have contributed to the sell off while its current sales multiple of 27 is still pricey this remains a top warren buffett stock to buy as organizations need for data cloud services is only increasing 3 stoneco like nu holdings stoneco is a brazil based fintech that u s investors may not know well stone s ecosystem resembles that of block formerly known as square offering fintech services and enterprise software to businesses for a period it grew rapidly amid the expansion of brazil s fintech market and it stood out by offering high quality customer service with a no bureaucracy approach unfortunately the pandemic and brazil s annualized inflation rate rising above 10 beginning in the summer of 2021 have hampered growth the brazilian government also made changes to banking regulations regarding fintechs that hurt stoneco s legacy lending business however management said on the q1 2022 earnings call that it had reorganized its segments separating its fintech businesses and digital commerce solutions to increase transparency moreover as it adapts to the new banking regulations its fintech businesses should recover despite these troubles q1 revenue rose 139 year over year to 2 07 billion reais 400 million still rising expenses including a nearly eightfold increase in financial expenses took their toll consequently stoneco booked a net loss of 313 million reais 61 million in q1 down from net income of 158 million reais in the prior year quarter not surprisingly considering these challenges stoneco s stock price has fallen dramatically it has lost just shy of 90 of its value over the last year its price to sales ratio has fallen to just over 2 a dramatic drop considering it exceeded 40 in february 2021 given the rapid growth of stoneco and fintech in general the stock should recover as the company adapts to market changes
ev stocks have lost a lot of steam lately but tesla is in a class of its own the electric vehicle ev market has been stumbling as investors shift much of their attention away from growth stocks and look for safer places to put their money but avoiding the ev market entirely could be a huge mistake and ignoring tesla s tsla 5 59 lead in the space could be an especially bad decision here s why tesla s stock is a buy right now vehicle production and deliveries hit the gas while younger ev companies are still trying to figure out how to increase their production tesla s production levels are likely causing envy among its smaller competitors for example tesla produced 305 407 vehicles in the most recent quarter an increase of 69 from the year ago quarter the ev maker is also quickly getting those vehicles into the hands of customers with deliveries reaching 310 048 in the quarter up 68 year over year those figures represent record vehicle deliveries and production for the company and they came at a time when some production was stifled in china because of covid 19 related lockdowns by comparison rivian says it will only be able to produce 25 000 electric vehicles this year down from its previous estimate of 50 000 because of supply chain issues and lucid group also cut its 2022 production goal from a previous estimate of 20 000 vehicles down to about 13 000 for the same reason some legacy automakers are also finding the transition to making evs harder than they anticipated as well toyota recently recalled its first mass produced electric vehicles 2 700 total less than two months after they launched the point here is that while competition is certainly increasing tesla has shown that compared to some of its competitors it s doing a better job with ev production automotive revenue and profit are climbing fast tesla s automotive revenue increased at a rapid pace reaching 16 9 billion in the first quarter an 87 year over year increase the increase was due to the company s stellar vehicle production and delivery growth in addition to its sales jump the company is earning more profit from its vehicles automotive gross profit spiked 132 in the first quarter to 5 5 billion the result was a record non gaap net income for the ev company surpassing 1 billion for the first time ever in a quarter vehicle production could be even better this year it would be one thing if tesla s stellar quarter was a one off but it isn t the company believes it has a reasonable shot at increasing vehicle production another 60 this year compared to 2021 part of that optimism comes from the fact that the company s factory in shanghai is coming back with a vengeance according to tesla ceo elon musk after covid 19 related shutdowns curbed production last year additionally tesla s newest factories in germany and texas only just came online in march and april tesla is still overcoming some production hurdles from the two plants with musk saying recently that the factories are losing billions of dollars right now due to supply chain issues but both are expected to significantly increase their production output this year and tesla hasn t changed its previous statement of aiming for 60 higher vehicle production this year which would equal about 1 5 million vehicles an ev leader that s only getting stronger like many other stocks during the pandemic tesla s share price surged only to cool down during a broader market sell off the result is an ev leader whose share price is down 38 year to date some of that share price drop comes from tesla investors worrying that musk is getting sidetracked by his purchase of twitter and while that s certainly something for tesla investors to keep an eye on it doesn t change the fact that tesla s vehicle production is increasing quickly and revenue and profit are both climbing sure there could be more share price volatility in the short term but with tesla s early moves in the ev industry already paying off and the company far ahead of younger ev start ups its stock could continue to be a great long term play in the ev space particularly at today s bargain price

president biden and big oil are at each other s throats at a time when gas prices are at the highest level in history hurting regular americans he points out that big oil companies are enjoying record profits the president earlier this month singled out exxonmobil saying the company made more money than god this year gas prices started skyrocketing following a raft of sanctions on russian oil after its invasion of ukraine in february the national average price of gasoline surpassed 5 a gallon for the first time ever this month prices have edged down by a few cents in recent days but remain elevated exacerbating these high gas prices is a huge shortage in refining capacity in the u s which isn t likely to be resolved any time soon refiners turn crude oil into usable products like gasoline diesel and jet fuel there s just fewer refiners in the u s today than a couple of years ago refining capacity in the u s is about a million barrels a day below what it was prior to the pandemic that s left the country unable to meet its fuel needs as more people are commuting traveling and driving as they emerge from the throes of the pandemic so where did all the refineries go some refineries shuttered during the pandemic induced recession in 2020 when demand for gasoline took a nosedive not all of those refineries have come back online the u s had five fewer refineries at the beginning of this year that at the beginning of 2020 when the pandemic hit and demand for oil evaporated during the recession refineries took a big financial hit when the price of gasoline plummeted some refiners threw in the towel they said the numbers just didn t work and closed up shop when you re losing money on doing it what do you do you stop making it and that s when you shut down refineries says denton cinquegrana chief oil analyst at oil price information service there were other disasters around the same time a philadelphia refinery one of the largest in the country was rocked by explosions a few months before the pandemic in louisiana another refinery was wiped out by hurricane ida both have been shut down oil is not where the future lies underpinning the decisions not to reopen refineries is the fact that the u s is undergoing an energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables the biden administration envisions a future where the world is powered by clean energy rather than oil with its destructive effect on the environment i think the refining executives say well looks like the writing s on the wall cinquegrana says in fact some refiners have repurposed their facilities where instead of making gasoline from oil they re ramping up to produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel out of feed stocks like soybean oil and used cooking oil biden wants a future in renewables but wants oil companies to pump more now of course high demand combined with high prices has led oil companies to make big profits exxonmobil s profit in the first quarter more than doubled from a year earlier meanwhile chevron reported its highest quarterly profit in nearly a decade while shell posted its highest earnings ever so president biden wants them to do more to bring down the price of gasoline at a time of war refinery profit margins well above normal being passed directly onto american families are not acceptable the president wrote in a letter to the heads of seven oil companies earlier this month the president urged oil executives to increase the supply of gasoline and other refined products and to drill for more oil in a bid to bring gas prices down it s no surprise that this is raising eyebrows given the president s stated goals on an energy transition and also his promise to voters on the campaign trail that he would end fossil fuels francisco blanch head of commodities research at bank of america points out that the country is still heavily reliant on gasoline despite those goals the narrative until today was that we were going to be driving electric vehicles by the end of the year so who cares about refined products well it turns out a lot of people need refined products says blanch but could refiners be doing more u s refineries are already going gangbusters right now they re operating above 90 capacity according to the energy information administration and expected to run at 95 for the rest of the summer as for turning back on idled refineries that s not a quick fix either it would take months to bring the refineries back online and it would be costly for the refiners cinquegrana from oil price

few income streams are more passive than dividends warren buffett likes buying businesses he s also very good at it you don t become one of the world s richest billionaires and most famous investors without a knack for spotting a solid business model buffett is serious too about how solid he wants his investments to be he likes battle tested companies he can hold for decades and the qualities that provide corporate staying power are often the same qualities that enable a company to pay dividends reliably it s not surprising then that several of buffett s favorite stocks pay dividends and at good yields here s a look at five of those stocks which combined could generate a five digit passive income stream down the road 1 chevron cvx 0 86 buffett first bought shares of chevron in 2020 but he recently tripled his position in the energy company a sign of his confidence in chevron s long term prospects chevron is now the fourth largest position in berkshire hathaway s stock portfolio chevron s current annual dividend is 5 68 per share which works out to a 3 7 yield the company has increased its dividend annually for the past 35 years 2 paramount global para 0 55 media company paramount global is a new position for buffett he bought up 68 million shares for berkshire in the first quarter of this year paramount s dividend dates to 2006 the history is less consistent than chevron s but the annual dividend did double between 2013 and 2022 the current yield for paramount is 3 9 buffett first bought a piece of coke back in 1988 while buffett hasn t increased the position this year berkshire does own more than 9 of the beverage company coca cola has been increasing its dividend payments annually for 61 years the current yield is 2 9 4 bank of america bac 0 45 bank of america is berkshire s second largest stock position berkshire first reported ownership in the bank in 2017 today the position totals more than 1 billion shares bank of america s dividend dates to 2005 though it was a lean payout between 2008 and 2017 the current yield is 2 5 based on annual payments totaling 0 84 5 citigroup c 1 88 buffett closed out his position of wells fargo earlier this year and picked up 55 million shares of citigroup instead citigroup s yield of 4 2 is the highest on this list citigroup s dividend like bank of america s faltered in the years following the 2008 financial crisis but in recent years the shareholder payout has grown from 0 64 annually in 2016 to 2 04 in 2021 getting to 10 000 in passive dividend income the average dividend yield across these five stocks is 3 48 to turn that yield into 10 000 in annual passive income you d need roughly 290 000 in the dividend paying assets chances are you don t have an extra 290 000 sitting around but you can build to that number with some planning as you ll see in the table below investing 960 monthly for 15 years sets you up to reach that 290 000 milestone in case 960 monthly is a stretch right now the table also shows projections for smaller monthly investments monthly contribution projected balance after 15 years approx passive income at 3 48 yield 300 90 000 3 130 600 180 000 6 200 750 226 000 7 800 960 290 000 10 000 the numbers assume your investments grow 7 on average annually that s a reasonable growth rate for periods of 10 years or more as long as you reinvest your dividends next steps to passive income if you re committed to developing a passive income stream with dividend stocks your next step is research dive deeper into these buffett stocks and other companies that interest you then make your plan and start investing now s a good time to kick off that plan too stock prices are down which in turn pushes yields higher those trends create opportunities for the longer term investor who in buffett s words is ready to be greedy when others are fearful
the answer lies in one thing women aren t doing for the last several decades a curious statistic has kept popping up in various studies all over the world it seems women tend to generate a consistently higher rate of return than men when it comes to investing this was first reported by a research team from the university of california at berkeley the research found that out of 35 000 brokerage accounts observed over six years the female investors outperformed the males by over a percentage point as if a sample population of that size wasn t enough several other research projects have reported similar findings most recently fidelity it found that out of a group of 5 million fidelity customers women outperformed men by nearly half a percentage point over a 10 year period those percentages might not sound like a substantial outperformance but over decades the result can be tens of thousands of extra dollars in your account the reason behind the outperformance vanguard s 2022 how america saves report sheds light on the disparity by explaining that women tend to trade 50 less than men in other words men are moving in and out of positions at a 50 higher rate than women that might not be the only reason behind the disparity in returns but the fact that men are trading stocks at a much higher rate has to be one of the main drivers why overtrading hurts your portfolio investing is a unique discipline in that the more you do things the worse your performance tends to be the late founder of the vanguard group jack bogle talked about the harm trading does to returns in his book the clash of the cultures investment vs speculation where he attributes it to mutual fund underperformance in the mutual fund industry for example the annual rate of portfolio turnover for the average actively managed equity fund runs to almost 100 ranging from a hardly minimal 25 for the lowest turnover quintile to an astonishing 230 for the highest quintile 100 portfolio turnover means the portfolio looks entirely different from one year to the next if the goal is to own great businesses for long periods of time it s no wonder mutual funds have underperformed with astronomically high turnover rates trading deactivates your greatest advantage the biggest reason to trade minimally is because the more you trade the less compounding your portfolio will experience compound interest works in favor of patient investors because it starts slowly but snowballs over long periods of time even the greatest investor of our time warren buffett earned 99 of his wealth after his 50th birthday which demonstrates how incredibly powerful compound interest is if you re patient enough to experience it unfortunately many investors are more interested in chasing the next sector or stock they think will blow up in the near term than in holding high quality companies for the long term bogle took this to heart as he pioneered low loss low turnover index funds and frequently made statements like this every piece of data that s ever been produced says that trading is the investor s enemy the more you trade the less you make conclusion invest like a woman i m sure there are deeper psychological or behavioral conclusions we could draw from the gender disparity in investment returns but for us fools the message that is screaming at us is to think long and hard before tinkering with our portfolios if there is an inversely proportional relationship between trading and portfolio performance then we should all strive to invest more like women do and unlike many things in life fortunately that means doing significantly less instead of more
president biden and big oil are at each other s throats at a time when gas prices are at the highest level in history hurting regular americans he points out that big oil companies are enjoying record

its invasion of ukraine in february the national average price of gasoline surpassed 5 a gallon for the first time ever this month prices have edged down by a few cents in recent days but remain elevated exacerbating these high gas prices is a huge shortage in refining capacity in the u s which isn t likely to be resolved any time soon refiners turn crude oil into usable products like gasoline diesel and jet fuel there s just fewer refiners in the u s today than a couple of years ago refining capacity in the u s is about a million barrels a day below what it was prior to the

for presentation at the prestigious american association for cancer research aacr conference engaged td2 a leading oncology focused contract research organization for the development of qn 302 for solid tumors in particular pancreatic cancer extended its research collaboration with university of louisville research foundation for its ras program michael poirier qualigen s chairman and ceo commented we are pleased with all that we accomplished in the first quarter of 2022 as we executed on our mission of putting patients first while maximizing stakeholder value as a diversified life sciences company with respect to our therapeutics pipeline we implemented an exclusive worldwide license agreement with ucl business ltd the commercialization company for university college london to develop qn 302 which now represents our lead therapeutics program qn 302 is a g quadruplex g4 selective transcription inhibitor which we are developing to treat pancreatic cancer prostate cancer as well as other rare solid tumors we also presented in vivo research that demonstrate the potential of the compound to treat multiple cancer types during the aacr conference and at the end of the quarter we announced td2 as our cro we are on track with ind enabling studies this year and we are looking forward to discussing further progress in this development in march we extended and expanded our research agreement with the university of louisville research foundation to develop our ras f platform this facilitates our efforts to generate and select additional compounds fully explore mechanisms within the ras pathway and drive the program towards a lead clinical candidate the end of the quarter also marked our return to fully managing the sales marketing and distribution of fastpack which is our revenue producing diagnostic business as of april 1 2022 we will be entitled to 100 of the revenue from fastpack sales that was previously shared with sekisui the decrease in first quarter revenue represented a one time event due to the expiration of our distribution agreement with sekisui which resulted in sekisui reducing its purchases from us during the quarter as it sold off its remaining inventory prior to termination of the agreement in april we assumed experienced sales professionals from sekisui and our outlook for future quarters continues to show sales growth we expect to demonstrate increased revenues in upcoming quarters the successful development and commercialization of diagnostics is part of our corporate dna and in furtherance of this we recently announced the signing of definitive agreements to acquire a majority stake in nanosynex in a mostly stock deal nanosynex s potentially game changing technology is an antimicrobial susceptibility testing ast platform that aims to provide clinical laboratories worldwide with a rapid accurate and personalized test for bacterial infections with the goal of quickly matching the correct antibiotics to treat a patient s particular infection with nanosynex s technology we aim to make a meaningful impact in the global fight against antibiotic resistant superbugs we believe there is significant potential in this platform and that it provides us with the opportunity to leverage our long standing diagnostics development regulatory and commercial expertise to help bring this platform to market which we believe will enable better targeting of antibiotics for their most suitable uses to ultimately result in faster and more efficacious treatment thereby potentially reducing hospitals mortality and morbidity rates we have also assigned shishir sinha who has expertly managed our fastpack operations to oversee our entire diagnostics business we believe shishir s expertise will be valuable to help that business continue to grow both organically through our newly re acquired distribution rights to fastpack and through the nanosynex partnership concluded mr poirier first quarter financial highlights revenues for the three months ended march 31 2022 were 0 7 million compared to approximately 1 9 million in the same quarter of the previous year all revenues generated during the quarter were from product sales of diagnostic tests product sales declined to 0 7 million from 1 4 million in the same quarter of the previous year due to the termination of our distribution agreement with sekisui diagnostics on march 31 2022 resulting in reduced sales to sekisui during the quarter as it sold off its remaining inventory prior to termination of the agreement

marina warner the english writer lecturer and former president of the royal society of literature is an authority on things that don t exist magic spells monstrous beasts pregnant virgins if the imagination can conjure it she has probably written about it in one of her almost forty books which quarry myths folk and fairy tales and religious texts for the human truths that they reveal the work offers jolts of associative surprise oedipus who blinds himself after sleeping with his mother is linked to the sandman of nursery rhyme who scatters dust in children s eyes to punish forbidden desires in warner s hall of mirrors there s no predicting whose face scheherazade s jorge luis borges s derek walcott s might glide by next warner a regular contributor to the new york review of books and the london review of books is no stranger to controversy alone of all her sex her study of the cult of the virgin mary enraged catholic conservatives with its feminist arguments and she has published blistering essays about how market ideologies deform academia in 2014 she wrote about feeling pushed out of her professorship at the university of essex after she protested the school s treatment of faculty she has also written short fiction and novels the lost father which considers the situation of italian women under fascism was short listed for the booker prize in 1988 and draws on warner s own ancestry her mother ilia grew up in bari and met warner s father when his regiment was deployed in italy in 1944 soon after marina was born in 1946 the family relocated from london to cairo where a cosmopolitan élite flourished against a backdrop of resistance to the west another novel indigo scrutinizes britain s colonial legacy after the cairo fire of 1952 in which egyptian revolutionaries torched hundreds of foreign owned businesses including the warners bookstore the family decamped to belgium and then to cambridge esmond and ilia an unreliable memoir new york review books warner s first full length work of autobiography is out this month and it traces both the early years of her parents union and the residue of her oldest memories to read warner s writing is to appreciate how stories persisting over thousands of years shape and are shaped by the societies that tell them her ability to tease out a stock character s hidden relevance makes her a sought after commentator on modern politics gender relations and internet culture and her willingness to listen when a tale s message is unpalatable when mother goose spews misogyny say rather than sisterly empowerment distinguishes her from a crop of scholars who seek to press our collective dreams and nightmares into ideological service i recently spoke to warner about myths metoo and her turn to memoir our conversation has been edited for clarity as a mythographer you study the roots of all stories do you often have aha moments while reading the news this is just like odysseus and the sirens it s not quite as one to one i m constantly marvelling at how the vicissitudes of human existence are covered by these very ancient texts it s really quite strange that people from so long ago seem to have understood so much and if you re looking at things like sexual relations it s amazing there s hardly a permutation that has not been covered by a myth they knew everything i remember once hearing john berger give a lecture it was about art and it took place in a disused station of the london underground and we went down to the very bottom and as we did he took us down a time line of art at the beginning we were looking at renaissance portraits and then we were looking at egyptian mummies and then we got to the bottom and we lay down on the platforms like the figures in henry moore s drawings of people sheltering from the blitz and berger came down the tunnel he was a very charismatic man with an amazing voice and his voice came gravelling out of the tunnel he said in the beginning there was no fumbling he was talking about cave paintings the first paintings we have there is something similar in literature in the beginning there was no fumbling gilgamesh is very rich in psychology about death about friendship about love between men and about monsters and the iliad the odyssey as you said these works are inexhaustible is there a story or myth that you think is particularly illuminating of the present moment i suppose the stories that i like illuminate cruelty scenes that give warning about not attending to people s inner worlds one story that has obsessed me for a long time is the story of callisto who is seduced by jupiter he masquerades as the goddess diana to whom callisto as a nymph is vowed when callisto gets pregnant diana throws her out and she s persecuted and scorned that particular triangle of deception and cruelty is illuminating and the way that she wasn t listened to there was no mercy for her so i suppose the lesson there is that we need to listen to people s stories about what has happened to them and then of course there s also a very strong metoo element to jupiter s deception he is in a position of power and destroys someone without power and seems completely unrepentant several years back you offered a stunning reading of the rapunzel story you looked at the beginning in which a pregnant woman so craves the parsley growing in a witch s garden that she steals some and the witch punishes her by taking her baby the baby grows up to be rapunzel the girl with long hair who is locked in a tower i m thinking of the story now because our supreme court seems poised to strike down roe v wade yes i had read a book called the poison principle by gail bell whose grandfather was guilty of murder by poison the author mentioned in passing that parsley was an abortifacient and a poison in great quantities this struck me as an absolute bolt of lightning it s not unusual for fairy tales to not make sense it s part of their charm part of their power but in this case why would the mother crave this particular herb and then apparently not mind giving her child away so that s how i worked it out that the story showed a buried lesson about both the need for abortion and the dangers of seeking or getting one and of course you have the witch too who perhaps offers an insight into women who are childless and want children so the story presents a double meeting of the need in 1994 you gave a series of lectures on managing monsters describing six tropes that you found to be omnipresent in contemporary life the evil mother the male warrior the innocent child the cannibal etc have your thoughts about any of these types evolved since then well they have all continued to flourish in a strange way i m still quite proud of those lectures i m rather surprised that they haven t been superannuated more fully it s a bit alarming the interesting thing about the diabolical mother is that this is now a subject of women s work there s a lot of writing by women about their mothers oppressive role in their lives i d be interested to revisit the theme in fact because i was first attracted to studying fairy tales because there was so much misogyny in them the same is true of myths and i wondered why that was so because it seemed to me that this was also a female form a kind of writing or storytelling that was very associated with women why did women write and speak against each other in these stories and i think that s an interesting thing that one could continue to explore
the content of this article was relevant at the time of publishing circumstances change continuously and caution should therefore be exercised when relying upon any content contained within this article here are three ways i m coping with the stock market s recent bout of weakness and aiming to build wealth in the longer term the content of this article is provided for information purposes only and is not intended to be nor does it constitute any form of personal advice investments in a currency other than sterling are exposed to currency exchange risk currency exchange rates are constantly changing which may affect the value of the investment in sterling terms you could lose money in sterling even if the stock price rises in the currency of origin stocks listed on overseas exchanges may be subject to additional dealing and exchange rate charges and may have other tax implications and may not provide the same or any regulatory protection as in the uk when investing your capital is at risk the value of your investments can go down as well as up and you may get back less than you put in you re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from the motley fool s premium investing services become a motley fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations in depth research investing resources and more learn more bearish opinions about the stock market seem to be everywhere right now but that doesn t change the long term record of shares as being a decent generator of wealth for example in the uk the lead ftse 100 index has delivered multi bagging returns since it started in 1984 at the level of 1 000 and billionaire us investor warren buffett pointed out that america s s p 500 index has over decades delivered total returns annualised at about 10 a year setbacks along the way and those outcomes have been despite the many dips downturns wars and recessions along the way indeed the fortunes of businesses and stocks vary from time to time and that s especially true over the short term but if i invest in quality growing businesses with a long runway of growth it s possible to experience a decent long term investment outcome although that s not always true because all shares come with risks as well as positive potential one of the key drivers of a good long term stock investment can be buying at a fair price in the first place valuation matters and the recent collapse of many overpriced growth stocks has demonstrated that truism once again but periods of weakness in the markets can be some of the best times to find quality businesses trading on fair valuations although i admit getting interested in shares can be difficult emotionally during such conditions my own method of coping involves three strands firstly i m keeping up my regular monthly investments into my low cost index tracker funds my strategy hinges on investing those monthly sums through thick and thin and i m hoping that approach will help to deliver a long term outcome that matches the market ignoring the headlines secondly i m targeting the shares of individual companies with my crash helmet on i m trying to ignore the economic and geopolitical headlines instead i m focusing on my watch list of great businesses and looking for good value entry points a key part of that strategy is to focus on the news flowing from the businesses that interest me thirdly i m holding on tight to the shares of the great businesses i already own and that s despite weakness in their share prices in many cases but as long as the original investment thesis continues to hold up there s no need to sell my aim is to look past short term volatility in operations and share prices in the longer term the investment outcome may be satisfactory but of course that s not guaranteed these are uncertain times that s for sure but there s always something to worry about and that s why we have the old adage that stock markets tend to climb a wall of worry despite recent setbacks and ongoing worries i m certain the stock market has lost none of its potential to make me rich over time so i m keeping my investing nose to the grindstone and carrying on
inflation is running at better than 8 the greatest rate in more than 40 years your weekly grocery shop is setting you back nearly 11 more today than it did a year ago and fuel oil is costing you double what it did this time last year i m not telling you anything you don t already know but i do have a point this pressure on your retirement budget especially if that budget is modest and fixed is not a reason to give up on the idea of retiring no the answer to surviving our inflationary age is to take your retirement on the road not everywhere in the world is experiencing inflation at the same rate plus in many many appealing places to retire overseas the cost of living is so much lower than in the states to begin with that inflation would have to do its thing for a long long time before it d increase your monthly costs beyond a very affordable level americans 65 years and older are spending a mean of us 47 579 per year or us 3 965 per month in many of the world s top retirement havens that budget will buy you a luxury level lifestyle what if you re retiring on less than maybe much less than us 4 000 per month no problem here are three tempting places to retire well on half that budget or less 1 chitré panama chitré is a beach town along panama s pacific coast about a three and a half hour drive west of capital panama city it s a small town with a population under 10 000 people but because it s a local hub of commerce and transport it offers the conveniences of a much bigger city including shopping banks health care legal services real estate agents and more this makes life convenient for retirees chitré receives limited tourism attention and has a small expat community so prices for everything remain low the cost of living is highly customizable and depends on your lifestyle preferences if you eat at local restaurants that serve traditional panamanian fare you ll pay about us 5 to us 10 for a full meal versus us 20 to us 25 at the international restaurants if you shop for local produce and seafood at the open air market you ll spend about us 100 per month on groceries versus about us 425 shopping at supermarkets for imported goods which cost a premium you can further reduce expenses by living in a central part of town and getting around on foot rather than by car one thing you can t skimp out on here is air conditioning for your home which will run up a monthly electricity bill of about us 125 depending on use and the size of the space you are cooling on a monthly basis a couple can expect to spend about us 1 600 if they own their own home in chitré or about us 2 000 if they rent with a minimalist lifestyle you could get by here on as little as us 600 per month about 500 expats call chitré home aside from the low cost of living and diverse amenities they are attracted here by friendly small town environment warm weather and excellent beaches including the opportunity to own affordable beachfront property for all of these reasons we ve named chitre the number one place to retire well on a budget in panama 2 chiang mai thailand southeast asia is one of the world s most inexpensive places to live but quality of life is not equally distributed across the region a top choice for balancing a low cost of living with a high standard of life is chiang mai a city in northern thailand it s known for its relaxed pace of life and high quality infrastructure including top quality hospitals restaurants and shopping a big expat community made up of people from all over the world bases itself here including many digital nomads who take advantage of the opportunity to earn a strong currency while spending relatively weak thai baht in the united states the average social security payment is us 1 658 in 2022 but in chiang mai about us 1 200 per month is enough for a nice lifestyle for two this includes rent which is very affordable in this city a two bedroom bungalow with a garden can be rented for about us 285 per month for about us 710 per month you can rent a three bedroom villa with a pool in chiang mai you can save greatly on transportation if using local options for getting around like tuk tuks baht buses and taxis your monthly transport bill could be about us 10 per person compare that to us 624 per month the mean amount americans 65 and older spent on transportation in 2019 the same is true for food eating out may be more cost effective than cooking your own food with the average meal costing about us 3 3 kyrenia northern cyprus northern cyprus offers the best of mediterranean living for a fraction of the price of better known destinations like the south of france or coast of spain while still an off the radar choice for most americans it has a strong expat community mostly made up of brits and other europeans here locals live to great ages because of the stress free existence and healthy diet there are great beaches to go along with near perfect weather with 340 days of sunshine per year with great hospitals and high quality care medical tourism is a burgeoning industry found where the five finger mountains meet in the sea in northern cyprus is kyrenia a quickly developing coastal city of about 46 000 people it boasts seaside hotels restaurants and cafés and a charming old harbor and castle here a two bedroom apartment with a communal pool can be rented for about us 590 per month cypriot food a blend of greek turkish and middle eastern influences is fantastically low cost as well with the cost of restaurant meals ranging between us 3 to us 10 real estate is remarkably affordable in northern cyprus as well it can be as little as one third the cost of similar property just over the border in the republic of cyprus condos in beach resorts with quality shared amenities start at well under us 100 000 which if you ve done any shopping for real estate in the united states lately you ll recognize as a world class bargain sincerely kathleen peddicord founding publisher overseas opportunity letter
president biden and big oil are at each other s throats at a time when gas prices are at the highest level in history hurting regular americans he points out that big oil companies are enjoying record profits the president earlier this month singled out exxonmobil saying the company made more money than god this year gas prices started skyrocketing following a raft of sanctions on russian oil after its invasion of ukraine in february the national average price of gasoline surpassed 5 a gallon for the first time ever this month prices have edged down by a few cents in recent days but remain elevated exacerbating these high gas prices is a huge shortage in refining capacity in the u s which isn t likely to be resolved any time soon refiners turn crude oil into usable products like gasoline diesel and jet fuel there s just fewer refiners in the u s today than a couple of years ago refining capacity in the u s is about a million barrels a day below what it was prior to the pandemic that s left the country unable to meet its fuel needs as more people are commuting traveling and driving as they emerge from the throes of the pandemic so where did all the refineries go some refineries shuttered during the pandemic induced recession in 2020 when demand for gasoline took a nosedive not all of those refineries have come back online the u s had five fewer refineries at the beginning of this year that at the beginning of 2020 when the pandemic hit and demand for oil evaporated during the recession refineries took a big financial hit when the price of gasoline plummeted some refiners threw in the towel they said the numbers just didn t work and closed up shop when you re losing money on doing it what do you do you stop making it and that s when you shut down refineries says denton cinquegrana chief oil analyst at oil price information service eduardo munoz alvarez getty images getty images fire smolders at an oil refinery that triggered several large explosions at the philadelphia energy solutions refining complex on june 21 2019 fire broke out in the early morning that triggered a vat of butane to ignite with an explosion so large that it was detected from space there were other disasters around the same time a philadelphia refinery one of the largest in the country was rocked by explosions a few months before the pandemic in louisiana another refinery was wiped out by hurricane ida both have been shut down oil is not where the future lies underpinning the decisions not to reopen refineries is the fact that the u s is undergoing an energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables the biden administration envisions a future where the world is powered by clean energy rather than oil with its destructive effect on the environment i think the refining executives say well looks like the writing s on the wall cinquegrana says in fact some refiners have repurposed their facilities where instead of making gasoline from oil they re ramping up to produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel out of feed stocks like soybean oil and used cooking oil biden wants a future in renewables but wants oil companies to pump more now of course high demand combined with high prices has led oil companies to make big profits exxonmobil s profit in the first quarter more than doubled from a year earlier meanwhile chevron reported its highest quarterly profit in nearly a decade while shell posted its highest earnings ever so president biden wants them to do more to bring down the price of gasoline justin sullivan getty images getty images petaluma california may 18 a customer pumps gas into their car at a gas station on may 18 2022 in petaluma california photo by justin sullivan getty images at a time of war refinery profit margins well above normal being passed directly onto american families are not acceptable the president wrote in a letter to the heads of seven oil companies earlier this month the president urged oil executives to increase the supply of gasoline and other refined products and to drill for more oil in a bid to bring gas prices down it s no surprise that this is raising eyebrows given the president s stated goals on an energy transition and also his promise to voters on the campaign trail that he would end fossil fuels francisco blanch head of commodities research at bank of america points out that the country is still heavily reliant on gasoline despite those goals the narrative until today was that we were going to be driving electric vehicles by the end of the year so who cares about refined products well it turns out a lot of people need refined products says blanch but could refiners be doing more u s refineries are already going gangbusters right now they re operating above 90 capacity according to the energy information administration and expected to run at 95 for the rest of the summer george frey getty images getty images salt lake city ut may 24 a driver unloads raw crude oil from his tanker to process into gas at marathon refinery on may 24 2022 in salt lake city utah photo by george frey getty images as for turning back on idled refineries that s not a quick fix either it would take months to bring the refineries back online and it would be costly for the refiners cinquegrana from oil price information service says that from the refiners perspective it doesn t make financial sense to invest in additional oil refining given the broader transition you re talking about a lot of money to get these refineries that are idled up and running when i m being told five years from now we hope you don t exist cinquegrana says the united states hasn t seen a major new refinery built since the 1970s and there s a good chance it never will chevron ceo mike wirth recently stated as much in an interview with bloomberg my personal view is there will never be another refinery built in the united states wirth said copyright 2022 npr to
