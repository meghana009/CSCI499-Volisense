savings behemoth ns i continues to do what most banks and building societies currently refuse to entertain which is give savers a fairer deal having increased interest rates on direct saver and income bonds to a half decent 0 5 per cent it has now given its three year green savings bond a much needed reboot previously as unappealing as a night out on dartmoor with storm eunice in rant and rage mode the latest issue of the bonds will pay guaranteed interest equivalent to 1 3 per cent a year this is double the rate offered to those who bought the bonds last october when they were launched a rate i described as at best parsimonious at worst insulting a good sign all banks and building societies should follow ns i s lead and heed our campaign to give savers a rate rise the green bond is not without its flaws the rate isn t the best available on a three year bond it comes nowhere near matching inflation like storm eunice raging away and you don t receive the interest until the bond matures and when you do get it all the income will be taxed in the year of receipt through prudent use of the tax free personal savings allowance currently 1 000 a year for basic rate taxpayers 500 for those paying 40 per cent tax any tax can be mitigated all that now remains is for ns i to increase the rate on its direct isa from 0 35 per cent an insult to 0 5 per cent the same as its taxable equivalent and for all banks and building societies to follow this organisation s lead and heed our campaign to give savers a rate rise look at history of companies you invest in irrespective of whether our savings or investments are green or a whiter shade of pale we all save and invest to make a return on our money although looking under the bonnet of an investment fund before buying it is an imperative it is also good to look at the history behind some of the companies you re invested in personally i m more comfortable investing in a fund that has been around the block a few times than one that has just launched and offers no more than a promise it s why i m drawn to some of the stock market listed investment trusts that have been quietly going about their business for more than 100 years in the process generating a mix of income and capital return for example the likes of foreign colonial 1868 mercantile 1884 scottish american 1873 and bankers 1888 some of these centenarians have fascinating histories none more so than edinburgh worldwide now managed by baillie gifford this 970million trust celebrated its 125th anniversary last year and to mark the occasion baillie gifford has published a book on its history written by investment trust guru john newlands it s a fascinating read demonstrating that the trust like many others has always been at the forefront of technological change back in the late 19th century it was a big investor in the railroads today it s investing in the electric car revolution its biggest holding is tesla and companies that are developing new therapeutic treatments the likes of us listed alnylam pharmaceuticals this relentless focus on the future does not always reap short term returns over the past year its technology heavy portfolio has fallen in price by nearly 43 per cent but longer term it delivers results five year gains of 118 per cent readers can get free copies of newlands book either download one at www bailliegifford com ewit125 or email me and i ll send you a hard copy readers add their own tips to beat the squeeze a massive thanks to readers who contacted me saying how much they enjoyed our 50 tips to beat the cost of living squeeze published in last week s wealth section of course you were not backward in coming forward with your own ideas none more so than one of personal finance s longest and most vocal readers eddie browne his tips ensure any life insurance policies are written in trust thereby exempting them from potential inheritance tax with any payout sidestepping the laborious probate process and use a self invested personal pension to save for the future because you can nominate whoever you like a spouse children or a charity to receive the fund upon your death
washington d c used to be a popular destination for tourists school groups and others who want to visit our nation s capital if you visited the city now you could be able to tour many of its most popular attractions and see the sights but one prominent american institution remains closed off to the general public the u s capitol building for nearly two years the symbol of our great republic has been off limits to the people of that republic house speaker nancy pelosi d ca has kept the capitol locked down while much of the country moves on the capitol visitor center remains closed and visits to house of representatives offices have been limited to official business visitors who must register beforehand some of these visitors have even been allegedly subject to extensive background searches by the capitol police the senate has restarted small guided tours but otherwise tour groups have not been able to behold the majesty of the rotunda or look for the representatives of their home states in statuary hall the house gallery remains closed meaning visitors cannot see debate or voting taking place live on the house floor restrictions in the house office buildings mean no constituents can come by offices to see if their member of congress is in the public is not allowed to show up to the capitol meanwhile many members of congress do not bother to show up thanks to proxy voting rules that allow them to give their vote to someone else i believe proxy voting is unconstitutional and at the very least inappropriate furthermore the opportunity for abuse over time is unacceptably high it strains credulity to believe that proxy voting is merely a matter of public health after all when the vote for speaker happened in 2021 before the rules for proxy voting were instituted in this congress members of congress who had recently tested positive for covid were on the floor casting their votes for speaker pelosi now with the house narrowly divided between 222 democrats and 211 republicans two seats are currently vacant proxy voting allows democrats to prevail in close votes wherever their members might be i suspect proxy voting has more to do with power than with protection from the coronavirus coronavirus case counts in the district of columbia have dropped sharply since the beginning of the year and the seven day average of deaths as of february 15 was zero even the district s liberal city government plans to end most of its vaccine and mask mandates they made that announcement on february 14 just a few days after speaker pelosi extended proxy voting to at least march 30 many americans have been at work throughout the pandemic others have returned as vaccines natural immunity and other factors decreased the risk of covid compared to the toll of remaining isolated the house of representatives should be no different before the pandemic i enjoyed greeting school groups visiting the capitol or meeting with constituents in my office that is part of my job so too are the interactions with other members of congress that happen on the house floor in committee rooms or in the hallways that lend themselves to problem solving on legislation or other issues facing the nation but these conversations are happening less or not at all as long as speaker pelosi keeps the capitol closed i ve signed a letter to speaker pelosi led by congressman andy biggs r az calling on her to reopen the capitol and to end its mask mandate immediately in light of the district of columbia lifting its covid restrictions the capitol is not a medieval castle retracting its drawbridge across the moat it is a symbol of our representative government and should be as open to the people as possible it should not be the last institution of the land to reopen its doors it is after all the people s house it is past time for speaker pelosi to end proxy voting return committees to in person hearings and open the doors to visitors again when that day comes my team and i look forward to welcoming you to the capitol when you are in washington d c if you have questions concerns or comments feel free to contact my office you can call my abingdon office at 276 525 1405 my christiansburg office at 540 381 5671 or my washington office at 202 225 3861 to reach my office via email please visit my website at www morgangriffith house gov also on my website is the latest material from my office including information on votes recently taken on the floor of the house of representatives morgan griffith represents the ninth district of virginia in the u s house of representatives
prosecutors and anti sex trafficking advocates aren t happy with the government s treatment of backpage from the thanks for making everything worse dept kamala harris former california attorney general and current us senator may have failed in her attempt to take backpage down but her dubious legacy lives on the same day the us supreme court denied certification to an appeal of a decision in favor of backpage and its section 230 protections backpage shut down its adult ads rather than face additional prosecution persecution from misguided politicians like harris while all those who went after backpage pat themselves on the back for making no difference whatsoever in the battle against sex traffickers those involved in the day to day work of tracking down sex traffickers down aren t nearly as thrilled as has been noted here on multiple occasions shutting down a service used by some for illegal activity just buries the illegal activity even deeper underground backpage s adult ad closure means traffickers will be moving to other venues ones not being actively watched by law enforcement no doubt including sites they re not even aware of as for sex workers who used backpage to advertise adult services they ve simply moved their ads to other sections of the site so all the grandstanding has done nothing to harm sex traffickers it has done a bit of damage to sex workers but it s caused the most harm to law enforcement david meyer lindenberg of fault lines points out that those actually involved with the fight against sex trafficking are angered by the vindictive prosecution of backpage it may have helped net kamala harris a new job where she can screw things up at the federal level but it s done nothing to combat trafficking he highlights a handful of quotes from a miami herald article on the backpage adult ad shutdown it would be a mistake for investigators or prosecutors to assume that trafficking will decrease because of the shutdown of backpage s escort ads said jane anderson a former miami dade assistant state attorney who now works for aequitas an anti human trafficking resource organization for prosecutors in fact investigators and prosecutors must now be even more proactive and resourceful to uncover trafficking that is occurring on lesser known websites including other areas of backpage it s a symbolic crusade said kimberly mehlman orozco an author and criminology professor at george mason university who serves an expert witness in human trafficking cases they re trying to get some accolades and look like the heroes it s having a negative effect on the ability for law enforcement to rescue victims and prosecute offenders the best we can do is facilitate the capabilities of police to investigate that s the damage done whether or not you believe backpage was used by sex traffickers realistic stats on sex trafficking are almost nonexistent and almost any law enforcement sweep designed to haul in traffickers just nets a bunch of consenting adults what s never found is anything approaching the horror stories used to turn hysteria into perpetual funding the theory that thousands of teens are being forced to perform sexual acts by traffickers and most ridiculously shuttled around the country to serve attendees of major events ranging from the super bowl to local stock shows as lindenberg notes the only people celebrating this amazingly hollow victory are those who abused their power to target a site over third party content it s notable how few people have come forward to defend what happened the most vocal messages of support came from the participants themselves who made a point of congratulating each other for their role in bringing it about and when florida prosecutors and the staff of reason magazine agree that an act of government was ill advised you can be pretty sure it wasn t the greatest idea ever that s how government power works it s rarely effective and it almost always results in unintended losses filed under cda 230 human trafficking kamala harris law enforcement prosecutors section 230 sex trafficking companies backpage

for much of the last two years i have used this column to laud the steps that were being taken in the virginia general assembly with the support of then gov ralph northam to bring virginia into the modern era virginia has a rich history but one that is also shrouded in controversy there is a tendency on the part of long time virginians to want to focus on the earliest history of the commonwealth in the new nation with an emphasis on the virginia statute of religious freedom the declaration of independence authored by a virginian and the virginia declaration of rights that served as a model for the federal bill of rights unfortunately the history that surrounded that era is not so glorious forgotten until recent times were the indigenous people who were forced out with the settlement of the colony and new state the horrors of slavery a civil war in which the state was a major battleground and a white supremacist government until recent years the shift in attitudes was not confined to virginia alone as movements such as black lives matter forced us to examine our history and our actions under the laws as they had been written the success of democrats at the polls to control both houses of the general assembly as well as the governorship and lieutenant governor and attorney general s offices brought about the amazing changes in the laws of virginia in 2020 and 2021 virginia moved into a leadership role in rewriting its election laws to make them among the most progressive in the nation early voting was instituted absentee voting was permitted without the need for an excuse and voting generally was made more accessible laws against all forms of discrimination were passed and hate crime laws were strengthened common sense gun control laws were passed including my universal background checks bill major steps were taken to end the classroom to prison pipeline and laws that were unevenly applied to racial minorities were repealed or revised symbols that represented the oppressive period of our history were removed our educational institutions moved to interpret our history more broadly to be inclusive of all persons who lived in the state i was feeling good that democracy was expanded we were becoming more inclusive our criminal justice system was being reformed and our communities were becoming safer and then there was the election of 2021 democrats lost the majority in the house of delegates and republicans swept the statewide elections of governor lieutenant governor and attorney general in the current session of the general assembly bills have been introduced to turn back all the progress that had been made over the last two years the clock is being turned back to the more conservative virginia that many of us have been struggling to get past for many years all the bills are passing in the republican controlled house of delegates fortunately democrats have a majority in the state senate that will be able to defeat these republican measures and our progressive measures will remain in place we must be eternally vigilant to ensure that while progress might be impeded it is not lost ken plum is a member of the virginia house of delegates
new residential construction has lagged in connecticut during the pandemic and experts say it s impacting the state s affordable housing stock ned gerard hearst connecticut media shaurice bacon feels stuck in her housing an apartment with not quite enough space for her family she s lived in public housing in bridgeport for two decades she s looked for other low cost apartments applied to housing choice voucher programs and explored rent to own options she s widened her search to include hartford new haven new britain and anywhere in fairfield county but she hasn t found anything available in her price range advertisement article continues below this ad no matter how much i change it around how much i rearrange my furniture redecorate i feel like i m stuck bacon said no state in the country has enough housing that s available and affordable for the lowest income renters connecticut lacks 86 717 rental units that are available and affordable to tenants with extremely low incomes according to estimates from the national low income housing coalition for bacon that means she and her two sons are crowded into a small apartment she got the place when she was young and pregnant with her first daughter unsure of what exactly the move would mean for other connecticut residents with low incomes it means they re rent burdened paying more than a third of their income to housing costs advertisement article continues below this ad new residential construction particularly of multifamily housing has lagged in connecticut for years a problem that s been exacerbated by the pandemic industry experts said through the pandemic developers have seen rising costs of materials and labor for new construction projects and a portion of what s been built has been billed as luxury housing not affordable for people with lower incomes it s always been a challenge so you know developers can t really produce housing that s affordable for the lowest income renters said andrew aurand vice president for research at the national low income housing coalition i think what we ve seen during the pandemic is we ve seen construction costs increase even before the pandemic we were hearing about labor shortages last year saw drops in total building permits as well as a shift in the proportion of multifamily buildings compared to single family housing advertisement article continues below this ad as of the end of november housing with five or more units represented just over 37 percent of new starts in 2020 it was more than 55 percent and in 2019 it was 59 percent according to permit data compiled by the state department of economic community development and for the first time since 2018 connecticut wasn t predicted to surpass 4 400 new housing units in a year for 2021 the biggest barrier to building more multifamily housing in connecticut is restrictive municipal zoning laws experts developers and state officials said a couple of groups have announced legislative goals that aim to reform zoning law these include introducing a fair share law that would set requirements for localities to create more affordable housing units reducing minimum lot sizes and allowing mixed income housing near train stations among other measures advertisement article continues below this ad we know that in connecticut we need more housing overall said nick abbott deputy coordinator at desegregatect our permitting of new homes in 2021 at least of the first 11 months was the lowest it had been in a comparable period over a decade the group s 2022 legislative agenda includes a measure to push transit oriented communities by allowing mixed income housing near train stations they re also advocating for smaller lot sizes to allow more housing to be built on parcels of land desegregatect is also promoting allowing municipalities to create unified land use commissions by merging commissions with nearby towns according to its website a new coalition of about 20 organizations is also pushing for a fair share law in connecticut that would require municipalities to build a share of affordable housing to meet needs determined by the state the overall initiative is called growing together connecticut advertisement article continues below this ad the state would also set incentives and enforcement tactics said erin boggs executive director of the open communities alliance the alliance is an organizing member on the steering committee from our perspective connecticut has this sort of dual housing crisis boggs said in an interview on one hand we are one of the most expensive states in the country and on the other we are one of the most segregated opponents of zoning reform bills introduced last year said it took too much power away from localities and pushed one size fits all solutions for housing affordability on connecticut s towns officials representing greenwich darien and parts of stamford were among those who spoke out against the changes advertisement article continues below this ad connecticut towns are working on developing plans to increase the stock of affordable housing plans must be submitted by july under the law and should be amended every five years in this day and age you re seeing it more that a percentage of homes are being put aside for affordability said greg ugalde president of t m building co inc melissa kaplan macey vice president of state programs and connecticut director at the regional plan association said simplifying the process for developers and making it clearer exactly how long it will take would help i think one of the easiest things we could do is to streamline the process and to make it transparent for everyone kaplan macey said advertisement article continues below this ad zoning regulations that don t allow for larger scale multifamily housing in certain parts of town have made it difficult for developers to find enough land to build on the more units that can be placed in a space the more affordable it is to build said nandini natarajan chief executive officer of the connecticut housing finance authority and delays with getting permitting can make the process longer which adds cost she said it takes a special developer with deep pockets to really stick it out natarajan said the group has recently revised its guidelines for allocating its 10 million low income housing tax credit program advertisement article continues below this ad the program is one of the state s leading funds for establishing affordable housing typically developers pair it with other funding from the state department of housing or other programs operated by the finance authority the updated guidelines aim to bring more resources to underserved communities and include a preapplication process updated distinctions between preservation and construction projects and new sustainability measures the zoning issues also tie in to public infrastructure and access to public water and sewage systems said michael santoro a specialist at the department of housing ugalde said he s hopeful the increased political spotlight on affordable housing issues will affect change that helps make it easier to develop more units advertisement article continues below this ad while bacon s been in her apartment for years and cares about the community she hopes to find something bigger

dividend investing offers more stable returns than growth stocks and these two dividend stocks could be excellent additions to your portfolio today the tsx has not been off to a great start in 2022 the s p tsx composite index has been riddled with volatility over the last several weeks and that trend looks likely to continue at writing the canadian benchmark index is up by 3 93 from its january 27 levels but down by 1 16 from its february 9 2022 levels growth stocks have taken the biggest hit due to the volatility but not all stocks have been affected equally dividend stocks have performed better than growth stocks in today s market environment if you have investment capital ready to deploy today and you want to invest in assets that can offer stable returns dividend investing might be the best way to go today i will discuss two reliable dividend stocks that you could consider for this purpose bank of nova scotia bank of nova scotia tsx bns nyse bns could be an excellent investment to consider if you want to add reliable dividend stocks to your investment portfolio scotiabank is a 112 63 billion market capitalization bank stock with solid domestic and international banking operations the impending interest rate hikes will likely provide a significant boost for all bank stocks in canada by improving profit margins for the financial institutions scotiabank is my top pick among the big six canadian banks right now due to its international exposure the bank has over 2 000 branches in 50 different countries it means that the bank can mitigate its losses if the economy in a particular region is not doing well if the rest of its operations keep performing at writing scotiabank stock trades for 92 52 per share and it boasts a juicy 4 32 dividend yield fortis fortis inc tsx fts nyse fts is a no brainer stock pick for investors looking for dividend stocks to add to their investment portfolios fortis is a 27 05 billion market capitalization utility holdings company it owns and operates several high quality utility businesses across canada the u s central america and the caribbean serving around 3 4 million customers fortis earns almost its entire revenue through highly rate regulated and long term contracted assets it means that the company can generate predictable cash flows regardless of the broader economic environment the non cyclical nature of the company allows its management to fund its investment programs and shareholder dividends comfortably fortis is a canadian dividend aristocrat with a 48 year dividend growth streak fortis stock trades for 57 19 per share at writing and it boasts a juicy 3 74 dividend yield foolish takeaway dividend investing is an excellent way to generate stable returns on your investment provided you can find the right high quality dividend stocks with a reputation for regularly paying shareholder dividends these stocks do not typically offer significant returns through capital gains like growth stocks however these stocks make up for it by having more stability during volatile market conditions and regular dividend payouts if you want to introduce more stability to your investment portfolio due to the high volatility in the tsx right now fortis stock and scotiabank stock could be suitable investments to consider

where is safety the answer is that it is almost certainly in america but that all depends on the wisdom of the federal reserve in washington dc where i am writing this column confidence has been hit by three blows first came the crash in the share price of the high tech us giants a crash only partially reversed then came growing evidence of the surge in inflation worldwide and the prospect of much faster increases in interest rates than the markets expected even a few weeks ago and now there are the tensions between russia and ukraine and the real possibility of war in europe moving in the right direction the us is the traditional safe haven for investors in troubled times so whereas this year seemed likely to be one of a steady solid global recovery as the threat of covid 19 retreated and global supply chains returned to normality it has so far been at best disappointing and at worst rather frightening faced with all this where will troubled investors place their funds the answer will i think be mostly in america the us is the traditional safe haven in troubled times where else do you go there is the classic home for funk money in gold but that is a relatively small market the total value of all the gold in the world is only 10trillion and a lot of that is locked up in central bank reserves equity markets are in a different league us equities that is the value of the companies quoted on us stock exchanges are worth roughly 55trillion while global equities some 100trillion there are the new and untried assets in the shape of cryptocurrencies but notwithstanding all the hype they are quite small the total value of all cryptocurrencies is less than 2trillion in any case i think the pitch that they give protection against inflation is absurd they are assets for frothy markets not for fearful ones as for any form of fixed interest security aside from index linked ones there is zero protection against inflation and bond values have plunged as interest rates climb so where else europe not a brilliant idea if there is going to be a war though there are many great enterprises across the continent investors will inevitably focus on europe s dependence on russian gas and the more general disruption the region faces there will be a price shock if russia invades even if it does not restrict gas supplies and the price shock comes at absolutely the wrong time the uk yes as argued increasingly by the equity strategists there is at least some value in london listed companies and the footsie has performed relatively well this year but the market is too small to absorb a flood of global funds what europe and the uk do offer are plenty of ways into another traditional safe haven in inflationary times commodity and energy companies but these are sectors that many investors shun because of environmental concerns whether those concerns are justified is a separate question the point here is that they are not as useful a hedge as they were in previous cycles so the argument keeps coming back to america apart from china where there are other obvious risks it has had the strongest recovery of any large economy up more than 3 per cent on its pre pandemic peak that momentum will carry it forward through this year and while the dollar is somewhat overvalued as measured by its purchasing power parity that is largely due to its safe haven status i do think the dollar could come back a bit this year just as i think that many of the most fashionable high tech companies are overvalued but while the federal reserve maintains the confidence of the markets the dollar s safe haven status is secure therein lies the core of the case for investing in america do you trust the fed to do the right thing there is a political debate here in washington as to the extent to which large corporations are exacerbating inflation by taking advantage of their market positions to widen their margins but that is not the prime driver of inflation the plain truth is that the economy is running hot too hot the challenge for the fed is how to cool it down by increasing interest rates but do so without scuppering the entire economic recovery i m worried about the burden on it as i know people in the fed are worried too fiscal policy is too loose which increases the load on monetary policy but i trust it and i judge the global investment community will trust it too
for many investors a reliable income stream from dividends is the holy grail at present that grail is largely composed of copper gold and even vanadium as much of the dividend growth from the uk stock market is coming from the mining and resources sector mining giants glencore and bhp both announced record dividends in the past few days and while some investors may have issues about their environmental credentials it should not be forgotten that it is these companies that are supplying some of the materials that are driving the transformation of the global economy towards a more sustainable one liquid assets much of the dividend growth from the uk stock market is coming from the mining and resources sector it s a point made by rob crayfourd a resources fund manager at new city investment managers he says when people talk about energy transition they think hydrogen lithium for batteries solar and wind but most of the listed companies involved in this process have share prices that are trading at expensive levels however the mining companies that produce the materials being used by these companies have share prices which could be viewed as undervalued especially given the strong earnings they are generating while investing in mining stocks is not without its risks they might give your portfolio an income boost unearth stocks with a rich heritage unlike some of today s technology stocks the mining and resources stocks listed on the london stock exchange have a long history it s worth understanding where they come from and how they have changed to decide which stocks are for you and the risks of investing in the sector the first thing to note is that you probably already have exposure to mining and commodity stocks if you re an investor in uk funds or an index tracking investment fund jason hollands managing director of wealth platform bestinvest says that basic resources businesses make up eight per cent of the ftse100 index by value the miners included in this index have a rich history for example bhp billiton which has its roots in the broken hill proprietary company of new south wales has grown and diversified into a behemoth with mining interests worldwide meanwhile rio tinto was founded in 1873 by investors who wanted to reopen ancient copper mines near the red river rio tinto in spanish near huelva in southern spain even glencore a relative newcomer to the stock market was set up in a different world from today by commodity experts wanting to trade zinc the miners have transformed their stated purpose over time far from the world of gold rush australia bhp s website now states that it provides products to help build a better clearer future while rio tinto says we produce materials essential to human progress glencore meanwhile promises that it is responsibly sourcing the commodities that advance everyday life yet legacy issues do plague some mining companies glencore announced in the last few days that it has set aside 1billion to deal with bribery and corruption probes while rio tinto released a damning report into its workplace culture citing systemic bullying sexual harassment and racism so while these companies are transforming themselves into sustainable businesses there is always the risk that their history and continued use of fossil fuels in the extraction of metals will dog their attempts to move forward tap into resources for a sustainable future despite these problems miners have a lot going for them in the current environment the price of mining stocks is heavily correlated with that of commodities which have gone up sharply in recent months miners have also done a good job in recent years in being more disciplined about costs which has allowed them to pay juicy dividends to their shareholders chris beauchamp chief mining analyst at online trading platform ig says the steady stream of dividends the sector provides investors with will only become more attractive bhp currently pays shareholders an annual income equivalent to 10 per cent of their investment while anglo american pays five per cent bhp shares are up 13 5 per cent over the past 12 months while anglo s are up nearly 28 per cent mark smith who runs investment fund amati specialist metals says high metal prices are likely to be sustained in the short term as the metals are required to move towards a more renewable energy future there s going to be a role for all these metal miners in this new green decarbonised world he predicts ig s beauchamp says the best approach that investors can adopt is to buy into the big mining companies which are extracting a variety of commodities he adds it still makes sense to stick with the big diversified miners with their broad range of activities and geographic exposure providing a measure of protection from any downturn in individual commodity demand bestinvest s hollands believes anglo american represents one of the better investment opportunities he says its interests span iron ore copper platinum and diamonds by 2024 around 50 per cent of its earnings will come from copper a metal that is a key component in electric vehicle batteries as well as the wiring for semi conductors he adds although the future is uncertain what is certain is that there will be more electric cars on the roads and semi conductors will be used in all facets of our lives from health care through to artificial intelligence try funds that invest on profitable metals if you d rather not buy individual stocks there are numerous investment funds that will give exposure to rising metal prices darius mcdermott managing director of wealth platform chelsea financial services suggests blackrock world mining trust as a good way to get exposure to a rising copper price its biggest holdings are in brazilian mining company vale bhp glencore and anglo american matthew read of investment trust research group quoteddata prefers fund cqs natural resources growth income because of its ability to hunt down less well researched commodity companies hollands says a more diversified approach is to buy a fund such as rwc uk equity income which has 10 per cent of its portfolio invested in basic materials stocks its largest position is a 5 9 per cent investment in anglo american but it also holds gold miners newmont and barrick gold be prepared for a bumpy ride however you choose to invest in mining stocks it is important to be aware that it is not likely to be a steady uneventful ride mining stocks are notoriously volatile hollands warns because the cost of extracting metals is high when commodity prices change even slightly it can have a major impact on profits he adds essentially mining equities amplify movements in underlying commodity prices specialist mining funds therefore carry considerable risk and are not for the faint hearted only buy them as part of a wider investment portfolio

mental clarity and focus how do keto diet pills aid weight loss before you can understand exactly how keto diet tablets aid weight loss you need to have a basic understanding of the concept of ketosis ketosis is a metabolic state in which the body uses fat for energy instead of carbohydrates glucose is the most common form of energy used by the body simply because it is in abundance in most typical diets if you significantly reduce your consumption of carbs however you ll limit the body s supply of glucose as a result it will have to turn to another fuel source fat when your body starts burning fat for fuel it s called ketosis the most effective way to enter ketosis is to reduce carb consumption to 20 to 50g of carbs per day while increasing fat consumption protein intake should be moderated because in high amounts it can be converted into glucose the ketogenic diet is a diet specifically designed to help the body enter a state of ketosis here are the most common types of the ketogenic diet standard ketogenic diet skd cyclical ketogenic diet ckd targeted ketogenic diet tkd high protein ketogenic diet once you ve entered a state of ketosis it s important to stay there if you want to lose weight and enjoy the other health benefits associated with low carb diets like keto following the keto diet can help lower blood pressure and triglyceride levels improve insulin sensitivity and may even slow the progression of alzheimer s disease no matter what type of ketogenic diet you re following taking a keto diet supplement could help you get the results you want even faster keto diet pills claim to speed up the transition into ketosis and may help you avoid symptoms of keto flu in the process keto diet pill benefits may vary depending on the formulation however so be sure to do your research some keto diet pills contain exogenous ketones which are the key to jump starting a keto diet by increasing ketone levels in the blood the best keto diet pills help the body start burning fat for fuel sooner these benefits will be amplified if you re already following a ketogenic diet but some keto supplements claim to support ketosis without a strict ketogenic diet how to choose the best keto supplements before putting anything into your body you need to be sure what it is and how it might affect you this is true for all dietary supplements but especially diet pills some diet pills are filled with stimulants and potentially harmful ingredients that you want to avoid if you want to lose weight the keto diet is a great tool to use even if you follow the diet however you may find it challenging to hit the right macronutrient ratio you may even want to bypass the whole transition process and get right into ketosis that s where keto diet tablets come into place before you buy however make sure to do your research here are some things to look for in the best keto diet pills exogenous ketones ketones are the key to the keto diet they are a substance found in the blood and urine when the body is burning fat for energy instead of glucose in diabetics high ketone levels can be a sign of ketoacidosis a potentially life threatening condition in keto dieters however high ketone levels are a good indication that the body has entered a state of ketosis following the keto diet is the best way to increase ketone levels but taking exogenous ketones in the form of keto diet pills can help there are two types of exogenous ketones you ll find in keto diet pills ketone salts and ketone esters the most heavily commercialized of the two is ketone salt this is simply a ketone body combined with a mineral ion frequently sodium in keto diet pills one of the most common forms of exogenous ketones is bhb keto bhb salts beta hydroxybutyrate bhb is the most common type of ketone body used in keto diet pills they re commonly listed as bhb salts because the ketone bodies have been combined with sodium minerals to create ketone salts medium chain triglycerides while the best keto diet pills contain exogenous ketones to help kick start ketosis a keto diet pill can be made even more effective with the addition of medium chain triglycerides mcts in order for the body to burn fat for energy it needs to have an abundance of fat the more fat in your diet and the less glucose the more likely you are to enter ketosis mct oil has become a popular ingredient in a keto diet pill because they are a highly efficient source of energy medium chain triglycerides like mct oil have been shown to support weight loss improve mental clarity and focus and reduce hunger levels it may also encourage the growth of healthy bacteria in the gut in addition to making sure your keto diet pills contain the ingredients you need to get the results you want to make sure they don t contain anything harmful avoid products made with too many artificial additives and look for products that are manufactured in the united states keep in mind that dietary supplements are not regulated to the degree that prescription drugs are so consider buying from a company that uses independent laboratories to verify the purity potency and safety of their products you ll also want to be sure to check the full list of ingredients for the product before you buy not just an overview of the active ingredients potential side effects the keto diet has become incredibly popular especially with celebrity endorsements before you try it yourself however it s important to know what you re getting into the keto diet was originally developed as a medical diet similar to the atkins diet which was created by a cardiologist to control blood sugar and boost metabolism the ketogenic diet was originally developed in the 1920s as a treatment for epilepsy as is true with any medical treatment including specialty diets you should exercise caution when following it according to registered dietitian kathy mcmanus director of the department of nutrition at brigham and women s hospital only the short term effects of the keto diet have been studied mcmanus suggests that it s difficult to know whether the diet is safe for long term use potential risks and side effects that may be associated with the keto diet include nutritional deficiency liver problems kidney problems constipation mood swings brain fog before switching to the ketogenic diet and especially before taking the keto diet pills talk to your doctor any nutritional supplement comes with a risk for side effects so there may be additional side effects to the keto diet pills on top of the keto diet itself dosage every ketogenic pill is different when it comes to dosage because it uses different ingredients some keto pills come in tablet form while others are soft gels so think about what kind of diet pills are easiest for you to swallow before you make your choice though the amount of active ingredients in keto pills may vary from one formulation to another the actual dose you take on a daily basis is fairly standard most keto diet pills have a standard dosage of two capsules per day it s generally best to take your keto fat burner with a glass of water 20 to 30 minutes before a meal final thought if weight loss is your goal the ketogenic diet could help you get there the keto diet is like other low carb diets in that you minimize carbohydrate intake rather than focusing on protein however you ll be consuming high levels of fat to encourage your body to burn fat for fuel rather than glucose fat is a more efficient source of energy so you may enjoy additional benefits like improved mental clarity and focus reduced appetite and higher energy levels the best keto weight loss supplements are formulated with safe effective ingredients they re designed to help you stay in ketosis without following a strict diet and they may help you avoid symptoms of the keto flu if you re considering trying ketogenic pills give one of the products we ve reviewed above a shot frequently asked questions what is ketosis ketosis is a metabolic state in which the body burns fat for fuel instead of glucose following the keto diet a low carb high fat diet is the most efficient way to enter ketosis but keto diet pills can help you get there faster what is the keto flu as you start the keto diet your body will have to adjust to the switch between 2 and 7 days after starting the diet you may experience symptoms like headache fatigue irritability and constipation these are symptoms of keto flu how do keto pills work the main idea behind any keto diet pill is to get you into ketosis faster some keto diet pills claim to help you enter ketosis without following a strict keto diet and many claims to help you avoid symptoms of keto flu how long does it take keto pills to work the efficacy of even the best keto diet pills depends on the kind of diet you follow while keto pills are designed to kick start ketosis they work best in conjunction with a keto diet or otherwise healthy diet many keto diet pills work within about one week are keto diet pills safe while some diet pills for weight loss have been linked to negative health effects keto pills are generally considered safe just be sure to check the ingredients in any keto supplements before you take them and talk to your doctor first as well do i have to follow the keto diet for keto pills to work the keto diet pill industry as a whole claims that you won t have to follow the keto diet in order for ketone supplements to work there doesn t appear to be any clear scientific evidence to support this claim however so you ll most likely get better results if you follow the keto diet while taking ketone supplements how much weight can you lose by taking keto pills it s difficult to predict weight loss with any diet pill and results vary depending on other factors like diet and exercise some pills claim you can lose as much as 5 pounds per week when you first get started and then

year yielding 1 93 down from last week s high of 2 05 mortgage rates have increased sharply as bond yields have spiked one of the reasons mortgage rates have been rising other than interest rates spiking is that demand for mortgages is way up interest rates for bank deposits haven t increased much but if when they do it will be interesting to see if people stop reaching for yield the way they

geopolitical tensions it s no wonder bulls are pulling in their horns here s what fund managers worry about wti crude oil futures steadied this week after rising 9 of the 10 previous weeks up 50 from december lows geopolitical risk is giving energy markets a lift still the big story is that rising global demand is gobbling up supply while spare production capacity shrinks thanks to chronic underinvestment in developing new reserves and then there s the esg factor the geopolitical risk premium in crude oil markets has driven the time spreads to historical wides gold and gold shares have been smoking hot on inflation and especially geopolitical concerns i ve read every weekly issue of the gold monitor published by my friend martin mureenbeeld since 1992 gold producers and institutional investors around the world subscribe to his service if you are seriously interested in gold you can sign up for a free trial on his website in this week s letter martin notes that gold has clearly broken away from the dollar and interest rate factors confirming that the overriding determinant of gold just now is geopolitical the russia ukraine crisis may have added some 100 to the

put a damper on the cad for three weeks the cad stayed in a narrow range between 7825 and 7900 the cad has not reacted to the draconian emergency measures act instituted by the federal government this week i m assuming the market thinks this policy will be very narrowly focused and will quickly blow over however suppose that is not the case in that event i expect to see capital flight from canada to the usa which will be seen as the switzerland of north america by worried canadians and substantially less foreign direct investment in canada you have to wonder if the boy wonder did a cost benefit analysis before he made his draconian announcement not likely the following is my valentine s day tweet following the announcement of the emergency measures act i ve been a huge mordecai richler fan for decades i ve read barney s version six times and watched the movie several times yes i named my dog after barney if mordecai were alive today he would be ripping into the federal government with a venomous pen nobody could do it better busybodies several years ago when i was hosting the moneytalks radio show i referenced an article i d read in the newspaper which quoted a person described as an activist this person was determined that people agree with her vision of how the world should be i explained to my listeners that anytime i read an article that cites an activist i automatically substituted the word busybody my grandmother used the word busybody to describe people who thought they knew best about how other people should spend their time and money when covid came along i realized it would be a busybody s wet dream they would feel morally justified shrieking at other people about how they should behave it turned out to be way worse than i imagined the busybodies were everywhere and lusted for the authority to enforce their views many of the busybodies held elected office and did what they could to make other people do what they thought was best no wonder we re seeing a magnificent decline in people s respect for or confidence in government this loss of confidence will change the world as we know it the trading opportunities will be extraordinary my short term trading i started this week short s p futures from last week i had stayed short over the weekend because the market had been down hard thursday and friday and i thought it would likely fall further this week the market was lower in the sunday overnight session but rallied ahead of the monday day session so i covered my position for a gain of 85 bps i bought the s p tuesday but was stopped for a slight loss and missed the tuesday overnight rally i shorted the market wednesday but was stopped for another slight loss and missed the big thursday friday drop as you can imagine i was mumbling to myself about having my stops too tight in a choppy market but at the end of the week i was flat and my p l was up 0 55 for the week i looked hard at buying bonds and shorting stocks friday i didn t make either trade because they were fomo motivated and i didn t have a good setup i would have been making a bet on things getting worse in ukraine over the long weekend once the olympics were over i cannot handicap the existential ukraine crisis if it gets worse stocks will probably fall and bonds will likely rally as will gold but protecting my capital by not making a bet was the right thing to do quotes from the notebook a good deal of selling takes place because people like the fact that their assets show gains and they re afraid the profits will go away howard marks in his selling out memo january 2022 my comment i m a big howard marks fan i read his book the most important thing illuminated twice you might think it odd that a short term futures trader would take an interest in a value investor who holds positions for years still he is a hugely successful investor with 50 years of experience and i like his way of looking at markets and people s behaviour i ve read his monthly memos for years i recommend him to you there is tons of talk about how central banks have lost control of inflation expectations nothing could be further from the truth markets still have complete confidence that central bankers will control inflation in the coming quarters so far the market believes we have experienced a cyclical inflationary upswing within a secular dis inflationary environment at some point market participants will realize that we are not going back to the post volcker pre covid world when that happens the repricing of assets will be fierce and brutal watch for this shift it will likely prove to be the inflection point for a whole new investing environment kevin muir the next inflationary inflection point the macrotourist february 2022 my comment i lifted this quote from kevin s latest piece on his macrotourist subscription service i read all of his pre subscription essays over four years and became a paid subscriber when he went behind a paywall two years ago his service is worth every penny i highly recommend him to you if i could paraphrase his message it would be the market expects the fed to tighten bonds for instance are not in free fall because the market expects that fed tightening will rein in inflation but eventually the fed will waffle will not keep tightening when they should and then long term higher inflation expectations will really kick into gear and we will enter a whole new investing environment the barney report the golden boy has papa wrapped around his not so little paw i love taking him places to run wild and have a great time when we come home he laps up a bowl of water and falls dead asleep this is the look i get when he thinks it s time for me to take him for another

economists generally see a rise in the cash rate from a record low 0 1 per cent occurring in august which would be the first increase in a decade such talk has been fuelled by inflation rising at its fastest pace in seven years and the unemployment rate falling to a 13 year low of 4 2 per cent even during the disruptions caused by the omicron variant but the rba has repeatedly said it wants to see annual wage growth above three per cent before it considers raising rates the annual rate stood at just 2 2 per cent in the september quarter the december quarter wage price index the key indicator for wages growth used by the rba and treasury will be released on wednesday economists forecasts point to a 0 7 per cent increase for the quarter for an annual rate of 2 4 per cent slightly faster than the rba has been forecasting at this stage of the year forecasts range from a 0 6 per cent to a full one per cent quarterly increase amp capital chief economist shane oliver is forecasting a 0 8 per cent rise in wage growth for the quarter which would be the fastest pace since 2014 our base case remains for an august hike but the risk is heavily skewed towards a start to rate hikes in june dr oliver said an acceleration in wages growth as we expect followed by another upside surprise in inflation for the march quarter and then another solid increase in wages for the march quarter would significantly boost the likelihood of a june rate hike the australian bureau of statistics will also start rolling out december quarter figures that feed into the economic growth result contained in the national accounts due on march 2 with construction data due on wednesday and business investment on thursday so far retail spending is known to have surged by a record 8 2 per cent in the quarter as the economy recovered from the impact of the delta lockdowns ensuring a rebound from the economic contraction in the september quarter economists expect construction work completed in the december quarter rose by 2 1 per cent after a 0 3 per cent decline three months earlier business capital expenditure is forecast to rise by 2 5 per cent after dropping 2 2 per cent in the september quarter meanwhile australian shares look set for a weak start to the week following declines on wall street due to escalating fears of a potential russian invasion of ukraine the dow jones industrial average fell 0 68 per cent to end at 34 079 18 points on friday and ahead of monday s washington s birthday holiday the s p 500 lost 0 72 per cent to 4 348 87 while the nasdaq composite dropped 1 23 per cent to 13 548 07 in response australian share futures dropped 51 points or 0 7 per cent to 7094 on friday the benchmark s p asx200 index closed down 74 5 points or 1 02 per cent to 7221 7 points

her price range advertisement article continues below this ad no matter how much i change it around how much i rearrange my furniture redecorate i feel like i m stuck bacon said no state in the country has enough housing that s available and affordable for the lowest income renters connecticut lacks 86 717 rental units that are available and affordable to tenants with extremely low incomes according to estimates from the national low income housing coalition for bacon that means she and her two sons are crowded into a small apartment she got the place when she was young and pregnant with her first daughter unsure of what exactly the move would mean for other connecticut residents with low incomes it means they re rent burdened paying more than a third of their income to housing costs advertisement article continues below this ad new residential construction particularly of multifamily housing has lagged in connecticut for years a problem that s been exacerbated by the pandemic industry experts said through the pandemic developers have seen rising costs of materials and labor for new construction projects and a portion of what s been built has been billed as luxury housing not affordable for people with lower incomes it s always been a challenge so you know developers can t really produce housing that s affordable for the lowest income renters said andrew aurand vice president for research at the national low income housing coalition i think what we ve seen during the pandemic is we ve seen construction costs increase even before the pandemic we were hearing about labor shortages last year saw drops in total building permits as well as a shift in the proportion of multifamily buildings compared to single family housing advertisement article continues below this ad as of the end of november housing with five or more units represented just over 37 percent of new starts in 2020 it was more than 55 percent and in 2019 it was 59 percent according to permit data compiled by the state department of economic community development and for the first time since 2018 connecticut wasn t predicted to surpass 4 400 new housing units in a year for 2021 the biggest barrier to building more multifamily housing in connecticut is restrictive municipal zoning laws experts developers and state officials said a couple of groups have announced legislative goals that aim to reform zoning law these include introducing a fair share law that would set requirements for localities to create more affordable housing units reducing minimum lot sizes and allowing mixed income housing near train stations among other measures advertisement article continues below this ad we know that in connecticut we need more housing overall said nick abbott deputy coordinator at desegregatect our permitting of new homes in 2021 at least of the first 11 months was the lowest it had been in a comparable period over a decade the group s 2022 legislative agenda includes a measure to push transit oriented communities by allowing mixed income housing near train stations they re also advocating for smaller lot sizes to allow more housing to be built on parcels of land desegregatect is also promoting allowing municipalities to create unified land use commissions by merging commissions with nearby towns according to its website a new coalition of about 20 organizations is also pushing for a fair share law in connecticut that would require municipalities to build a share of affordable housing to meet needs determined by the state the overall initiative is called growing together connecticut advertisement article continues below this ad the state would also set incentives and enforcement tactics said erin boggs executive director of the open communities alliance the alliance is an organizing member on the steering committee from our perspective connecticut has this sort of dual housing crisis boggs said in an interview on one hand we are one of the most expensive states in the country and on the other we are one of the most segregated opponents of zoning reform bills introduced last year said it took too much power away from localities and pushed one size fits all solutions for housing affordability on connecticut s towns officials representing greenwich darien and parts of stamford were among those who spoke out against the changes advertisement article continues below this ad connecticut towns are working on developing plans to increase the stock of affordable housing plans must be submitted by july under the law

melissa kaplan macey vice president of state programs and connecticut director at the regional plan association said simplifying the process for developers and making it clearer exactly how long it will take would help i think one of the easiest things we could do is to streamline the process and to make it transparent for everyone kaplan macey said advertisement article continues below this ad zoning regulations that don t allow for larger scale multifamily housing in certain parts of town have made it difficult for developers to find enough land to build on the more units that can be placed in a space the more affordable it is to build said nandini natarajan chief executive officer of the connecticut housing finance authority and delays with getting permitting can make the process longer which adds cost she said it takes a special developer with deep pockets to really stick it out natarajan said the group has recently revised its guidelines for allocating its 10 million low income housing tax credit program advertisement article continues below this ad the program is one of the state s leading funds for establishing affordable housing typically developers pair it with other funding from the state department of housing or other programs operated by the finance authority the updated guidelines aim to bring more resources to underserved communities and include a preapplication process updated distinctions between preservation and construction projects and new sustainability measures the zoning issues also tie in to public infrastructure and access to public water and sewage systems said michael santoro a specialist at the department of housing ugalde said he s hopeful the increased political spotlight on affordable housing issues will affect change that

the kummakivi balancing rock is a natural feature found in a scenic forest region of ruokolahti a municipality in the region of south karelia in the southeastern part of finland this feature consists of two boulders one perched precariously on the top of the other although the upper rock looks as though it would roll off at any given moment this has not happened additionally if a human being were to apply force to the rock it would not budge even the slightest bit the strange kummakivi balancing rock the name of this finnish balancing rock kummakivi has been translated to mean strange rock two rocks make up this unusual geological formation the rock on the bottom has the shape of a curved mound it is lodged in the earth and has a smooth convex surface resting on the top of this bedrock is another huge rock measuring about 7 meters long 22 97 ft the contact point between these two rocks is rather small and it looks as though the upper rock is performing an impossible balancing act kummakivi strange rock found in ruokolahti south kalelia finland kersti lindström adobe stock anyone looking at the kummakivi balancing rock for the first time would probably be expecting the upper rock to roll off at any time yet the rock is firmly anchored onto the bedrock and it has yet to be pushed over or even moved slightly by any human being the ancient inhabitants of this area who no doubt were perplexed by the sight of this natural wonder sought to find an explanation as to how this balancing rock came to be in such a baffling position it is likely that this group of people tried to move the kummakivi balancing rock with their own hands realizing however that the physical force that they applied to it failed to move the boulder they speculated that a supernatural force must have moved it to the site a large precarious boulder called kummakivi strange stone located in ruokolahti southeastern finland a white miniature schnauzer under it gives an idea of the scale kotivalo cc by sa 4 0 supernatural and scientific explanations the mythology of finland is filled with supernatural creatures such as trolls and giants such creatures are believed to possess physical strength beyond that of any mere mortal moreover some of these creatures have also been associated with rocky landscapes for instance a hiisi hiidet in plural is a type of giant in finnish mythology said to dwell in rocky landscapes finnish folklore also states that such creatures have the habit of throwing boulders around creating cairns and carving out strange holes in rocky outcrops which are believed to have been used by these giants to churn milk thus the explanation provided by local folklore for the kummakivi balancing rock is that it was brought rolled thrown there by a giant troll a group of hiidet eoghankerrigan deviantart geologists however have provided an alternate explanation for the formation of the kummakivi balancing rock it has been speculated that the huge rock had been brought there by glaciers during the last glacial period when the glaciers retreated from the area to the north about 12 000 years ago this rock was left behind and hence became the kummakivi balancing rock the kummakivi balancing rock kersti lindström adobe stock other precarious boulders the kummakivi balancing rock is not the only example of a balancing rock also known as precarious boulders in the world such rocks have been found in many countries around the world and all are surrounded by colorful stories in india for example there is a balancing rock called krishna s butter ball a reference to an avatar of hindu god vishnu krishna s butter ball mamallapuram india cc by sa 3 0 apart from providing people with interesting stories balancing rocks have also been used for more scientific purposes in the usa for example researchers have used balancing rocks as a kind of natural seismoscope while such rocks do not tell when earthquakes have occurred in the past they are an indication that the region had not suffered from earthquakes strong enough to topple them information about the amount of force needed to move these rocks can provide details on the magnitude of past earthquakes and the recurrence and intervals of large earthquakes in the area which would be vital for probabilistic seismic hazard analyses in other words balancing rocks may save lives to conclude the kummakivi balancing rock is indeed a natural wonder to behold while people in ancient times have attributed its formation to mythological giants a more scientific explanation is available today the importance of this feature has been recognized and it was given protected status in 1962 moreover in the usa balancing rocks have been used for seismic studies and perhaps this balancing rock may prove useful for a similar purpose in the future too top image a photo of the kummakivi balancing rock source finlandnaturally by wu mingren updated on february 19 2022

management company focused on improving the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias acutus medical s primary product is its acqmap imaging and mapping system which consists of a console workstation proprietary software algorithms and a single use catheter that contains ultrasound transducers and electrodes which collect the data required to create a comprehensive map of a patient s cardiac anatomy and electrical propagation pathways and patterns to gain a market foothold acutus medical initially lent its first generation acqmap console and workstation to users free of charge to facilitate the sale of its disposable products in late 2019 acutus medical began to install its second generation acqmap console and workstation products with potential purchasers under evaluation arrangements the acutus medical class action lawsuit alleges that throughout the class period acutus medical made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose that i a material percentage of the acqmap systems under evaluation had been randomly installed at sites with little if any consideration given to whether the healthcare providers at the selected locations were likely to adopt or desire acutus medical s products ii a material percentage of the acqmap systems under evaluation had been installed in locations where acutus medical did not possess the infrastructure necessary to appropriately educate train and support medical service providers on the system s operations iii as a result acutus medical was in the process of designing a strategic plan to terminate and relocate approximately 20 of then existing acqmap systems evaluation arrangements iv acutus medical s management discussion and analysis was materially false and misleading and failed to disclose that the termination and relocation of approximately 20 of existing acqmap systems evaluation arrangements was reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on acutus medical s 2021 financial results and v acutus medical s risk factor discussions were materially false and misleading and made reference to potential risks without disclosing that such risks were then existing or adequately describing the specific nature of the risks then facing acutus medical on november 11 2021 acutus medical announced that it had slashed its 2021 revenue guidance due in part to a strategic decision by acutus medical during the third quarter of 2021 to relocate approximately 20 of acqmap systems installations under then existing evaluation arrangements to address meaningfully lower than expected product adoption further contrary to acutus medical s representations during the class period acutus medical revealed that acutus medical needed to relocate acqmap systems that had been placed in improper locations

press play to watch the full interview on nh pbs s the state we re in state of the state governor chris sununu gave his state of the state address february 17 before a joint session of the new hampshire house representatives and senate to discuss the speech with nh pbs the state we re in host melanie plenda is anna brown the director of research and analysis for citizens count and annmarie timmins senior news reporter for the new hampshire bulletin the content below has been edited for length and clarity watch the full interview above or tune in on nh pbs s the state we re in melanie plenda the governor mentioned new hampshire s strong economy especially the recent 250 million surplus anna and then annmarie what s driving the success anna brown the 250 million surplus is a lot of things coming together at the same time first of all last year s budget writers were very conservative in their revenue estimates because we didn t really know what was gonna happen next 2022 is a brand new year but we re still coming out of covid we ve seen a lot of growth in the stock market but also some uncertainty about inflation and bubbles the revenue that we re seeing come in is partly because they took the worst case scenario into account when they were planning revenue when you talk about a surplus that means it s more than they were planning on coming in it s also a factor of incredible business activity in new hampshire we saw tourism rebound incredibly last summer everyone wanted to get out and go to the beach and go to restaurants after a lot of cold and lonely times with covid it s something that we re seeing at the national level too with federal surpluses the question then becomes where do you put that surplus governor sununu is very fond of one time investments or returning it to towns and localities but that doesn t necessarily change long term funding questions around school funding for example he s usually hesitant to do long term tax changes with that excess revenue there s a lot of things going into the budget surplus all at once and it s definitely great to have that money to play with but it might be a one year thing we can t count on it for sure going forward annmarie timmins our tourist economy really did bounce back quickly when i talked to people who were coming here from out of state in those early days they were people who could drive to new hampshire because you couldn t rely on your flight actually happening those people saw new hampshire as the most free state we didn t have a mask mandate anymore more restaurants were open more hotels were open and that was intentional by the governor it was to get people here and i think that worked i think all of the main street rescue money all the ppe kept businesses afloat in some cases nonprofits did very well they were able to hold onto fundraising money but also bring in extra money with the support especially for people who were working in those areas that the government sees as the social service agencies all of those things have gone very well for the state one remark stood out regarding this surplus governor sununu gave people encouragement to go to their town meeting this year and say you need to cut our taxes so we ll see where that goes melanie plenda the governor also mentioned that new hampshire is number one in america for public safety he was referring to the us news and world report ranking of the 50 states which looked at the correction system measuring incarceration rates and racial equity as well as public safety looking at the violent and looking at violent and property crimes annmarie what does that mean for the state annmarie timmins in our court system the demographic of race is not captured so how do you know who s being arrested who s going through misdemeanor versus a felony we know who ends up in jail and in prison and that s a fraction of who is being charged with crimes i m not persuaded so much by those numbers i think it s worth noting that corrections cannot keep staff and that has caused problems with programming they don t have enough drug and alcohol counselors or psychiatrists maybe we have fewer people in there but are we preparing them for success upon release i think sometimes these studies don t go far enough and we don t even have the information to fully understand what s happening in terms of equity melanie plenda that s a really good point to anna there have been a lot of changes in public safety policy recently what impact if any is that having on this anna brown when you re looking at this ranking and the data it was looking at it was pulling from before the coronavirus pandemic so that had multiple impacts on our justice system the courts are really behind on cases they re still struggling with that because in the beginning of course everything just shut down then you had to shift to scheduling limited things in person and doing something virtually new hampshire has been working on bail reform for the past couple of years which has been very controversial because ideally you don t want to incarcerate someone who s awaiting trial just because they can t afford bail you get these really tragic situations for example one young man died in jail and he was awaiting trial for a very minor crime there was a bail reform law that passed that said you can t hold someone just because they can make bail unless they re going to be a serious risk to the public the way it was written though some people are coming back and saying this law goes too far people are concerned about some of the people that are getting let out on the streets just because maybe they re low income doesn t mean there s still a risk to the public and we should have this higher bail threshold that was one bill that governor sununu did call out during his state of the state sb 294 it s looking to pull back on some of those changes that were made in recent years making it a little harder to get out on bail again it s definitely a controversial bill when you re looking at law enforcement reform criminal justice and the differential impacts based on race and other economic issues in new hampshire melanie plenda let s talk about some of the coronavirus accomplishments that governor sununu touched on among those that he mentioned were being the fastest with the initial vaccine rollout new hampshire was the first state to open the vaccine up to everyone 1 5 million rapid test delivered to households across the state kept schools open built out internal surge centers at hospitals cut red tape to fast track nurses licenses and holding washington accountable for their illegal mandates that s a pretty rosy picture he was painting but one thing he didn t mention was the delays in accepting money from the federal government annmarie then anna let s discuss the wins but also some of the losses there annmarie timmins i do think that this state led the way for a long time we did have the highest case growth in the country our vaccination rate was really lagging for a long time and we don t know what it is right now because of reporting challenges the strike teams helped expand capacity and brought the military national guard there were a lot of creative responses to covid but there were some other questions too in terms of schools we kept them open but schools have been caught in this place where they can t go remote anymore and they have to decide about masks some of these tough decisions that are far less politically popular have been handed down to the schools and i ve heard it expressed that people wish he would just tell them what to do because then it s a backup for them they have to face the parents and the students so i think that has been a little bit of a challenge i think promoting the vaccine has not gone well we ve put a lot of money out there for promotion there essentially was no promotion for the longest time i think any of us who practically counted the days so we could get our vaccine assumed everyone would do the same and we ve seen instead that there was a lot of pushback against that in terms of this money that was denied from the federal government we were the only ones to deny it i think now another state has been offered millions of dollars that would ve helped get that vaccine out to more diverse communities and people at home it just got caught up in conspiracy thinking someone on the fiscal committee alleged there were octopus creatures living in the vaccine that really appealed to the folks who are anti vaccine they came out in force they were storming executive council meetings shutting them down and being hauled out by the police it became a real fiasco and that money eventually was approved in a really underhanded way the executive council after the meeting where they voted it down and all the police made nine arrests did not put it on the public agenda for the next meeting that crowd did not know to come and they passed it then with very little discussion but at that point it was late it slowed the state s ability to get its vaccine registry up and going which allows it to track vaccination rate and success in different parts of the state dhhs said it did really have true consequences for us in terms of the vaccination effort and sununu has been really supportive of vaccinations he s gotten out there every week and talked about it maybe he didn t participate in this pushback but he certainly wasn t able to turn it around for quite some time because of that pushback from the anti vaccine crowd anna brown it s interesting that one of the first things governor sununu mentioned in his state of the state was that over 2 000 people have died in our state and that s a real loss and we re mourning those people but he also said at a different time he wanted to go from the new normal back to the old normal he did implement the mask mandate and at one point in the beginning of the pandemic he was very aggressive in terms of putting schools remote it seems he s ready to move past that completely which is a little different from the state legislature citizens count did a rough breakdown of all of the bills this year by topic and there are dozens upon dozens of bills related somehow to covid 19 mask mandates vaccine mandates what security or public health measures businesses can and cannot put in place what they can ask employees about or not governor sununu seems ready to move it on and put covid in the rearview mirror but i m not sure that the legislature is on the same page these articles are being shared by partners in the granite state news collaborative for more information visit collaborativenh org
new residential construction has lagged in connecticut during the pandemic and experts say it s impacting the state s affordable housing stock ned gerard hearst connecticut media shaurice bacon feels stuck in her housing an apartment with not quite enough space for her family she s lived in public housing in bridgeport for two decades she s looked for other low cost apartments applied to housing choice voucher programs and explored rent to own options she s widened her search to include hartford new haven new britain and anywhere in fairfield county but she hasn t found anything available in her price range advertisement article continues below this ad no matter how much i change it around how much i rearrange my furniture redecorate i feel like i m stuck bacon said no state in the country has enough housing that s available and affordable for the lowest income renters connecticut lacks 86 717 rental units that are available and affordable to tenants with extremely low incomes according to estimates from the national low income housing coalition for bacon that means she and her two sons are crowded into a small apartment she got the place when she was young and pregnant with her first daughter unsure of what exactly the move would mean for other connecticut residents with low incomes it means they re rent burdened paying more than a third of their income to housing costs advertisement article continues below this ad new residential construction particularly of multifamily housing has lagged in connecticut for years a problem that s been exacerbated by the pandemic industry experts said through the pandemic developers have seen rising costs of materials and labor for new construction projects and a portion of what s been built has been billed as luxury housing not affordable for people with lower incomes it s always been a challenge so you know developers can t really produce housing that s affordable for the lowest income renters said andrew aurand vice president for research at the national low income housing coalition i think what we ve seen during the pandemic is we ve seen construction costs increase even before the pandemic we were hearing about labor shortages last year saw drops in total building permits as well as a shift in the proportion of multifamily buildings compared to single family housing advertisement article continues below this ad as of the end of november housing with five or more units represented just over 37 percent of new starts in 2020 it was more than 55 percent and in 2019 it was 59 percent according to permit data compiled by the state department of economic community development and for the first time since 2018 connecticut wasn t predicted to surpass 4 400 new housing units in a year for 2021 the biggest barrier to building more multifamily housing in connecticut is restrictive municipal zoning laws experts developers and state officials said a couple of groups have announced legislative goals that aim to reform zoning law these include introducing a fair share law that would set requirements for localities to create more affordable housing units reducing minimum lot sizes and allowing mixed income housing near train stations among other measures advertisement article continues below this ad we know that in connecticut we need more housing overall said nick abbott deputy coordinator at desegregatect our permitting of new homes in 2021 at least of the first 11 months was the lowest it had been in a comparable period over a decade the group s 2022 legislative agenda includes a measure to push transit oriented communities by allowing mixed income housing near train stations they re also advocating for smaller lot sizes to allow more housing to be built on parcels of land desegregatect is also promoting allowing municipalities to create unified land use commissions by merging commissions with nearby towns according to its website a new coalition of about 20 organizations is also pushing for a fair share law in connecticut that would require municipalities to build a share of affordable housing to meet needs determined by the state the overall initiative is called growing together connecticut advertisement article continues below this ad the state would also set incentives and enforcement tactics said erin boggs executive director of the open communities alliance the alliance is an organizing member on the steering committee from our perspective connecticut has this sort of dual housing crisis boggs said in an interview on one hand we are one of the most expensive states in the country and on the other we are one of the most segregated opponents of zoning reform bills introduced last year said it took too much power away from localities and pushed one size fits all solutions for housing affordability on connecticut s towns officials representing greenwich darien and parts of stamford were among those who spoke out against the changes advertisement article continues below this ad connecticut towns are working on developing plans to increase the stock of affordable housing plans must be submitted by july under the law and should be amended every five years in this day and age you re seeing it more that a percentage of homes are being put aside for affordability said greg ugalde president of t m building co inc melissa kaplan macey vice president of state programs and connecticut director at the regional plan association said simplifying the process for developers and making it clearer exactly how long it will take would help i think one of the easiest things we could do is to streamline the process and to make it transparent for everyone kaplan macey said advertisement article continues below this ad zoning regulations that don t allow for larger scale multifamily housing in certain parts of town have made it difficult for developers to find enough land to build on the more units that can be placed in a space the more affordable it is to build said nandini natarajan chief executive officer of the connecticut housing finance authority and delays with getting permitting can make the process longer which adds cost she said it takes a special developer with deep pockets to really stick it out natarajan said the group has recently revised its guidelines for allocating its 10 million low income housing tax credit program advertisement article continues below this ad the program is one of the state s leading funds for establishing affordable housing typically developers pair it with other funding from the state department of housing or other programs operated by the finance authority the updated guidelines aim to bring more resources to underserved communities and include a preapplication process updated distinctions between preservation and construction projects and new sustainability measures the zoning issues also tie in to public infrastructure and access to public water and sewage systems said michael santoro a specialist at the department of housing ugalde said he s hopeful the increased political spotlight on affordable housing issues will affect change that helps make it easier to develop more units advertisement article continues below this ad while bacon s been in her apartment for years and cares about the community she hopes to find something bigger soon and wants to keep an eye out for a new place right now her baby sleeps in a portable bassinet she wants him and her teenage son to each have their own rooms the baby s with a crib all his own her

on paper britain has thus far cleaved close to its allies when it comes to sanctions policy even if with less enthusiasm the u k the eu and the u s all imposed similar sanctions regimes on belarus and iran albeit while the u k was still a member of the eu in the case of the latter when it comes to enforcement however london has been far less bullish than washington while the u s handed out 1 3 billion in fines for sanctions breaches across 26 enforcement cases in 2019 alone a report earlier this month revealed that the u k has imposed just six fines for sanctions violations since the office for sanctions implementation ofsi was established in 2016 in the words of one commentator the 21 million worth of fines suggest that u k sanctions are toothless this criticism may not be totally fair however it takes time for new government bodies and agencies to get the right structures in place what s more notable is that despite brexit the u k s recent stance on sanctions has been less aligned with that of the u s than of the eu when it comes to taking action against russia for its past actions on ukraine for example both the u k and the eu have imposed substantial territorial sanctions on financing trade in key sectors and investment in crimea and sevastopol which could be expanded to cover the whole of ukraine equally companies that take any action in breach of sanctions along with employees who are citizens of either may face penalties under their respective regimes the real question however is what british sanctions policy will look like in the future as u k prime minister boris johnson noted in characteristically colorful language the west is hooked on the hypodermic drip feed of russian hydrocarbons that need to be yanked out in more elementary language it certainly seems that europe s apparent immediate reliance on russian energy of which the nord stream 2 natural gas pipeline is perhaps totemic could undermine the united western front after all there was significant foot dragging from berlin at the thought of banning the pipeline it could therefore be the case in the future that where the eu is hamstrung by the need for consensus the u k could be more agile moving its policy closer to washington s

ford motor co is looking at ways to separate its electric vehicle operation from its century old legacy business hoping to earn the sort of investor respect enjoyed by tesla inc and other pure play ev makers chief executive officer jim farley wants to wall off ford s electric operations from its internal combustion engine business and has even considered spinning off one or the other people familiar with the effort said a spinoff could generate the kind of earnings multiples that have given tesla a market value approaching 1 trillion but splitting the company which ford says it isn t planning may prove too difficult so farley instead may simply separate the ev business internally as its own unit as part of a broad reorganization that seeks to give ford an edge in the electric age a spinoff could be a tough sell to the ford family they control the automaker through a special class of stock and are leery of losing influence over the 118 year old company said the people who didn t want to be identified revealing internal deliberations the founding family led by executive chair bill ford has three seats on the board the company faces pressure from wall street to spin off its nascent ev business to boost value by shedding legacy costs and to gain greater access to capital markets investors have awarded immense value to pure ev makers such as rivian automotive inc whose market value briefly topped ford s late last year despite producing relatively few vehicles ford s stock jumped as much 5 4 after bloomberg news reported on the company s plans rising the most intraday in month the shares were up 4 6 to 18 34 at 10 49 a m in new york we are focused on our ford plan to transform the company and thrive in this new era of electric and connected vehicles the company said by email when asked about a potential spinoff we have no plans to spin off our battery electric vehicle business or our traditional ice business early this month however farley didn t reject the possibility of spinning off either operation when queried on the subject during the company s earnings call running a successful ice business and a successful bev business are not the same farley said i m really excited about the company s commitment to operate the businesses as they should be the ev business is fundamentally different in the customers it attracts the way its products are built and the engineering and design talent that must be hired we re not seeking half measures farley said on the call we re done with incremental change we have a clear plan a bias for action and a whatever it takes mindset late last year ford had talks with financial advisers to explore some options for the ev operation including a potential reorganization and raising private capital for it according to two people familiar with the matter as farley sought to maximize the value of ford s ev operations his vision evolved over time from initially considering a smaller spinoff to contemplating a full breakup to now looking at an internal split the people familiar with the effort said even an internal split would be complicated splicing up engineering and operations at a carmaker where some engineers and factories create and build both types of vehicles is no easy task one of the people said even if everyone favors a true split it would be heavy work to manage the complexity the person said ford has committed 30 billion to its ev strategy through 2025 and is said to be spending another 10 billion to 20 billion by the end of the decade to convert factories to build plug in models farley has tripled production of the electric mustang mach e and doubled output of its f 150 lightning plug in pickup which goes on sale this spring the company plans to produce 600 000 evs annually in two years and generate as much as half its sales from battery powered vehicles by 2030 in its current structure the automaker lacks access to the financing available to tesla and other ev makers that are viewed more favorably by banks and investors creating a pure plug in play could provide ford access to cheaper capital and give investors the opportunity to assign a value to its ev business the people said farley is working closely on the effort with doug field the former head of apple inc s car project whom ford hired in september as advanced technology chief the people said field who previously worked as tesla s chief engineer would have a senior role in any new entity the people said field and farley would have their work cut out for them if they chose to pursue a full spinoff aside from having to win over the founding family car dealers and the united auto workers union also would have to be convinced that they wouldn t get left behind analysts have said ford needs to shed its legacy business model to achieve the profit margins that tesla commands which farley has estimated top 10 000 a car to offset the higher cost of electric vehicles analysts say automakers need a direct sales model like at tesla and rivian that bypasses dealers and the cut of revenue they receive carmakers also need to lower labor costs ford is making great progress in electric morgan stanley analyst adam jonas said in a november note to investors old line carmakers face serious challenges from evs and in our view will require non traditional actions to address them ford already builds the mustang mach e in mexico where wages are a small fraction of what they are in the u s the automaker also is building its first all new assembly plant in a half century to manufacture electric f series trucks in tennessee and the uaw has no assurance it will represent those workers there is precedent for what farley and field are considering in 2017 auto supplier delphi technologies plc spun off its combustion engine powertrain business and renamed the remaining company aptiv plc which focuses on electronics and software for evs and autonomous cars aptiv began trading at greater multiples as a full scale automaker ford has a bigger lift though farley appears eager to shake things up this is a culture change at ford he said on the earnings call this is part of the rhythm change 2022 bloomberg l p visit bloomberg com distributed by tribune content agency llc
triblive s daily and weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need right to your inbox rapidly climbing inflation in the u s is accelerating calls from governors and state leaders to provide immediate tax relief to cash strapped residents facing higher prices on everyday products such as gas milk and electricity the governors of maine and kentucky this week joined states including illinois california massachusetts florida alabama washington and missouri that are considering offering quick but temporary relief to taxpayers crushed by a relentless surge in inflation in recent months the consumer price index which measures what americans pay for goods and services reached another 40 year high last month soaring to 7 5 because of strong consumer demand and pandemic related supply disruptions the swift bipartisan action by state leaders over the past few weeks comes as congressional democrats in washington are rushing to line up legislation that addresses rising gas medical and food costs ahead of the midterm elections democrat and republican states flush with cash thanks to higher than expected tax revenue a soaring stock market and millions in unspent federal pandemic aid have been eager to move quickly to return surpluses to taxpayers 2022 is shaping up to be the year of bipartisan tax relief said jared walczak vice president of state projects for the tax foundation across the board we re seeing lawmakers trying to find ways to reduce tax burdens making ends meet state lawmakers tax relief wish list runs the gamut from food purchases to property taxes to relief at the pump as well as purchases of household cleaning supplies and vehicles although the adjustments are not uniform all the proposals are moving in the same direction to rescue taxpayers even if temporarily tax policy experts say alabama lawmakers on thursday approved a bill that would allow families to avoid paying state income tax on monthly child tax credit payments they receive under president biden s economic relief package a day earlier kentucky democratic gov andy beshear signed an executive order halting an increase in vehicle property taxes that have climbed substantially because of skyrocketing car values he also endorsed a plan by the state legislature to temporarily cut the state s sales tax by 1 for one year starting july 1 to help families pay higher costs that are anticipated to continue to rise through 2023 a booming economy and the best state budget in 25 years means we can do more to help our working families and small businesses buy and sell the essential goods and services that are costing more and that are simply priced too high beshear said consumers have been hammered by higher costs across the economy from food to apartment rents to airfares and electricity effectively wiping out pay raises in maine democratic gov janet mills on tuesday proposed sending half the state s 411 million surplus back as one time 500 checks to help residents keep up with surging prices her supplemental budget plan also calls for two more relief measures a 1 000 refundable tax credit to roughly 100 000 low and middle income property owners and renters and expanding the state s earned income tax credit to families earning less than 57 414 annually sales tax relief state tax revenues have increased by 26 3 since april 2021 according to the tax policy center as personal income and corporate income taxes rose consumers aided with federal stimulus money also spent more helping to bolster sales tax revenue for states republican lawmakers in new york and connecticut have introduced legislation to either temporarily exempt or reduce the state s sales tax rate in new york deputy minority leader steve hawley a republican in the state assembly proposed giving relief to new yorkers by exempting a 4 sales tax on gas personal care products housekeeping supplies and ready to eat foods for two years the windfall of additional state sales tax revenue from inflated prices of goods should not be compounded on the backs of new york consumers the bill authors wrote new york state has significant revenues to account for the loss of sales tax revenue from the suspension provided in this bill in connecticut republican lawmakers also called for part of the state s surplus to be returned to taxpayers by reducing the general sales tax from 6 35 to 5 99 and eliminating a 1 surcharge on prepared foods including restaurant meals as food costs rise there are 13 states that tax groceries and now oklahoma kansas mississippi and virginia are among several considering phasing out the levy applied on food purchases entirely or at least temporarily earlier this month oklahoma republican gov kevin stitt proposed eliminating the state s 4 5 sales tax which would save residents more than 250 million according to a study commissioned by house minority leader emily virgin a democrat last year utah republican gov spencer cox as part of his 25 billion state budget wants to give residents a 160 million grocery tax credit to help cover rising food costs the majority of the tax rebate he said would go to households earning less than 100 000 per year in the midwest illinois democratic gov j b pritzker who faces reelection this year offered inflation relief as part of his budget plan sparing consumers nearly 1 billion in taxes for the upcoming year on groceries gasoline and property taxes the higher cost of even basic necessities is making it harder to make ends meet said pritzker earlier this month during an address from the state capitol building in springfield government ought to do more to ease the pain and put more money in the pockets of hardworking illinoisans analysts say the proposed tax relief efforts like pritzker s are just short term these proposals are too small and too localized to deal with the fundamental problem of inflation said david merriman a professor at university of illinois chicago help at the gas pump state relief efforts come as democrats in washington proposed bills in the senate s 3609 and house this month to temporarily suspend the 18 4 cents per gallon federal gasoline tax until jan 1 2023 some senate republicans have called it a gimmick but the white house said it s keeping all options on the table the proposal drew swift opposition from transportation and construction groups that say it would hurt the already strained highway trust fund which is supported by the gasoline tax and funds federal highway and transit programs these short sighted solutions will increase debt financing by billions and bring greater uncertainty to the solvency of the surface transportation system said michael johnson president of the national stone sand gravel association some opponents including house transportation and infrastructure chair peter defazio d ore also argue energy companies will pocket the savings instead of lowering prices as americans continue to pay hefty prices at the pump state lawmakers from both parties are also itching to offer a reprieve california s democratic gov gavin newsom wants to delay a hike in the state gas tax calling it a modest 523 million gas tax holiday he has received pushback from democratic state legislators who raised concerns about its impact to the economy republican florida gov ron desantis also wants to provide 1 billion in relief to suspend the state s gas tax for millions of floridians for five months helping the average family to save 200 the state s house ways and means committee advanced a tax package thursday that would establish temporary sales tax holidays but doesn t include desantis proposal to suspend the state s gas tax meanwhile states such as rhode island are hoping to use their budget surpluses of 600 million to eliminate the state gas tax altogether in 2022 our state budget is benefiting from inflation as the gas tax brings in new unexpected revenue rhode island republican minority whip jessica de la cruz said meanwhile the people of rhode island are struggling to balance their budgets with no relief in sight

we may suggest it was obvious that cnn was deeply compromised by the way it serially promoted then gov andrew cuomo of new york in the early months of the pandemic in 2020 but now the new york times is reporting it s more corrupt than the first impressions the front page on saturday carried the headline cnn executive let ex governor steer interviews inquiry finds the executive was pr chief allison gollust the one who was having an affair with cnn boss jeff zucker reporters michael m grynbaum john koblin and emily steel focused on a late afternoon march 28 2020 newsroom interview with then weekend anchor ana cabrera governor cuomo had told a senior cnn executive allison gollust about subjects that he d like to be asked about on air according to several people familiar with the matter ms gollust cnn s longtime chief of communications and marketing and a former top aide of the governor passed along the topics to cnn producers and then reported back to the governor done she wrote on tuesday ms gollust was forced to resign from cnn after an internal investigation found a trove of written communications between her and governor cuomo including messages about the march 2020 appearance the people said the episode is the latest example of how closely entwined cnn s leadership was with one of the country s most prominent democratic politicians it s common for tv producers to tell guests in advance what the subject or subjects of the interview will be with a major newsmaker there may be a deeper discussion over whether the newsmaker has something newsworthy to say but this was more like cnn taking dictation from cuomo the cravath investigators also uncovered extensive written communications between governor cuomo and ms gollust who had briefly worked for the governor in late 2012 and early 2013 the people said it wasn t clear what all of those communications were about but investigators found messages during the pandemic in which governor cuomo informed ms gollust about three specific subjects that he wanted to be covered during a march 28 2020 appearance at cnn the people said they said those topics included his recent phone conversation with mr trump and the effect of new york s being placed under lockdown ms gollust then sent messages to cnn staff requesting that the governor be asked about those subjects the cravath lawyers reviewed broadcast transcripts that showed that the anchor asked about the subjects that ms gollust had put forward the people said ms heller the spokeswoman for ms gollust said that ms gollust acted as the principal booker for governor cuomo during the early days of the pandemic and that her role was well known by the entire network in cnn s reliable sources newsletter reporter oliver darcy attempts to spin it a careful read of the interview transcript at issue shows a probing q a and no signs of interference or cuomo coziness wrong the questions during this interview which lasted more than 18 minutes were set ups for the governor starting with what s your reaction to what you just heard click on expand for a sense of how cuomo received questions that could easily have been just the questions cuomo requested cabrera do you have any problem with the idea of there being travel restrictions essentially what i heard from the president is perhaps new yorkers couldn t leave the state cuomo well that s not a quarantine that would be a lockdown if you said we re geographically confining people that would be a lockdown then we would be wuhan china and that wouldn t make sense this is a time the president says he is trying to restart the economy new york is the financial sector you geographically restrict a state you would paralyze the financial sector you think the dow jones the stock market has gone down it would drop like a stone cabrera what if that is what he wants what if he wants a lockdown would you sue to stop him you said you don t think it is legal cuomo look a lockdown is what they did in wuhan china and we re not in china and we re not in wuhan i don t believe it would be legal i believe it would be legal i believe it would be illegal cabrera on that point you made about the financial sector about being able to have interstate commerce and also the financial sectors it is the heart of manhattan right what would this mean for the stock market would it have to shut down cuomo oh it would drop like a stone i mean i don t know if it would operationally have to shut down but it may as well shut down cabrera the new york stock exchange specifically i m sorry i don t mean to interrupt you there s a slight delay with our signal here i was thinking about the new york stock exchange obviously if it is again a little vague now about the quarantine that he s speaking of but one point he mentioned new york city i imagine there are a lot of people that go in and out of new york city that don t live in the city might be part of the new york stock exchange that s where i was thinking about an impact when it comes to the stock market right cuomo oh no you re exactly right ana there are people that come in and out all day long dealing with the stock exchange there are meetings i mean thousands of people coming in and out that are directly related to the stock exchange and i know the president is concerned what happened to the stock market we all are i am as governor of new york every person that has a retirement fund watched the drop is concerned so why you would want to just create total pandemonium on top of a pandemic i have no idea cabrera well if you think about the actions you took right when it came to new rochelle you put in a zone that was somewhat restrictive and you did that in order to stop the spread if there isn t some kind of lockdown how do you get it under control how do you prevent the spread from getting worse cuomo we had the hottest cluster if you will the hottest hot spot in the united states of america with new rochelle westchester we did something with the containment zone closed school and no large gatherings we never said you can t come and go we ve never confined people s mobility imprisoned people in a geographic area even in new rochelle we called it a containment zone which was not the best word it was to contain the virus not people we never contained anyone i can t remember the last time this country said we re going to contain you in an area again that s why i think i don t even believe it is legal cabrera i want to ask about the situation in new york stories we are hearing from hospital workers are not good we see lines outside places like elmhurst what s the status when it comes to ventilators in new york state that s been one of the big issues of concern for you cuomo well the ventilators which by the way before this situation nobody really gave a second thought to ventilators as for gollust acting as gov cuomo s principal booker darcy claimed brian stelter and i did not know this these reporters were in the dark about their own network even as they touted its integrity
menafn caribbean news global by kristalina georgieva when the group of 20 finance ministers and central bank governors gather in jakarta in person and virtually this week they can take inspiration from the indonesian phrase gotong royong working together to achieve a common goal this spirit is more important than ever as countries are facing a tough obstacle course this year the good news is that the global economic recovery continues but its pace has moderated amid high uncertainty and rising risks three weeks ago we cut our global forecast to a still healthy 4 4 percent for 2022 partly because of a reassessment of growth prospects in the united states and china since then economic indicators have continued to point to weaker growth momentum due to the omicron variant and persistent supply chain disruptions inflation readings have been higher than expected in many economies financial markets remain volatile and geopolitical tensions have sharply increased that is why we need strong international cooperation and extraordinary agility for most countries this means continuing to support growth and employment while keeping inflation under control and maintaining financial stability all in the context of high debt levels our new report to the g20 shows just how complex this obstacle course is and what policymakers can do to get through it let me highlight three priorities first we need broader efforts to fight economic long covid we project cumulative global output losses from the pandemic of nearly 13 8 trillion through 2024 omicron is the latest reminder that a durable and inclusive recovery is impossible while the pandemic continues but considerable uncertainty remains about the path of the virus post omicron including the durability of protection offered by vaccines or prior infections and the risk of new variants in this environment our best defense is to move from a singular focus on vaccines to ensuring each country has equitable access to a comprehensive covid 19 toolkit with vaccines tests and treatments keeping these tools updated as the virus evolves will require ongoing investments in medical research disease surveillance and health systems that reach the last mile into every community upfront financing of 23 4 billion to close the act accelerator funding gap will be an important down payment on distributing this dynamic toolkit everywhere going forward enhanced coordination between g20 finance and health ministries is essential to increasing resilience both to potential new sars cov 2 variants and future pandemics that could pose systemic risks ending the pandemic will also help address the scars from economic long covid think of the profound disruptions in many businesses and labor markets and think of the cost to students worldwide estimated at up to 17 trillion over their lives due to learning losses lower productivity and employment disruptions school closures have been especially acute for students in emerging economies where educational attainment was much lower to begin with threatening to compound the dangerous divergence among countries what can be done strong policy action scaling up social spending reskilling programs remedial training for teachers and tutoring for students will help economies get back on track and build resilience to future health and economic challenges second countries need to navigate the monetary tightening cycle while there is significant differentiation across economies and high uncertainty going forward inflation pressures have been building in many countries calling for a withdrawal of monetary accommodation where necessary going forward it is important to calibrate policies to country circumstances it means withdrawal of monetary accommodation in countries such as the united states and the united kingdom where labor markets are tight and inflation expectations are rising others including the euro area can afford to act more slowly especially if the rise in inflation relates largely to energy prices but they too should be ready to act if economic data warrants a faster policy pivot of course clear communication of any shift remains essential to safeguard financial stability at home and abroad some emerging and developing economies have already been forced to combat inflation by raising interest rates and the policy pivot in advanced economies may require additional tightening across a wider range of nations this would sharpen the already difficult trade off countries face in taming inflation while supporting growth and employment so far global financial conditions have remained relatively favorable partly because of negative real interest rates in most g20 countries but if these financial conditions tighten suddenly emerging and developing countries must be ready for potential capital flow reversals to prepare for this borrowers should extend debt maturities where feasible now while containing a further buildup of foreign currency debts when shocks do come flexible exchange rates are important for absorbing them in most cases but they are not the only tool available in the event of high volatility foreign exchange interventions may be appropriate as indonesia successfully did in 2020 capital flow management measures may also be sensible in times of economic or financial crisis think of iceland in 2008 and cyprus in 2013 and countries can take macroprudential measures to guard against risks in the non bank financial sector or where property markets are surging of course all these measures may still need to be combined with macroeconomic adjustments in other words we need to ensure that all countries can move safely through the monetary tightening cycle third countries need to shift their focus to fiscal sustainability as countries emerge from the grip of the pandemic they need to carefully calibrate their fiscal policies it s easy to see why extraordinary fiscal measures helped prevent another great depression but they have also pushed up debt levels in 2020 we observed the largest one year debt surge since the second world war with global debt both public and private rising to 226 trillion for many countries this means ensuring continued support for health systems and the most vulnerable while reducing deficits and debt levels to meet their specific needs for example a faster scaling back of fiscal support is warranted in countries where the recovery is further ahead this in turn will facilitate their shift in monetary policy by reducing demand and thus helping to contain inflationary pressures others especially in the developing world face far more difficult trade offs their fiscal firepower has been scarce throughout the crisis which has left them with weaker recoveries and deeper scars from economic long covid and they have little scope to prepare for a post pandemic economy that is greener and more digital for example the imf last year described how green supply policies including a 10 year public investment program could raise annual global output by about 2 percent compared to the baseline on average over 2021 30 all these policy actions can help us find a new modus vivendi for a more shock prone world but they may be hampered by debt we estimate that about 60 percent of low income countries are in or at high risk of debt distress double 2015 levels these and many other economies will need more domestic revenue mobilization more grants and concessional financing and more help to deal with debt immediately that includes reinvigorating the g 20 common framework for debt treatment this should start with offering a standstill on debt service payments during the negotiation under the framework quicker and more efficient processes are needed with clarity on the steps to go through so that everyone knows the road ahead from formation of creditor committees to an agreement on debt resolution and make the framework available to a wider range of highly indebted countries the imf s role the imf plays an important role in this area by providing macroeconomic frameworks and debt sustainability analyses and we encourage greater debt transparency by requesting greater disclosure of what a member country owes and to whom when it seeks imf financing and by working with our members through the imf world bank multi pronged approach to debt vulnerability we also need to build on the historic allocation of special drawing rights of 650 billion as well as holding the new sdrs as reserves some members have already begun to put them to good use for example nepal for vaccine imports north macedonia for health spending and pandemic lifelines and senegal to boost vaccine production capacity to magnify the impact of the allocation we encourage channeling of new sdrs through our poverty reduction and growth trust which provides concessional financing to low income countries and the new resilience and sustainability trust with its cheaper rates and longer maturities the rst could fund climate pandemic preparedness and digitalization policies that would improve macroeconomic stability for decades to come the g20 has given its strong backing to the rst and we aim to have it fully operational this year as countries face up to multiple challenges the imf will support them with calibrated policy advice capacity development and financial assistance where needed the key is to bring agility into all aspects of policymaking but even that is not enough we also need to follow the spirit of indonesia s motto bhinneka tunggal ika unity in diversity together we can get through the obstacle course to a durable recovery that works for all
it took some time for the authoritarian ideas of the world economic forum wef to become excoriated in the mainstream press but one of the most nefarious elements of stakeholder capitalism are universal environmental social and government esg scores but what are esg scores and could they be a gateway to a social credit system advertisement stakeholder capitalism is wef founder klaus schwab s model for imposing his ethical prescriptions onto free market exchange businesses will no longer be beholden to the prevailing shareholder primacy model of profit maximization but instead to more socially conscious stakeholders experts in fields like environmental sustainability racial and gender equity and increased immigration these stakeholder criteria are determined by the un s seventeen sustainable development goals including the elimination of all poverty relative and absolute gender equality and economic equity between nations this is an aspect of his great reset of capitalism schwab asks us to envision a world where these values are totalised across every sector the union of monopolistic business and government policy is a core tenet of fascism under lockdowns businesses and governments accrued unprecedented power and profits while we were under house arrest politicians have stocks and shares in many of the businesses they legislate against and big businesses support measures like universal corporation tax rates to impair their opposition the unification of the public and private spheres to form a national body politic a corpus is the etymology of the term corporation as emissaries of the wef s ethic all commerce and governing bodies become organs of an international state which everything is for and nothing is outside or against businesses will be subjected to performance evaluations concerning compliance with esg targets to ensure their continued eligibility for wef partnership perks this involves gathering data on their employees and customers this requires a vast digital infrastructure with algorithms tracking everything from purchasing habits to demographic trends your consumer behaviour will be scored on its carbon footprint or proportion of patronage of black owned business the disparity between the targets and a business performance will provide an incentive for businesses to nudge their customer bases toward partaking in what they see as ethical and sustainable consumer behaviours to accelerate the process businesses will form special interest lobbying groups to pressure governments into passing legislation that increases compliance with environmental and social policies eventually boycotts will be done on your behalf dissidents to this new public private ideology will not be able to buy from any business working with the wef given the wef s partnerships with governments monopolistic enterprises like amazon and silicon valley social media giants and international bodies like the who and wto that will be the majority of businesses soon there could be speakeasies for groceries like in lithuania which banned those not vaccinated against covid from supermarkets and pharmacies your social media posts could bar you from buying essential goods like store signs swearing party support in soviet occupied europe or mom and pop shops begging to be spared from 2020 s riots adopting esg scores are the new pledge of fealty to the wef s authoritarian international rule advertisement but that is only if world leaders acquiesce to this public private corporate partnership why would prime ministers and presidents pay patronage to an unelected bond villain in davos in many instances the wef s is responsible for their rise through a party apparatus to elected office their global leadership fellows programme has coached many influential political figures in their doctrine of international cooperation utilitarian policymaking and diversity equity and inclusion graduates of their related young global leaders initiative include transport secretary pete buttigieg new zealand s prime minister jacinda ardern french president emmanuel macron the prime minister of belgium the prime minister of finland the crown prince of norway those not listed on the website but cited by schwab include vladimir putin former german chancellor angela merkel and canadian prime minister justin trudeau it will be difficult to seek safe harbour from compliance with this digital commerce system when most world leaders attended the same political summer school however as the canadian truckers protest goes to show the best laid plans of this globalist internationale aren t going over as well as they had hoped in their ivory tower elitism they forgot the working man and woman have more conscience than they do the internet has liberalised access to information like the printing press did the good word from the clutches of corrupt churches all it takes is for goods distributors businesses and everyday consumers to conscientiously object and their great narrative comes undone advertisement the only fear is that this grassroots uprising will be the excuse to expedite automation and put the heavy goods haulers out of business it may take a few luddites to resist the algorithmic determination of our lives and expropriation of our property lest we end up nihilistic and immiserated reject their tenets of the new institutional religion buy and make american follow the example of the freedom convoy and don t allow any political figure elected or otherwise to tell you what to put in your body

as the coronavirus pandemic enters its third year families across the united states and even some other nations are feeling the pinch of price hikes of necessities including food housing and energy thanks to record high inflation this means the cost of living is going up at the fastest pace in decades affecting the price of things most households need and overshadowing the job and wage gains many americans experienced last year here s a guide to what is inflation and why it s tricky for governments and central banks to tackle what is inflation inflation is a rise in the cost of goods and services maybe you noticed higher prices at the grocery store or at the gas pump maybe your rent has gone up or your paycheck doesn t seem to go as far as it used to that s inflation in normal economic times a little bit of inflation is typical the federal reserve which is in charge of keeping prices stable wants to see inflation rise 2 each year using their preferred gauge but the country hasn t seen this level of inflation in 40 years and many millennials and people in today s workforce have grown up without ever thinking about inflation in their lives advertisement what does inflation mean for me inflation may seem like a wonky academic concept but it directly affects the things you buy each day steep increases in the cost of housing along with used cars and trucks have powered the overall rise in prices yet few if any parts of the economy have been spared average u s rent prices rose 14 last year to 1 877 a month with cities like austin new york and miami notching increases of as much as 40 according to real estate firm redfin economists have been especially worried about rising home and rent costs which can get locked in through long term contracts and may not improve after supply chains clear up the price of gasoline fell 0 5 in december after months of steep increases but in december gas was still 49 6 more expensive than it was a year earlier food costs rose 6 3 in december compared with the year before as worker shortages and the spread of the coronavirus bedeviled grocery supply chains how did inflation start advertisement one of the first signs of the coronavirus pandemic in the united states was fallout from the closure of chinese factories that produced key parts for american businesses and key products for american consumers trapped at home by pandemic restrictions millions of americans splurged on laptops furniture and clothing for the work from home era global shipping prices soared as space grew short on ships but supply problems did not begin feeding into higher prices until spring 2021 as countries reopened for business in the wake of widespread vaccinations the normally smooth trans pacific conveyor belt of goods stopped and started resulting in supply disruptions that fed on themselves the most visible example was the chronic backlog of more than 100 massive container ships anchored off the ports of los angeles and long beach waiting to unload their goods such supply disruptions have been especially damaging for the auto industry which ran short of the computer chips needed to make modern vehicles over the past year new car prices are up almost 12 according to the bureau of labor statistics the sticker shock for buyers of used cars is even worse they re up by more than 37 what else is fueling inflation advertisement it s not just the supply chain there are a lot of things contributing to inflation for example a nationwide labor shortage is adding another layer of costs making it more expensive for companies to transport goods and hire health care and child care workers millions of workers have retired or have child care challenges with ongoing day care and school closures or health concerns with vulnerable family members who remain on the sidelines no longer in the labor force that has forced companies across many sectors to hike the cost of goods and services to be able to offer higher wages to try to woo workers back to the workforce did stimulus checks help cause inflation over the past three years the government passed four different stimulus efforts infusing several trillion dollars into the economy during the trump administration workers got stimulus checks and expanded unemployment benefits of about 600 a week as well as paid sick leave temporarily later in 2020 the administration also passed a 900 billion relief package that financed a new round of stimulus checks unemployment aid and small business assistance among other measures but economists are increasingly pointing to the scale and size of the 1 9 trillion american rescue plan which democrats passed less than two months after president joe biden came to office as too big to fill the economy s hole advertisement this stimulus re extended more generous unemployment benefits of 400 a week gave many americans another round of stimulus checks and expanded the child tax credit though it has since expired it also strengthened nutritional assistance and school lunch programs many democrats except a rare few such as lawrence summers who served under presidents bill clinton and barack obama initially waved off concerns that the spending power of the package could overwhelm the economy and flame inflation but over time it became clear that the massive influx in cash that went straight to american households plus billions more dollars pumped into the broader economy overheated the recovery at this point it s hard to tease out how much blame stimulus deserves for widespread inflation but it s a common criticism among republicans who didn t vote for biden s stimulus package and as time goes on an increasing number of economists concede that the american rescue plan was too big to fill the hole left by the coronavirus recession why is housing so expensive housing costs have been pushed up by soaring demand meager supply and a different kind of stimulus pumped into the economy all over the country as people have reevaluated where they live and work families have scoured for new homes but there are nowhere near enough houses or condos to meet the demand nor is there enough construction capacity to build new ones the costs of basic building materials from lumber to window panes have soared while construction crews are bogged down by labor shortages advertisement meanwhile low interest rates have fueled the boom even more at the beginning of the pandemic the federal reserve slashed interest rates to near zero and flooded the markets with a deluge of financial support but that easy money in turn drove down mortgage rates while driving up asset prices and lifted wealthier americans who can compete in america s unequal housing boom often through fierce bidding wars and all cash offers nationwide the hot housing market has trickled down to higher rents or has spurred landlords looking to sell their properties altogether increasingly the pandemic era housing boom has divided those who can afford to stay and those who cannot is food affected by inflation food prices were one of the first things to start rising at first it was because of a spike in demand with hoarding and massive purchases of items such as flour yeast chicken soup and gatorade driven by hundreds of millions of americans being forced to eat most of their meals at home foods packaged for restaurants shuttered for months were orphaned even as grocery shelves went bare but prices kept going up in 2021 with many food manufacturers including kraft heinz general mills and campbell soup announcing price increases for 2022 citing the higher costs of ingredients transportation logjams labor shortages and higher wages the good news is that inflation for some food items such as poultry and meat is beginning to slow but now prices for fresh produce which had avoided the worst of the price hikes are also rising because of a greater reliance on imports and higher fertilizer costs on farms coinciding with another spike in demand advertisement how and when will prices ease federal reserve and white house officials say they still expect prices to ease back down to a more typical level later this year but it s unclear how quickly and effectively that will happen while the pandemic maintains its grip on daily life in the meantime many economists say families will probably see a lasting mark on their budgets the cost of rent for example is unlikely to go back down after inching higher over the past year groceries or building materials that depend on vast supply chains may not become cheaper until those networks clear up plus one big challenge for policymakers is americans perceptions of inflation which can influence consumer spending choices if americans expect the cost of goods and services to keep rising they may be more likely to buy more furniture or plane tickets now before the price tag stings even worse that cycle of behavior only pushes prices higher which can make those very inflation expectations self fulfilling what other countries are seeing high inflation prices are rising everywhere in the developed world but at an annual rate of 7 u s consumer price inflation is higher than in any other advanced economy advertisement in europe inflation hit 5 1 in january the highest level since the euro currency was introduced more than two decades ago residents of britain are suffering their worst inflation in nearly 30 years with prices up at an annual 5 4 rate likewise you have to go back to the early 1990s to find a period when prices in canada were ticking up as quickly as economies around the world reopened last year they all ran into similar problems a mismatch between the goods that could be produced and the ones customers wanted to buy global shipping and port headaches rising costs for key commodities including oil in the united states biden administration officials wanted to make sure they didn t repeat the policy errors following the 2009 recession when the government turned to austerity policies before the economic rebound was complete so they pumped trillions of dollars into the wounded economy that gave the united states the strongest recovery in the world but at the cost of higher inflation than elsewhere even in japan where prices have been depressed almost continuously since the collapse of the late 1980s real estate bubble the central bank in recent days revised upward its assessment of inflation risks for the first time in eight years among major economies only china has a lower inflation rate today than in early 2020 meanwhile in turkey president recep tayyip erdogan s unorthodox belief that repeatedly cutting interest rates would lower consumer prices has fueled the rapid depreciation of the turkish lira yearly inflation stood at 36 1 at the end of 2021 hitting turkish households hard with few prospects for short term improvement advertisement how are countries responding to inflation while some of the trends underpinning inflation such as the pandemic and a global shortage of basic materials are having the same effect everywhere some economists say americans are seeing more rapid inflation than elsewhere as a consequence of the structure of the u s economy and the nature of the lavish financial rescue deployed to fight the pandemic part of what we re seeing in the u s is very similar to and echoed in the rest of the world said nathan sheets global chief economist for citigroup and part of it is unique to our circumstances and particularly to the strength of u s aggregate demand in 2020 and 2021 direct government checks drove a consumer spending boom while household balance sheets were also lifted by the u s stock market which outperformed those in europe and asia government responses have also varied across countries although many central banks have already made moves to raise interest rates britain has emerged as an interesting case study for policymakers as it prepares for inflation to reach or surpass 6 in april just as a cap on energy prices is due for an update to account for the rising cost of supplying energy britain is also raising taxes in a bid to reduce its pandemic related debt the bank of england in december also became the first central bank in a group of seven nation to raise interest rates advertisement this will put pressure on british households which are already contending with the higher price of goods and could endanger the recovery of the british economy is there government aid available for inflation there is no direct government aid for inflation the federal reserve is in charge of keeping prices stable but its tools are blunt to rein in inflation the fed is likely to raise interest rates from near zero in march setting up the first in a series of rate hikes to come this year in france anyone making less than 2 000 euros 2 286 a month in 2021 was eligible to receive a one time 100 euro 114 inflation indemnity from the government the tax free payment was designed as a purchasing power buffer for 38 million lower income people in the face of the sharp rise in the cost of energy according to the government other governments have imposed price caps on basic goods to shelter households from the worst effects of inflation in january hungarian prime minister viktor orbán said items such as sugar flour and sunflower oil should be sold at the same price as they were in october and serbia is working to extend a similar policy past its february deadline the washington

menafn caribbean news global by kristalina georgieva when the group of 20 finance ministers and central bank governors gather in jakarta in person and virtually this week they can take inspiration from the indonesian phrase gotong royong working together to achieve a common goal this spirit is more important than ever as countries are facing a tough obstacle course this year the good news is that the global economic recovery continues but its pace has moderated amid high uncertainty and rising risks three weeks ago we cut our global forecast to a still healthy 4 4 percent for 2022 partly because of a reassessment of growth prospects in the united states and china since then economic indicators have continued to point to weaker growth momentum due to the omicron variant and persistent supply chain disruptions inflation readings have been higher than expected in many economies financial markets remain volatile and geopolitical tensions have sharply increased that is why we need strong international cooperation and extraordinary agility for most countries this means continuing to support growth and employment while keeping inflation under control and maintaining financial stability all in the context of high debt levels our new report to the g20 shows just how complex this obstacle course is and what policymakers can do to get through it let me highlight three priorities first we need broader efforts to fight economic long covid we project cumulative global output losses from the pandemic of nearly 13 8 trillion through 2024 omicron is the latest reminder that a durable and inclusive recovery is impossible while the pandemic continues but considerable uncertainty remains about the path of the virus post omicron including the durability of protection offered by vaccines or prior infections and the risk of new variants in this environment our best defense is to move from a singular focus on vaccines to ensuring each country has equitable access to a comprehensive covid 19 toolkit with vaccines tests and treatments keeping these tools updated as the virus evolves will require ongoing investments in medical research disease surveillance and health systems that reach the last mile into every community upfront financing of 23 4 billion to close the act accelerator funding gap will be an important down payment on distributing this dynamic toolkit everywhere going forward enhanced coordination between g20 finance and health ministries is essential to increasing resilience both to potential new sars cov 2 variants and future pandemics that could pose systemic risks ending the pandemic will also help address the scars from economic long covid think of the profound disruptions in many businesses and labor markets and think of the cost to students worldwide estimated at up to 17 trillion over their lives due to learning losses lower productivity and employment disruptions school closures have been especially acute for students in emerging economies where educational attainment was much lower to begin with threatening to compound the dangerous divergence among countries what can be done strong policy action scaling up social spending reskilling programs remedial training for teachers and tutoring for students will help economies get back on track and build resilience to future health and economic challenges second countries need to navigate the monetary tightening cycle while there is significant differentiation across economies and high uncertainty going forward inflation pressures have been building in many countries calling for a withdrawal of monetary accommodation where necessary going forward it is important to calibrate policies to country circumstances it means withdrawal of monetary accommodation in countries such as the united states and the united kingdom where labor markets are tight and inflation expectations are rising others including the euro area can afford to act more slowly especially if the rise in inflation relates largely to energy prices but they too should be ready to act if economic data warrants a faster policy pivot of course clear communication of any shift remains essential to safeguard financial stability at home and abroad some emerging and developing economies have already been forced to combat inflation by raising interest rates and the policy pivot in advanced economies may require additional tightening across a wider range of nations this would sharpen the already difficult trade off countries face in taming inflation while supporting growth and employment so far global financial conditions have remained relatively favorable partly because of negative real interest rates in most g20 countries but if these financial conditions tighten suddenly emerging and developing countries must be ready for potential capital flow reversals to prepare for this borrowers should extend debt maturities where feasible now while containing a further buildup of foreign currency debts when shocks do come flexible exchange rates are important for absorbing them in most cases but they are not the only tool available in the event of high volatility foreign exchange interventions may be appropriate as indonesia successfully did in 2020 capital flow management measures may also be sensible in times of economic or financial crisis think of iceland in 2008 and cyprus in 2013 and countries can take macroprudential measures to guard against risks in the non bank financial sector or where property markets are surging of course all these measures may still need to be combined with macroeconomic adjustments in other words we need to ensure that all countries can move safely through the monetary tightening cycle third countries need to shift their focus to fiscal sustainability as countries emerge from the grip of the pandemic they need to carefully calibrate their fiscal policies it s easy to see why extraordinary fiscal measures helped prevent another great depression but they have also pushed up debt levels in 2020 we observed the largest one year debt surge since the second world war with global debt both public and private rising to 226 trillion for many countries this means ensuring continued support for health systems and the most vulnerable while reducing deficits and debt levels to meet their specific needs for example a faster scaling back of fiscal support is warranted in countries where the recovery is further ahead this in turn will facilitate their shift in monetary policy by reducing demand and thus helping to contain inflationary pressures others especially in the developing world face far more difficult trade offs their fiscal firepower has been scarce throughout the crisis which has left them with weaker recoveries and deeper scars from economic long covid and they have little scope to prepare for a post pandemic economy that is greener and more digital for example the imf last year described how

help us find a new modus vivendi for a more shock prone world but they may be hampered by debt we estimate that about 60 percent of low income countries are in or at high risk of debt distress double

that a durable and inclusive recovery is impossible while the pandemic continues but considerable uncertainty remains about the path of the virus post omicron including the durability of protection offered by vaccines or prior infections and the risk of new variants in this environment our best defense is to move from a singular focus on vaccines to ensuring each country has equitable access to a comprehensive covid 19 toolkit with vaccines tests and treatments keeping these tools updated as the virus evolves will require ongoing investments in medical research disease surveillance and health systems that reach the last mile into every community upfront financing of 23 4 billion to close the act accelerator funding gap will be an important down payment on distributing this dynamic toolkit everywhere going forward enhanced coordination between g20 finance and health ministries is essential to increasing resilience both to potential new sars cov 2 variants and future pandemics that could pose systemic risks ending the pandemic will also help address the scars from economic long covid think of the profound disruptions in many businesses and labor markets and think of the cost to students worldwide estimated at up to 17 trillion over their lives due to learning losses lower productivity and employment disruptions school closures have been especially acute for students in emerging economies where educational attainment was much lower to begin with threatening to compound the dangerous divergence among countries what can be done strong policy action scaling up social spending reskilling programs remedial training for teachers and tutoring for students will help economies get back on track and build resilience to future health and economic challenges second countries need to navigate the monetary tightening cycle while there is significant differentiation across economies and high uncertainty going forward inflation pressures have been building in many countries calling for a withdrawal of monetary accommodation where necessary going forward it is important to calibrate policies to country circumstances it means withdrawal of monetary accommodation in countries such as the united states and the united kingdom where labor markets are tight and inflation expectations are rising others including the euro area can afford to act more slowly especially if the rise in inflation relates largely to energy prices but they too should be ready to act if economic data warrants a faster policy pivot of course clear communication of any shift remains essential to safeguard financial stability at home and abroad some emerging and developing economies have already been forced to combat inflation by raising interest rates and the policy pivot in advanced economies may require additional tightening across a wider range of nations this would sharpen the already difficult trade off countries face in taming inflation while supporting growth and employment so far global financial conditions have remained relatively favorable partly because of negative real interest rates in most g20 countries but if these financial conditions tighten suddenly emerging and developing countries must be ready for potential capital flow reversals to prepare for this borrowers should extend debt maturities where feasible now while containing a further buildup of foreign currency debts when shocks do come flexible exchange rates are important for absorbing them in most cases but they are not the only tool available in the event of high volatility foreign exchange interventions may be appropriate as indonesia successfully did in 2020 capital flow management measures may also be sensible in times of economic or financial crisis think of iceland in 2008 and cyprus in 2013 and countries can take macroprudential measures to guard against risks in the non bank financial sector or where property markets are surging of course all these measures may still need to be combined with macroeconomic adjustments in other words we need to ensure that all countries can move safely through the monetary tightening cycle third countries need to shift their focus to fiscal sustainability as countries emerge from the grip of the pandemic they need to carefully calibrate their fiscal policies it s easy to see why extraordinary fiscal measures helped prevent another great depression but they have also pushed up debt levels in 2020 we observed the largest one year debt surge since the second world war with global debt both public and private rising to 226 trillion for many countries this means ensuring continued support for health systems and the most vulnerable while reducing deficits and debt levels to meet their specific needs for example a faster scaling back of fiscal support is warranted in countries where the recovery is further ahead this in turn will facilitate their shift in monetary policy by reducing demand and thus helping to contain inflationary pressures others especially in the developing world face far more difficult trade offs their fiscal firepower has been scarce throughout the crisis which has left them with weaker recoveries and deeper scars from economic long covid and they have little scope to prepare for a post pandemic economy that is greener and more digital for example the imf last year described how green supply policies including a 10 year public investment program could raise annual global output by about 2 percent compared to the baseline on average over 2021 30 all these policy actions can help us find a new modus vivendi for a more shock prone world but they may be hampered by debt we estimate that about 60 percent of low income countries are in or at high risk of debt distress double 2015 levels these and many other economies will need more domestic revenue mobilization more grants and concessional financing and more help to deal with debt immediately that includes reinvigorating the g 20 common framework for debt treatment this should start with offering a standstill on debt service payments during the negotiation under the framework quicker and more efficient processes are needed with clarity on the steps to go through so that everyone knows the road ahead from formation of creditor committees to an agreement on debt resolution and make the framework available to a wider range of highly indebted countries the imf s role the imf plays an important role in this area by providing macroeconomic frameworks and debt sustainability analyses and we encourage greater debt transparency by requesting greater disclosure of what a member country owes and to whom when it seeks imf financing and by working with our members through the imf world bank multi pronged approach to debt vulnerability we also need to build on the historic allocation of special drawing rights of 650 billion as well as holding the new sdrs as reserves some members have already begun to put them to good use for example nepal for vaccine imports north macedonia for health spending and pandemic lifelines and senegal to boost vaccine production capacity to magnify the impact of the allocation we encourage channeling of new sdrs through our poverty reduction and growth trust which provides concessional financing to low income countries and the new resilience and sustainability trust with its cheaper rates and longer maturities the rst could fund climate pandemic preparedness and digitalization policies that would improve macroeconomic stability for decades to come the g20 has given its strong backing to the rst and we aim to have it fully operational this year as countries face up to multiple challenges the imf will support them with calibrated policy advice capacity development and financial assistance where needed the key is to bring agility into all aspects of policymaking but even that is not enough we also need to follow the spirit of indonesia s motto bhinneka tunggal ika unity in diversity together we can get through the obstacle course to a durable recovery that works for all

by frank shostak via mises in the national income and product accounts nipa savings are established as the difference between disposable money income and monetary outlays disposable income is defined as the summation of all personal money income less tax payments to the government personal income includes wages and salaries transfer payments income from interest and dividends and rental income the nipa framework is based on the keynesian view that spending by one individual becomes part of the income of another individual the spending of the purchaser is the income of the seller from this it follows that spending equals income so if people maintain their spending this keeps overall income coming in now an increase in the supply of money affects the total amount of money spent consequently the greater the expansion in the money supply all other things being equal the more money is going to be spent and therefore the greater the national income is going to be therefore for a given outlay an increase in money supply will result in an increase in savings note again that in the nipa s framework increases in the money supply are an important factor in savings increases however does it make sense that increases in the money supply are associated with increases in savings if this is so then the central bank can be seen as instrumental to savings formation savings are not about money but about the consumer goods that are required to support individuals lives and well being how savings support production savings are the amount of consumer goods produced in excess of the consumption of these goods for instance if a baker produces ten loaves of bread and consumes two loaves his savings are eight loaves of bread now in order to enhance his oven the baker hires the services of a technician the baker pays the technician with the saved bread note that the saved bread enables the technician to maintain his life and well being while he is busy improving the oven with an improved oven the baker can increase the production of bread likewise the other producers of consumer goods by exchanging these goods for the services or products of various producers supply them with the means that support their lives and well being note that the saved consumer goods support individuals in all the stages of production from the producers of consumer goods and services to the producers of raw materials the producers of tools and machinery and all the other intermediate stages of production observe that if the production of consumer goods were to increase all other things being equal i e the pool of savings increased this would further permit the enhancement and the expansion of the infrastructure an expanded pool of savings enables individuals to introduce new stages of production that previously could not be undertaken this in turn permits the production of a larger quantity and a greater variety of consumer goods in addition once there has been an adequate increase in the pool of consumer goods individuals are in a position to aim at further enhancing their well being by seeking things such as entertainment and services such as medical treatment the saved consumer goods support the lives and well being of the various individuals that provide entertainment and various services who require consumer goods in order to maintain their lives and well being introducing money the introduction of money does not alter what we have said so far a producer of a consumer good exchanges his saved goods for money he can in turn exchange the money for other goods and services by exchanging his savings for money he has supplied the other producer with his saved goods as a rule whenever individuals acquire capital goods such as machinery they transfer money to the individuals who are employed in the making of the machinery with the received money the machinery makers can choose to exchange it not only for consumer goods but also for various services despite its importance as the medium of exchange according to murray n rothbard money per se cannot be consumed and cannot be used directly as a producers good in the productive process money per se is therefore unproductive it is dead stock and produces nothing 1 again money s main job is simply to fulfill the role of the medium of exchange money does not sustain or fund real economic activity however without the medium of exchange i e money neither the division of labor nor the market economy could have emerged the existence of money enables individuals to specialize individuals pay with goods and services they produce they do not pay with money money only helps facilitate payments it enables the goods of one specialist to be exchanged for the goods of another specialist in planning for freedom ludwig von mises wrote commodities says say are ultimately paid for not by money but by other commodities money is merely the commonly used medium of exchange it plays only an intermediary role what the seller wants ultimately to receive in exchange for the commodities sold is other commodities by means of money an individual can channel savings i e unconsumed consumer goods to other individuals which in turn permits the widening of the process of wealth generation whenever the individual deems it necessary he can always exchange his money for goods we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us this however requires that the flow of the produced consumer goods be unabated therefore whenever the holder of money decides to exchange some of it for goods these goods must be there for him are money supply increases in response to demand for money harmless by some commentators failing to accommodate an increase in the demand for money can suffocate the economy in this way of thinking a corresponding increase in the money supply will be fully absorbed by the demand increase without any bad side effects on the contrary an increase in the demand for money is not going to absorb a corresponding increase in the money supply as occurs with demand for other goods for instance a 5 percent increase in the supply of bread will be absorbed by a 5 percent increase in the demand for bread note that the increase in the supply of bread is entirely consumed here i e absorbed by the increased demand however an increase in the demand for money will not absorb the corresponding increase in the money supply a demand for money is the demand to spend it and not to consume it as is the case with a demand for bread the increase in the money supply is going to set in motion an exchange of nothing for something which will result in the diversion of wealth from wealth generating to non wealth generating activities this in turn will weaken the process of wealth generation an increase in the money supply to accommodate an increase in the demand for money will set in motion all the negatives that an increase in the money supply does such as the menace of the boom bust cycle once the market has chosen a particular commodity as money the given stock of this commodity will always be sufficient to secure the services that money provides this means that there is no need to increase the money supply in response to an increase in demand within the framework of a free market there cannot be such thing as too little or too much money as long as the market is allowed to clear no shortage or surplus of money can emerge according to mises as the operation of the market tends to determine the final state of money s purchasing power at a height at which the supply of and the demand for money coincide there can never be an excess or deficiency of money each individual and all individuals together always enjoy fully the advantages which they can derive from indirect exchange and the use of money no matter whether the total quantity of money is great or small the services which money renders can be neither improved nor repaired by changing the supply of money the quantity of money available in the whole economy is always sufficient to secure for everybody all that money does and can do 2 do people save money people do not save money but rather they exchange it for goods and services once savings saved consumer goods are exchanged for money the holder of the money can employ it immediately in an exchange for other goods or he may hold it temporarily how an individual decides to employ his money is going to alter his demand for money whether he uses money immediately in an exchange for other goods puts it under the mattress or keeps it in his pocket will not alter the given pool of savings for instance by lending money individuals lower their demand for money the act of lending does not alter the existing pool of savings likewise if the owner of money decides to acquire a financial asset such as a bond or a stock he simply transfers his money to the seller of financial assets no present savings are affected because of these transactions problems emerge whenever the central bank embarks on monetary pumping however when the pumped money is exchanged for consumer goods it amounts to consumption that is not supported by production more money is now chasing the same amount of goods consequently a holder of honest money i e an individual who has produced wealth discovers that he cannot get the equivalent value of all the goods he previously produced and exchanged for money all other things being equal he discovers that the purchasing power of his money has fallen any so called economic growth in the framework of loose monetary policy can only take place if the private sector manages to grow the pool of savings despite the loose monetary policy undermining this process note again that loose monetary policies give rise to non wealth generating activities once the pace of non wealth generating activities starts to exceed the pace of wealth generating activities the pool of savings comes under pressure this in turn sets the platform for a severe economic decline conclusions savings are about consumer goods production in excess of the consumption of these goods saving is not about money but about final consumer goods that support the lives and well being of various individuals that are engaged in the various stages of production it is not money that funds economic activity but the saved pool of consumer goods the existence of money only facilitates the flow of savings any attempt to replace savings with money ends in an economic disaster 1 murray n rothbard man economy and

february 20 2022 links international journal of socialist renewal reposted from socialist project the victory of the oz slate in the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt union headed by sean o brien and fred zuckerman and backed by teamsters for a democratic union tdu has raised the question will this new leadership bring about reform in one of the nation s largest and most powerful unions real reform would mean a union that is free from corruption more democratic willing to mobilize the members to fight the bosses and capable of also addressing broader social issues like trumpism covid and climate change to put it another way is the teamsters a powerful union is it now headed by reformers who will take on united parcel service ups in the 2023 contract can the teamsters win a ups strike and then go on to launch a major organizing drive among amazon workers to bring them into the labor movement will the teamsters become just a more militant business union or will it be able to begin to challenge the economic and political powers that be if the union is reformed and becomes an organization that mobilizes its members to fight for themselves its example could have an enormous impact on the entire american labor movement it could encourage resistance to the employers it could legitimate class struggle and it could provide an alternative to the left s current emphasis on electoral politics the teamsters has been at a juncture like this before back in the 1990s when ron carey supported by tdu became teamster president a comparison between the cases of carey and o brien and more broadly between the carey tdu and the o brien tdu relationships could be illuminating so we turn here to look at the teamsters union and reform slates in historical perspective in order to understand where the union may be heading is the teamsters a powerful union the teamsters have the reputation of being a particularly powerful union and it certainly was from the 1930s until the 1970s during the 1930s successful strikes and organizing drives particularly in minneapolis but also in boston chicago and seattle transformed the teamsters from a small exclusive craft union into a large inclusive quasi industrial union the most important of these was the minneapolis experience where farrell dobbs and other revolutionary socialists led a series of wild cat strikes and then an extensive organizing drive in the upper midwest working with dobbs at the time was a young teamster organizer from detroit jimmy hoffa who while he didn t agree with dobbs politics adopted his organizing strategies at about the same time in 1935 the us congress passed the motor carrier act that established government regulation of the trucking industry establishing routes rates and controlling entry into the industry the act ended cut throat competition and stabilized the industry since new trucking companies could no longer enter the industry and undercut shipping rates while established companies were guaranteed the going rate so the employers had less motivation to cut wages the combination of the transformation of the teamsters from a craft union into a semi industrial union the passage of the motor carrier act that stabilized the industry and the building of the interstate highway system beginning in 1956 together with the post war prosperity of the american economy created a new reality for motor freight workers during this period the first national trucking companies became established pacific intermountain express consolidated freightways roadway yellow freight and others meaning that a piece of freight could now be moved from coast to coast by one company the motor freight industry became big business when jimmy hoffa became the president of the union in 1957 he began the process of unifying many regional and local contracts into the national master freight agreement nmfa that was first negotiated in january of 1964 the agreement covered more than 450 000 long haul and local cartage drivers and dockworkers across the country in those years teamsters not only won higher wages but also employer contributions to their pension and health funds it was the teamsters domination of the freight industry that made it a truly powerful union throughout the period from the 1930s to the 1970s the teamsters union grew through official strikes wildcat strikes and job actions by means of which it won contracts and defended them those experiences not only won higher wages but also created a sense of cohesion and solidarity among warehousemen dockworkers and truck drivers particularly among the drivers nearly all of whom were white men in those years the companies generally did not hire black over the road drivers as white over the road drivers in the south and other areas refused to work with black drivers women were not hired for freight jobs only with the settlement of a us government suit against trucking employers and the union did black and latino workers gain some acceptances among the drivers blacks and latinos did work on the docks within the union the big city freight locals boston new york pittsburgh cleveland chicago denver atlanta seattle and los angeles and a few others held the dominant political power in the union those truckdrivers were at the center of american industry connecting many small companies with the giants of the economy in steel auto glass rubber electrical appliances plastics garments you name it trucks carried everything and teamsters drove those trucks giving them the power to paralyze the economy and also the power to support other workers on strike by refusing to cross their picket lines i remember as a truck driver in chicago in the 1970s that on several occasions when i arrived to make a delivery to a factory on strike there would be pickets at the gate i would call the dispatcher and tell him that i could not make the delivery because of the strike explaining that if i attempted to cross the picket line the company s truck and the customers freight on board might be damaged they didn t care if i was injured but they did care about their equipment in truth sometimes there were just a few people picketing or maybe even just one other drivers did the same thing the dispatchers always said forget it go to your next stop because it was not worth getting into a fight with the teamsters union the teamsters power at that time was feared by the bosses and recognized and appreciated by other unions and workers the teamsters union then was comparable to the united mine workers in the coal industry to the united steel workers in basic steel making to the united auto workers in the auto industry and to other industrial unions that is the ibt absolutely dominated the freight industry and related industries such as car hauling and package delivery for ups and it also organized other drivers in beverage delivery beer and soda pop construction rock sand and gravel and waste among others the domination of the freight industry with its 450 000 workers gave the teamsters the ability to organize others in related industries like agricultural packing sheds dairy baking and groceries and it also made it possible to bring some completely unrelated factories into the union so that by the 1970s the ibt had a membership of two million the biggest union in the us at the time it really was a powerful union then though on the brink of decline from power to weakness corruption and deregulation the power of the teamsters union eroded for three reasons one having to do with the leadership the second with the deregulation of the industry and the third with broader changes in the economy while jimmy hoffa was centralizing and expanding the power of the teamsters he also permitted and even encouraged the mafia to play an important role in the union mafiosi like tony provenzano head of the new jersey teamsters were important allies of hoffa an associate of the chicago mob hoffa s friend allen dorfman played a key role in the central states pension fund there were dozens of other mafiosi as well the united states senate select committee on improper activities in labor and management also known as the mcclellan committee or labor racketeering committee began investigations into the teamsters with robert f kennedy rfk serving as chief counsel in 1961 president john f kennedy made his brother the us attorney general and rfk motivated by a concern to eliminate the mafia from american society but perhaps also by a desire to weaken the teamsters as a union pursued hoffa relentlessly hoffa was eventually convicted of bribery and fraud and sentenced to thirteen years in prison his hand picked successor frank fitzsimmons subsequently arranged a deal with president richard nixon to allow hoffa to leave prison in 1971 but on the condition that he not participate in union activates until 1980 with hoffa effectively banned from the union and unable to reclaim his role as its leader fitzsimmons remained the union president since nixon had helped him he in turn supported nixon and the republican party the men played golf together which says it all once out of prison after serving just a few years hoffa began to fight to get back his old position he attempted to rally rank and file members with class struggle rhetoric but he also threatened to blow the whistle on the mobsters in the union the mafia took his threats seriously which is why in july of 1975 hoffa disappeared most probably kidnapped and murdered by the mob at just about that time a group of leftists became involved in the union members of the us based international socialists is which eventually evolved into solidarity joined with longtime union activists and reformers to launch a national campaign called teamsters for a decent contract in 1975 the campaign which ignited some local wildcat strikes in freight and at ups was successful in forcing the union to call a national strike which led to higher wages and other improvements those involved in that campaign then founded teamsters for a democratic union tdu and ken paff the leading strategist of the movement became national organizer a post he held for over forty years tdu fought for union reforms such as elected stewards engaged in shop floor organizing and pushed for more militant union action while also running candidates for positions in the teamsters national leadership tdu did so consistently and tirelessly in an increasingly corrupt union environment and amidst the beginning of the neoliberal transformation of the economy through deregulation as president fitzsimmons adopted a policy of letting regional leaders including mafia leaders run their own pieces of the union so the union that had been centralized under hoffa became a loose federation of baronies under fitz thus began the political and administrative disintegration of the union as teamster leaders like provenzano in new jersey jackie presser in cleveland roy williams in kansas city and others in various regions began to negotiate substandard contracts and to exchange labor peace for employer bribes business unionism gave way to gangster unionism in several areas when lung cancer kept fitzsimmons from running for another term as president he was succeeded by roy williams in 1981 who in turn was followed by jackie presser in 1983 the greed of the leadership advanced even further with williams taking home as much as 813 247 a year and presser 550 000 for the various posts they held as was later learned both williams and presser were involved with the mafia and simultaneously acting as fbi informants throughout that period they and other teamster leaders used undemocratic procedures intimidation and violence to pressure the members to vote for bad contracts while at the same time they cultivated privileged followers among selected groups of drivers and dockworkers of some freight locals while the mafia and corruption played a role it was the deregulation of the freight industry that ultimately and severely weakened the teamsters the motor carrier act of 1980 promoted by reformers such as ralph nader and democratic party politicians such as senator ted kennedy and president jimmy carter allowed new entrants into the trucking industry and permitted companies to set their own routes and rates the result was that within ten years the number of trucking companies had doubled from 20 000 to 40 000 as new non union companies entered the industry paying their employees far less than teamster wages and benefits the then existing unionized national companies such as consolidated freightways still ran their shrinking unionized operations but also opened new non union affiliates a practice known as double breasting many brand new non union companies set up terminals and operations while non union trucking brokers also provided drivers and increasing numbers of non union owner operators came into the field competitive chaos was accompanied by folding companies and mass job loss the saddest part of the story is that in several instances in an attempt to save their jobs workers set up employee stock ownership plans or esops using their pension money to buy the failing companies for which they worked they hired corporate business managers to run them but even though they exploited themselves mercilessly they could not save their companies and their jobs in the face of the non union competition they ended up losing both jobs and pensions as a result while the teamsters once represented about 450 000 freight workers now they represent little more than 75 000 at the few surviving unionized national companies today somewhere between 750 000 to one million non union owner operator over the road drivers move most of the motor freight across the nation the heart of the teamsters union its strongest group of workers who were also its most active members was almost completely destroyed by deregulation with that the political center of the union shifted from freight to package handling and logistics that is to ups the largest package company but also the most important logistics operation which employs some 320 000 teamster members a third factor that led to the weakening of the union was the economic recessions of 1973 75 and of 1980 82 the latter seeing unemployment rates near 10 percent the highest since the great depression of the 1930s facing that situation workers became reluctant to strike for fear of losing their jobs to scabs now called replacement workers in the teamsters workers who throughout the period from the 1930s to the early 1980s had engaged in all sorts of job actions wildcat strikes and official strikes now became reluctant to take such action while news commentators often say strikes hurt everyone it is not true strikes reinvigorate unions remind workers of their power give them practice in exercising that power teach the lessons about the balance of power whether they win or lose and when they win strikes can also improve workers lives on the job and increase their standard of living union leaders including the teamsters uninterested in but no longer knowing how to lead strikes made terrible concessions in wages health care coverage multi tier contracts and contracting out with the 1980s the strike era that had given birth to reform movements such as tdu ended the unions declined in strength and numbers their members with no experience of struggle often no longer knew how to take action for themselves from the 1980s until today the teamsters has ceased to be a powerful industrial union none of its leaders had a plan to recoup its hold on the freight industry so the teamsters ceased to be a semi industrial union and became what we can call a general union at the same time the union largely failed to fight for those remaining freight and package workers and instead negotiated contracts that allowed two or more tiers part time work contracting out and inadequate wages and benefits teamster officials however anxious to maintain the union s dues base that is the income that provided for the top officials extravagant salaries some as high as 500 000 a year and golden parachute pensions adopted a strategy of organizing anybody anywhere in any industry the teamsters now a general union competed with other established unions to organize city and state public employees teachers police officers and fire fighters prison guards health and hospital workers high tech workers and well you name it they also sometimes raided other unions to steal members way from them anything to get more members and more dues most of these workers had nothing in common with truck drivers dockworkers and warehousemen and often had little in common with each other this policy of competition with other unions in order to organize all sorts of workers not only failed to build the power of the teamsters in its historic center which was freight or its new center package delivery but it also weakened other unions that were attempting to organize other industries such as education or health care since workers in those industries now became divided among different rival unions many of these new teamster members had little sense of identification with the union nationally and the union failed to establish a new identity as a union of all workers which perhaps helps to explain why only about 15 percent of members voted in the most recent national elections for top officers many and perhaps most rank and file teamsters clearly feel completely alienated from their union so as the oz slate and the coalition known as teamsters united prepares to take power it is inheriting a union that has been largely hollowed out a union whose now highly diverse workforce in many industries does not share a strong identification with the organization or a sense of solidarity with each other an outfit where 85 percent of the members did not feel strongly motivated enough to find a post office box and put their mail ballot envelope in it in order to cast a vote for the election of their own leaders there are still some stronger more highly motivated divisions like ups and car haul but strengthening the teamsters and making it powerful again will be a very big job the experience of ron carey and tdu the o brien zuckerman oz team supported by tdu is not the first experiment in union reform since the union s heyday in the 1990s ron carey also backed by tdu became the ibt president and similarly tested the possibilities of reform and militancy it is an experience well worth analyzing carey was raised in an irish catholic family in queens went to a good high school set aside college to serve in the us marines and then following his dad s career got a job at ups smart and ambitious he became a union steward and in 1967 was elected president of teamster local 804 representing ups workers in new york he took several college courses in labor studies to better prepare himself for the job carey was a registered republican who held conservative views on various issues including being an anti communist but he was a militant business unionist an honest union official and a fighter he led the local through several strikes winning for his members some of the best wages and conditions in the country which is why he was reelected local president eight times naturally the venal corrupt sell out national presidents of the union from fitzsimons to presser from roy williams to william j mccarthy detested carey and worked to isolate him so during the 1980s carey collaborated with tdu on organizing ups workers to win better contracts a mutually beneficial relationship developed between the new york ups leader and the national reform caucus in 1989 the us government in yet another attempt to end mafia involvement in the union brought a racketeer influenced corrupt organization rico lawsuit against the teamsters union the justice department contemplated a complete takeover of the union but teamsters for a democratic union intervened in the suit asking the government to grant the teamster members the right to vote as individuals for the top leaders of the union until then union officers had been elected at conventions dominated by corrupt union officials and staff the government accepted tdu s suggestion leading to the possibility of a far more democratic union the rico suit led to thirty years of government oversight of the union and the removal in the first several years of about 200 corrupt officials many of them mobsters when carey ran for president in a campaign that lasted from 1989 to 1991 it was the first election conducted under the new rules that gave members the right to vote carey worked closely with tdu a relationship based on the recognition that tdu needed a reform candidate for the presidency of the union and carey needed the national network that tdu had constructed over the previous 15 years one could not call the campaign a honeymoon however because when campaigning often the first words out of carey s mouth at a local rally were i am not tdu perhaps this was to protect himself from red baiting since the role of socialists in the founding of tdu had become well known but as carey s former organizing director bob muehlenkamp told me carey did not want the perception that tdu controlled him carey won the election with a plurality 48 percent of the vote as the old guard supporters were divided between two other candidates when carey took office he did so with 15 reformers on the 18 member executive board members about half of whom were tdu activists carey immediately sold off the fleet of teamsters private planes cut his own salary from 225 000 to 175 000 and began the onerous personally dangerous and politically hazardous task of working with the us government s appointed trustees to remove the mafia from the union given tdu s support ken paff had expected carey to hire him for some top office like chief of staff or organizing director and to bring other tdu members to work for the union s national staff as well paff called me at the time and told me to be ready to go to washington but the call never came for him or me as muehlenkamp explained carey did not trust tdu and he believed that many of the newly elected tdu executive board members did not have the union experience in organizing leading and settling strikes or negotiating contracts so rather than hiring them as top staffers carey hired a crew of experienced progressive labor staffers from outside the teamsters several of whom were friends of tdu but the new president wanted to keep tdu at a distance only later hiring some tduers and then mostly for second tier staff jobs in fact carey almost immediately began the process of pushing tdu away in one of the first executive board meetings he told the tdu members each of whom had been elected by union members tdu is not your boss i m your boss tdu members were expected to be carey yes men carey now isolated among the union officialdom nationally most of whom were holdovers from the old order and with no political confidence in tdu on his political left came to the conclusion that he needed to broaden his base of support among the union s local officials he decided that he would do so by holding out an olive branch to the old guard and attempt to work with some of them at that time according a former tdu activist tdu s leadership discouraged some of its own members from running for office and supported slates made up of tdu members and others who were not reformers as a result some tdu members were emotionally and politically broken and sidelined most tdu members and other rank and filers remained in the dark about these developments despite his attempt to build an alliance with old guard officials cary was losing support some of those officials muehlenkamp told me engaged in strikes but then artificially prolonged them while members drew strike pay in an attempt to bankrupt the union treasury and thus damage carey the union had also lost some 500 000 dues paying members since 1979 as a result of deregulation so carey pushed for a 25 percent dues increase in early 1994 to replenish the union s treasury but the dues increase was defeated by a membership vote of 3 to 1 a stinging blow for carey two years later at the teamsters convention in july 1996 jimmy hoffa jr was able to muster more convention votes than carey another significant sign of the reform president s weakness one has the impression that while he had been an excellent local union leader as a national leader facing aggressive employers the mafia and the us government carey often felt out of his depth muehlenkamp said that carey maintained an office at local 804 where he had formerly been president just to get away from headquarters being around his old local s members recharged his batteries said muehlenkamp whatever the tensions between carey and tdu the collaboration continued and made it possible in 1997 for the union to conduct a remarkably successful national strike against ups that paralyzed the company inspired millions of teamsters and other workers and created new opportunities for the workers movement that ups strike remains a model of strike strategy organization and tactics the ibt staff and tdu activists first conducted surveys among the members organized discussions of their demands and in that way built momentum for a strike carey had not initially wanted a strike but the pressure from the base had built up among the members and it became unavoidable at one point he turned to one of the organizers and said well i guess you ve got your fuckin strike the carey tdu collaboration was essential to the strike s victory carey s administration established the central theme of the strike as the demand for full time jobs for all workers with a brilliant slogan part time america doesn t work the idea that workers wanted and needed full time jobs not only resonated with the ups employees but also with most of the american people finally the union presented its case to the public with impressive video advertisements in which the ups workers themselves young smiling and well spoken just like those who came to the door each day with your packages explained why they were striking public support was overwhelming carey did not have support from all ups local leaders but in locals where officials refused to support the national campaign tdu activists stepped up worked with teamster headquarters and organized the strike the afl cio s president john sweeney a reformer who carey had helped to elect supported the teamster strike which was a great asset the strike was also tremendously successful in part because ups package handlers and drivers had been trained to do their jobs in a particularly efficient way that made it impossible to hire replacements for them off the street the union won the strike giving carey the momentum he needed to win re election as teamster president it was a signal victory in the labor movement said ken paff it was a decisive victory converting many thousands of low paid part time jobs to union wage full time jobs at the time john sweeney said that the strike had done more for organizing than any millions of dollars the unions spent on gaining members in 1996 simultaneous with organizing the ups strike carey launched his campaign for a second term as union president he pushed aside tdu which had largely managed his first campaign and hired operatives with background in the united mineworkers union umw in ngos and in the democratic party to run his second campaign tdu still worked on the carey campaign though largely independent of the new managers carey won the 1996 election defeating jimmy hoffa jr by 52 to 48 percent but as it turned out he won through fraud it was discovered that the operatives he had brought in from outside to manage the campaign had arranged a complicated scheme to use hundreds of thousands of dollars of the union s money to re elect him named as accomplices in the scheme were other major union officials such as richard trumka a former reform leader of the umw and secretary treasurer of the afl cio and gerald mcentee president of the american federation of state county and municipal employees afscme carey had turned to the labor bureaucracy rather than to the rank and file and the results were disastrous when the corruption scheme was revealed a federal judge ordered the teamsters to rerun the election but the court appointed overseer disqualified carey from seeking office then the independent review board which had been set up by the rico settlement found that carey had closed his eyes to the corruption taking place so the board went further expelling him from the union that he was persecuted by the federal judges and overseers there is no doubt carey was eventually tried and cleared of all charges clearly ups wanted to rid itself of carey and find a more friendly union leader the old guard wanted to return to the corrupt glory days and some elements within the us government wanted to break the power of the union yet though he was no doubt persecuted it is also true that carey had invited in the group who ran his campaign in the same manner as such campaigns other unions were also sometimes run and that the fraud had happened on his watch one might conclude that if carey did not know it was because he didn t want to know with carey disqualified and then expelled from the union tom leedham a highly respected tdu ally stepped into the breech as the reform candidate however with carey and the reform forces discredited jimmy hoffa jr defeated leedham 54 5 percent to 39 3 percent with 28 percent of members voting the carey election fiasco was also a debacle for tdu which had been so closely associated with him and therefore a setback for the union reform movement too hoffa jr s ascension to the presidency meant that the ups contract that had promised full time jobs and other improvements was not fulfilled much of carey s reform work was undone and a new era of union collaboration with the employers and neglect of the members had begun it would last almost twenty five years in retrospect it seems clear that ron carey s conception of union reform was limited by his commitment to business unionism he believed that he could harness the forces from below to reform the union from above he believed that the union if it were free of the mafia could by engaging in the usual process of contract negotiation accompanied by militant strikes if necessary win a decent life for everybody he also believed that his best allies were in the union bureaucracy like the mine workers union staff who worked on his second campaign rather than with his own union s rank and file carey s 1950s and 60s view of things a vision based on the long stretch of prosperity of an earlier era left him unarmed in the face of the capitalist system with its crises new technologies transformations of industry new economic policies and shifting political power carey embodied the limits of union reform within the system what will happen with o brien the newly elected leadership led by president sean o brien will take power in the union in march 2022 the leadership team of teamsters united is a coalition involving sean o brien and fred zuckerman former rivals who came out of the jimmy hoffa jr administration at different moments and then both of them later allied with teamsters for a democratic union zuckerman broke with hoffa jr some time ago and ran against him for teamster president in 2016 with tdu s backing while o brien only broke with hoffa in 2018 at times the two men who headed the oz slate had both been strongly criticized by tdu and tdu likewise had criticized both of them but in 2021 they all joined together to defeat steve vairma another hoffa administration figure what can be expected when such a coalition comes to power throughout the past forty five years tdu organized workers both in the workplace and local unions and supported national candidates for leadership it did so during a long period of working class quiescence as all unions lost members and strikes became rare tdu s national organizer and staff worked long hours at low wages to keep the organization afloat tdu s membership never very large a few thousand at most fluctuated local chapters came and went yet tdu continued to organize creating new chapters and recruiting new members strongest among ups workers so that from time to time it was able to help to elect local reform slates during the quiet years tdu found clusters of new fighters in different areas whose presence made the movement a little more diverse ethnically and culturally tdu did an excellent job in training workers in grievance handling contract campaigns running local elections but as an organization it did not attempt to discuss the issue facing the labor movement more broadly leaving that to labor notes and it seldom took up social issues or national politics in those years tdu s determined leader ken paff continued to look for the possibility of bringing change to the teamsters the opportunity arose out of the 2018 ups contract negotiations in challenging hoffa jr on that ups contract tdu was allied with fred zuckerman head of local 89 in louisville kentucky who backed by tdu had run for teamster president against hoffa jr in 2016 narrowly losing by about 6 600 votes as the campaign advanced sean o brien head of boston local 25 and leader of ups negotiations suggested adding zuckerman to the bargaining team leading hoffa jr to take the ups negotiations away from o brien o brien then became a major figure in the campaign to vote no on the contract a majority of ups workers 54 percent eventually voted against the contract but under the teamster rules then in place it took two thirds to reject the contract only 44 percent of eligible members participated in the ratification referendum against the majority hoffa jr imposed the unpopular contract following those events zuckerman and o brien joined together and decided to run for the top offices in the union tdu then had to make a decision about what it would do tdu s national organizer ken paff overcame some resistance and convinced the tdu leadership and the organization as a whole to embrace the oz slate arguing that the long sought after change would now be possible with the combination of reform from above and from below how does the oz slate and its teamsters united coalition compare with the carey tdu alliance the latter had a relationship of collaboration built on several years of common work on ups contracts they had shared goals despite greater tensions after carey s election that made it possible for them to work together as partners most importantly on the ups contract sean o brien s relationship with tdu at least initially was altogether different o brien actually threatened to punish tdu backed union reformers in teamster local 251 in providence rhode island who ran a reform slate against an incumbent favored by o brien o brien s threat of violence led the rico created independent review board to impose on o brien a disciplinary action and a 14 day suspension from all union positions beyond that o brien has a thuggish reputation and his followers in his boston local who sometimes use racist and misogynistic language on union picket lines clearly don t all share tdu s democratic and egalitarian values yet when o brien spoke at tdu convention in october 2021 he told the assembly our coalition with tdu teamsters united and anyone else who wants to take on the fight against employers will last well beyond this election o brien has repeatedly said that tdu is an integral part of the coalition already before his campaign he had mended relations with local 251 in providence and one of its officers matt taibi was chosen for o brien s executive board slate and became eastern regional vice president tdu and its members were energized by their recent work on the teamsters united campaign and they look forward to making the union both more democratic and more militant o brien has taken power with a new executive board that includes some genuine reforms including a couple of tdu members while tdu played a role in the new president s victory it is not clear that it will have a much influence tdu has raised important issues such as the reorganization of the union s industrial divisions the continuing fight for elected stewards and preparation for strikes in car haul and at ups will o brien take up all of these will o brien integrate tdu members into his administration will he hire tdu members to work on the ibt national staff now that it is allied with o brien will tdu be able to continue to play its independent role or will tdu board members and union staff be expected to simply say yes all of these questions are on the table first will this be an administration of reform while zuckerman and o brien rebelled against the hoffa jr administration and especially against its failure to fight ups still both of them and others on the slate come out of that regime and it remains to be seen if they will be able to break with old relationships and practices hoffa jr s leadership was characterized by a go along get along relationship with the employers seeking accommodation rather than challenging the bosses hoffa jr and other teamster leaders failed to fight for higher wages accepted two tier contracts acquiesced on pension cuts and in general oversaw the deterioration of union agreements throughout the hoffa jr years top officers continued to be paid extravagant salaries more than ten making over 300 000 a year and two making more than 400 000 while even the highest paid workers in the teamsters union rarely make 100 000 a year some earn 80 00 and many make far less o brien himself makes over 190 000 and fred zuckerman 150 000 tdu s rank and file bill of rights stated no officer should make more than the highest paid working members in his jurisdiction but that bill of rights was rescinded at tdu s most recent convention reportedly to be revised and updated still it does seem that things are changing at the teamsters union convention held last summer the delegates representing the coalition o brien zuckerman and tdu held about half the votes and won three important reforms delegates voted for majority rule on the contract ending the rule that had required two thirds to vote a contract down they also voted into the constitution a new article stating that every bargaining committee must now include rank and file members finally the convention passed a resolution that strike benefits will be distributed from day one of a strike not at the eighth day as previously these are significant meaningful changes that give the ranks more power in their union and vis à vis the employers a winning ups strike in 2023 fred zuckerman in 2016 and sean o brien in 2021 both argued that under hoffa the teamsters had failed to take on ups and that it was absolutely necessary to do so tdu agrees with both of them on that the question is then will the o brien administration be able to challenge the union s single biggest employer organize a strike and win meaningful gains for its members in the 2023 contract will o brien and his team be able to organize such a national strike as carey did with the aid of tdu will the oz team have the ability to develop a strategy and the administrative capacity to put it into effect o brien has both a reputation as a fighter against ups and experience in leadership postions not only as the leader of local 25 but also as leader of the new england joint council of teamsters head of the package division and chief negotiator of the ups contract in 2017 remember that hoffa jr removed him from that last position after o brien announced that he wanted to put fred zuckerman of the louisville local on the team it was that which led to o brien s break from hoffa and his alliance with zuckerman while o brien has held important positions he has not led a large regional or national strike against a powerful multi billion dollar corporation leading a fight against ups will put him to the test o brien who comes out of the old regime and has many contacts among union officials may feel he can rely on the local union leaders and doesn t need a group like tdu to organize and win ups workers want to see improvements in the contract in several areas today ups has a multiple tier contract with wage differentials between full and part time workers there is also the issue of what are called 22 4 workers who represent a low wage tier 6 00 an hour less the historic demand for full time jobs may have to be take up again together with other demands to increase wages for part timers and to eliminate the 22 4 tier in any case workers will be demanding more pay and better conditions how hard will ups resist the union s demands will the corporation be willing to make concessions in order to get on with business and would o brien be willing to accept what they offer for example if they eliminated tiers claiming victory but avoiding a strike perhaps to answer the question about ups we have to look at the package delivery business and the changing relationship between ups and amazon the teamsters have historically been in a good position to deal with ups because it has been represented by the union for decades and has had few domestic competitors though the union s failure to organize fedex and fedex ground is a weakness like freight the package delivery companies are unregulated which means that new companies offering lower rates can enter into competition with the established outfits amazon is about to do just that the relationship between ups and amazon reminds one of that between the united states and china for a long time they were economic partners but have now become competitors and war could be on the horizon amazon began as retailer of books but soon became a general online retail service advertising the products of many companies and selling them online to consumers products bought through amazon were delivered to customer by the us postal service usps by fedex or by ups now however amazon has surpassed both ups and fedex in package delivery amazon reportedly has 400 000 drivers worldwide 40 000 semi trucks 30 000 vans and a fleet of more than 70 planes cnbc amazon s air service both carries the products it sells online and now handles freight or packages for third parties as well amazon began its package car fleet with 20 000 diesel sprinter vans from mercedes benz but the company has recently ordered 100 000 electric powered vans from rivian to be delivered by 2030 it is also buying thousands of electric ram vans from stellantis formed after merger of fiat chrysler and peugeot 1 800 electric vans from daimler and 10 000 three wheeled vehicles from mahindra an indian company this is a lot of equipment capable of delivering a lot of packages amazon has since its founding worked systematically and successfully to prevent the organization of unions among its employees in the united states over the last several years there have been various efforts to organize amazon workers by labor unions labor community coalitions and by some leftist groups but though there have been some protests small walkouts and petitions for union election it remains an open shop all of this makes amazon a very serious competitor of ups fedex and the usps the big brown machine of ups now faces amazon s big blue machine which means ups will have to fight harder to keep down labor costs this could make ups take a harder stance in a future strike and a strike at ups may not be as effective as it once was if shippers and consumers can turn to amazon if o brien does lead a strike against ups it may be more challenging than ever if o brien and the teamster united election does open the door to rank and file action as paff puts it that could lead to a real workers movement that could change the teamsters and affect the labor movement as a whole the door must be opened and the rank and file must be prepared to take advantage of the opening if it does we could see a new era for labor with increasing class struggle and class consciousness with militant minorities sparking mass labor movements we could see a new day for the labor left the teamsters new leadership in the labor movement and politics we should say a few words about the teamsters union leadership in the labor movement and in politics in the near future the teamsters were expelled in 1957 from the afl cio the umbrella organization to which most us unions belong because of its corruption and refusal to cooperate with congressional committees investigating the union thirty years later in 1987 when jackie presser the mafia fbi double agent was president the teamsters rejoined the afl cio when ron carey took over leadership of the teamsters he led the union to support the election of john sweeney a progressive labor leader who attempted to reform the federation some of sweeney s former supporters however leaders of several of the largest unions broke from the old federation in 2005 to form the strategic organizing center better known as change to win a coalition of several other large unions and their 5 5 million members hoffa jr took the teamsters into change to win but it failed to bring about much change nor did it win much o brien says he is willing to consider once again rejoining the afl cio but has not yet made a decision about it advocates argue that rejoining the afl cio would give the labor movement a lot more power but in truth the federation is a not a very progressive or aggressive body has no power over its affiliates and channels much of its energy into support for the democratic party which for decades has little for the working class it s a checkered history at best but if the teamsters become a genuine center for reform and militancy and set the ranks in motion then rejoining the afl cio might have a salutary effect on labor as a whole related to the question of the afl cio is the issue of the democratic party the teamsters were like almost all other unions historically aligned with the democratic party until robert kennedy s pursuit of jimmy hoffa in the 1960s under fitzsimmons the teamster leadership aligned with the republican party though later under hoffa jr it returned to the democratic party fold meanwhile however many white working class democrats both men and women deserted the party and began to vote for republicans and subsequently a good many of those became supporters or former president donald trump when hoffa and other teamster leaders proclaimed their support for joseph biden as candidate for president they knew many of their members would ignore them and vote for trump in terms of political values and program perhaps bernie sanders represented the best practical alternative within the democratic party for teamsters and other working class people since the sanders campaigns however the progressive wing of the democratic party has not had much success progressive democrats like alexandra ocasio cortez and the squad have with few exceptions largely been kept in line behind biden and house speaker nancy pelosi sean o brien has been meeting with biden s secretary of labor martin walsh former mayor of o brien s hometown boston o brien has praised biden s pro labor positions such as the proposed protecting the right to organize act which now appears to have little or no chance of passing and he is clearly trying to put himself in the good graces of the biden white house if the teamsters were at some time in the future to become a militant progressive union it might give them some sway in pushing the democrats to the left and if that failed the teamsters could in theory become a pole for independent political action to the left of the democrats the idea of a labor party a workers party might be put on the agenda but the prospect of any such independent working class political action much less a labor party is not on the agenda for the foreseeable future the new teamsters in the brave new world sean o brien and his team will take power in march in what following the novelist aldous huxley we might call a brave new world one that is an emerging dystopia made up of the environmental disaster of climate change recurring pandemics of deadly viruses a staggering world economy and a rightward political shift involving conspiracy theories and growing authoritarianism with all of this has come mass migration by millions around the world the head of one of us s largest and potentially most powerful unions will have to provide leadership not only on workers issues in the narrow sense but also on social and political issues that the union the working class and the entire country faces will the o brien administration be up to it let s take the question of conspiracy theories and authoritarianism we know that conspiracy theories anti scientific attitudes a lack of social solidarity racist and misogynist language and support for authoritarian figures such as trump are widespread among white people and others including members of the teamsters union many who hold such views and attitudes do not believe in the human causes of global warming do not believe in the efficacy of vaccination masking and social distancing as a response to the virus have no commitment to equality for all no longer support democratic institutions such as respect for one person one vote elections and some have come to support trump and the republican party with its racism and its pro business and anti labor policies confronting and changing such views is essential and would be a big job for any union leader but it is imperative that the teamsters too take up these problems if they are to protect and improve workers lives and the lives of all in our society taking on those issues means building a massive progressive working class movement the only thing that can possibly change society for the better unions have always stood for the idea that we join together in solidarity for the good of all both in the workplace and in society a genuinely progressive union movement would have carried out health education on a broad scale among unionists would have demanded in the beginning to play a central role in vaccination campaigns and would have taken the lead in demanding vaccination for all americans and for people throughout the world as the necessary measure to protect all and to stop the continuing mutation of the virus into new variants but some union leaders caved into outspoken conspiracy promotors anti vaxxers and libertarian individualists and resisted both vaccination and masking mandates in the name of freedom or bogus religious exceptions similarly the teamsters new leadership should begin educating the membership broadly on the issue of ending the use of all carbon fuels in order to stop global warning framing it as a fight against the powerful gas and oil companies that dominate national politics and lead the country into foreign wars it is a fight against the internal combustion engine a struggle to end the use of carbon fuels completely and so it is a particular challenge to the transportation industry its unions and workers the teamsters working with environmental groups will have to develop a convincing strategy for a transition for the millions of workers who will be affected and a plan to turn that strategy into legislation sean o brien may have opinions on such issues but there don t seem to be many in the public record with the rightwing authoritarians blaming workers of color and immigrants for the nation s problem the working class has become deeply divided trump and the republicans have blamed mexicans the chinese and the arab muslim people for the nation s problems while the real enemy is at home the american capitalist class the new teamster leadership will have to develop a program to fight racism to defend workers of color and immigrants goals that can be translated into contract demands and legislation because if we do not defend people of color and immigrants we will be unable to defend and build a united labor movement in fighting for all of these things labor notes and other progressive pro labor organizations could play a constructive role in helping the teamsters if the teamsters union is to become more democratic more powerful and more politically influential it will take a massive rank and file movement from below such a movement arising from the grassroots would need to use its economic and social power to confront employers and to resister government interference or repression like all earlier labor and social movements teamsters will have to be prepared to break the law perhaps the oz slate and teamsters united victory representing as it does a break from twenty five years of conservative leaders will create the opening for such a progressive development but the ranks will have to break from the practice of business unionism and reject the notion of reform from above socialists with their opposition to the capitalist system their critical analysis of the labor bureaucracy and their commitment to democracy and workers power could play an important role in such a movement this article began as a presentation to the socialist project of canada s labour committee the author thanks the participants for their questions and remarks thanks to the various former and current teamsters and tdu members who spoke with me and thanks as well to kim moody and lois weiner for reading

americans can hardly agree on anything anymore but people across the political spectrum have had it with capitol hill s stock trading scandals last month a fox news poll found that 70 percent of registered voters were in favor of a ban on current members of congress and their immediate family and staff trading stocks the public is fed up our otherwise divided congress meanwhile has long been united by its willingness to dodge ethics rules and avoid enacting meaningful ethical restrictions when congress created the federal conflict of interest law it conveniently exempted its own members and staffers there s nothing stopping a member such as sen joe manchin iii d w va from voting to block an environmental bill that would affect his own investment in waste coal there s also nothing stopping other members from making suspiciously timed stock trades after receiving confidential government briefings on market moving information that could change however now that congress is poised to ban congressional stock trading with bipartisan support but the details of a policy such as this are everything depending on which of several competing bill prevails congress either will take a first step toward creating a real ethics program or will give us more window dressing for legalized corruption the last time the public similarly demanded a change congress pulled a fast one by passing the nearly useless stop trading on congressional knowledge act of 2012 stock act that law did not bar members from owning or trading stocks which would remove opportunities for insider trading all it did was shorten the deadline for disclosure so it s no surprise this toothless law failed to prevent suspicious trades in fact former congressman chris collins r n y pleaded guilty to insider trading in 2019 during the pandemic the justice department investigated four senators on suspicion of insider trading related to the pandemic those probes were closed without action but the appearance of impropriety left a stain to make matters worse some in congress have shown they can t even be bothered to meet the disclosure deadline now a decade after congress conned the public with the stock act there s a danger that its members could pass another ineffectual law to look as though they re addressing the public s concern without having to change their disgraceful behavior several proposals on the table fall short sen josh hawley r mo has introduced a bill with a cumbersome enforcement mechanism that seems designed to fail his bill would entitle a member to a vote by the full senate or house before any fine is collected a process bound to end in partisan side taking and while the bill authorizes a fine it doesn t say how much so the ethics committees may lack authority or at least the nerve to collect a significant sum the bill does require members to forfeit profits or tax deductions from unauthorized transactions but only sales and not purchases generate profits or deductible losses sen jeff merkley d ore has introduced a weak ban that doesn t apply to members spouses and lets members keep stocks they owned before taking office passing a bill with any of these deficiencies would be worse than doing nothing at all because it would once again let congress hide behind the illusion of reform in contrast sens jon ossoff d ga and mark kelly d ariz introduced a stronger bill the ban congressional stock trading act it improves on the trust in congress act previously introduced by rep abigail spanberger d va who was the first and most vigorous champion of a stock trading ban and rep chip roy r texas spanberger and ossoff and their respective co sponsors have proposed that members and their spouses divest several types of assets or put them in blind trusts they don t control which would foreclose opportunities for insider trading ossoff s bill has a strong enforcement mechanism applies to spouses and dependent children and contains a crucial disclosure requirement his bill would empower each ethics committee to assess a fine equal to a month s salary and to keep assessing successive fines in that amount for each month the member remains in noncompliance a member would have no right to demand the full chamber vote on whether to dismiss the fine under an existing law members can put assets rather than just cash into blind trusts and lawmakers are notified when the trustee sells an asset but the public is not giving members more insight into their conflicts of interest than the public has ossoff addresses that problem in his bill by requiring all sale notices to be released publicly the public would finally know which members have truly eliminated their conflicts of interest and which are only pretending not to know what they own the disclosure is important because it would give the public a tool in pressuring members to sell off conflicting assets instead of just concealing them in blind trusts last week sens elizabeth warren d mass and steve daines r mont introduced a bill the bipartisan ban on congressional stock ownership act that would bar members and their spouses not only from trading but also from owning stock in large corporations this approach would meaningfully improve the situation too although it goes further than the ban congressional stock trading act by prescribing the strong medicine of divestiture for stocks rather than the creation of a blind trust it doesn t cover as many types of assets as ossoff and kelly s bill would the two bills are therefore complementary and could be combined to magnify their effect on government ethics some opponents have objected that it s unfair to apply these proposed restrictions to spouses or children if this resistance to government ethics weren t so sinister it would be laughable while working at the office of government ethics one of us shaub spent over a decade forcing presidential nominees for senate confirmed posts to comply with a conflict of interest law that applied to them their spouses and their minor children in all those years no senator picked up the phone after reading a nominee s ethics agreement to complain that making the nominee s spouse divest assets was unfair not once only now that similar requirements may apply to their own spouses and children do members of congress suddenly care and if they really see these restrictions as onerous they could easily opt out of them by simply going back to private life in truth we d like to see an even stricter ban one that applies not only to members of congress their spouses and their minor children but also to their senior staffers the president and vice president political appointees and judges and that limits the holdings they can own to diversified mutual funds and treasuries with narrow exceptions applicable only in unusual circumstances but the bills ossoff kelly warren and daines have introduced are a strong first step in the right direction after passing these bills or an amalgam of them congress could use the momentum to establish the stricter ban we propose the public has entrusted government leaders with great power it s time those leaders realized that they must put the public above all else ours is not the radical position the radical position is asking americans to continue accepting the low ethical standard to which congress has held itself walter m shaub jr is a former director of the u s office of government ethics he currently serves as senior ethics fellow with the project on government oversight liz hempowicz is the director of public policy at the project on government oversight
