the internal revenue service and department of the treasury have released final guidance on the transition away from libor setting secured overnight financing rate as an alternative and creating noncovered modification in the place of fair value the cessation of libor matters to the muni market because existing debt and contracts may reference it potentially impacting variable rate debt swaps and contracts among other things the final regulations hope to swap out the libor rate that is no longer being published as of dec 31 2021 but will be around until june 2023 with a new formula that won t change the economics of the deal or cause reissuance of the particular debt it seems to follow pretty closely the recommendations of the alternative reference rates committee the new york fed group that s overseeing the libor transition and it seems to provide needed flexibility for municipal issuers who may need to change the terms of outstanding deals in order to accommodate the loss of libor without having to undergo a reissue said michael decker senior vice president of federal policy and research at the bond dealers of america i think that s the main thing that the community was looking for and i think it s something that generally the community will be supportive of the irs is also bringing its operations into the present by using the power of ai to help irs compliance teams better detect tax cheating identify emerging compliance threats and improve case selection tools to avoid burdening taxpayers with needless no change audits bloomberg news the proposed regulations released on oct 9 2019 leaned on fair market value to ensure the value of the debt stayed the same how do you differentiate changes that are just swapping out the old formula for the new formula said johnny hutchinson partner at squire patton boggs and member of the national association of bond lawyers board of directors the way that the proposed regulations tried to do that was to say the fair market value of your debt has to be the same both before and after the change but people get very skittish when you hand them a certificate signed that says these bonds are being sold at fair market value he said muni market participants often say that calculating marked to market fair value poses challenges for municipal bonds because they don t often trade every day as stocks do sofr was another safe harbor outlined in the proposed regulations but has been somewhat controversial due to the short history of the formula being published hutchinson said with the final regulations set to be published in the federal register on jan 4 the sofr rate is mentioned as a qualified rate a qualified rate is a sofr based rate or other qualified replacement rate so long as it is in the same currency as the discounted ibor or is otherwise reasonably expected to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds in that currency law firm cadwalader wickersham taft said but satisfying the requirements with a constant fair market value has been changed that requirement has been completely scrapped it looks like from an initial read hutchinson said instead the way that the final regulations are going to test whether the parties are really making changes beyond just swapping in a new formula for the old formula is there are a list of what are called noncovered modifications and they all relate to changes in the timing or amounts of the cash flows on the debt the shift in approach basically says as long as you don t make these specific noncovered modifications the irs or treasury won t inquire as to whether the fair market value is the same but some modifications to existing agreements may include both covered and noncovered components which should be tested on a standalone basis the regulation says in a way this makes things a bit more definitive for bond counsel as when a modification event occurs they re able to pull up the list of noncovered modifications and see whether the specific event falls under it but still some uncertainty exists as bond counsel familiarize themselves with the long list of noncovered modifications if that s how the regulations work i think that s a good thing hutchinson said it s helpful and it allows us to apply the rules with a little bit more certainty than we had before for issuers this may result in additional time and money spent with bond counsel that s what the attorneys do they have to test whether or not they can be qualified emily swenson brock director of the federal liaison program at government finance officers association it s hard because that adds a lot of cost and it adds a lot of time there is currently legislation passing through congress that could affect that would allow for non penalized modifications to outstanding contracts when libor ceases to exist in june 2023 it passed the house in december in a 415 9 it follows new york state legislation that hopes to minimize disruptions by allowing tough legacy contracts or those that expire after june 2023 and do not have fallback language specifying an alternative to use sofr in a letter to speaker of the house nancy pelosi and republican leader kevin mccarthy gfoa and many other industry groups hoped to tip the scale in the industry s favor without federal legislation to address these contracts investors consumers and issuers of securities may face years of uncertainty litigation and a change in value the letter said this would thereby create ambiguity that would lead to a reduction in liquidity and an increase in volatility
as the provider of about 40 of the u s blood supply the american red cross generally aims to keep about a five day supply on hand at any given time coordinating distribution with some 2 600 hospitals across the nation but lately said spokesman joe zydlo that stock of blood on the shelves has dwindled to roughly one day s worth it s a situation that the red cross has in recent weeks described as historic with its website terming the supply dangerously low what happens is when you have only a day supply when disaster hits in a particular area such as tornadoes that we saw last month blood drives will be canceled zydlo the regional communications manager for the american red cross of missouri and arkansas explained monday on st louis on the air you may have donor centers that are closed due to what happened and so you can t collect enough blood to hopefully provide that to your hospitals american red cross of missouri and arkansas residents of trumann arkansas connect with red cross personnel in the wake of a tornado that ripped through the town dec 10 every two seconds someone in the u s needs blood he said adding that there s also been an increase in more need for more blood products over the last several months zydlo pointed to a couple of factors driving the increasing demand suggesting that some of the need comes because people who paused elective procedures during the early part of the covid 19 pandemic are finally undergoing things like hip or knee replacements he said trauma situations are also on the rise around the u s as more people are getting out there was actually a surge in blood donors early on in the covid 19 pandemic as people searched for ways to help but in recent months the red cross has seen a significant decrease in first time blood donors a 13 5 drop in the st louis region we really rely on those first time donors to come zydlo said as the organization sounds the alarm with emergency appeals for blood donation it s also focused on responding to recent natural disasters including the tornadoes that hit communities such as defiance missouri and trumann arkansas in mid december zydlo traveled to trumann and saw the devastation firsthand he discussed his observations with host sarah fenske and answered listener questions related to giving blood red cross pushes blood donation disaster relief listen as regional communications manager joe zydlo discusses what s causing the shortfall in blood supply and how it plays into the organization s recent response to tornadoes in missouri and arkansas listen 15 48 to give financially to the american red cross or set up a blood donation appointment go to redcross org st louis public radio is hosting a blood drive from 1 to 6 p m jan 19
commentary dr robert malone is a u s virologist and immunologist who has dedicated his professional existence to the development of mrna vaccines in the 1980s malone worked as a researcher at the salk institute for biological studies where he conducted studies on messenger ribonucleic acid mrna technology in the early 1990s malone collaborated with jon a wolff and dennis a carson two eminent scientists on a study that involved synthesization in fact malone is the father of mrna vaccines he has served as an adjunct associate professor of biotechnology at kennesaw state university and he co founded atheric pharmaceutical a company that was contracted by the u s army medical research institute of infectious diseases in 2016 as you can see malone is no ordinary man in fact he s a rather extraordinary man before embarking on a distinguished career in science malone worked as a carpenter and as a farmhand becoming a doctor was a lofty aspiration but through hard work and determination his dream became a reality over the course of three decades malone has established himself as one of the most competent people in the fields of virology and immunology malone is arguably the most qualified person in the world to speak on what we as a society should and shouldn t be doing during the pandemic yet for reasons that will become abundantly clear he finds himself ostracized largely silenced and cut off from the scientific community why two months before his twitter account was suspended malone wrote a rather prophetic twitter post i am going to speak bluntly he wrote physicians who speak out are being actively hunted via medical boards and the press they are trying to delegitimize us and pick us off one by one he finished by warning that this is not a conspiracy theory but a fact he urged us all to wake up sadly many of us are still asleep in my research for this piece it seems clear to me that malone has been silenced not because he s some quack spouting nonsense but because he challenged and still challenges the overarching narrative about vaccines and the lethality of covid 19 malone was recently interviewed by joe rogan for the uninitiated rogan is the host of one of the most influential podcasts in the world at one point during the three hour interview malone referred to dr anthony fauci as tony fauci a man he knows personally malone in other words knows where all the skeletons are hidden the same is true for dr peter mccullough another world renowned expert who has appeared on rogan s podcast prior to writing this piece i consulted both malone and mccullough dr anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases speaks during a briefing at the white house on dec 1 2021 susan walsh ap photo over the course of the past 18 months malone has been painted as some kind of anti vax fringe scientist a man of questionable merit who s spouting nonsense well he s not malone happens to be vaccinated all he has ever asked for is the chance to have frank and honest discussions on vaccines in his own words vaccines have saved lives many lives but it is also increasingly clear that there are some risks associated with these vaccines malone said various governments have attempted to deny that this is the case but they are wrong vaccination associated coagulation is a risk cardiotoxicity is a risk those are proven and discussed in official usg communications as well as communications from a variety of other governments malone isn t a crazed conspiracy theorist he s a man who s intimately familiar with the benefits and the risks of vaccines he s a proponent of informed consent perhaps before letting someone inject a vaccine into your body you should be fully informed of the risks involved he says he isn t an unreasonable man zero degrees of separation the story goes deeper in 2019 the bbc established the trusted news initiative tni a partnership that now includes organizations such as facebook twitter reuters and the washington post we re told that it nevertheless in this age of faux outrage and fabricated storylines society needs a fall guy a boogie man a sacrificial lamb malone fits the bill he knows too much it s much easier to discredit a decorated physician who challenges the overarching narrative than it is to actually debate him the story goes deeper in 2019 the bbc established the trusted news initiative tni a partnership that now includes organizations such as facebook twitter reuters and the washington post we re told that it was established to tackle disinformation in real time tni was ostensibly designed to wage a war on fake news upon closer inspection however it appears to have been designed to promote very specific narratives and to silence any dissenting voices such as malone s instead of trusting the tni we should question the motives of its members when one thinks of tni and the mainstream media in general various terms instantly spring to mind objectivity isn t one of them highly compromised and conflict of interest do come to mind however speaking of objectivity or the lack thereof in august 2021 the atlantic ran a much cited hit piece on malone which was high on accusations but low on actual evidence it attacked his character and credibility repeatedly rather intriguingly the article like all of the atlantic s covid 19 articles was funded by the chan zuckerberg initiative and the robert wood johnson foundation the former is an organization established and owned by facebook founder mark zuckerberg and his wife priscilla chan the robert wood johnson foundation owns stock in johnson johnson a company whose vaccine has been associated with the development of blood clots the very thing malone has been warning us about for the better part of two years people might scoff but contrary to popular belief democracy doesn t die in darkness it dies in broad daylight its death is slow and protracted one by a thousand cuts rather than by one fatal stab as author steve levitsky once wrote democracies don t often die at the hands of military generals but of elected leaders presidents or prime ministers who subvert the very process that brought them to power one of the great ironies of how democracies die is that the very defense of democracy is often used as a pretext for its subversion he wrote would be autocrats often use economic crises natural disasters and especially security threats wars armed insurgencies or terrorist attacks to justify antidemocratic measures apply these lines to the pandemic and levitsky s words carry more weight than ever before in the united states one must not question the efficacy of masks vaccines for kids the logic or lack thereof of lockdowns or the unconstitutional nature of vaccine mandates what about the little matter of vaccine breakthrough deaths don t ask any questions but wait if science can t be questioned doesn t this make it propaganda hush now don t you love america don t you want people to live rather than die then shut up and get the vaccine then the booster shot then the booster booster shot we the arbiters of truth know what s best for you somewhat ironically these self appointed arbiters of truth spout no shortage of lies a stock photo of social media platform icons in a mobile device pixabay pexels according to numerous reports fauci has repeatedly deceived the american people it s important to remember that fauci is first and foremost a talking head for the u s government in reality he s a politician with a medical degree to quote the author gillian flynn the author of gone girl the truth is malleable you just need to pick the right expert who better than fauci a highly qualified individual with his own fan club but don t be fooled fauci might act like he answers to no one but he does he answers to the u s government who then does the government answer to big pharma it seems in 2019 the roosevelt institute published a fascinating report the cost of capture how the pharmaceutical industry has corrupted policy makers and harmed patients the report outlines the many ways in which the pharmaceutical industry has shaped policies through corporate capture this is a phenomenon that sees private industries use their significant financial and political influence to manipulate a state s decision making apparatus the report warned about the dangers of lobbying and of deeply flawed medical research what we re seeing is the convergence of big pharma big tech and big government let s call it the unholy trinity with big tech doing the bidding of big government and big government doing the bidding of big pharma interestingly but not surprisingly youtube has removed the joe rogan episodes featuring robert malone and peter mccullough why because when it comes to viruses and vaccines these are among the most notable and accomplished experts in the world they appear to know things that the government doesn t want us to know additionally google the owner of youtube appears to be closely involved with the u s government what we re left with is the equivalent of a digital dictatorship with even the most qualified people being silenced ostracized and in some cases defenestrated robert malone is a wise man an honest man and a highly credible man the grief that has come his way and continues to come his way to this day is unwarranted but as he knows only too well this is the price one must pay for challenging the unholy trinity views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not

expect u s real gdp to grow by just 2 5 in the first quarter following a more than 7 annualized surge in the fourth said david kelly chief global strategist at jpmorgan funds job gains could see a sharp slowdown in january before recovering later in the quarter as the pandemic eases he added this temporary slowdown in activity combined with the dampening effect omicron is having on demand around the globe should reduce overall inflation pressure entering 2022 but that doesn t mean inflation will disappear we still expect core personal consumption deflator inflation to run well above the federal reserve s 2 long term goal throughout 2022 and if omicron s impact on the economy remains mild the fed will end its asset purchases by mid march and begin a series of quarterly 25 basis point federal funds rate hikes starting in june kelly said wilmington trust s investment committee agreed we expect inflation measures to remain elevated in coming months due to base effects and supply disruptions keeping the fed on track for a first rate hike in the second half of this year but they expect the path of hikes to be shallow as we look for inflation to decelerate later in the year as supply chain and base effects ease growth in 2022 should be at a solid above trend pace with downside risks from covid dampening consumer spending stubbornly high inflation and a more hawkish fed wilmington sees inflation slipping to 3 by mid year and the 10 year treasury yield will move toward 2 economic growth has cooled from the second quarter noted wells fargo with knotted supply chains labor shortages intensifying inflation fewer additional stimulus dollars and a resurgence of the pandemic mostly to blame our current forecast is for q1 is 3 8 said wells fargo securities senior economist mark vitner i would say there is some downside risk to that number given the surge in covid cases and further delay of the return to the office plus he expects a slowdown in consumer spending growth that said the drivers of economic growth have shifted more toward production which is less likely to be impacted by covid in q1 vitner said these projections were quite different not so long ago jpmorgan s kelly noted as prospects for a quick end to the pandemic and a combination of very easy monetary and fiscal policy suggested that the economy wouldn t slow enough going into 2022 with inflation and interest rates potentially spiraling higher and while omicron and federal reserve tapering with expectations of rate hikes are pumping the brakes on the u s economy it remains to be seen he said whether this braking pressure is about right allowing the economy to coast to a soft landing and an extended expansion or whether the economic drag might prove too much leading to a more dramatic and less happy outcome while omicron is clearly much milder than earlier variants kelly said it is also by far the most contagious of the variants and this has led to very widespread illness across the country leading to activities being limited hitting demand in the leisure entertainment travel and restaurant industries with more people catching covid albeit mild cases expect widespread absenteeism in early 2022 he said applying a significant drag to the economy in the first quarter following a very strong fourth quarter by state all but one of the 50 states posted a more moderate rate of real gdp growth in q3 compared to the previous quarter as supply chain bottlenecks intensifying inflation labor shortages and a resurgence of the pandemic weighed on economic activity vitner wells economist charlie dougherty and economic analyst nicole cervi said delaware was the only state to see real gdp accelerate in q3 while the leisure and hospitality sector continues to recover they said it is still running well below pre pandemic levels in most states in data construction spending grew 0 4 in november less than the 0 6 gain expected by economists polled by ifr markets but the october gain was raised to 0 4 from 0 2 and september s number was revised to a 1 0 jump from a 0 1 dip year over year construction spending grew 9 3 more issuance projections heading into 2022 pat luby senior municipal strategist at creditsights estimates 480 billion of total issuance with increases in both tax exempt and taxable borrowing this includes 362 billion of non taxable bonds including traditional tax exempt plus bank qualified and alternative minimum tax bonds and 118 billion of taxable bonds additionally he estimates a total of 235 billion of refunding bonds including 81 billion of taxable and 154 billion of non taxable bonds estimating new issue supply requires assumptions about the conditions of the municipal treasury and corporate bond markets as well as the nature of demand economic conditions and the legal and political environments said luby because of the sensitivities to market conditions actual refunding issuance could be much higher or lower than we estimate for instance if spreads on taxable investment grade bonds narrow demand for taxable municipals may rise resulting in greater issuance and if issuers refund a higher percentage of bonds than expected this might increase non taxable issuance while decreasing taxable borrowing the number of advance refunding bonds might be reduced if forward delivery bonds are increased luby said because the capacity to refinance older bonds is dependent on market circumstances the rate at which new bonds are issued may fluctuate as rates change issuance of new money bonds though will be less sensitive to changes in market conditions according to luby due to the depth of demand from investment grade taxable bond buyers we would not be concerned if taxable municipal supply exceeds our expectations he said

the world bank has disclosed that nigeria s debt which may be considered sustainable for now is vulnerable and costly according to the washington based global financial institution the country s debt is also at risk of becoming unsustainable in the event of macro fiscal shocks the bank said this in the november edition of its nigeria development update it said nigeria s debt remains sustainable albeit vulnerable and costly especially due to large and growing financing from the central bank of nigeria while currently the debt stock of 27 per cent of the gross domestic product is considered sustainable any macro fiscal shock can push debt to unsustainable levels however the debt to the gdp in nigeria is rising quickly and the total stock of debt in absolute value has almost doubled between 2016 and 2020 and without a policy change is expected to reach 40 per cent of the gdp by 2025 the bank further expressed concerns over the nation s cost of debt servicing which according to it disrupts public investments and critical service delivery spending the cost of debt servicing is also a concern as it is potentially crowding out public investment and critical service delivery spending interest costs have been above two per cent of the gdp since 2018 reaching 2 4 per cent of the gdp in 2019 and then falling to 2 2 per cent of the gdp in 2020 cost of debt is high as federal government also resorts to overdraft ways and means financing from the cbn to meet in year cash shortfalls at end of 2020 the stock of the cbn ways and means financing was estimated at n13 1tn or 8 5 per cent of the gdp it stated it however said that the federal government was making efforts to negotiate terms with the cbn in order to convert the stock of overdraft financing into a long term debt instrument which would lower the cost of debt for the government and enhance fiscal sustainability over the medium long term economists have raised concerns over the rising debt profile of the federal government the punch had exclusively reported that the federal government was planning to push its public debt stock to n50 22tn by 2023 with domestic debt at n28 75tn and external debt at n21 47tn this was according to the projections in the national development plan 2021 2025 the debt management office had disclosed that nigeria s public debt was n38tn as of the end of the third quarter of 2021 with the total debt stock rising by n2 540tn in three months between july and september 2021 the ndp shows that the regime of the president major general muhammadu buhari retd plans to accumulate about n12tn debt in two years from 2021 to 2023 however based on the plan the government targets a reduction in total public debt by 2025 a tabular illustration in the document shows the government targets n39 59tn debt stock for 2021 n46 63tn for 2022 n50 22tn for 2023 n50 53tn for 2024 and n45 96tn by 2025 analysts have agreed with the world bank on the costly and vulnerable nature of nigeria s public debt the fiscal policy partner and africa tax leader of pwc mr taiwo oyedele expressed his agreement with the world bank s assertion highlighting the high cost of debt servicing he said i agree with the world bank although the debt to gdp ratio is not too high if you think about the debt service cost to revenue ratio it is already over 70 per cent that s when you know it s costly nigeria borrows at double digit and even when we borrow in dollars the rates are very high and then you devalue the naira and the cost of servicing the debt in naira goes up because it is dollar dominated debt put all of that together and you can easily say to yourself that even though our debt to gdp ratio is very low our cost of borrowing is unsustainable because it is very high and therefore make it very costly he advised the government to have an integrated debt revenue expenditure strategy which would address expenditure efficiency terms of borrowing and revenue optimisation he also advised the government to reconsider its priorities regarding its national budget a former deputy governor of the central bank of nigeria and former presidential candidate kingsley moghalu also criticised the increasing borrowing tendency of the government urging the officials to re consider other ways of generating revenue for the country there are many ways through which we can improve nigeria s domestic revenue situation without selling the future of our country as to the argument that nigeria does not have a debt problem but a revenue problem that is mere sophistry if you re spending 90kobo of every one naira you earn repaying debt you are insolvent you cannot say that we have a debt to gdp ratio that allows you to continue borrowing no that is an argument for sustainable economies you cannot be comparing nigeria with advanced economies we are in an economy that is still very basic if you are not earning enough revenue why are you borrowing you are just compounding your problem why don t you focus on where to get the revenue from instead of lazily ignoring that problem and just trying to survive with borrowing if an individual was living a life that way it would be a calamity that is why nigeria is in a calamitous situation today economically he said according to moghalu it is also not reasonable to borrow for infrastructural development as the government can expand the public private partnership options for such development he said you cannot be borrowing for infrastructure they should go and expand the ppp options for infrastructure you don t have to impoverish this country by borrowing this is not sensible economic management how sustainable economically are those infrastructures they claim to be building are they yielding enough

to say about gulfport energy corporation nyse gpor in its q2 2021 investor letter thermal coal and natural gas esg investing is inflationary as green energy is simply more expensive than hydrocarbons hydrocarbon energy companies are starved for capital and are being told to change their ways the result is less exploration and drilling even with benchmark oil prices surging over the last year companies are loath to drill more normally the cure for high prices is high prices with esg in the proverbial driver s seat we might need much higher prices still in order to increase investment to meet demand there is almost nothing less popular than thermal coal from 2011 to 2020 u s coal production declined by 51 u s demand has fallen as we ve shifted to alternative sources of electricity as unpopular as coal is though it still makes up about 20 of u s electricity generation globally coal demand is growing modestly as china and india add power generation capacity faster than the west is reducing it even so reduced oil and gas drilling has caused natural gas prices to advance and coal prices are following seaborne thermal coal prices are up 140 year over year and at the highest levels

guidance recent highlights total revenue guidance of 500 510 million for q4 2021 reflecting an increase of more than 25 compared to q3 2021 510 million for q4 2021 reflecting an increase of more than 25 compared to q3 2021 reported adjusted ebitda 1 guidance of 75 80 million for q4 2021 includes approximately 18 million in expected gain on sale of assets guidance of 80 million for q4 2021 includes

exited q4 2021 with 31 deployed fleets with 1 additional staffed fleet ready for q1 2022 deployment management commentary the strong momentum we experienced when exiting the third quarter continued through year end said robert drummond president and chief executive officer of nextier the expected sequential gains resulted from solid growth across the entire nextier enterprise enhanced by the inclusion of a full quarter of alamo contribution versus just one month in q3 2021 further market indicators suggest that the pace of market recovery is increasing and frac service supply is rapidly tightening we re only just beginning to see the financial benefits of our integrated completion service model which offers our customers higher efficiency and a path to lower costs and emissions drummond continued our integrated model will be a distinct competitive advantage for nextier and our partners as we enter the next phase in us shale s evolution supply chain disruptions and the newest covid variant will continue to pose a challenge for our operations but we re confident we have the right team in place to minimize disruptions and any related financial impacts nextier is beginning to experience the benefits from our countercyclical investment strategy with the guidance revealing signs of strong profitable growth as we exited 2021 said kenny pucheu executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextier despite typical holiday seasonality our q4 2021 guidance suggests a step change in profitability per active frac fleet relative to q3 2021 and we anticipate further gains throughout 2022 as an early adopter of low cost and emission technologies nextier is reaching the end of its two year strategic conversion to a predominately natural gas capable fleet pucheu added these investments were funded substantially by the sale of non core businesses and assets allowing us to minimize new capital deployed while repositioning the company as a leader in natural gas powered frac solutions we enter 2022 with momentum the industry s largest natural gas capable fleet and a supportive market backdrop fourth quarter expected one time gains adjusted ebitda guidance of 75 80 million for the fourth quarter includes an expected 18 million in one time gain on the sale of assets during q4 2021 nextier continued down the path of divesting diesel powered frac equipment and other non core assets to fund conversions of equipment to be powered by natural gas these divestitures and resulting significant accounting gains in q4 2021 came via previously announced equipment sales outside of the us as well as through trade ins of excess diesel equipment in exchange for tier 4 dgb conversions and conversion kits these gains reflect our commitment to reallocate capital through the sale and trade in of conventional diesel equipment for conversion to dual fuel outlook consistent with prior commentary for the first quarter of 2022 nextier expects to operate an average of 32 deployed frac fleets the company was operating 31 fleets exiting q4 2021 and intends to deploy one additional upgraded tier 4 dual fuel frac fleet in q1 2022 sequentially we anticipate net pricing gains in q1 2022 and increased utilization with the expectation that we can achieve double digit annualized ebitda per fleet by the end of q1 2022 we see a constructive demand backdrop for us onshore completion services as we begin 2022 added robert drummond supply of frac services has tightened considerably over the past year and nextier is in a great position to recapture a significant portion of the pricing concessions we made to help our customers through covid while also benefitting from value provided by its leading position of premium horsepower we remain confident that pricing can exit 2022 up double digits from 2021 s exit nextier remains intently focused on free cash flow fcf and we anticipate being on a sustained path to significant fcf generation beginning in 2022

operate while mitigating the impact on our financial performance we continue to encourage our workforce to practice safe behaviors in the workplace and while away from work to help prevent community spread of covid 19 in december however the company experienced higher levels of employee absenteeism resulting from the surge in covid 19 cases associated with the omicron variant it is possible that

the renewables and carbon capture technology it is developing that will provide another outlet for the materials it uses in oilfield applications one company in particular is looking to green energy applications using materials that have been primarily used in oilfield applications the decline of the oilfield service sector ofs due to reduced activity in the past few years have required companies participating in this space to look for new sources of revenue one such company tetra technologies inc nyse tti is expanding its horizons to green energy applications with materials that have traditionally been used in primarily oilfield applications for those who aren t familiar with them tti has three legacy core businesses oilfield fluids additives and field service frac water treatment and management services in the shale patch chemical manufacturing for industrial applications and for their own bromine supply the news of their partnership with eos corporation nyse eose compels us to look at tti through a new lens that of a minerals and resource steward with significant reserves of key minerals bromine and lithium that are finding new applications in the alternative energy economy in the case we will discuss in this article flow batteries play a role in the viability of the rapidly expanding installations of solar farms for industrial and residential electricity applications when the sun doesn t shine and the grid must be supplied flow batteries are the technology that fill the gap you can read the press release for yourself but i will summarize the key parts of what this partnership entails tti manufactures a chemical known as zinc bromide in their magnolia arkansas facility by manufacturing i mean that tti adds zinc oxide to elemental bromine to make the final product znbr2 for the past forty years the main application for znbr2 has been as a heavy completion fluid used in oilfield completion operations znbr2 had a couple of attributes that made it attractive to use this way one it enabled a density of as much as 2 45 s g roughly two and a half times the weight of water two it lowered the true crystallization temperature tct the eutectic point of a fluid where it begins a phase change from liquid to solid of a brine fluid those were the positive attributes there were also some negative ones the low ph of the fluid made it a weak acid and therefore it was risky to handle for field workers to a large degree proper preparation and personal protective equipment ppe mitigated this risk although you can probably imagine how miserable wearing a neoprene slicker suit in the gulf of mexico gom in summer can be but that wasn t the real problem zinc is an epa listed material and bioaccumulates up through the food chain it is a known teratogen and therefore comes with strict discharge limitations as a combination of risk to personnel and the epa reporting requirements oil companies have been increasingly reluctant to use it several former manufacturers of znbr2 have withdrawn from the market as well these actions have proved to be timely as alternatives to the use of zinc are now marketed so the fact that a new use for znbr2 has come along is welcome news to tti and could be an increasing source of revenue in the coming years the zynth battery and eos the oil industry has long known that leaving zinc bromide as a packer fluid was a great way to have tubing failure or come back to the rotted casing in a couple of years zinc bromide is an electrolyte and readily enables ion transfer from metal into brine even with corrosion inhibitors applied at elevated temperatures zinc posed an unacceptable risk there s a lot more to the corrosion story and we re going to stop here on that subject related beijing slashes import quotas for independent refiners by 11 but that very characteristic is what makes znbr2 a powerful candidate for use in batteries designed to store power generated in daylight from solar arrays when the sun goes down they then discharge this stored energy into the grid eos if you are struggling with the concept as described above this graphic sums it up nicely in between wind and solar are neat arrays of chemical batteries ready to kick in and deliver power when the wind fails to blow and the sun doesn t shine eos there is some overlap between li batteries and flow batteries as noted in the eos graphic below the point eos is making here is that to accommodate the entire range of applications different technologies appear to be best suited for unique situations the segment eos has targeted is the standby commercial power segment so what is a znbr2 zynth battery traditional znbr2 flow batteries rely upon separate chambers to flow the znbr2 solution across membranes coated with zinc in the charge cycle the ion transfer creates current which provides the electro motive force for the discharge cycle in graphic below eos describes their static battery marketed as the zynth as a step change improvement over the flow battery eos why znbr2 batteries they come with a lot of pluses and a few minuses on the plus side 100 depth of discharge capability on a daily basis little capacity degradation enabling 5000 cycles low fire risk as electrolyte is non flammable no need for cooling systems use of low cost and readily available battery materials easy of end of life recycling using existing processes on the con side lower energy density than li ion batteries lower round trip efficiency than li ion although this can be partially offset by the energy drawn from li ion installations to run cooling systems the need to be fully discharged every few days to prevent zinc dendrites that can puncture the separator lower charge and discharge rates than li ion now you will remember i said the market was segmented li ion battery has been widely adopted for transportation if you have any doubts about this just look at the 2 year chart on albemarle corporation nyse alb ranging from 56 in march of last year to as high as 280 last month what the zynth battery is particularly suited for is the deep discharge daily cycling needed by solar and wind power installations for grid power eos site growth in solar power the international energy agency iea has identified a sharp growth profile for installed photovoltaic power supporting the energy grid through 2026 and beyond eos estimates that their opportunity pipeline for the next for this period is a conservative 3 7 bn advertisement iea your takeaway tti is selling at 2 84 a share now having declined from just over 4 00 a few months ago the market is only valuing the ongoing completion fluid and water management businesses that are still viable but do not have the growth prospects of the solar applications even taking those businesses at current revenues tti should be selling for more than it is now their current valuation of 300 mm is only 75 of the 400 mm worth of revenue that tti will generate this year tti is also beginning to monetize its lithium resources and that adds another lever to resource revenues their agreement with standard lithium nyse sli to extract elemental lithium from their arkansas acreage has provided a stream of revenue and stock that led to a 6 mm boost to the lagging oilfield ebitda in q 3 tti gets paid for the lithium and bromine extracted and gets shares of the sli no tti capital is tied up here going forward it s time to stop thinking of tti as just another oilfield service company they are also a resource company and control resource assets in the form of elemental lithium and bromine that could one day bring 10 s of millions annually to the bottom line the renewables and carbon capture technology they are developing that will provide another outlet for their calcium chloride give them a broadening array of distribution channels into the green energy economy by david messler for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice

photo credit photographee eu shutterstock approximately 44 million u s households or 35 of total are renters according to data from the u s census bureau renters tend to move much more frequently than homeowners for example 51 of renters surveyed in the 2019 american community survey reported moving into their current home within the past two years compared to just 15 of homeowners while the majority of renters move frequently about 5 5 of u s renter households have been in the same residence for more than 20 years for a variety of demographic economic and cultural reasons this percentage is far higher in certain parts of the country one advantage of staying in a rental unit longer is that landlords tend to raise rent more slowly for existing tenants a factor that is especially important when market rents are growing faster than wages census bureau data shows that renters who have been in their homes longer pay much less in rent on average than renters who have been in their homes for less time in 2019 the median rent for households who moved into their homes within the past two years was 1 160 per month or nearly 30 higher than the median rent paid by those who last moved in 1989 or earlier both average tenure and rental prices vary significantly across the country on a regional basis renters in the northeast and california tend to stay in their homes longer due to a combination of competitive housing markets high housing costs and rent control laws in new york state for example nearly a third of renters haven t moved in over a decade and more than 15 haven t moved in at least 20 years new york state also has the largest proportion of renters of any state at 46 5 conversely utah has a much lower share of renter households and also the lowest share of long term renters only 1 9 of renters have been in their homes for 20 years or more in utah how these trends evolve in the aftermath of covid 19 are difficult to predict on the one hand the increased popularity of remote work reduces the need to find new housing when switching between jobs based in different locations at the same time limited housing inventory and rapidly growing prices provide financial incentives for renters to stay put these factors suggest that renters might move less frequently in the years ahead on the other hand remote work largely eliminates the need to live in one place a fact that has fueled the growth of services like monthly rentals on airbnb and cultural trends like vanlife should these trends spill over into the larger housing market average tenure especially among certain demographics would likely decline to find the cities where existing renters stay put the longest researchers at construction coverage analyzed the latest data from the u s

the idea behind buying afterpay with the support of its co founders nick molnar and anthony eisen is that the australian fintech will act as a bridge between block s cash app and its seller app loading afterpay will gain access to block s extensive merchant and consumer customers in the critical us market and block will get afterpay s buy now pay later and online shopping platforms supporters think the company s long term potential is to be a super app on par with china s wechat the merger is all scrip meaning existing afterpay shareholders can choose to be paid in us listed block shares or they can hold the stock through a dual listing on the asx the final hurdle the deal still needs to clear is approval from the bank of spain which is expected in early 2022 among institutional investors canvassed by the sydney morning herald and the age there was widespread support for bringing the two firms together yet few investors had yet made up their minds about investing in block suggesting the stock may be just as divisive as afterpay has been ophir asset management portfolio manager steven ng a long time afterpay shareholder says the fund is open to retaining its stake in block assuming the takeover goes ahead he says the merger should ramp up the growth of both block and afterpay s businesses from a block perspective it looks like afterpay could act as the glue that brings together the cash and seller ecosystems ng says i think it accelerates both block and afterpay s strategy investment analyst at holon global investments todd o dea says the merger should support afterpay s growth at a time of fierce competition in bnpl but the fund has not determined whether it will invest in block we will probably see a lot of consolidation in the next couple of years in that bnpl market being able to pair up with block and get access to 70 million cash app users will be very value accretive o dea says payments is the part of banking that is experiencing the most disruption from fintechs and some see this as another attractive trait of block jun bei lui who manages about 1 billion at tribeca investment partners likes the payments business owned by block and believes the merger can fuel afterpay s access to capital and scale that it needs even so she has been selling down her position in afterpay so that it is in line with the company s weighting it s mainly just because it s a very different business now liu says block s exposure to cryptocurrencies is a concern for some investors credit moe zoyari bloomberg crypto volatility a key concern for liu and many others is block s cryptocurrency exposure at its latest quarterly results revenue from bitcoin trading was us1 8 billion 2 5 billion a third lower than the june quarter largely in response to volatility in the digital asset s price for some investors such wild swings are a turn off while liu says cryptocurrency trading will eventually find its place she says it s difficult to put a valuation on a cryptocurrency trading business and at the moment she is not convinced the risk reward trade off makes sense for her investors the challenge is that cryptocurrencies is such a volatile space the volatility of cryptocurrencies is five times that of the sharemarket liu says managing director of white funds management angus gluskie says crypto risks will be a key issue for an asx investor to consider if they are looking at block shares alongside its international exposure we haven t made up our mind however it s clearly got exposure in areas which carry great risk he says my personal feeling is cryptocurrencies have endless supply and ultimately no value so it s a pretty dangerous space to be in yet as crypto assets become more mainstream with commonwealth bank set to offer bitcoin trading there are plenty in the market who are comfortable with some crypto exposure nick healy portfolio manager of wilson asset management s global equities fund says block s exposure to the volatile bitcoin market is something for potential investors to be aware of but it wouldn t necessarily hold back the market s interest in the stock i wouldn t say volatility would be a reason to rule it out but it would certainly be something you would want to be aware of going in he says jack dorsey has made his interests in cryptocurrencies clear holon s o dea does not see block s bitcoin exposure as a problem either saying it is a way to gain exposure to cryptocurrency assets if anything it might be good to have a bit more innovation on the asx and a bit more diversification away from banks and miners o dea says ophir s ng also says he is not worried about the company s bitcoin revenue it just makes the revenue look more volatile but for us it s the gross margin that s important he says my personal feeling is cryptocurrencies have endless supply and ultimately no value so it s a pretty dangerous space to be in angus gluskie white funds management moreover ng says block s move to offer bitcoin trading to customers is an example of the company s willingness to innovate like all growth stocks including afterpay block s shares have also been on a rollercoaster ride surging more than six fold from their covid 19 lows to us247 26 when the deal with afterpay was announced in august since then however they have dropped more than 30 per cent also like afterpay the company has never paid a dividend and it does not expect to pay one in the forseeable future as it focuses on growth us centre of gravity a final issue confronting potential block investors is geography while it will be dual listed the company is us focused and local investors will have far less access to management than they had with afterpay block has a market capitalisation of more than us80 billion but the weighting of the asx listed block shares on the local market is uncertain opal capital management portfolio manager omkar joshi predicts local interest in asx listed block shares will fade away over time as has occurred with unibail rodamco the owner of westfield which has a dual listing in australia at the end of the day block is a us business investors in australia are not really going to spend much time on it says joshi who does not currently hold afterpay shares

the relentless rise of apple s stock speaks to the power of apple s capital return program which spent 85 5 billion to repurchase shares and 14 5 billion on dividends in apple s fiscal 2021 apple is the poster child for share buybacks spending more than 467 billion in the past 10 years investors are beginning to see apple as a flight to safety or quality trade thanks to the combination of its large cash flow and willingness to return that money to investors apple capped off a stunning rise on monday when it briefly became the first company to touch a 3 trillion market value before closing the day just short of the mark the relentless rise of apple s stock speaks to the power of apple s capital return program in recent years apple has been the biggest repurchaser of its own shares in the s p 500 by far apple spent 85 5 billion to repurchase shares and 14 5 billion on dividends in its fiscal 2021 which ended in september apple spends more on buybacks than other companies who repurchase a lot of their shares including meta platforms formerly facebook alphabet bank of america and oracle get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters share buybacks boost a company s stock price by reducing the supply of shares in the market effectively returning the money to investors in addition reduced share counts increase earnings per share a metric used by many value based investors to judge a stock apple started to pay quarterly dividends and repurchase its shares in march 2012 since then and through last summer apple has spent over 467 billion on buybacks according to s p global market intelligence which calls the iphone maker the poster child for share buybacks in fact since august 2018 when apple first hit a 1 trillion value its stock is up 252 compared with a market cap increase of about 200 the disparity is a direct result of its buyback program which has reduced the company s share count from about 19 4 billion at the end of june 2018 to about 16 4 billion now investors are beginning to see apple as a flight to safety or quality trade thanks to the combination of its large cash flow and willingness to return that money to investors the recent rally in shares in part may reflect investor expectations of relatively stable demand and continued strong cash flows and capital return for a stock that has performed largely in line with the market bank of america securities analyst wamsi mohan wrote in a december note can it continue apple s prodigious cash flow is one reason why investors believe that apple can continue to spend significant amounts on share buybacks while still growing its headcount and investing in research and development apple reported an industry leading 104 billion in cash flow in its fiscal 2021 by way of comparison fellow tech giants microsoft and alphabet had about 77 billion and 65 billion in cash flows during their most recent fiscal years respectively apple s ability to generate free cash flow could also allow the company to continue its capital return program even when it becomes net cash neutral which apple ceo tim cook describes as a point when apple s total cash will equal its total debt in dec 2017 alongside a new tax law that allowed it to move most of its cash pile from overseas apple said that it planned to no longer maintain its huge cash pile and instead planned to return cash to investors over time apple s buyback pace immediately quickened from 33 billion in fiscal 2017 to 73 billion in fiscal 2018 as of october apple has 66 billion in net cash cfo luca maestri said at the time that s down from about 163 billion in net cash from when the decision was announced in november bernstein analyst toni sacconaghi predicted that apple would be able to continue repurchasing between 3 and 4 of outstanding shares through 2026 without taking on net debt apple has borrowed in recent years to fuel its capital return program but its spending has been offset by its cash pile apple generally updates investors on its shareholder return plans in april alongside its second quarter financial results citi analysts expect apple to announce another 90 billion in buybacks and to raise its dividend by 10
parents of the more than 46 000 boston public schools students should brace themselves for at least a possibility that covid fueled staff shortages will prompt school cancellations in the coming weeks even as district and city leaders continue to prioritize in person learning officials said monday more than 150 bps employees tested positive for covid 19 over the weekend and leaders of the state s largest school district expect that number to grow before students return to classrooms on tuesday superintendent brenda cassellius and mayor michelle wu both said monday that they want boston to keep kids in school buildings but indicated the ongoing winter surge may make that goal difficult to achieve in person learning is better for our kids wu said describing the difference she notices in her two children when they attend school in person however we have to be realistic about staffing challenges districts across the country right now are facing a surge as positivity rates go up it becomes unmanageable at a certain point to keep classrooms staffed in past years the district coped with staffing shortages by combining classrooms an option that wu said is no longer safe during the pandemic a total of 155 teachers and administrative staff among the district s workforce of more than 9 700 reported positive covid 19 tests across saturday and sunday wu said she called that figure an exponentially larger number than the rate of absence before the pandemic asked if parents should expect that schools could be canceled in the coming weeks due to a lack of available teachers cassellius replied they should anticipate that that is a possibility we are doing everything possible not to have that happen we are trying to protect in person learning for our students she said we know this is where they get their meals this is where they get their education and care and often many of our students with special needs they get services they need so they don t regress cassellius projected that transportation issues are likely this week urging parents to monitor the bps app for any alerts about bus delays or cancellations the district has 105 standby drivers to cover for absences and help mitigate the impact while cassellius praised mitigation methods such as pooled testing in place in boston and other districts both she and wu urged bostonians at large to get vaccinated avoid large gatherings and take other precautions to slow the spread these mitigation methods have really helped us to stop in school transmission cassellius said what we re trying to do now is stop it from getting into school that s where the community can help with getting vaccinated getting themselves tested and not going out if you re not feeling well students in many other districts returned from their winter break on monday gov charlie baker who visited salem s saltonstall school early monday morning said the vast majority of schools opened though some opened late or remained closed baker has made a push to keep remote learning off the table warning that it inflicted terrible damage to kids during the early months of the pandemic and declaring that a return to the format is not going to happen in massachusetts the baker administration announced plans last week to provide school districts with enough at home rapid covid 19 test kits to provide two tests to each school employee suggesting staff take one test before returning from the break because of shipment hurdles districts received tests on saturday and sunday several days after the initial planned delivery wu said bps received its 10 000 plus state supplied tests on sunday enough for each teacher to take one test that is not sufficient and that will get us through tuesday morning barely she said calling for new measures to provide regular testing to teachers across the state demand for tests during the holiday season and the omicron fueled wave has led to long lines at testing sites and challenges finding at home tests in stock at local stores after swearing in new and returning city councilors wu told reporters she was on her way to meet with her team to make sure we re tackling specifically the problem of hours long lines in boston this is unacceptable wu said there s no reason why in this city people should be waiting for hours in the cold to do something that is necessary for their family s health and safety the first term mayor said her focus is on two areas for potential improvement increasing the number of sites and the testing capacity at each site and making lines move more efficiently and faster an underlying problem wu said is the degree of investment in local public health infrastructure she noted that the city relied on whittier st health center to operate its first night vaccine and booster clinic for a large chunk of the day boston is the home to the world s best hospitals and most brilliant experts when it comes to health and public health we need to be investing more in our public health infrastructure overall wu said right now our public health commission is working so hard but we have to partner with outside health care companies and organizations to be able to provide that staffing to do testing and vaccinations in the fall baker activated national guard members to fill school transportation gaps amid a driver shortage about 200 guard personnel drove a total of 330 000 miles in school vehicles over the following two months the governor said monday that boston turned down the opportunity to participate with the national guard on that program wu who had not yet taken office as mayor when the program launched responded monday that national guard members were licensed only to operate seven passenger vans and not the larger buses that boston uses district officials explored renting smaller vans to supplement their bus fleet but found there wasn t the availability we needed she said we have 27 000 students who rely on boston public schools for transportation wu said many of these are students with disabilities who have serious medical conditions and need a tremendous amount of care our drivers are professionally trained they know the streets of boston the routes are sometimes quite complex so this was simply not a program that was fit for boston s needs

for two years the stockmarket has been largely able to ignore the lived reality of americans during the pandemic the mounting coronavirus cases the loss of lives and livelihoods the lockdowns because of underlying policies that kept it buoyant investors can now say goodbye to all that investors are expecting a turbulent 2022 credit bloomberg come 2022 the federal reserve is expected to raise interest rates to fight inflation and government programs meant to stimulate the economy during the pandemic will have ended those policy changes will cause investors businesses and consumers to behave differently and their actions will eventually take some air out of the stock market according to analysts it s going to be the first time in almost two years that the fed s incremental decisions might force investors or consumers to become a little more wary said david schawel chief investment officer at family management corp a wealth management firm in new york

with interest rate hikes on the horizon what lies in store for the fixed income markets and how should advisors position their clients portfolios accordingly to find out we turned to the franco ditri investment specialist in t rowe price s fixed income division in his role ditri covers the full range of fixed income strategies working closely with clients consultants and prospects in the intermediary channel in north america he has also served in roles at invesco brandywine global investment management susquehanna international group and others lara crigger managing editor etf trends etf database t rowe price just published its 2022 market outlook in it you address a question that s top of mind for many of our readers where can i find income so let me kick it to you franco where the heck can advisors find income in 2022 franco ditri investment specialist t rowe price s fixed income division taking a look at the fixed income markets everyone knows that spreads are incredibly tight they re at the tightest levels they ve been in certain sectors in the last 20 years so where can we find income especially in this type of market at this point we tend to find income in shorter duration fixed income we tend to favor certain areas such as floating rate bonds with very short duration typically less than half a year or the 1 3 year space in fixed income across many sectors across corporate government mortgage backed securities the 1 3 year space tends to have a higher sharpe ratio so the risk return profile tends to be better at this time we are not terribly concerned about credit risk if we look at a company s balance sheets they have more cash than they ve had in the past their interest ratios have come down they have been able to increase prices there s some metrics out there saying that 60 of companies tend to increase prices so the biggest risk is that interest rate risk we do expect the fed to hike rates chairman powell came out last week stating that they have met the criterion on their inflation mandate that they re a bit more flexible on their employment mandate and that rate hikes are on the table for next year the fed is showing estimates for three hikes next year so where do we find income the front end with floating rate you re still getting around that 4 yield which in this environment with the potential for rising rate environments we do think that is very attractive also if we expand the universe which we have flexible mandates that allow portfolio managers to go out there and find these certain opportunities we can find opportunities elsewhere for 2021 that was in taxable municipal bonds clos non agency mortgage backed securities crigger do you foresee the opportunity in these sectors to continue in 2022 or has the time passed on them ditri we do think that munis still offer nice risk adjusted returns state and local governments have more cash on their balance sheet and balanced budgets we ve seen states such as illinois being close to being downgraded however that turned quickly as the cash infusion started coming in so we are still bear bull on municipal bonds we think that there is more income in the higher yielding part of that market but we do still very much think munis have a long runway we also think there s still an opportunity in clos the one concern is that there s so much supply this year but we actually think that that is somewhat healthy clos held up very well during the covid related sell off and on a relative value basis we like the higher quality part of the clos they continue to screen cheap and we think that they re a bit cheaper than corporates of the same quality with aaa rated clos we ve only seen what we would consider modest widening despite record issuance and they continue to scream cheap versus other sectors of the market we also think that aa rated clos will look good compared to a blend of lower quality investment grade and that the securitized market itself is a place for opportunity going into 2022 crigger for an advisor who may not be as familiar with the securitized space what should they know about it as they give it a closer look ditri the securitized market has many many different sectors some of the most common are asset backed securities when you re first taking a look at the securitized market you can start in those areas and you don t need to get to the exotic part of the market you have residential mortgage backed securities commercial mortgage backed securities so there s opportunities in those exposures they tend to have solid risk return ratios but it depends on your level of risk and that s why we think it makes sense to have a manager that can go out and find these particular opportunities because they re not easy to look up all the details read the fine print on how they re paid when they re not paid and so on so there are some of the more well known areas but then you also have the prime auto and subprime auto loans there are areas in which we can find opportunity given dislocations in the market crigger so the fixed income market is one that really proves the value of active management ditri agreed if you look at the agg that benchmark probably has 35 to 40 exposure to u s treasuries if rates are going up then perhaps you don t want to have such a large exposure to u s treasuries maybe you want to go out and diversify into asset backed securities clos cmbs high yield bank loans and even emerging market corporate debt which can be issued in u s dollars that debt tends to be high quality and it has a risk return ratio in between u s investment grade and u s high yield so we think that the opportunity for active management in fixed income is paramount because benchmarks tend to be skewed by the largest issuer s debt and risk weighting matters too again looking at the agg as of the end of september it had about 26 of its index in investment grade corporates however that portion made up almost 84 of what we consider the risk weighted allocation so just looking at the exposures really don t let you know how much risk is associated with those exposures crigger speaking of risk what sort of challenges do you think fixed income investors will encounter in 2022 will it be more of the same circumstances we saw in 2021 or are there new challenges that investors should start to prep for ditri the biggest challenges over the past few years is that all risk assets have been driven by monetary policy fiscal policy and the overhang of the virus as we see with the latest strain that will continue in 2022 but the biggest change we have seen and we ll continue to see is that central banks in the developed markets have now started tightening we saw the bank of england increase rates last week and the bank of norway and the bank of new zealand have also raised rates we ve seen the fed come out say they re going to increase rates so that extremely accommodative monetary policy in the developed markets is starting to change and will change next year meanwhile emerging market central banks have been increasing rates since march of this year all to do with the big overhang of inflation you ve heard chairman powell stating that we should retire the term transitory inflation however we do think that inflation will come down in 2022 it will take some time though our expectations are not for inflation to be below 2 as we have been used to for a number of years we ve seen ranges anywhere from 2 5 to 3 but we do think that there are some deflationary pressures we went back to the averages for the components and subcomponents of inflation and said if these subcomponents were to go back to their pre covid trends what would be the impact on inflation and we ve seen the largest component for potential deflation which has been bringing the inflation headline numbers down is from new and used vehicles u s car prices have risen significantly and new car prices have risen due to the supply chain shortages but we expect that by mid next year the supply chain issues will start to resolve contributing to a decline in that component of inflation looking at our internal calculations we see 3 25 of potential for areas of inflation to come down almost 2 of that is coming from new and used vehicles crigger car sales are a canary in the coal mine whatever way inflation is going to go look to the new and used car sales and they ll tell you ditri yes another bigger concern is the cost of rent or owner s equivalent rent that will be the part that will drive inflation that is increasing because it s been below trend and so it tends to come in with a lag taking a look at inflation and its prior years base effects we expect core inflation to peak in february or march of next year we do expect the energy component which has been very large past few months to start to come down as well it is tracking to be negative for the month of december meaning it s declining from a higher level in november those large readings from 2021 will start to come out and we ll start seeing inflation coming down but we don t expect it to go back to where it was before below 2 crigger so still slightly elevated as to where we were from before but not 10 or 15 or whatever sort of disaster scenario some folks are predicting ditri agreed that s how we see it if we take a look at what the fed discussed last week they see inflation a little bit higher with its december projections versus those from september but they still see it coming down year over year what we think the fed did is they gave themselves maximum flexibility they want to end the tapering the buying of bonds in march to give themselves the flexibility to raise rates crigger as we enter this final stretch of the year many people are making their year end adjustments how should investors be positioning their fixed income portfolio moving into 2022 ditri when looking at your fixed income portfolio you need to ask yourself two questions is the purpose of it to generate income or to provide different diversification versus your equity exposures when you answer that question that will help you structure the allocation we went back and looked historically at fixed income benchmarks what actually drives return in fixed income there s two components the price components of buying a bond at par selling it for more or less or the income component which is part of the name of fixed income if you look at the agg the standard benchmark over the last 14 to 15 years we found that about 80 of the agg s returns over that time period has come from the income component but once you move outside of those benchmarks and you start to look at municipal bonds the front end investing bank loans high yield emerging markets and so on then over 100 of your return comes from the income component so when looking at your fixed income allocation once you determine the role of that in your portfolio we think that you find a manager that sticks their philosophy and process maintains that exposure over the medium term and income should generate your return we do think it always makes sense to have a core fixed income allocation that should be your ballast for troubles in the equity market but as we said in the beginning of our conversation you re not getting much income in that space that s where you can kind of go one of two ways you find those flexible portfolios that can get exposure to the income generating sectors like u s high yield floating rate loans or emerging markets with the portfolio management team determining your exposures or you can create the plus exposures with sector specific positioning crigger any last thoughts ditri the one big takeaway i would say for readers should have is that 2022 will be a challenging year but the u s will still be growing at an expected 4 next year that s still significantly higher than our long run average around 2 so the growth has been delayed not derailed we do expect inflation to decline we know spreads are tight but there is opportunity out there to still generate income in the fixed income market if you take a look at your allocations give managers some flexibility and then let the positioning do the rest for more news information and strategy visit the active etf channel
photo credit photographee eu shutterstock approximately 44 million u s households or 35 of total are renters according to data from the u s census bureau renters tend to move much more frequently than homeowners for example 51 of renters surveyed in the 2019 american community survey reported moving into their current home within the past two years compared to just 15 of homeowners while the majority of renters move frequently about 5 5 of u s renter households have been in the same residence for more than 20 years for a variety of demographic economic and cultural reasons this percentage is far higher in certain parts of the country one advantage of staying in a rental unit longer is that landlords tend to raise rent more slowly for existing tenants a factor that is especially important when market rents are growing faster than wages census bureau data shows that renters who have been in their homes longer pay much less in rent on average than renters who have been in their homes for less time in 2019 the median rent for households who moved into their homes within the past two years was 1 160 per month or nearly 30 higher than the median rent paid by those who last moved in 1989 or earlier both average tenure and rental prices vary significantly across the country on a regional basis renters in the northeast and california tend to stay in their homes longer due to a combination of competitive housing markets high housing costs and rent control laws in new york state for example nearly a third of renters haven t moved in over a decade and more than 15 haven t moved in at least 20 years new york state also has the largest proportion of renters of any state at 46 5 conversely utah has a much lower share of renter households and also the lowest share of long term renters only 1 9 of renters have been in their homes for 20 years or more in utah how these trends evolve in the aftermath of covid 19 are difficult to predict on the one hand the increased popularity of remote work reduces the need to find new housing when switching between jobs based in different locations at the same time limited housing inventory and rapidly growing prices provide financial incentives for renters to stay put these factors suggest that renters might move less frequently in the years ahead on the other hand remote work largely eliminates the need to live in one place a fact that has fueled the growth of services like monthly rentals on airbnb and cultural trends like vanlife should these trends spill over into the larger housing market average tenure especially among certain demographics would likely decline to find the cities where existing renters stay put the longest researchers at construction coverage analyzed the latest data from the u s

the idea behind buying afterpay with the support of its co founders nick molnar and anthony eisen is that the australian fintech will act as a bridge between block s cash app and its seller app loading afterpay will gain access to block s extensive merchant and consumer customers in the critical us market and block will get afterpay s buy now pay later and online shopping platforms supporters think the company s long term potential is to be a super app on par with china s wechat the merger is all scrip meaning existing afterpay shareholders can choose to be paid in us listed block shares or they can hold the stock through a dual listing on the asx the final hurdle the deal still needs to clear is approval from the bank of spain which is expected in early 2022 among institutional investors canvassed by the sydney morning herald and the age there was widespread support for bringing the two firms together yet few investors had yet made up their minds about investing in block suggesting the stock may be just as divisive as afterpay has been ophir asset management portfolio manager steven ng a long time afterpay shareholder says the fund is open to retaining its stake in block assuming the takeover goes ahead he says the merger should ramp up the growth of both block and afterpay s businesses from a block perspective it looks like afterpay could act as the glue that brings together the cash and seller ecosystems ng says i think it accelerates both block and afterpay s strategy investment analyst at holon global investments todd o dea says the merger should support afterpay s growth at a time of fierce competition in bnpl but the fund has not determined whether it will invest in block we will probably see a lot of consolidation in the next couple of years in that bnpl market being able to pair up with block and get access to 70 million cash app users will be very value accretive o dea says payments is the part of banking that is experiencing the most disruption from fintechs and some see this as another attractive trait of block jun bei lui who manages about 1 billion at tribeca investment partners likes the payments business owned by block and believes the merger can fuel afterpay s access to capital and scale that it needs even so she has been selling down her position in afterpay so that it is in line with the company s weighting it s mainly just because it s a very different business now liu says block s exposure to cryptocurrencies is a concern for some investors credit moe zoyari bloomberg crypto volatility a key concern for liu and many others is block s cryptocurrency exposure at its latest quarterly results revenue from bitcoin trading was us1 8 billion 2 5 billion a third lower than the june quarter largely in response to volatility in the digital asset s price for some investors such wild swings are a turn off while liu says cryptocurrency trading will eventually find its place she says it s difficult to put a valuation on a cryptocurrency trading business and at the moment she is not convinced the risk reward trade off makes sense for her investors the challenge is that cryptocurrencies is such a volatile space the volatility of cryptocurrencies is five times that of the sharemarket liu says managing director of white funds management angus gluskie says crypto risks will be a key issue for an asx investor to consider if they are looking at block shares alongside its international exposure we haven t made up our mind however it s clearly got exposure in areas which carry great risk he says my personal feeling is cryptocurrencies have endless supply and ultimately no value so it s a pretty dangerous space to be in yet as crypto assets become more mainstream with commonwealth bank set to offer bitcoin trading there are plenty in the market who are comfortable with some crypto exposure nick healy portfolio manager of wilson asset management s global equities fund says block s exposure to the volatile bitcoin market is something for potential investors to be aware of but it wouldn t necessarily hold back the market s interest in the stock i wouldn t say volatility would be a reason to rule it out but it would certainly be something you would want to be aware of going in he says jack dorsey has made his interests in cryptocurrencies clear holon s o dea does not see block s bitcoin exposure as a problem either saying it is a way to gain exposure to cryptocurrency assets if anything it might be good to have a bit more innovation on the asx and a bit more diversification away from banks and miners o dea says ophir s ng also says he is not worried about the company s bitcoin revenue it just makes the revenue look more volatile but for us it s the gross margin that s important he says my personal feeling is cryptocurrencies have endless supply and ultimately no value so it s a pretty dangerous space to be in angus gluskie white funds management moreover ng says block s move to offer bitcoin trading to customers is an example of the company s willingness to innovate like all growth stocks including afterpay block s shares have also been on a rollercoaster ride surging more than six fold from their covid 19 lows to us247 26 when the deal with afterpay was announced in august since then however they have dropped more than 30 per cent also like afterpay the company has never paid a dividend and it does not expect to pay one in the forseeable future as it focuses on growth us centre of gravity a final issue confronting potential block investors is geography while it will be dual listed the company is us focused and local investors will have far less access to management than they had with afterpay block has a market capitalisation of more than us80 billion but the weighting of the asx listed block shares on the local market is uncertain opal capital management portfolio manager omkar joshi predicts local interest in asx listed

the center square farmland prices are expected to continue to rise in 2022 that was the consensus of 93 of attendees at a recent university of illinois farmland market webinar sixty percent of those surveyed at the webinar said they expect farm prices to rise by 5 next year agupdate reported thirty percent said they expect farmland prices to rise more than 5 next year the dramatic 20 rise in farmland prices in 2021 makes glenn semple vice president of farm credit illinois nervous in spite of the fact that the farm economy is quite healthy he said i m not saying land values are going to go down semple said but if commodity prices were to decrease by 25 or 30 and interest rates were to go up by 1 5 or 2 it would be challenging for land values to stay where they are at for most buyers the majority are investors and cash buyers rising land prices are not an issue semple said however buyers on the margin could get into trouble if they overpay he said they are setting themselves up for the potential for it to be painful if land values come back 10 or 15 or 20 off of the highs and they bought at the high semple said for cash heavy investors looking to diversify their holdings farmland s attraction is that it is not directly correlated with the stock market or any other holdings they are probably a little strong on what they are paying for the land as a long term return on investment but if a billionaire is buying farmland and paying a little too much for it they won t feel the impact to any great degree semple said semple s concern is for the young farmer who is paying 2 000 or 3 000 an acre more for farmland than it may eventually be worth a couple of years down the road he said farmland values have a tendency to move in the opposite direction as interest rates semple said we have been in a 40 year downtrend of interest rates so land values have been in close to a 35 year trend upward he said to determine land value the calculation works like this take the typical cash rent of a farm and reduce that by real estate taxes and any expenses that an absentee landowner would have divide that by the interest rate on a 10 year treasury rate to get the price with interest rates at rock bottom lows the cap rate is down so the same amount of income can support a higher land value if interest rates were to go up significantly absent an increase in the income stream generated by that property land values would adjust downward semple said the other driving factor in the price of farmland real estate is commodity prices he said in the past 12 months corn and soybean prices have skyrocketed eighteen months ago corn was nearly 50 less than what it is today soybeans were 35 less than what they are today a large crop in 2022 where commodity prices come back to earth would take some of the fluff or some of the air out of some of these farmland prices semple said

trouble in paradise the crumbling california model by joel kotkin california is broken but it is not doomed s ome horrified conservatives dismiss california as the progressive dystopia bound for bankruptcy and let s hope growing irrelevance progressives for their part hail the golden state as the avatar of a better future the role model for a new more environmentally friendly and socially just economic order they often dismiss critiques as conservative misinformation yet california is not doomed at least in the near term nor is it anything like a model of social democracy as long as its tech oligarchs produce enormous profits and generate wealth california remains fiscally flush for the near term and the evolving economy long on digitization and constant entertainment works to the state s historic strengths key industries such as space and biomedical research also offer promise the big problem with the california model is that it does not work for most californians who suffer from the highest poverty rate cost of living adjusted in the country despite being home to three of the nation s four most expensive housing markets california has among the lowest cost adjusted median income of any state as demographer wendell cox notes although not particularly hard hit by pandemic fatalities california continues to recover more slowly than the rest of the states and now suffers the highest unemployment rate in the country including nine of the 16 metros with the greatest joblessness even as the tech oligarchy has reaped record profits and expanded its wealth to unprecedented levels california ranks as the second worst place to find a job of all the states thank god for hawaii a new economic model flush from his recall triumph governor gavin newsom along with the legislature seems determined to double down on his attempt to shape california as the model for the progressive future he claims that our state is the envy of the world and the model of social justice unlike the washington plutocracy he boasts california isn t satisfied serving a powerful few on one side of the velvet rope we can see in aggregate numbers some justification for crowing a writer at bloomberg claims that the state has the best economy in the world pointing to the bloated stock prices of the major tech firms soaring home values and the enormous wealth creation accruing to a relative handful other writers insist that california will continue to dominate most of its key industries owing to its innovation and capital resources yet it s time now to see what california s success is all about it reflects a new kind of economy dominated by a few large companies with an elite workforce a large service class and a population increasingly dependent on wealth redistribution this emerging oligarchic regime however progressive it likes to label itself is more feudal than egalitarian more hierarchical than competitive financed largely by the same tech giants who help fund newsom s successful defeat of the recall for most the reality on the ground is increasingly challenging the state is now the second most unaffordable state for home buyers a particular challenge for millennials and it suffers the highest rate of doubling up only our friend hawaii does worse california has the largest gap between middle and upper wage quartiles in the nation and it has a level of inequality greater than that of mexico and closer to that of central american countries such as guatemala and honduras than to such progressive developed counties as canada and norway according to the state legislative analyst s office 20 percent of state wealth is held within 30 zip codes that account for just 2 percent of the population less than 33 percent of state wealth is held within 1 350 zip codes that house 75 percent of californians a changed economy california s inegalitarian reality reflects the decline of what was once a remarkably diverse job rich economy key sectors included aerospace oil trade manufacturing business services agriculture as well as software and media but according to new research from chapman university s marshall toplansky and ken murphy of uc irvine california s rate of job creation over the past three decades has been far below that of key competitors such as texas arizona florida washington nevada and colorado as one observer put it california has allowed a largely unregulated sector the tech industry to thrive while putting ever more damaging restrictions on the rest of the economy especially blue collar sectors since 1998 california has lost more than 700 000 of its one 2 million while states such as arizona nevada and utah have gained and states in the intermountain west and parts of the south have emerged as industrial powerhouses tech firms have been able to run largely unrestrained but california industrial polluters must buy credits to operate face high energy prices and draconian tax and labor laws that make it exceeding difficult to operate competitively if your firm is not a quasi monopoly with other countries and states ever since california decided to lead the war against climate change in the past decade the golden state has fallen into the bottom half of states in manufacturing sector employment growth ranking 44th last year its industrial new job creation has as mentioned above lagged murphy and toplansky also found that job creation in other blue collar sectors notably construction has massively lagged that of texas florida arizona nevada utah and even highly regulated washington state over the past 30 years even without adjusting for costs notes the new york times no california metro ranks in the u s top ten in terms of well paying blue collar jobs but four ventura los angeles san jose and san diego place among the bottom ten at the same time policy makers have targeted the heavily unionized local fossil fuel industry for extinction preferring to source its oil from countries such as saudi arabia according to a study by the los angeles economic development corporation these dictates threaten over 366 000 high paying largely blue collar jobs about half held by people of color another 3 9 million jobs 16 5 percent of total state employment are at risk from these policies the threat to the high end economy the state s troubles don t stop there california is creating fewer professional business service jobs the largest source of high wage employment according to toplansky and murphy s analysis of bls data over the past three decades california has lagged behind the national average and grown at half the rate of texas washington state utah florida and colorado the growing exodus of key business service firms bechtel jacobs mckesson has both epitomized and accelerated this decline but the biggest crisis could be a decline in the all important innovation sector last year tesla hewlett packard enterprises and oracle moved their headquarters to texas some 40 percent of bay area tech workers say that they would like to move to a less expensive region leading tech firms now expect a large proportion of their workforce roughly 50 percent of whom could work remotely to stay elsewhere after the pandemic with workers seeking out cheaper and less congested climes most notably in texas or further out in the relatively cheaper california interior to be sure the core bay area counties still contain virtually all the country s billionaires under 40 but there are some signs that this may not be the case much longer the state s share of venture capital investments has fallen and the rate of start ups is rising in competitive regions such as arizona nevada texas and north carolina over the past 30 years california s innovation sector note toplansky and murphy has lagged that of several other states notably utah and washington and others too could catch up california may also discover that many of its increasingly entrenched giants such as google could become sclerotic as they take on the bureaucratic sloth associated with size and a powerful market position once an intensely competitive sector big tech has become enamored with the allure of the sure thing backed by massive capital suggests long time analyst mike malone if there is a potential competitor he says it gets bought twitter s former ceo jack dorsey has suggested that the magic that led firms and people to come to california is in danger of wearing off betraying the california promise historically california s booms entertainment trade construction aerospace semiconductors benefited large parts of the population the current boom in information technology does not even boost prospects for most in silicon valley the area note two left wing scholars manuel pastor and chris brenner once was among the most egalitarian in the nation a place of opportunity for many immigrants particularly from east asia today they suggest as it has become home to an expanding number of the super rich silicon valley has become fragmented and divided with the high tech community largely isolated from the broader region and particularly its working class simply put the current tech economy based on software social media and massive venture capital investments does not produce higher living standards for most even as it generates huge fortunes for the relative few according to a 2018 university of california santa cruz study nine out of ten jobs in the valley now pay less than they did 20 years ago adjusted for inflation particularly disadvantaged are those who clean the offices of tech firms make food for their employees and take care of their children this bifurcation is found throughout the state one in three california households struggle to meet basic needs notes the united way and that includes over half of latino households and two in five african american ones over two thirds of noncitizen latinos including the undocumented live at or below the poverty line in california there is this idea of oh we care about the poor notes mark duggan principal author of a stanford university of texas research on the country s contesting mega states but on this metric we are literally the worst the great migration california s media and academic establishment tend to dismiss the idea of an exodus blaming the narrative in large part on conservative propagandists we can debate the significance of this outbound movement but it s not exactly chopped liver since 2000 more than 2 4 million net domestic migrants a population larger than that of the sacramento metropolitan area have moved to other parts of the nation from california this process is now accelerating driven as much by people not moving in as those moving out between 2014 and 2020 net domestic out migration from california grew from an annual rate of 46 000 to 242 000 according to u s census bureau estimates this decline does not reflect the movement of disgruntled oldsters and the unemployable but from a rapid decline in people who traditionally came here to make their fortunes california now has the worst attraction rate in the country which is driving the demographic decline some 85 percent of those leaving according to an analysis of irs data from 2012 to 2019 are in their prime earning years of 25 to 64 in 2019 the largest number of net domestic migrants was in the 35 44 age category at 27 percent while 21 percent were age 55 64 particularly ironic given the state s racialized politics has been the declining growth of california s minority populations who now represent nearly two thirds of the residents some may see california as a multicultural exemplar but a recent university of california berkeley poll showed that 58 percent of african americans express interest in leaving the state more than any other ethnic group so too do 45 percent of asians and latinos minorities are increasingly headed elsewhere the latino population in the state rose at only one half the national rate from 2010 to 2019 while the state s black population was under 1 percent well below the 7 2 percent national rate and even further below its share in florida and texas over the past two decades the african american household population notes demographer cox has declined in san francisco oxnard and los angeles foreigners also appear to be staying away net international migration to the state peaked in 2015 at 154 000 and fell to 29 000 by 2020 los angeles and san francisco were once beacons for people from abroad but they increasingly choose dallas fort worth nashville houston and even some midwestern metros according to a recent study from heartland forward over the past decade los angeles lost foreign born residents while areas such as dallas columbus phoenix austin houston and denver saw growth of up to 30 percent california once the symbolic capital of youth culture is also losing its appeal to the young generation between 2013 and 2017 los angeles ranked only behind new york for the largest net losses of millennials notes brookings as young people grew to prefer the more affordable dallas austin houston and denver metros childbearing is increasingly either too expensive or out of fashion los angeles and san francisco rank last and second to last in birthrates among the country s 53 major metropolitan areas over the past decade the state suffered among the most precipitous fertility declines of any state three fifths of counties particularly those on the coast have seen a decline in their under 25 population with los angeles alone since 2000 experiencing a hegira in this demographic decline of three quarters of a million people california s total fertility rate long above the national average is now the nation s tenth lowest the rise of oligarchal progressivism the odd confluence of enormous wealth creation mass poverty and a weakened middle class has come in a state that the biden administration seeks to use a model for the rest of the country shortly after biden took office the la times gleefully wrote that the new administration was striving to make america california again what few particularly in the dominant media and political culture recognize is that this is no longer the old california of opportunity but an increasingly hierarchical and inegalitarian version rather than bolster opportunities along a broad spectrum the state increasingly deals with inequality by providing what marx described as the proletarian alms bag rent control housing subsidies free health care and other largesse to the increasingly economically irrelevant masses the culture for much of california driven by state politics is one of benefits and now guaranteed income not a jobs strategy or expectation says michael bernick a former director of the state s employment development department this can be seen in the disbursement of the state surplus which the state has chosen to dole out in an unprecedented series of payments to the poor and families making less than 75 000 a year oddly this approach has many supporters in the tech oligarchy mark zuckerberg pierre omidyar elon musk and sam altman founder of the y combinator all support universal basic income and generally back subsidies for basics such as rent and electricity some claim they will be able to foot the bill with profits made from artificial intelligence it also reflects the worldview of many tech leaders who appear to regard the masses as incapable of improving their lives in a digitized world gregory ferenstein after interviewing 147 digital company founders reported that most believed that an increasingly greater share of economic wealth will be generated by a smaller slice of very talented or original people everyone else would subsist on subsidies and perhaps a bit of gig work is there room for a counterrevolution this is not the american dream and especially not the old california version epitomized by pat brown california s governor from 1958 to 1966 who built the state s expansive road network public university and college system and promoted the development of well paying jobs in fields such as aerospace the state when i moved here in the early 1970s was all about the opportunity to rise but one recent survey this one from the public policy institute of california found that roughly two in three state residents believe that inequality has worsened in their area and that it will continue to do so in coming years nearly two thirds of californians think the state s best days are behind us for now sacramento chooses to focus on such critical issues as mandating gender neutral toys or launching a vigilante assault on gun companies but a coalition to reverse course at least can be gleaned from such things as the 2020 vote on proposition 15 a measure financed by meta s mark zuckerberg and the teachers unions which would have raised property taxes in the middle of a devastating recession in a letter to mark zuckerberg the biggest backer of the measure raising property taxes various groups including the state s black hispanic and asian chambers of commerce noted unlike facebook restaurants dry cleaners nail salons and other small businesses can t operate right now and many may never open again the last thing they need is a billionaire pushing higher taxes on them under the false flag of social justice amid the state s well publicized crime wave there s a mounting campaign against progressive district attorneys notably and amazingly in san francisco there is also growing discomfort among some minorities who are beginning to dissent over green policies a lawsuit by 200 prominent civil rights leaders claims that california climate policy has disproportionately hurt poor and minority populations by boosting housing and energy prices and undermining blue collar employment in response to the state s drive to prevent new natural gas hookups 113 cities and the three most prominent ethnic chambers of commerce african american latino and asian pacific have joined the state chamber in opposition bay area restaurateurs who prefer to cook with gas and are already struggling with existing regulatory mandates and pressures have sued the state a coming political crunch public employees are now casting their gaze at the tech moguls vast fortunes as a way to finance the state s long term indebtedness which is tied heavily both to welfare spending and pensions and lifetime health care for state workers among the worst and least sustainable in the nation the 1 percent who pay roughly half of the state s income taxes won t always have such great years and with the middle and working class in decline it s hard to see where the money will come from to support the burgeoning welfare state this is what a marxist friend might describe as heightening the contradictions as california depends on the rich for revenues it s natural that the public sector may be tempted to keep sticking it to them in 2020 alone san francisco passed three substantial tax increases on the tech and business community these included a ceo tax and a gross receipts tax that increases the rate on the tech industry to double that of comparable cities such as seattle in sacramento too there are widespread calls for wealth taxes with plans to force people to pay even if they leave the state and to raise the state s income tax already the nation s highest a new proposal circulating in the legislature would add three new surcharges on seven figure earners this would mean a marginal tax rate of 54 percent for high earners the potential impact of the plans on high earners can be seen in the departure of high profile billionaires such as elon musk and larry ellison reacting in part to the threat of higher taxes the state estimates that people and companies moving out of state are already costing 1 billion in taxes annually but the california rich long cozy with the progressive agenda may not be so content to live with the imposition of what some call fully automated luxury communism that would put everyone on easy street paid for by draconian taxes on the richest california and the american future many conservatives may like to write off california claiming that nobody is going to save the beleaguered state but the state is too large too important and too critical to be ignored california shapes our technological future even as companies such as apple sell out their legacy to china and its cultural influence is unsurpassed it s doubtful that texas or arizona much less the south will ever enjoy the creative synergy that has driven california china not texas may prove the real winner of the technological future it s conceivable that as progressives up their pressure an emerging centrist majority could arise the key will be building a new alliance between the remaining conservative and centrist voters with increasingly alienated minorities and millennials both of whom may be less reliably leftist than commonly supposed these voters like americans elsewhere want to own homes raise families start businesses and support themselves many are probably more concerned with the loss of middle management factory energy and food related jobs than with policing the gender neutrality of toys the constituencies for change do exist as for the rest of you please do not abandon california it has a way of imposing its crazy visions as well as its most brilliant innovations on everyone else our state may be troubled but the forces undermining our society are present elsewhere as well if less starkly you cannot allow our leading state and the creator of our cutting edge to go into permanent decline after all as we go so too might you comments are closed

join us the numbers published yesterday regarding the production and deliveries of tesla in q4 almost a million units delivered are really impressive even more so if we take into account the growth from year to year 87 yoy but without denying the importance of those numbers and the positive impact at the stock market level for elon musk we want to put the focus of 2022 on the 3 issues that in our opinion are the most important at this point the cybertruck volume production the opening of the 2 gigafactories texas and berlin and the mass production of the tesla semi there are plenty of articles about the cybertruck specs and capabilities as well as range and technology that it will include so we won t be talking in detail about that instead i ll be talking about the cybertruck design and volume production as we all know and according to musk it was inspired by blade runner and the lotus esprit driven by james bond in the spy who loved me which doubled as a submarine the cybertruck uses unibody construction termed an exoskeleton by tesla like most passenger cars rather than the body on frame construction which is typical of trucks as a standard vehicle frame would conflict with the under floor battery pack it uses unusually thick 3 mm 1 8 in 30x series cold rolled stainless steel body panels which cannot be stamped like conventional automobile parts the panels can only be bent along straight lines resulting in a very distinctive faceted design which has been called low poly or likened to origami this material is the same material spacex also owned by musk uses on their starship rocket because it distributes stress more evenly and allows for more interior volume earlier design concepts for cybertruck had included using titanium for the outer panels but this was later switched to stainless steel for additional strength using an alloy that was developed in house by tesla all that said and apart from many other high tech specs actual volume production is expected to begin sometime in 2022 hopefully soon but in terms of timing tesla is not usually very compliant with schedules again hopefully i am wrong as per the latest information in an article by tinsae aregay in torquenews last december 3rd the cybertruck was originally scheduled to start production by the end of this year 2021 however the worldwide parts shortage coupled with battery constraints have forced tesla to delay the start of production to the end of 2022 tesla has also recently removed all pricing and variants of the cybertruck from the company s online configurator so this should definitely be one of the main issues in 2022 for tesla cybertruck volume production the sooner the better the second main focus in my humble opinion would be to finish construction and start production at the 2 gigafactories texas and berlin gigafactory texas also known as tesla gigafactory 5 or giga texas is the automotive manufacturing facility near austin texas under construction by tesla since july 2020 tesla was aiming to have first production before the end of 2021 which did not happen and volume production in 2022 the factory is planned to be the main factory for the tesla cybertruck and the tesla semi it will also produce model 3 and model y cars for the eastern united states as well as being the site of tesla s corporate headquarters on the other hand tesla gigafactory berlin brandenburg also known as gigafactory berlin gigafactory 4 or gigafactory europe is the european manufacturing plant for tesla under construction in gr√ºnheide germany the campus is 35 kilometres 20 mi south east of central berlin on the berlin wroc≈Çaw railway which forms the north border of the site between erkner station and fangschleuse railway station and the a10 motorway which forms the west border construction work had begun by june 2020 with initial foundation work underway the set up of the first four construction cranes and the beginning of the arrival of trainloads of building materials including pillars and beams musk had stated at the time that the construction would come together at an impossible seeming speed due to the use of prefabricated construction techniques on 9 october 2021 tesla held the official gigafactory berlin brandenburg county fair where they invited 9000 local guests to tour the factory but as of today there is still no precise information as to when the official opening of the factory will finally take place as apparently there are still some issues regarding the authorization permits finally the third most important issue again in my humble opinion to tackle in 2022 should be the tesla semi it is an all electric battery powered class 8 semi truck in development by tesla to which we referred in many articles before two concept vehicles were unveiled in november 2017 and production is planned in 2023 even though we insist it should be a priority for the year 2022 the company initially announced that the truck would have a 500 miles 805 km range on a full charge and with its new batteries it would be able to run for 400 miles 640 km after an 80 charge in 30 minutes using a solar powered tesla megacharger charging station musk said that the semi would come standard with tesla autopilot that will allow semi autonomous driving on highways among many other interesting features but apart from the widely known specs we just want to put emphasis on the fact that tesla should make all possible efforts to actually start the long awaited semi volume production in 2022 as it would really be a breakthrough in transportation that would disrupt and positively affect many other related industries not to mention the beneficial environmental impact itself what do you think what are the 3 things tesla should be focusing on in 2022 please let us know your opinion in the comment section below all images courtesy of tesla inc nico caballero is the vp of finance of cogency power specializing in

want a two bagger this year these three covid stocks just might do it the market s a forward looking mechanism and some people might feel that the covid 19 pandemic is over that s probably an

think covid stocks fulgent genetics flgt 1 38 nrx pharmaceuticals nrxp 6 91 and adaptive biotechnologies adpt 14 89 could double your money this year testing testing will this stock turn on patrick bafuma fulgent genetics entering the last wave of 2021 you may have heard that there was a run on covid tests in fact just this week the local cvs told me that there was not an over the counter test available within 20 miles yet many countries ports and employers want the results of a pcr test within three days prior to entry while this may put a strain on resources it s great news for rt pcr test maker fulgent genetics this medical diagnostics company has focused on contracting with school systems nursing homes athletic organizations health clinics and the government to commercialize highly specific pcr testing for the sars cov 2 virus having booked 95 5 million in revenue in the third quarter it is likely safe to assume this will continue with the omicron variant well into the new year adjusted gross margin was a juicy 81 3 in q3 2021 too over the last year margin has floated between 77 1 and 82 6 so aside from inflationary issues i have little reason to think the margin will not remain enviable and while it s clear that currently the company s future remains tethered to covid 19 it has also been clear that the virus refuses to go away as such i m not convinced that covid diagnostic numbers will melt away for the company and with short interest now at just under 13 positive results for the company could take shareholders on an enjoyable trip up and to the right with a price to earnings p e ratio of just over 5 this stock looks insanely cheap when compared to classic lab vendors like laboratory corporation of america holdings and quest diagnostics with p e ratios of 10 9 and 10 2 respectively or abbott laboratories and its binax test at a p e of about 35 fulgent looks significantly undervalued with a p e in the mid single digits and what seems like a never ending need for its product fulgent genetics could be an easy double in 2022 a healthy rebound could be taking shape george budwell nrx pharmaceuticals nrx pharmaceuticals stock shed an eye popping 80 4 of its value over 2021 although the drugmaker s shares initially popped during the first few months of 2021 wall street s enthusiasm for this speculative coronavirus stock steadily waned as the year progressed thanks to the u s food and drug administration fda declining to grant emergency use authorization eua for the company s severe covid 19 treatment zyesami aviptadil the long and short of it is that zyesami probably would have racked up several hundred million dollars in sales with an eua for severe covid 19 cases that s a tremendous commercial opportunity for a company with market cap under 300 million at the time of this writing the good news is that nrx pharmaceuticals recently filed a new breakthrough therapy designation btd request for zyesami with the fda this revised btd request centers around covid 19 respiratory failure in patients who progress despite treatment with remdesivir and other approved therapies if granted this regulatory designation might open the door for an eua in this patient population while this revised target market is certainly smaller in scope it would still amount to a healthy commercial opportunity for a company of nrx pharmaceuticals current size in fact nrx pharmaceuticals ought to be able to bank at least 100 million in sales this year if the fda gives the green light this time around the big picture is that this beaten down coronavirus stock might be gearing up for a monstrous run higher in 2022 adaptive biotechnologies will bounce back taylor carmichael adaptive biotechnologies adaptive biotechnologies is focused on the immune system the company is mapping 30 billion immune receptors in the human body and is using supercomputers from microsoft to run the data as it maps our adaptive immune system later this decade adaptive says it could have a universal blood test on the market a doctor will take a blood sample and be able to hack your immune system and see what diseases it is fighting this blood test could reveal if you have infectious diseases autoimmune disorders or cancer in the meantime adaptive already has several diagnostic tests on the market the fda has cleared three of the company s clonoseq tests for minimal residual disease in blood cancers multiple myeloma acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia and the company has an eua for its covid 19 test adaptive s covid test is the first on the market that uses t cells in the blood to check for the disease just recently the molecular diagnostic services program agreed to pay 770 per test for certain groups of individuals including immunocompromised patients adaptive s not profitable yet and its revenue is still meager 146 million over the trailing 12 months the stock is down 50 as impatient investors head for the exits but that s a mistake the company estimates there are 7 million immunocompromised patients just in the u s that s a 5 billion market opportunity in the near term with the government paying for the tests we should see a spike in adaptive s covid related revenue in 2022 and the stock should jump along with it
image elizabeth holmes center entering the courthouse in san jose calif on monday credit jim wilson the new york times san jose calif elizabeth holmes the founder of the failed blood testing start up theranos was found guilty of four of 11 charges of fraud on monday in a case that came to symbolize the pitfalls of silicon valley s culture of hustle hype and greed ms holmes who had once promised to revolutionize health care was the most prominent executive to field fraud accusations in a generation of high flying money losing start ups a jury of eight men and four women took 50 hours over seven days of deliberations to reach a verdict convicting her of three counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud by lying to investors to raise money for her company ms holmes was found not guilty on four other counts related to defrauding patients who had used theranos s blood tests the jury was unable to reach a verdict on three counts of deceiving investors for which judge edward j davila of california s northern district said he planned to declare a mistrial each count carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison terms that are likely to be served concurrently ms holmes 37 is expected to appeal a sentencing date is expected to be set at a hearing on the three hung charges next week while the verdict was read ms holmes who had falsely claimed that theranos s blood tests could detect a variety of ailments with just a few drops of blood sat motionless then she gathered her belongings and whispered to her lawyer she went down the row of family and friends in the court gallery behind her hugging each one before leaving through a side door it s been a long case judge davila told the jury we collectively have been through many things stephanie hinds a u s attorney said in a statement that the guilty verdicts reflected ms holmes s culpability in this large scale investor fraud the verdict stands out for its rarity few technology executives are charged with fraud and even fewer are convicted if sentenced to prison ms holmes would be the most notable female executive to serve time since martha stewart did in 2004 after lying to investigators about a stock sale and theranos which dissolved in 2018 is likely to stand as a warning to other silicon valley start ups that stretch the truth to score funding and business deals the mixed verdict suggested that jurors believed the evidence presented by prosecutors that showed ms holmes lied to investors about theranos s technology in the pursuit of money and fame they were not swayed by her defense of blaming others for theranos s problems and accusing her co conspirator ramesh balwani the company s chief operating officer and her former boyfriend of abusing her they were also not swayed by the prosecutor s case that she had defrauded patients on monday jurors told the court that they were deadlocked on three of the charges of defrauding investors judge davila pushed them to continue deliberating but they were unable to agree the verdict arrived in a frenzied period for the tech industry with investors fighting to get into hot deals and often ignoring potential red flags about the companies they were putting money into some have warned that more theranos like disasters loom in recent years tales of start up chicanery from the bungled initial public offering of wework to the aggressive boundary pushing tactics of uber have not slowed the flow of money toward charismatic founders spinning tales of business success those downfalls captured the public s attention but did not result in criminal charges yet the justice department under president biden has renewed its focus on white collar crimes we will urge prosecutors to be bold lisa o monaco the deputy attorney general recently said in a speech the fear of losing should not deter them ms holmes s conviction sends a message to other founders and executives to be careful about their statements to investors and the public said jessica roth a law professor at cardozo school of law and former federal prosecutor in the southern district of new york it shines a light on the importance of drawing a distinction between truth and optimistic projections and keeping that clear in one s mind she said ms holmes rose to prominence by mimicking the disruptive change the world chutzpah of silicon valley heroes like steve jobs a playbook that has turned companies like apple tesla google and facebook into some of the most valuable in the world in the process she captured the attention of heads of state top business leaders and wealthy families with idealistic plans to revolutionize the health care industry she traveled the world on private jets was feted with awards and glowing magazine cover stories and lauded as the world s youngest self made female billionaire but she crossed into fraud when she lied about the accuracy types and number of tests theranos s machines could do to raise funding and secure business deals that s a crime on main street and it s a crime in silicon valley robert leach an assistant u s attorney said in opening statements at the trial s start the verdict concludes nearly four months of proceedings that alternated between exhilarating and plodding there were delays because of a coronavirus scare a burst water pipeline technology problems in the courtroom and juror travel one juror was dismissed for playing sudoku and another for her buddhist faith crowds of spectators many of whom followed the theranos saga via podcasts documentaries books and news articles waited for hours for a spot in the courtroom s limited seats inside jurors heard from dozens of witnesses and viewed hundreds of pieces of evidence used in support of prosecutors argument that ms holmes knowingly misled investors and patients on her rise to fame and fortune witnesses included james mattis the former defense secretary who sat on theranos s board as well as lisa peterson who managed money for the wealthy family of a former education secretary betsy devos and invested 100 million in theranos prominent investors including rupert murdoch and larry ellison as well as two former secretaries of state george shultz and henry kissinger who sat on its board were discussed but never called to the stand the case s evidence outlined ms holmes s role in faked demonstrations falsified validation reports misleading claims about contracts and overstated financials at theranos jurors heard recordings and watched videos of ms holmes making inflated or misleading claims about theranos before it shut down in 2018 theranos voided two years worth of its blood tests it paid to settle several investor lawsuits as well as fraud charges by the securities and exchange commission but prosecutors argued that ms holmes s actions went beyond those punishments they were criminal she led investors to lose hundreds of millions of dollars and patients to get unreliable test results they said at so many of the forks in the road she chose the dishonest path john bostic an assistant u s attorney said in closing arguments in her defense ms holmes s lawyers tried to discredit testimony from whistle blowers attacked investors for not doing more research into theranos and said ms holmes s failures were not a crime ms holmes capped the proceedings by taking the stand over seven days of testimony she alternated between accepting responsibility for certain missteps and deflecting blame for other problems to colleagues she said she believed that theranos s tests worked and had relied on the expertise of more qualified people running the company s lab and she used her charisma to sell jurors on the same vision of the future that years earlier had helped her win over investors world leaders and the press i wanted to talk about what this company could do a year from now five years from now 10 years from now ms holmes said i wanted to talk about what was possible ms holmes s argument that her optimistic projections were no different than that of other silicon valley companies contradicted the government s evidence which was consistent with traditional fraud cases ms roth said if other founders and executives are engaged in the kinds of deceit that was alleged and proven by considerable evidence in this case then they should be concerned she said most strikingly ms holmes accused mr balwani of emotional and sexual abuse the pair dated in secret for more than a decade even owning an estate in atherton calif together ms holmes said mr balwani who is around 20 years older controlled every aspect of her life including her schedule self presentation and time spent with her family she also accused him of forcing her to have sex with him mr balwani has denied the allegations that testimony delivered through tears threatened to turn the tide against the prosecutor s case by appealing to the jury s emotions and painting ms holmes as a victim but it was a risky strategy experts have said particularly since ms holmes did not provide an expert witness to put her accusations in context of the wire fraud charges mr balwani known as sunny will stand trial this year he has also pleaded not guilty ms holmes left the courthouse after dark on monday holding hands with her mother and partner cameras surrounded them lighting up the dark sidewalk as reporters shouted questions ms holmes avoided eye contact and stared straight ahead

sign up for daily news updates from cleantechnica on email or follow us on google news deep waters in temperate climate lakes have already lost almost 20 percent of their oxygen supply originally published on nexus media by kaitlin sullivan on a sweltering morning last july thousands of dead fish washed onto the northeastern shores of pokegama lake 60 miles north of minneapolis deb vermeersch an official with the minnesota department of natural resources was called in to investigate when she arrived she saw a quarter mile stretch of sand covered with the rotting carcass of walleye and northern pike which thrive in deep cool waters as well as crappies sunfish and suckers all warm water dwellers they were already pretty decomposed because of the warm water vermeersch recalled because so many different types of fish had died vermeersch and her colleagues knew it wasn t a species specific parasite a common cause of fish kills they zeroed in on the culprit dangerously low oxygen levels oxygen is disappearing in freshwater lakes at a rate nine times that of oceans due to a combination of pollution and warming waters according to a study published in nature earlier this year lakes like pokegama are warming earlier in the spring and staying warm into autumn fueling algae blooms which thrive in warm waters and threaten native fish minnesota with its 14 380 lakes and temperatures that have risen faster than the national average is a unique laboratory for studying how climate change is affecting temperate zone lakes around the world the state sits at the intersection of four biomes two distinct prairie ecosystems and two ecologically different forest systems this means scientists here are able to study how lakes in different ecosystems fare on a warming planet and look for ways to stave off the worst effects of climate change if you start losing oxygen you start losing species what s going on at the surface is that warmer water holds less oxygen than cool water said lesley knoll a university of minnesota limnologist and one of the authors of the nature report she said that longer hotter summers are interfering with two key processes that have historically kept lakes oxygen levels in check mixing and stratification in temperate climates water at the surface of lakes mixes with deep waters in the spring and the fall when both layers are similar in temperature as the surface water warms during the summer the water forms distinct layers based on temperature cool water at the bottom warm at the top this is known as stratification in the fall when the surface waters cool again the water mixes for a second time replenishing oxygen in deeper waters but as climate change makes surface water warmer and keeps it warmer for longer that mixing doesn t happen when it should as you have that stronger stratification the water in the deep part of the lake is cut off from the oxygen at the top part of the lake if you start losing oxygen you start losing species says kevin rose a biologist at rensselaer polytechnic institute in new york and a coauthor of the nature study knoll rose and a team of 43 other researchers studied 400 temperate lakes from around the world they found that on average surface waters warmed by 7 degrees fahrenheit and have lost roughly 5 percent of oxygen since 1980 deep waters which haven t warmed much have still lost an average of almost 20 percent of their oxygen thanks to the state s long held lake monitoring programs almost a quarter the lakes in the study were in minnesota warming lakes emit methane fish kills aren t the only reason scientists are concerned about lakes losing oxygen in extreme cases when deep waters go completely void of oxygen something else happens methane emitting bacteria begin to thrive as lakes warm they will produce more methane and most of that has to do with stratification said james cotner a limnologist at the university of minnesota lakes normally emit carbon dioxide as a natural part of breaking down the trees plants and animals that decay in them but plants in and around fresh water also absorb it making healthy lakes carbon sinks lakes have historically emitted methane too about 10 to 20 percent of the world s emissions but the prospect of them releasing more of the greenhouse gas has cotner and his colleagues alarmed methane is about 25 times more potent than co2 when it comes to trapping heat in earth s atmosphere cotner is leading a team of researchers who are studying what conditions allow methane emitting bacteria to prosper in lakes and how conservationists can respond the key questions are understanding how much and when carbon dioxide and methane are emitted from lakes and what are the key variables that can tell how much will be emitted certainly oxygen is a big part of that but stratification and warming also plays a role says cotner pollution plays a big role it s not just longer hotter summers that are causing lakes to lose their oxygen polluted agricultural runoff pesticides and fertilizers and logging have long plagued minnesota s lakes it s a problem that s getting worse worldwide as climate change pushes agriculture further away from the equator and into new territory said heather baird an official with minnesota s department of natural resources in northern minnesota potatoes now grow where pine forests have thrived for years phosphorus a common fertilizer now runs off from the soil into the region s lakes baird said though small amounts of phosphorus occur naturally in lake ecosystems too much of it feeds harmful algae blooms those blooms which thrive in warm nutrient rich water set off a chain of events that remove oxygen from deep lake waters when phosphorus builds in lakes and creates algae blooms those blooms eventually die as they do they sink deeper down bacteria break down the algae using up the remaining oxygen at those lower depths said baird a quarter of minnesota lakes now have phosphorus levels that are so high that the state advises against swimming fishing or boating in them fueled by these nutrients algae blooms take over covering the lake in sometimes toxic residue that thrives in warm nutrient rich water as was the case in pokegama lake earlier this year the protists choke out aquatic life especially fish that thrive in cold deep waters this is all exacerbated by warming air temperatures the 75 percent rule researchers and conservationists in minnesota are now studying the best ways to protect temperate climate lakes from the worst effects of climate change they have found that preserving 75 percent of deep water lakes watersheds appear to keep fish stocks healthy having a forested watershed helps keep better water quality by filtering out nutrients which in turn can buffer against the impacts of climate change to a point knoll said however she added as temperatures continue to rise that 75 percent may not be high enough anymore knoll and state conservationists are focusing their research and efforts on deep cool lakes that have a better chance of staying oxygenated than warmer shallower lakes like pokegama july 2021 when the pokegama lake fish kill occured was the hottest month ever recorded on earth parts of minnesota were also experiencing the worst drought in 40 years a trend some climatologists expect to persist in future summers vermeersch the minnesota fisheries supervisor said it s unclear what this will mean for the future of lakes like pokegama hopefully it s not going to be a linear thing she said adding that fish kills are probably going to happen more often depending on a combination of factors when you get lakes like pokegama that are shallow and already impaired i

private equity firm chatham asset management was ultimately successful in its efforts to outbid fellow investment firm atlas holdings to acquire rr donnelley sons rrd north america s largest commercial printing conglomerate that reported 4 8 billion in sales for its most recent fiscal year after multiple back and forth bids chatham rrd s largest bond holder and a 14 99 common stock shareholder thought it had finally won the battle when atlas indicated it would not top chatham s latest 10 85 per share cash counter offer which comprised an enterprise value of approximately 2 3 billion but not so fast another bidder has re entered the fray on dec 29 2021 rrd announced the receipt of an unsolicited non binding alternative proposal from a yet undisclosed strategic party to acquire all of the outstanding shares of rrd s common stock for 11 per share in cash subject to certain terms and conditions as part of its proposal the strategic buyer also indicated it would pay the 12 million expense reimbursement fee rrd would owe chatham for terminating their pending acquisition agreement as well as reimburse chatham the 20 million termination fee it paid atlas holdings on rrd s behalf to terminate their original agreement it s not the first time the unnamed entity had approached rrd with an offer on nov 27 2021 it submitted a non binding proposal to buy rrd s common stock for 10 share in cash subject to other terms and conditions but that was the last time the strategic buyer was mentioned publicly until now rrd board deems new offer superior proposal with this newer offer in hand rrd s board of directors determined after consultation with its outside financial advisor and legal counsel that the strategic party proposal would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal with that said the board did affirm there can be no assurances that a transaction will result from the strategic party proposal or that any alternative transaction will be entered into or eventually consummated either way chatham asset management is not standing still in announcing the new bidder rrd also confirmed the receipt of a letter from chatham regarding the strategic party proposal in the letter chatham stated its belief to the rrd board this latest offer does not constitute and would not reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal and that a conclusion otherwise by the board would be a breach of the company s obligations under its acquisition agreement with chatham chatham further stated its belief that rrd s board is not permitted to engage in negotiations or discussions with or to furnish nonpublic information or data to the strategic party this latest development will likely rekindle the pending lawsuit or lead to a new one chatham had filed earlier in the delaware court of chancery against the rrd board of directors to uphold its fiduciary responsibility to broker the best deal for shareholders at that time chatham requested that the court declare the atlas termination fee and certain other provisions of the atlas merger agreement unenforceable cause rrd to redeem its poison pill and waive certain provisions of delaware law that could prevent chatham from taking its offer directly to stockholders through a third party tender offer what happens next a shareholder proxy vote will be forthcoming should the existing 10 85 per share in cash m a deal with chatham ultimately proceed as agreed this special virtual shareholder meeting would be put on hold however if rrd severs that agreement and reaches an acquisition deal with the mystery strategic buyer which it refers to simply as party c this in turn could also lead chatham to raise its acquisition bid yet again to surpass party c s proposed 11 per share cash offer as of now the victor is still yet to be determined

image elizabeth holmes center entering the courthouse in san jose calif on monday credit jim wilson the new york times san jose calif elizabeth holmes the founder of the failed blood testing start up theranos was found guilty of four of 11 charges of fraud on monday in a case that came to symbolize the pitfalls of silicon valley s culture of hustle hype and greed ms holmes who had once promised to revolutionize health care was the most prominent executive to field fraud accusations in a generation of high flying money losing start ups a jury of eight men and four women took 50 hours over seven days of deliberations to reach a verdict convicting her of three counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud by lying to investors to raise money for her company ms holmes was found not guilty on four other counts related to defrauding patients who had used theranos s blood tests the jury was unable to reach a verdict on three counts of deceiving investors for which judge edward j davila of california s northern district said he planned to declare a mistrial each count carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison terms that are likely to be served concurrently ms holmes 37 is expected to appeal a sentencing date is expected to be set at a hearing on the three hung charges next week while the verdict was read ms holmes who had falsely claimed that theranos s blood tests could detect a variety of ailments with just a few drops of blood sat motionless then she gathered her belongings and whispered to her lawyer she went down the row of family and friends in the court gallery behind her hugging each one before leaving through a side door it s been a long case judge davila told the jury we collectively have been through many things stephanie hinds a u s attorney said in a statement that the guilty verdicts reflected ms holmes s culpability in this large scale investor fraud the verdict stands out for its rarity few technology executives are charged with fraud and even fewer are convicted if sentenced to prison ms holmes would be the most notable female executive to serve time since martha stewart did in 2004 after lying to investigators about a stock sale and theranos which dissolved in 2018 is likely to stand as a warning to other silicon valley start ups that stretch the truth to score funding and business deals the mixed verdict suggested that jurors believed the evidence presented by prosecutors that showed ms holmes lied to investors about theranos s technology in the pursuit of money and fame they were not swayed by her defense of blaming others for theranos s problems and accusing her co conspirator ramesh balwani the company s chief operating officer and her former boyfriend of abusing her they were also not swayed by the prosecutor s case that she had defrauded patients on monday jurors told the court that they were deadlocked on three of the charges of defrauding investors judge davila pushed them to continue deliberating but they were unable to agree the verdict arrived in a frenzied period for the tech industry with investors fighting to get into hot deals and often ignoring potential red flags about the companies they were putting money into some have warned that more theranos like disasters loom in recent years tales of start up chicanery from the bungled initial public offering of wework to the aggressive boundary pushing tactics of uber have not slowed the flow of money toward charismatic founders spinning tales of business success those downfalls captured the public s attention but did not result in criminal charges yet the justice department under president biden has renewed its focus on white collar crimes we will urge prosecutors to be bold lisa o monaco the deputy attorney general recently said in a speech the fear of losing should not deter them ms holmes s conviction sends a message to other founders and executives to be careful about their statements to investors and the public said jessica roth a law professor at cardozo school of law and former federal prosecutor in the southern district of new york it shines a light on the importance of drawing a distinction between truth and optimistic projections and keeping that clear in one s mind she said ms holmes rose to prominence by mimicking the disruptive change the world chutzpah of silicon valley heroes like steve jobs a playbook that has turned companies like apple tesla google and facebook into some of the most valuable in the world in the process she captured the attention of heads of state top business leaders and wealthy families with idealistic plans to revolutionize the health care industry she traveled the world on private jets was feted with awards and glowing magazine cover stories and lauded as the world s youngest self made female billionaire but she crossed into fraud when she lied about the accuracy types and number of tests theranos s machines could do to raise funding and secure business deals that s a crime on main street and it s a crime in silicon valley robert leach an assistant u s attorney said in opening statements at the trial s start the verdict concludes nearly four months of proceedings that alternated between exhilarating and plodding there were delays because of a coronavirus scare a burst water pipeline technology problems in the courtroom and juror travel one juror was dismissed for playing sudoku and another for her buddhist faith crowds of spectators many of whom followed the theranos saga via podcasts documentaries books and news articles waited for hours for a spot in the courtroom s limited seats inside jurors heard from dozens of witnesses and viewed hundreds of pieces of evidence used in support of prosecutors argument that ms holmes knowingly misled investors and patients on her rise to fame and fortune witnesses included james mattis the former defense secretary who sat on theranos s board as well as lisa peterson who managed money for the wealthy family of a former education secretary betsy devos and invested 100 million in theranos prominent investors including rupert murdoch and larry ellison as well as two former secretaries of state george shultz and henry kissinger who sat on its board were discussed but never called to the stand the case s evidence outlined ms holmes s role in faked demonstrations falsified validation reports misleading claims about contracts and overstated financials at theranos jurors heard recordings and watched videos of ms holmes making inflated or misleading claims about theranos before it shut down in 2018 theranos voided two years worth of its blood tests it paid to settle several investor lawsuits as well as fraud charges by the securities and exchange commission but prosecutors argued that ms holmes s actions went beyond those punishments they were criminal she led investors to lose hundreds of millions of dollars and patients to get unreliable test results they said at so many of the forks in the road she chose the dishonest path john bostic an assistant u s attorney said in closing arguments in her defense ms holmes s lawyers tried to discredit testimony from whistle blowers attacked investors for not doing more research into theranos and said ms holmes s failures were not a crime ms holmes capped the proceedings by taking the stand over seven days of testimony she alternated between accepting responsibility for certain missteps and deflecting blame for other problems to colleagues she said she believed that theranos s tests worked and had relied on the expertise of more qualified people running the company s lab and she used her charisma to sell jurors on the same vision of the future that years earlier had helped her win over investors world leaders and the press i wanted to talk about what this company could do a year from now five years from now 10 years from now ms holmes said i wanted to talk about what was possible ms holmes s argument that her optimistic projections were no different than that of other silicon valley companies contradicted the government s evidence which was consistent with traditional fraud cases ms roth said if other founders and executives are engaged in the kinds of deceit that was alleged and proven by considerable evidence in this case then they should be concerned she said most strikingly ms holmes accused mr balwani of emotional and sexual abuse the pair dated in secret for more than a decade even owning an estate in atherton calif together ms holmes said mr balwani who is around 20 years older controlled every aspect of her life including her schedule self presentation and time spent with her family she also accused him of forcing her to have sex with him mr balwani has denied the allegations that testimony delivered through tears threatened to turn the tide against the prosecutor s case by appealing to the jury s emotions and painting ms holmes as a victim but it was a risky strategy experts have said particularly since ms holmes did not provide an expert witness to put her accusations in context of the wire fraud charges mr balwani known as sunny will stand trial this year he has also pleaded not guilty ms holmes left the courthouse after dark on monday holding hands with her mother and partner cameras surrounded them lighting up the dark sidewalk as reporters shouted questions ms holmes avoided eye contact and stared straight ahead

senior loans risk the london interbank offered rate libor is the average offered rate for various maturities of short term loans between major international banks who are members of the british bankers association libor is the most common benchmark interest rate index used to make adjustments to variable rate loans it is used throughout global banking and financial industries to determine interest rates for a variety of financial instruments such as debt instruments and derivatives and borrowing arrangements due to manipulation allegations in 2012 and reduced activity in the financial markets that it measures in july 2017 the financial conduct authority the fca the united kingdom financial regulatory body announced a desire to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021 although the period from the fca announcement until the end of 2021 is generally expected to be enough time for market participants to transition to the use of a different benchmark for new securities and transactions there remains uncertainty regarding the future utilization of libor and the specific replacement rate or rates as such the potential effect of a transition away from libor on the trust or

currently rely on libor the transition may also result in a change in i the value of certain instruments held by the trust ii the cost of temporary borrowing for the trust or iii the effectiveness of related trust transactions such as hedges as applicable when libor is discontinued the libor replacement rate may be lower than market expectations which could have an adverse impact on the value of preferred and debt securities with floating or fixed to floating rate coupons any such effects of the transition away from libor as well as other unforeseen effects could result in losses to the trust
