this gorgeous 1970 chevrolet chevelle ss 454 ls6 convertible only has 27 865 miles 44 844 km on the odometer the sympathetic restoration was done by roger gibson and is accompanied by an appropriate letter but it also comes with the original owner s testimonial about the authenticity of the car without any further nonsense this beauty comes equipped with a 454 cubic inch 7 4 liter engine that can output up to 450 ponies 456 ps it also has the original m22 rock crusher four speed transmission frame a arms ball joints spindles steering box and linkage tie rod tubes and ends springs shocks backing plates and rear cover sway bars driveshaft and fuel tank it was produced on may 4 1970 at the baltimore maryland plant and sold brand new to charles chuck cordell that safeguarded it until september 2016 when he sold it to a car collector from tennessee at the time the chevelle had 27 000 miles 43 452 km on it which means that since 2016 it only ran for another 865 miles 1 392 km when he first laid his eyes on it mr cordell didn t like the white stripes it rolled out from the factory and asked the dealership he bought it from to remove them furthermore he had the people there install aluminum heads and remove the smog equipment the list of modifications demanded by him didn t end there in addition the entire thing is documented and was only performed by professional engine builders according to the auction website photo mecum auctions other than that the car hasn t been through any more suffering the upholstery glass trim and white convertible top are completely original with the latter only being operated six or seven times in the car s life and hasn t been down since the mid 1970s cordell said however it is important to note that in the late 90s the car has been repainted due to an unfortunate incident at a speed shop where the fender got scratched when the current owner took it in 2016 to roger gibson auto restoration in scott city missouri upon examining it gibson said that it was a truly exceptional example absolutely rust free and that it had no wreck damage he then took off the outside panels and repainted the car in the original tuxedo black while also adding the factory style white stripes many parts are still original like the t 3 headlamps stainless and chrome trim grille bumpers and brackets trunk mat jack and spare tire the latter never saw daylight outside of the trunk being opened on ocasions because it was never used gibson saw to it that the ls6 engine was returned to its former glory with correctly date coded and numbered parts among which we count the distributor carburetor and intake cylinder heads and smog equipment photo mecum auctions the original owner had feared the car might be stolen one day so he had every bolt head and suspension piece painted brick red to be easily identifiable when roger gibson took a look underneath the car he said that it was the cleanest i have ever seen in my shop however for him to correctly complete the restoration he had to deal with cordell s overbearing love for the car this being said the paint kept the exposed parts better preserved through time the end result was nothing short of a fortunate one because the car kept most of its stock suspension and driveline components original pan paint bolts clips and brackets where replacements were inevitable the documented factory inspection markings were reproduced accordingly this sympathetic restoration will be on the auction block from january 4 15 2023 no price tag has been displayed yet but based on previous similar range vehicles it could easily go north of 120 000

bank of korea bok governor rhee chang yong departs for the united states to attend meetings among g 20 finance ministers and central banks in washington d c in this photo taken on oct 12 korea times file by yi whan woo the bank of korea bok is anticipated to go for a 25 basis point increase at this year s final rate setting meeting to strike a balance between inflation and the adverse effects of its accelerated credit tightening in 2022 according to analysts sunday scheduled on thursday the meeting will come as the currency and stock markets here took a beating in general throughout the year over the u s federal reserve s hawkish rate hike to tame inflation the fed s rate policy led to a widening interest gap between korea and the united states and subsequently raised concerns over capital flight in search of safe haven assets while the bok also carried out aggressive rate hikes to stabilize prices and the financial market such hikes have been followed by unwelcome liquidity shortages suffered by companies due to costly borrowing rates under the circumstances the bok was believed to be open to taking its third big step rate hike of 60 basis points following july and october until it was found that u s inflation cooled down to an eight month low of 7 7 percent last month the eased u s inflation number suggests the fed s hawkish credit tightening is paying off it then has fostered optimism here that the u s central bank may not go for a fourth 75 basis point rate hike as predicted in the final monetary policy meeting of 2022 that takes place on dec 12 and 13 the u s interest rate remains in a range of 3 75 percent to 4 percent as compared to korea s 3 percent many speculate u s inflation may have peaked after it cooled down to 7 7 percent in october raising hopes that the fed will ease credit tightening in response lg economic research institute economist cho young moo said the bok is expected to take the u s factors into account along with the refinancing burden of companies to balance out its monetary policy this week he also said the gloomy 2023 economic outlook for korea is a reason for the bok to adjust its monetary policy according to lg economic research institute korea s economy will further slow to the mid 1 percent level in 2023 down from the 2 percent range this year joo won deputy director of the hyundai research institute voiced a similar view noting the won dollar exchange rate fell below the psychological threshold of 1 400 won after the u s inflation numbers were announced and has hovered in the 1 300 won range since then the exchange rate is likely to gradually fall to as low as 1 250 won which is regarded as adequate for the korean economy joo said it gives the bok a breather after being under pressure to move faster on hiking rates
by adam hamilton of zeal llc the bleeding us stock markets are mired in a mounting bear fueled by extreme fed tightening already losing over a quarter of their value this year traders are wondering how long this rampaging bear will keep mauling stocks and how severe the damage will be this bear s ultimate trajectory is partially dependent on how the gigantic american companies dominating major stock indices are faring fundamentally they are just wrapping up their q3 22 earnings season covering a challenging quarter for stock markets the mighty s p 500 spx flagship benchmark us stock index fell a sizable 5 3 last quarter exiting at a fresh bear low this rather aggressive beast had clawed the spx down a serious 25 2 in just 8 9 months but bears can grow a heck of a lot bigger and prowl for way longer so this one still looks like a cub this is especially true of fundamentally driven bears that arise and exist to slash rampant overvaluations back down near historical norms from march 2000 to october 2002 the spx cratered 49 1 over 30 5 months later between october 2007 to march 2009 the spx again plummeted 56 8 in 17 0 months these dreadful ursa majors are nothing to be trifled with mercilessly shredding away long years of gains ominously today s underlying economic conditions impacting corporate profitability are much worse than during those last bears monthly headline us consumer price index inflation averaged 2 6 year over year increases during the early 2000s bear and 3 2 during that late 2000s one but today s young bear is seeing raging inflation with the cpi averaging huge 8 3 yoy jumps gutting corporate earnings power the fed was also far less hostile to stock markets during those prior great bears entering the earlier one the federal funds rate was running 6 0 before 50 basis points of hikes peaking at 6 5 after that the federal open market committee frantically slashed its ffr way down to 1 75 by the end of that bear top fed officials proved even way more dovish than that during that later bigger meaner bear market as it stealthily awakened from hibernation the ffr was running 4 75 but the fed panicked the deeper that bear mauled slamming the federal funds rate all the way down to 0 125 before that bear gave up its ghost that was a zero interest rate policy as the fomc targets a quarter point range for its interest rate those previous couple big bears suffered massive losses despite benign inflation and a dovish fed but today s is a radically different story since mid march 2022 alone the fomc has hiked the ffr an extreme 375bp from 0 125 to 3 875 and just last week the fed chair himself warned that rate hikes still have a ways to go to ultimate levels higher than previously expected on top of these blisteringly fast rate hikes the fomc is also actively destroying money through quantitative tightening bond selling neither previous bear had any qt a roaring liquidity headwind for stock markets qt2 is critical now because today s raging inflation was directly fueled by extreme fed money printing in just 25 5 months into mid april 2022 the fed ballooned its balance sheet an absurd 115 6 or 4 807b monetizing bonds more than doubling the us dollar monetary base in just a couple years is why inflation is out of control since june alone qt2 has been ramped up to nearly double the terminal size of qt1 in only a quarter the time at 95b per month of monetary destruction qt2 would have to run for another 48 months to unwind the fed s post pandemic lockdown stock panic money spewing today s stock bear growing during extreme fed rate hikes and extreme qt is utterly unprecedented making it far more dangerous so how big us companies are actually faring operationally is very important offering clues as to whether this young bear will likely deepen for 21 quarters in a row now i ve analyzed how the 25 largest us companies dominating the spx did in their latest earnings season as q3 ended these behemoths alone accounted for a heavily concentrated 42 4 of the entire s p 500 s weighting they are detailed in this table each big us company s stock symbol is preceded by its ranking change within the s p 500 over the past year since the end of q3 21 these symbols are followed by their stocks q3 22 quarter end weightings in the spx along with their enormous market capitalizations then market caps year over year changes are shown revealing how those stocks performed for investors independent of manipulative stock buybacks those have been off the charts in recent years fueled by the fed s late zero interest rate policy and trillions of dollars of bond monetizations stock buybacks are deceptive financial engineering undertaken to artificially boost stock prices and earnings per share which maximizes executives huge compensation looking at market cap changes rather than stock price ones neutralizes some of stock buybacks distorting effects next comes each of these big us stocks quarterly revenues hard earnings under generally accepted accounting principles stock buybacks trailing twelve month price to earnings ratios dividends paid and operating cash flows generated in q3 22 followed by their year over year changes fields are left blank if companies hadn t reported that particular data as of mid week or if it doesn t exist like negative p e ratios percentage changes are excluded if they aren t meaningful primarily when data shifted from positive to negative or vice versa these latest quarterly results are very important for american stock investors including anyone with retirement accounts to understand they illuminate whether the us stock markets are fundamentally sound enough to stave off this young bear before it grows into a ravenous monster bear markets don t discriminate eagerly mauling down even the best companies and there s no doubt these 25 largest american stocks dominating the us markets are all fantastic businesses they couldn t have grown so massive if they weren t offering outstanding goods and services their customers want to buy nevertheless these elite blue chip industry leaders haven t been spared this bear s bloody claws together their collective market capitalization dropped 16 7 yoy exiting q3 22 mirroring the overall spx s 16 8 decline in that span and surprisingly the market darling mega cap technology stocks led the way apple microsoft alphabet amazon and meta for long years they were the five biggest spx stocks although meta s stunning fall from grace has gutted its market cap it remains a mega cap tech over this past year ending q3 22 these five mega cap techs saw their total market caps collapse 23 0 meanwhile the next 20 largest us companies only suffered a collective 9 5 market cap decline the beloved market generals are increasingly being shot a dire omen for stock markets fortunes since bears exist to maul down overvaluations their predations are the worst in expensive stocks like mega cap techs amazingly given the fed s raging inflation these 25 biggest us companies still managed to grow their total revenues by a massive 20 2 yoy in q3 22 to 1 133b seeming to again show why they are the best that is distorted by spx top 25 composition changes over this past year those mega cap techs have long reported the strongest sales growth but their total revenues only climbed 9 2 yoy to 364b the next 20 largest american companies fared far better seeing their aggregate sales explode a colossal 26 2 yoy to 769b but that was heavily skewed by this past year s soaring crude oil prices catapulting exxon mobil s and chevron s quarterly results far higher between q3 21 to q3 22 quarterly average us oil and natural gas prices rocketed up 29 5 and 84 3 to 91 37 and 7 96 that was a great boon for producers xom and cvx q3 sales blasted 51 9 and 49 1 higher yoy dwarfing all these other elite companies growth with the exception of tesla its quarterly revenues soared 55 9 yoy on fast growing demand for electric cars as gasoline prices surged with crude oil and with huge quarterly sales of 112b and 67b xom and cvx have outsized impact on the spx top 25 total excluding them revenues look way different simply pulling these oil super majors out of both comparable quarters the rest of these giant american companies saw total revenues grow 9 8 yoy to 954b that s not much ahead of monthly headline cpi inflation which averaged 7 9 yoy gains in these past twelve months so real inflation adjusted sales for the biggest and best us companies ex oil are just barely positive now with the us economy still deteriorating interestingly strong top line growth has long been one of wall street s primary rationalizations for buying overvalued stocks if revenues are stalling before starting to roll over in real and eventually even nominal terms that would support considerably lower valuations weakening sales growth yields plenty of rich fodder for this voracious bear high inflation pinches customers budgets forcing them to buy less from companies insufficient revenues growth also restrains earnings growth even in the best of times and while serious inflation is raging rising input costs further erode corporate profitability companies simply can t pass along all their higher costs in price hikes as enough customers will be unwilling or unable to pay those higher prices that further impairs sales spawning a vicious circle increasingly pressuring corporate earnings this bearish dynamic is already taking root as the spx top 25 s total q3 22 earnings under generally accepted accounting principles only grew 6 9 yoy to 161b those market darling mega cap techs actually fared far worse seeing their aggregate profits plunge 17 8 yoy to 59b lower earnings raise their valuations giving this young bear more fuel to keep rampaging but overall profitability is even worse as the us president loves to rant about the oil super majors are earning massive windfall profits in q3 xom and cvx saw their earnings skyrocket 191 3 and 83 8 yoy to 19 7b and 11 2b just pulling these two companies out of the comparable quarters the rest of the spx top 25 actually saw total gaap earnings drop a sizable 9 6 yoy to 130b inflation and a slowing us economy are already hitting profits we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us bear markets exist to maul stock valuations from overvalued levels back down to normal ones they are defined as stock prices divided by underlying corporate earnings per share classic p e ratios thus shrinking profits leave stocks more expensive regardless of prevailing prices the longer earnings retreat during a bear from any cause the longer that bear is likely to prowl and the more damage it is likely to do weakening corporate earnings among the elite us companies along with soaring interest rates are also constraining their stock buybacks for most of the decade plus since october 2008 s stock panic late in that last serious bear corporate stock buybacks have been the biggest and dominant source of capital inflows into stock markets without them stock prices and the entire s p 500 would be way lower today big us companies financed their massive buybacks over the years through both ongoing earnings and borrowing which was cheap during the fed s zirp years but with earnings waning as inflation rages and debt servicing costs soaring in this extreme rate hike cycle corporate stock buybacks are plunging they collapsed 20 1 yoy to 81b across these spx top 25 companies a precipitous and ominous drop that was even worse without exxon mobil and chevron with the rest of the biggest us stocks seeing their total buybacks plunge 28 1 yoy to 73b that would ve looked much worse still without the mega cap techs that have always been aggressive in manipulating their own stock prices last quarter s buybacks from apple microsoft alphabet amazon and meta only retreated a mere 3 3 yoy to a still massive 52b but even these elite companies can t maintain that torrid buyback pace this research thread s table puts stock buybacks next to gaap earnings so we can easily compare the two shockingly in q3 22 apple earned 20 7b but spent 24 4b buying back its own stock alphabet plowed more into buybacks than its total profits too 15 4b on just 13 9b of net income flailing meta s 4 4b of earnings supported 6 4b of buybacks over the long term stock buybacks can t exceed some reasonable fraction of corporate profits while the mega cap techs do have vast cash hoards they shrunk dramatically in this past year their total cash on hand plunged 21 2 yoy to 372b they can t keep burning cash fast to repurchase stocks forever and with interest rates far higher thanks to this uber hawkish fed borrowing for stock buybacks is too expensive declining stock buybacks going forward will further weaken the us stock markets aiding this young bear and the mega cap tech stocks disproportionally dominate stock buybacks accounting for nearly 2 3rds of the spx top 25 s total last quarter so as they are forced to slow those elite five stocks responsible for a staggering 21 1 of the entire spx s market cap are facing much lower prices dragging down everything the big us companies mostly flat real revenues and deteriorating earnings are very concerning alone with inflation raging and the fed aggressively tightening but the most bearish fundamental portent for the spx top 25 stocks is their continuing severe overvaluations even after the s p 500 plunged 25 2 essentially year to date into the end of q3 22 the elite us stocks still remained very expensive relative to earnings their average trailing twelve month price to earnings ratio did collapse 54 2 yoy which is good news but that was largely because tesla s p e plummeted from 414x to a still ridiculous 103x exiting q3 22 these biggest and best us companies still averaged a lofty 29 2x p e that is technically still in bubble territory which starts at 28x that is double the century and a half fair value average of 14x for the spx it s shocking to realize that even after losing a quarter of their value this year the elite us stocks are still sporting dangerous bubble valuations on average that almost guarantees this young bear has a long ways to run yet ursa majors don t give up their ghosts until they have mauled stock prices long enough and deep enough to force valuations back under 14x violent mean reversion overshoots to 7x are even seen the last serious stock bear was that late 2000s one slamming the spx that brutal 56 8 lower into march 2009 the spx s 25 largest component stocks then led by exxon mobil and microsoft had average ttm p es of 13 7x exiting that bear slaying month the more extreme valuations are within an ongoing bear the longer it will last and the more it will hurt today s bubble valuations after a 25 spx decline are scary big us companies don t only use their quarterly earnings to buy back stocks but to pay dividends since receiving those quarterly cash payments has been a high priority for investors companies are loath to cut dividends last quarter the spx top 25 companies actually grew their total dividends a huge 37 9 yoy to 41b xom and cvx did skew that a bit but without them the total dividend growth was still 32 9 to 35b but with this first inflation super spike since the 1970s eroding profits sooner or later companies will have to cut dividends to reflect lower earnings maybe investors won t care as much with bond yields getting competitive thanks to the fed but maybe lower dividends will spawn more stock selling mighty apple s huge 24 4b of stock buybacks in q3 were accompanied by 3 7b in dividends totaling 1 36x quarterly profits the spx top 25 companies operating cash flows also proved strong last quarter soaring 27 0 yoy to 228b that was the highest by far in the 21 quarters i ve been advancing this research thread but big oil again really distorted that removing xom and cvx that comparison moderated to 12 5 yoy gains to 188b interestingly the mega cap techs only saw 0 1 yoy ocf growth showing stalling businesses just like consumers when companies start seeing financial pressure they draw down their cash balances to make up the shortfalls that is happening with these elite us companies as their total cash treasuries dropped 16 3 yoy to 783b excluding those oil super majors their cash hoards plunged 20 8 yoy to 737b mega cap techs again were slightly worse seeing their cash fall 21 2 yoy at the end of q3 to 372b while 20 ish cash burn rates could be sustained for a few years odds are these companies will slow their spending much sooner that will include laying off employees of course but the low hanging fruit for belt tightening is those corporate stock buybacks those waning significantly will add much momentum to this young bear the former facebook now known as meta is a good example of what s coming for more stocks over this past year ending q3 22 meta s market cap plummeted 61 7 its revenues contracted 4 5 yoy leading earnings to collapse a brutal 52 2 meta tried to paper over that shortfall by drawing down its cash 28 1 but it also drastically slashed its stock buybacks by 52 8 yoy that contributed to its terrible stock performance this week meta just announced it is firing 13 of its workforce or 11k employees as raging inflation and a slowing economy take bigger bites out of other major us companies they will be forced to follow meta s cost cutting path not only do lower buybacks further weaken stock prices but layoffs hurt the entire economy exacerbating the recession this is really ominous with valuations still up near dangerous bubble levels with a young bear market underway there s a lot of valuation mauling left to do that argues this young bear has a long ways to run yet before giving up its ghost investors should pare their stock heavy portfolios before it deepens upping cash allocations is one option but the us dollar s purchasing power is being rapidly eroded by this raging inflation gold silver and their miners stocks are the classic alternative investments that thrive in general stock bears and are poised to mean revert far higher this gold complex does even better during inflationary times as raging inflation erodes corporate profits weakening stock prices gold investment demand for prudent portfolio diversification soars during the last similar inflation super spikes in the 1970s gold prices nearly tripled during the first and more than quadrupled in the second gold also thrived during past fed rate hike cycles which are bearish for stock markets if you regularly enjoy my essays please support our hard

latest quarterly results exacerbated the risks this young bear market is far from hibernating these elite american companies revenues largely stalled when adjusted for this raging inflation and their nominal earnings actually fell as struggling consumers pull back discretionary spending that left average valuations way up in dangerous bubble territory despite falling stock prices excessive valuations are the fodder that ravenous bears devour lingering until they are mauled back down to undervalued levels a normal bear mean reversion and overshoot would warn the majority of this young bear is still yet to come and corporate stock buybacks ability to stave it off is waning as they retreat so it is prudent for investors to pare their heavy stock holdings and redeploy some of that

by kim yoo chul during the peak of the covid 19 pandemic leading korean technology companies largely benefited from consumers staying at home and purchasing products to make their lives more comfortable now as developed and emerging economies continue to emerge from the pandemic such consumption patterns have changed consumers in the united states one of the top markets for korean manufacturers of high tech products are changing their buying habits to cope with the highest inflation levels seen in about four decades as consumers in key markets cut back on purchases of durable goods such as clothing tech gadgets and home appliances leading korean tech exporters have been struggling after inaccurately assessing supply and demand samsung lg and sk s technology affiliates have accumulated substantial amounts of inventory causing the prices of their flagship products to drop company officials contacted by the korea times said this photo taken on nov 6 2022 shows the booth of samsung at the fifth china international import expo ciie in east china s shanghai xinhua yonhap crucial to factory utilization rates inventory refers to the amount of products a company stores on its premises or consigned to third parties such as retailers in the world of business inventory usually acts as a buffer between factory output and the completion of customers orders inventory also represents current assets as a company normally intends to sell its finished goods within a limited amount of time typically a year samsung electronics the world s top manufacturer of tvs smartphones memory chips and displays for example supplies its flagship products to large retailers in north america such as target and changes in the shopping patterns of u s consumers caused major retailers there to revise down their profit outlooks this also caused other big u s retailers including bestbuy and walmart to manage their high inventory levels by cancelling inbound shipments samsung electronics has no option but to temporarily scale back production at its tv mobile phone and home appliance plants to respond to demand side erosion an official said mounting concerns over inflation are thought to be the main culprit of eroding end demand but the point is that the company can t raise the prices of key products and this is why samsung is becoming more aggressive in getting rid of its high level of inventory the official added a resident passes items over a temporary barrier sealing off a residential block regarded as a high covid 19 infection risk in guangzhou guangdong province nov 9 2022 a surge in covid 19 cases has spurred lockdowns in the southern chinese manufacturing hub of guangzhou adding to financial pressure that has disrupted global supply chains and sharply slowed growth in the world s second largest economy ap yonhap as of the third quarter of this year samsung electronics possessed 57 31 trillion won worth of inventory assets up 10 percent from the previous quarter according to samsung s quarterly report to the financial supervisory service fss by the third quarter of this year lg electronics had 11 20 trillion won worth of inventory assets up 15 7 percent from the previous quarter lg electronics also supplies tvs and home appliances to major retailers in the u s europe asia and south america despite consumers abandoning upscale retailers because of growing concerns over inflation we can t supply our key products to retailers at huge discounts because keeping higher product prices can partially offset profit declines it s a smart move to monitor closely any signs of changing consumer behavior but it s too early to say that the global consumer market is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel because i would say a lot of conditions and circumstances still remain unfavorable compared to the pre covid years an executive at one lg group tech affiliate said by telephone asking not to be identified given the numbers provided by the fss it s fair to say inventory levels not considered as cash equivalents but as one of the key figures directly affecting a company s cash flow are elevated compared to the last year samsung lg and sk group s tech affiliates are taking action to heavily hold back on procurement orders and asking their top local suppliers for concessions such as delayed deliveries order reductions and even cancellations amid record high inventory levels each company said samsung electronics for example is considering halting the operation of its two smartphone plants in vietnam for two weeks from december this year to clear inventory we are not positive about the forecast of the global memory chip market in the fourth quarter of this year due to continued weak demand for tech products plus samsung s set making business divisions are set to defend profit margins for the remainder of this year an executive at samsung said samsung was cutting down on the production of smartphones tvs and home appliances because of swelling inventories which lg is also doing a currency trader watches monitors at the foreign exchange dealing room of keb hana bank headquarters in seoul nov 18 2022 ap yonhap micron technology of the u s and sk hynix both confirmed plans to significantly reduce facility investments next year due to what they called an unprecedented deterioration in memory chip demand samsung the global leader in the memory chip segment still remains confident about consolidating its ongoing dominance of the sector as it has no plans for production cuts or a huge reduction in capital expenditures next year rising inflation which usually impacts multinational tech companies including samsung sk lg and hyundai has been forcing investors to rethink whether stocks which grew in an environment of low interest rates will be able to continue growing but the central point is that while central banks around the world are expected to follow the u s federal reserve s widely anticipated move to lift its benchmark rate to 4 75 percent and 5 percent by march next year the overall economy is not in such bad shape similar to the broader economy technology stocks are very sensitive to inflation rising benchmark rates and a strong dollar it looks like all leading technology companies have to prepare for the risk of a global slowdown by seeking to clear out inventory said kim yong jin an economics professor at sogang university in seoul because samsung sk and lg s technology affiliates will have to be highly responsive to the economic environment until the second quarter of next year i would say these leading tech firms have no option but to further tighten their belts including pausing hiring in unprofitable businesses and winding down some products kim added representatives at samsung electronics and lg electronics declined to comment regarding questions over the specifics of additional belt tightening measures
i don t have statistics on which of our portfolio companies is firing and who is hiring but there is nothing to be done there are companies that need to hire employees and there are companies that need to fire them in order to slow down their burn rate explained alex kayyal svp and managing partner at salesforce ventures fund in an exclusive interview with calcalist according to kayyal it s hard for entrepreneurs to look long term and that s our job the good ceos are the ones who react quickly and take action i know it s very emotionally difficult but you have to do what s right for the next ten years if you want to be an entrepreneur and ceo you have to be able to do the hard things many israeli entrepreneurs would like to see salesforce on their list of shareholders in contrast to the heavy and outdated image of most corporate investment funds salesforce enjoys a modern and dynamic image proof of this can be seen in the fact that in 2021 it became the second most active corporate fund after google s gv the explanation for this lies in the fact that salesforce itself was a startup not long ago when founder marc benioff and his partners developed software for managing sales and service systems since 1999 the company has become an international giant with annual sales of over 25 billion and a market value of 150 billion even after a 50 drop from the beginning of 2022 1 view gallery alex kayyal svp and managing partner at salesforce ventures photo glynallen if you look at the dozens of companies in salesforce s portfolio all of them without exception are software companies and it is hard to ignore the extensive wave of layoffs they are undergoing this is also evident in salesforce s israeli portfolio in which it has invested over the years 500 million in 32 companies not including the purchase of clicksoftware for 1 4 billion in 2019 salesforce itself has also laid off 1 000 employees this month and according to estimates the total amount may reach 2 500 of its 73 000 employees the crisis affecting the high tech industry all over the world including israel where 6 500 employees have been laid off since the beginning of the year brought kayyal here for a series of meetings with the entrepreneurs behind salesforce s portfolio companies and also to assess new investment candidates kayyal conveyed everything but stress or concern about what s going on in the industry on the contrary for him layoffs are the right thing to do now entrepreneurs and ceos need to be agile and adaptable empathy towards employees is important but you also need to think about building the business for the long term says kayyal who was born in switzerland studied business administration at harvard joined salesforce in 2012 and last year became a managing partner moving from london to san francisco he has no technological background and refuses to reveal his age in what appears to be an attempt to obscure the fact that he is very young probably in his early 30s kayyal is a representative sample of the executives in investment funds who dictate the tone in global and israeli high tech in good times fund managers pushed entrepreneurs to expand quickly in order to take over market share and now most of them who themselves have never managed a company even a single day in their lives pull out books from reputed business administration schools and use them as a guide to life a look at kayyal s twitter account provides an excellent illustration of this this letter is one of the best i ve ever seen this is what leadership looks like in difficult times the letter attached to the tweet is a mass layoff letter sent by patrick collison the founder and ceo of stripe a fintech company that until recently was one of the highest valued private companies peaking at 40 billion it recently cut its value to 29 billion and fired 14 of its 8 000 employees in the letter collison admits that he made a mistake and exaggerated with the hiring of employees and also lists a line of benefits for those being laid off but the bottom line is clear and very elon musky if you get an email within fifteen minutes it means you re fired the business environment has changed explains kayyal the public market says it wants efficiency this is a big change and the entrepreneurs who want to build large and public companies must listen this means reevaluating how fast they want to grow we tell the founders of our portfolio companies think about the long term so they are thinking long term and that s why salesforce ventures unicorns led by snyk ownbackup and melio have recently experienced layoffs even though they have plenty of cash on hand how involved are you in your portfolio companies in most cases you are not on the board of directors but in the industry they say that you are very involved our role is not to tell the founders what to do but to support them in what they are doing we want to be the jet engine to challenge them before we sign an investment i tell the entrepreneur that it means that he has invited me to his home for a long time and i will be sleeping on his couch are you pressuring entrepreneurs to lay off employees i have and continue to see many companies and what they all have in common is that even the best have issues along the way the difficulties force us to think about strategy every time when times are challenging we tell them we are with you in the trenches we are not running away but we have to make decisions and they are not always easy the market is difficult for everyone but there is also an opportunity here these days you are meeting with quite a few entrepreneurs at different stages how much does the subject of budget cuts come up during your dinners we didn t talk about the layoffs during the meal and even now founders are interested in increasing market share not layoffs how do you know which companies should lay off and who can actually recruit and expand we have companies that have enough money for several years including in israel and there are companies that will have to raise in the coming year and for them the long term is also very important because the big break in the software market is still ahead of us a large survey conducted among cios showed that cloud computing expenditure will rise to 45 of all corporate spending in the next five years compared to 22 today the transition to the cloud is such a big event that we laugh and say that in fact cfos have become cios because they control these critical budgets how bad is next year going to be it will be very different between a company that has money for six years and we also have some of those in israel and a company that has money for five months in general there is currently a lot of pessimism around high tech but right now it is a great time to recruit employees build market share and invest in existing customers what will happen to high tech companies that only have money for a few months we really want to invest now and we haven t stopped investing the best investments made by the fund were actually those made during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 marc benioff is still very involved in the activity because his dna is very entrepreneurial so we have a lot of understanding and empathy for entrepreneurs but many growth companies don t want to raise now so 2022 will end with less investments than 2021 during which we invested 500 million when we meet with the ceos we ask them if you had another 100 million in your pocket right now what would you do with the money if the ceo has three big things he wants to do with that money he needs to raise capital if he says it is for the feeling of security and that the money will sit in the bank it is better not to raise it now because of market conditions obviously valuations have changed but for the healthy companies there will always be money kayyal is trying to avoid the term that scares funds and entrepreneurs alike down rounds or fundraising at a lower valuation than the previous round in the meantime the companies together with the funds are trying with all their might to avoid such transactions and prefer to turn to more creative means such as transactions that include debt that will be converted into shares when the valuations grow again or even taking regular credit to finance operations until the market turns around do you recognize changes in the behavior of senior managers in recent months did they grow up are they behaving responsibly many entrepreneurs have not experienced the previous crises and the current reality is new to them but to be a good entrepreneur you have to be able to go through walls and it doesn t have to be accidental either you have to be the kind of person who sees a wall and wants to go through it however at the same time you have to be able to listen to the advice of others and that s a difficult combination to find because most people who walk through walls don t want to listen to anyone on the other hand if you re willing to listen but you don t have a vision it won t help in 2021 salesforce ventures reported a phenomenal profit of 2 1 billion and in 2022 it presented a smaller profit of 1 2 billion but no less impressive is the fact that since it started operating 13 years ago it has invested about 5 billion it owes the extraordinary profits mainly to the ipo of software company snowflake and to the meteoric jump in zoom stock during covid in zoom for example salesforce invested 100 million at the same time as the ipo in 2019 and in about a year more than tripled the investment by the way the fund made a similar move in israel s monday com and purchased shares for 75 million at the same time as the company s ipo which was done at a valuation of 6 8 billion in 2021 by the end of july the last financial report published by salesforce it estimated the value of its investments at 5 2 billion still a slight increase compared to 4 8 billion at the beginning of the year did you warn your companies in advance that a slowdown was coming that there is a bubble our valuation was also at an all time high and we asked ourselves how long it could last and what we would do when things started to change we encouraged our companies to raise more money which is why there are now companies like bringg wiz or gong which have money for two additional years still as an economy that is dependent on high tech should we be worried

founded in 2005 as an ohio based environmental newspaper ecowatch is a digital platform dedicated to publishing quality science based content on environmental issues causes and solutions when one thinks of food waste many still think that it involves leftover food scraps or expired food left in the refrigerator that ends up in the garbage they don t think about the scores of food thrown out by supermarkets or not purchased by supermarkets for not being aesthetically pleasing enough to sell despite that the food is perfectly edible over a third of the world s food that s produced gets lost or wasted each year this happens while over 820 million people worldwide are affected from hunger some of this food particularly in the united states often ends up in our landfills emitting greenhouse gases and taking forever to decompose according to a 2018 report by the waste journal landfills have 10 15 years left of landfill capacity ten thousand u s landfills have already closed having reached capacity with 3 000 active landfills left on the bright side there is a global food waste revolution happening with many changemakers creating solutions to help feed the hungry to feed the soil to repurpose food waste into renewable energy and find innovative ways to sell food that otherwise would never be out in the supermarkets still there is a lot of work to be done facts according to the usda in the united states alone 30 40 percent of the food supply is wasted half of all produce is thrown away in the us because it is too ugly to eat this amounts to 60 million tons of fruit and vegetables ugly fruit and vegetables make up a third of all wasted food in europe 40 60 of fish caught are discarded because they do not meet supermarket quality standards nearly 50 is discarded in the united states a survey conducted by respect food reported that 63 of people don t know the difference between use by and best before dates use by dates indicate perishable items best before can be eaten after the given date but won t be at its highest quality food waste is the number one material in us landfills accounting for 24 of all municipal solid waste when the food in landfills rots it produces methane which is one of the most powerful greenhouse gas emissions about 6 8 of all human caused greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced if we stop wasting food food losses translate into lost income for farmers and higher prices for consumers giving us an economic incentive to reduce food waste environmental impact of food waste jose a bernat bacete getty images around the industrial revolution in the early 1900s is when food waste started to become more apparent food cost less and was more readily available prior to this people were preserving food by salting spicing picking and drying there was little use for refrigeration because meat fish milk fruits and vegetables did not play as important of a role as it does in diets today though some used the elements for refrigeration methods refrigeration in the 1930s helped preserve food longer but as time went on particularly after wwii industrial agriculture ramped up with overproduction particularly to accommodate exporting it wasn t until 2013 that the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao studied the impact of food waste on climate change designating food waste as one of the top three emitters of greenhouse gasses when food scraps enter the landfill it emits methane as it breaks down globally landfills and wastewater emit 67 million metric tons of methane that s 20 of methane emissions according to the united nations when food waste breaks down it also produces nitrogen which when exposed to air forms nitrate which can then leach into the groundwater which is often times used as our drinking water nitrates can affect how our blood carries oxygen high levels can turn skin bluish or gray and lead to more serious health effects like weakness birth defects excess heart rate fatigue and dizziness when we waste food we also waste the natural resources it involves to produce it water use while raising animals and growing crops is extremely intensive according to the natural resources defense council nrdc food waste ends up wasting a quarter of our water supply in the form of uneaten food and equates to 172 billion in wasted water adding that the us spends over 220 billion in growing transporting and processing 70 million tons of food that eventually ends up in landfills agriculture accounts for 70 of the world s water use by throwing out two pounds of beef you are wasting 50 000 liters of water used to produce the meat and nearly 1 000 liters for a glass of milk down the drain food waste and security when it comes to fruits nuts and vegetables the usda has high standards for quality that is not based on nutritional value but on appearance though some practical concerns are listed like vegetables being free from rot etc many fruits and vegetables on this extensive list seen here require firm plump appearances or specific sizes or shapes ken rutledge who manages sales at a potato farm in california has to figure out what to do when retailers decide that his fingerlings aren t the right size or that his yellow potatoes aren t perfectly round he has seen up to 75 of his crops rejected due to appearance i don t think you get past the gut punch he told the guardian referencing the amount of food that goes wasted if you re a produce grower or an artist would you rather see your work thrown in the burning pile or would you rather have it used and appreciated cosmetic imperfection is one of the main causes for food waste and what s particularly interesting is that following the usda s high standards for quality is entirely voluntary yet despite this global crisis supermarkets continue to stock shelves with only a specific glistening quality of food which not only results in food waste but lost income for farmers one of the reasons for this possibly happening is that consumers are not asking grocers to stock these items in the us in 2016 whole foods and walmart paired up with companies that source and sell imperfect produce to do pilot projects in store but this was quietly abandoned in 2019 the companies however are still up and running one of them is imperfect foods whose slogan is groceries that help you fight food waste and is a delivery service that rescues and redistributes food including produce shelf stable goods dairy meat and seafood they do so in support of farmers and producers to eliminate food waste the company claims on its website that as a customer in one year up to 380 pounds of food can be saved from going to the landfill misfits market which recently acquired imperfect foods is another online marketplace that delivers sustainably sourced foods with the same model consumers they say can save up to 40 on food as opposed to what is purchased at the market repurposing food waste to those in need while the above is a couple of direct to consumer options there are also numerous organizations that are helping out those in need both nationally by state and internationally here is a list of some of those who are making a difference in the us founded in 1979 to support underserved americans facing hunger they partner with farmers market chains and restaurants to rescue food waste and bring it to food banks across the us they also reach communities through mobile pantries they work to help alleviate food insecurity for seniors and children with school pantries summer meals and other programs to date they ve rescued 4 7 billion meals from manufacturers and distributors and have a network 200 food banks and 60 000 food pantries nationwide launched in pittsburgh pennsylvania in 2015 this organization equips local citizens with the tools and knowledge to reduce food waste in their communities they also work with food donors by redistributing the produce to local charities and underserved households as well as empower local citizens through their app food rescue hero to find and deliver food parcels to those in need the charity utilizes zero waste kitchens where they prepare meals and use surplus food to create original products and work to redistribute previously unsellable groceries founded by students at the university of maryland in 2011 to recover surplus dining hall food from campus it has evolved into one of the largest student led movements in the us across colleges and university campuses across the nation besides collecting leftover goods from food vendors restaurants and farms to deliver to community service agencies they also run campaigns to raise awareness among students about food waste and food insecurity and give students the tools to advocate for waste relief with policymakers founded in 1982 in new york city it s now one of the city s largest food rescue organizations that redirects surplus food to those in need by partnering with individual and corporate food donors then delivers it to soup kitchens food pantries and other community food programs they also have mobile markets to give residents access to fresh fruits and vegetables food rescue us was founded in 2011 by jeff schacher and kevin mullins to create a sustainable and scalable food rescue model that combats both food insecurity and food waste today they engage volunteers to help reduce food losses in multiple locations nationwide founded in 2011 this organization created a self sustaining community model that gets citizens in their local communities to transfer fresh food surpluses from local businesses to social service agencies that feed the food insecure with locations all over the us they do this by using an app to locate where to recover food from restaurants shops farmers markets or corporate retailers here is a list of over 50 more both by state and international charitable organizations who are fighting food waste other solutions to solve food waste kseniya ovchinnikova getty images just as there are many charitable organizations helping to get food to people in need there are many other solutions both old and innovative ways to repurpose food food waste and renewable energy many might not think of it but food waste can also be turned into renewable energy and several large companies over the years have signed on to do so using a process called anaerobic digestion ad food waste is treated at a special ad plant where it s broken down into a methane rich biogas that is then used to create new energy general mills has been doing it since 2016 after pledging to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 28 over a ten year period the company s yoplait greek yogurt production involves separating whey from heavier cream in milk which results in 60 70 percent of the milk becoming an unusable waste by product called acid way in order to avoid landfill disposal their tennessee plant constructed an anaerobic digestor and connected energy recovery facilities the biogas created is used to power a caterpillar engine that generates about 1 6 megawatts of electricity which supplies over 10 of the processing facility most

overcorrection that we want to avoid daly said san francisco fed research shows that the proxy rate is more like 6 compared to the fed funds rate range of 3 75 4 the proxy rate takes into consideration public and private borrowing rates and credit spreads among other things markets expect the fed to raise its benchmark interest rate another 0 5 percentage point in december then

their payments is rising at the fastest pace since 2009 according to morgan stanley analysts led by betsy graseck the metric closely watched by analysts as an indication of consumers financial health rose more than 50 basis points from a year earlier according to a chart in a report published monday the analysts based their findings on monthly master trust reports released by card issuers including american express bank of america citigroup discover and jpmorgan chase today s acceleration in delinquency deterioration is being driven by high inflation coupled with declining consumer savings graseck wrote our outlook for delinquency deterioration is based on consumer savings continuing to decline while unemployment inches up to 4 3 by year end 2023 consumers fortified with high employment levels and covid stimulus payments had seen late payments and defaults fall to record lows during the pandemic that began to change in may of this year as delinquencies began ticking up according to the analysts delinquency rates are nearly back at 2019 average levels and are expected to reach 3 by the end of next year the bank s findings align with federal reserve data from last week showing that third quarter card balances jumped by the most in 20 years amid rising prices and strong consumer demand hugh son goldman still sees path to a soft or at least softish landing for the fed goldman sachs economists think the federal reserve can bring inflation under control without causing a recession that doesn t mean there won t be pain the wall street firm still expects a weak economy ahead but it could be limited as the early signs so far suggest the central bank can achieve its hoped for soft landing the initial steps along this path have been successful but there is much further to go in 2023 goldman economist david mericle said in a client note over the weekend we expect another year of below potential growth and labor market rebalancing to solve much but not all of the underlying inflation problem unlike consensus we do not expect a recession goldman sees gdp growth of just 1 or so in 2023 a looser labor market and lower wage growth that all will come as the fed raises interest rates a few more times taking its benchmark borrowing rate to a range of 5 5 25 from the current range of 3 75 4 one reason for the firm s optimism is it sees inflation in its current form as not as bad as in the early 1980s the last time it was this high with some factors likely to abate on their own in the months ahead achieving a soft or at least softish landing is in large part a question of calibrating policy tightening correctly and while this isn t easy it has gone well so far this year mericle wrote jeff cox rail workers move closer to strike after one union rejects deal

robots are the future in certain sectors however that s not anytime soon companies have been trying out automatons to serve food in restaurants make home deliveries or do chores in stores partly in hopes of easing the worker shortage but some of those consumer facing robots aren t passing probation among the disenchanted fedex corp said last month it was powering down roxo its last mile delivery robot to prioritise several nearer term opportunities a spokeswoman said also in october amazon com inc said it was ending field tests of scout its home delivery robot after learning that some aspects of its unique delivery experience weren t meeting customers needs a company spokeswoman said and over the summer doordash inc said it was shutting down its chowbotics business best known for sally the salad making robot roughly 18 months after buying it while we gained valuable insights into how to better serve this market we concluded our current approach was not meeting our very high thresholds for continued investment a doordash spokesman said companies have entertained hopes that the growing variety of robots could help them not only weather the worker shortage but speed up labour intensive tasks improve customer service by reducing the number of things the human workers have to do and as an added bonus position their brands as innovative and forward leaning some of those efforts have been successful at least partly others have ground to a halt sending companies back to technology that is less sci fi but can be deployed more quickly and cost effectively upfront costs uncertain returns consider the tale of patty a robot waiter at fast casual chain burgerfi international inc patty was introduced in testing mode in jupiter florida last december leveraging technology is a key factor in delivering guest and employee happiness karl goodhew chief technology officer at the company said as he announced the new server nearly a year later patty is no longer rolling around burgerfi s floors while many customers enjoyed being served by the computer run waitress the cost of deploying pattys to all the chain s 120 plus restaurants would ultimately be too high for relatively marginal value goodhew said this week the human servers were happy to have a robot to help them bus plates he said but patty didn t speed things up enough to turn over considerably more tables it turns out to be a massive investment for something that is really an extra pair of hands goodhew said instead burgerfi is investing in customer service technology such as self ordering kiosks and a phone answering bot called becky he added despite the mixed reviews around 121 000 service sector robots were sold last year to carry out tasks from transportation to surgery to vacuuming according to the international federation of robotics an industry organisation that conducts a yearly robot census based on global vendor data some companies are satisfied their robots are doing the job white castle for instance has flippy 2 the latest iteration of a robotic fry cook working the kitchens of four of its 350 plus fast food restaurants and plans to bring the robots to 100 more locations besides french fries flippy also makes onion rings and wakefern food corp s shoprite a regional grocery chain uses tally robots in 20 of its stores and plans to roll out more of them in the coming months made by simbe robotics inc tally travels the aisles scanning for problems with stock like items in the wrong place or empty shelves needs improvement but other companies are rethinking their robot helpers chili s grill bar the casual dining chain owned by brinker international inc in august halted the rollout of rita which seated guests served food bused tables and sang happy birthday the decision came just four months after chili s had expanded rita from 10 trial locations to 51 more restaurants we re going to stop some of those projects that we just didn t have a line of sight to a return on the business brinker chief executive kevin hochman said during an earnings call at the time hochman who took on the top job in june said he was instead looking at investing in things like kitchen equipment that will reduce cook times and turn over tables faster and improving the user interface of its mobile ordering site chili s had hoped the ritas would lighten the load on wait staff but found the robots were too slow to keep up with service a brinker spokeswoman said all ritas will be removed from chili s restaurants this month she added juan higueros co founder and chief operating officer of rita maker bear robotics inc said the company was surprised chili s put the technology on pause as research indicated it was largely well received by staff adding that one chili s employee this week posted a tiktok video of workers saying comedic goodbyes to their robot buddy we hope we will have the opportunity to continue the progress we were jointly making in the near future higueros said the abandoned tests highlight the difficulties in balancing the costs of robots against their usefulness said matt beane an assistant professor in the technology management program at the university of california santa barbara robots are still prone to messing up basic tasks and often require supervision in fluid environments like shop floors or sidewalks prof beane said their success in public settings has been largely limited to high margin businesses in contained predictable spaces delivering room service at luxury hotels or mixing cocktails in bars for example where robots are often novelties for which companies can charge extra he said i have not seen good examples of companies successfully deploying robotic systems in low margin public facing settings prof beane said mcdonald s chief executive chris kempczinksi in july told investors and analysts he thought robots weren t a practical solution to labour demand in the vast majority of restaurants the economics don t pencil out you don t necessarily have the footprint and there s a lot of infrastructure investments that you need to do around your utility he said mcdonald s is investing in bots at the software level however testing automated voice recognition that can fill in for human order takers at its drive throughs overcoming human misgivings despite any corporate enthusiasm for robots with their limitless work hours no sick days bathroom breaks or grousing customers aren t necessarily happy to see one when they are expecting a person when chili s in may posted a video of rita to its facebook page some customers were annoyed quit trying to erase people one commenter wrote offline nearly 60 of surveyed chili s diners said rita didn t improve their overall experience at the restaurant the brinker spokeswoman said adding that rita s job was to make employees jobs easier while entertaining diners not to take jobs from human staff debbie roxarzade founder and chief executive of las vegas based restaurant chain rachel s kitchen said she came up against some customer resistance when she first introduced servi another machine from bear robotics in her henderson nevada restaurant in december 2021 when she was having trouble finding staff the discomfort though soon dissipated she said the regulars now see that it hasn t replaced any of the team members behind the counter if anything they see that the team members are a little bit more relaxed and happy to have this extra pair of hands roxarzade said rachel s kitchen staff primarily use servi to share the load when bringing food and drink to a big table or multiple tables roxarzade said servers are glad to not have to walk back and forth to the kitchen as much and get to spend more time on the guests she added but the staff has also had to learn to work around servi s quirks for example servi isn t great at busing dirty trays back to the dish sink she doesn t open doors roxarzade said servi also can t go outside because the sun interferes with its navigation system so roxarzade said she can t use it at locations that seat a lot of customers in patio areas the perils of the outdoors are a big problem for delivery robots in particular the internet is flooded with videos of coolers on wheels driving themselves into potholes getting stuck in snow crashing being stolen and in one case getting obliterated by a freight train some people have also raised concerns that delivery robots could block wheelchair access on sidewalks or otherwise get in the way of humans leading local authorities to limit or prohibit their use toronto for example last december banned delivery robots the prohibition will remain in effect until ontario s transportation ministry establishes a pilot program to research the effects of robots and the city council decides whether it wants to opt in a spokeswoman said even so these roving robots come with advantages according to jeremy shirk co owner of conan s pizza in austin texas in april he began using cyan robotics inc s coco robots to deliver his deep dish pizzas around the south austin area the robots it turned out were much slower than his delivery drivers and often found it difficult to cross wide roads he said my biggest pie that we call the savage weighs about 6 pounds shirk said it doesn t really do well bouncing around for 20 minutes in august the robotics company paused its austin operations over supply problems a spokeswoman said but shirk said he would still use cocos if they were available for one big reason they were great advertising it was all about getting people talking which worked he said i could say i have the oldest pizzeria in austin with the newest delivery tech i thought that was pretty cool bangkok post

find a jar of some questionable critter to identify in many cases the contents of the jars prove to be unremarkable that was not the case with this one when i opened it up i saw a whole bunch of ticks in there and i said to myself uh oh penrose said after sending samples from the jar for further analysis in columbus penrose s suspicions were confirmed the asian longhorned tick had made its way to morgan county cattle pastures the ohio department of agriculture oda announced in the summer of 2020 the united states department of agriculture s national veterinary services laboratory confirmed the discovery of an asian longhorned tick in gallia county the tick was found on a stray dog the tick was identified by ohio state university and sent to the federal lab for confirmation the asian longhorned tick is an exotic east asian tick that is known as a serious pest to livestock u s department of agriculture first confirmed the presence of this tick in the u s in new jersey in 2017 asian longhorned ticks are light brown in color and are very small often smaller than a sesame seed an adult female is about the size of a pea when full of blood larva nymph and adult may all be present at the same time asian longhorned ticks are difficult to detect due to their size and quick movement they are known to carry pathogens which can cause disease in humans and livestock and may also cause distress to the host from their feeding in large numbers in some cases causing death since first discovered in ohio the asian longhorned tick has been spreading i think last year they were found over in monroe county and maybe another county in southern ohio penrose said we kept it in the back of our minds to keep an eye out for it when the jar came in that s what stimulated my interest and of course the interest of our local veterinarian along with all the creepy traits common to ticks asian longhorned ticks can reproduce asexually they don t need a mate to reproduce penrose said each tick can lay up to 2 000 eggs so you can see how fast they can expand and basically overwhelm a cow i think these numbers can build up so fast and so much that that they can actually suck enough blood out of a cow to kill her this was obviously a concern for the cattle producer behind the tick filled jar at the extension office earlier in the summer the farmer did notice a few ticks on some baby calves when he went out to work them after they were born he didn t think much about it but then later on he saw some of his cattle with a whole bunch of ticks on them our local veterinarian went out and was able to treat them the farmer ended up moving the cattle over to another field a lot of the discussion has been about how these ticks multiply rapidly but they don t travel very far more nymphs were found this fall but they got it under control for this season farmers right next door that had cattle didn t have any issues with them whatsoever penrose said and not only our local veterinarian osu extension and osu veterinarians get involved with this but also our friends at the ohio department of agriculture and our usda veterinarians got involved we informed the local health department about it too it was really comforting that there was a team of different agencies working together to really get a handle on this while tick season is winding down late in the year it remains important to monitor livestock for asian longhorned ticks and the potential for disease they spread while there is time to come up with a strategy for 2023 in cattle check for ticks where the skin is thin on the head neck ears flanks armpit groin udder and under the tail there are some insecticides or some pour ons that can be used but there may be some resistance to some certain types another problem is that a lot of the pour ons we use are not labeled for ticks even though they work on ticks penrose said that s why it s so important to have a good veterinary client patient relationship with a veterinarian if you re fortunate enough to have one in your area so you can come up with a solution some of the ivomec type products will work for an extended period of time but others may not if it s really bad you maybe should consider something like a back rubber that has an insecticide with it that you could put out next to the mineral tub or the water source ticks move by hitching a ride on something else they can move on wildlife people equipment anything that s kind of what makes it scary you need to not only check your cattle but your goats your sheep your dogs and cats it s really important to have pets on one of those good preventative medicines to keep ticks off our animals penrose said they re still trying to learn about this but it certainly can be a problem we need to figure out how to keep these ticks from spreading we need to really keep an eye out because problems are much easier to solve if you can get on them early rather than when it gets to be too late for the livestock this is a developing situation that hopefully we can learn more from and really not cause any additional problems to livestock in kentucky the bite of the asian longhorned tick is being blamed for cattle with a microscopic protozoan parasite theileria orientalis that infects the red blood cells of cattle and causes anemia the problem can also be transmitted through blood transfer from contaminated needles and equipment the tick can feed on many animal species including humans but the blood parasite only affects cattle once a cow is infected it may take 1 to 8 weeks before she shows symptoms of disease said michelle arnold with the university of kentucky veterinary diagnostic laboratory there is a spring peak in disease incidence in march april and a fall peak in september october there is no effective treatment for sick cattle or vaccine to prevent infections however once infected cattle become carriers and are protected from new infections there are no recognized long term health or production effects from persistent infection theileria is not a public health concern and contact with affected cattle doesn t pose a human health risk or food safety risk with regard to theileria arnold suggests cattle producers watch for the following the majority of infected cattle have limited or mild clinical signs the symptoms are very similar to anaplasmosis another tick borne cattle disease that causes anemia affected cattle show signs of anemia including lethargy pale or jaundiced yellow mucous membranes and increased respiratory and heart rates labored breathing may be mistaken for pneumonia especially in young stock affected cattle may be exercise intolerant and lag behind the rest of the herd or be off by themselves affected cows may be off feed have a fever and sudden weight loss may see sudden death especially in late pregnant and early lactation cows late term abortions may occur due to lack of oxygen to the fetus with subsequent death of the calf metritis in the cow can follow breeding bulls may have decreased libido for 1 to 1 5 months calves especially 6 to 8 weeks of age but up to 6 months of age may show symptoms for cattle with signs of anemia arnold suggests contact a veterinarian theileriosis and anaplasmosis look almost identical so treatment with an approved antibiotic la 300 or baytril 100 ca1 for treatment of anaplasmosis is recommended however if theileria is the cause there will be no response to the antibiotic therapy a blood test is available to test for this disease stress and movement of affected animals should be minimized as their reduced number of red blood cells lowers their ability to transport oxygen around the body this can lead to collapse and death affected animals should be rested given high quality feed and water and handled only when necessary there is no treatment available for theileria infection other than supportive care blood transfusions may be used for valuable animals recovery may take 1 to 2 months depending on the severity of the anemia ease any underlying disease or stress cows in late pregnancy early lactation and young calves 2 to 3 months old are more susceptible to severe disease pay close attention to cows around calving avoid trace mineral deficiencies and vaccinate cattle against the immunosuppressive bvd virus for controlling asian longhorned ticks arnold said ticks spend most of the time nearly 90 in the environment even though only a small proportion of the tick population is on livestock at any one time treating cattle with a tick repellent will reduce the numbers that feed and develop into the next stage of the tick lifecycle this will have an impact on the numbers of eggs that eventually get deposited in the pasture and helps manage the disease spread currently there are no acaricides labeled for use against asian longhorned ticks the use of pesticide impregnated ear tags pour ons sprays and back rubs that control the american dog tick and the lonestar tick should provide beneficial tick control there are field reports of success with macrocyclic lactone dewormers such as cydectin pour on and dectomax injectable products environmental control to reduce contact with ticks involves mowing pastures especially shaded areas and fencing cattle from wooded areas perimeter fencing of a minimum of 20 feet from wooded areas will reduce the number of ticks on the grazing area all stages of the tick like warm damp conditions and long grass avoiding long rank pasture that has not been grazed such as around the edge of crops and brushy areas will reduce the likelihood of animals picking up ticks keep in mind that wildlife can serve as tick hosts and move the ticks to new areas treat new cattle for ticks as they arrive to the farm and before moving cattle from one property to another to avoid movement of infected ticks calves should be closely inspected for ticks and signs of anemia too ohio state university extension has a fact sheet on asian longhorned ticks at

three double digit rallies this year in the s p 500 argue a case that as difficult as 2022 has been for equity markets there s enough resilience to suggest that this year could be a harbinger for

inflation data also indicates that the federal reserve s rate hiking cycle is doing its job even though the labor market remains resilient stoltzfus said retail sales data showing a resilient consumer

acting like the central bank is moving even faster san francisco fed president mary daly said monday that s important she added because the relationship between the actual fed funds rate and what daly called a proxy rate on the actual impact of the fed s moves can help tell policymakers when they need to stop raising interest rates as we make decisions about future rate adjustments it s going to be increasingly important to remain conscious of this gap between the printed funds rate and the proxy funds rate she said if we ignore this gap it raises the chance of tightening too much this overcorrection that we want to avoid daly said san francisco fed research shows that the proxy rate is more like 6 compared to the fed funds rate range of 3 75 4 the proxy rate takes into consideration public and private borrowing rates and credit spreads among other things markets expect the fed to raise its benchmark interest rate another 0 5 percentage point in december then increase a few more times in 2023 until the funds rate hits around 5 5 25 daly has said she also expects the fed funds rate to hit around 5 and remain high until inflation starts coming down jeff cox

subin gina francolla bank of america says market could stay range bound after a recent bounce on increasing hope that inflation may be peaking bank of america thinks stocks could stay range bound going forward financial markets are at a crossroads as narratives build up around two very different outcomes that depend on data prints over the next few months as well as the reaction function of central banks especially the fed strategists led by ritesh samadhiya said in a note monday the first is a benign outcome where the fed executes a soft landing by cooling inflation without pushing the unemployment rate too high the other relatively gloomier scenario is one of a global recession which suggests further potential downside to risk assets the note said the high likelihood for both as suggested by leading indicators hints at a middle of the path outcome that could see markets range bound in the near future michael bloom fred imbert consumers appetite for credit cards rises refi outlook slumps survey shows americans are less likely to apply for auto loans or mortgage refinancing in the year ahead but more likely to try to get a credit card according to a survey monday from

the fed goldman sachs economists think the federal reserve can bring inflation under control without causing a recession that doesn t mean there won t be pain the wall street firm still expects a weak economy ahead but it could be limited as the early signs so far suggest the central bank can achieve its hoped for soft landing the initial steps along this path have been successful but there is much further to go in 2023 goldman economist david mericle said in a client note over the weekend we expect another year of below potential growth and labor market rebalancing to solve much but not all of the underlying inflation problem unlike consensus we do not expect a recession goldman sees gdp growth of just 1 or so in 2023 a looser labor market and lower wage growth that all will come as the fed raises interest rates a few more times taking its benchmark borrowing rate to a range of 5 5 25 from the current range of 3 75 4 one reason for the firm s optimism is it sees inflation in its current form as not as bad as in the early 1980s the last time it was this high with some factors likely to abate on their own in the months ahead achieving a soft or at least softish landing is in large part a question of calibrating policy tightening correctly and while this isn t easy it has gone well so far this year mericle wrote jeff cox rail workers move closer to strike after one union rejects deal

elon musk restored the twitter account of former president donald trump on saturday a pivotal move that could help the platform s once loudest bluntest force regain online attention just as a new presidential election begins the people have spoken musk wrote in a tweet nodding to the results of a twitter poll that had just completed on whether to reinstate the former president trump s account was repopulating with old tweets and followers saturday night though the former president had not tweeted immediately after being restored he said earlier saturday he remained focused on his twitter clone truth social signaling he would not return to the site right away twitter users who participated in musk s poll voted roughly 52 percent to 48 percent to restore trump s account according to the unscientific and non representative twitter poll musk has put multiple pivotal decisions up to a vote from his twitter feed including last year on whether to sell 10 percent of his tesla stock musk had previously said he disagreed with the ban and intended to restore trump but after purchasing twitter for 44 billion late last month he had also promised to install a content moderation council to make such decisions saying the process would likely take weeks trump had more than 88 million followers before twitter suspended him after jan 6 2021 citing fears of violent incitement in the days after his supporters stormed the u s capitol in riots that left five dead and hundreds injured two former twitter employees familiar with the process of account restoration speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution said banned accounts can take up to a full day to be restored to their prior state musk s move minutes after the conclusion of his poll reversed one of the most consequential decisions in twitter s history a self described free speech absolutist musk has said permanent bans undermine twitter s role as an unrestricted haven for free expression it drew immediate criticism from the naacp which urged advertisers to pause all promotions on the platform saturday night in elon musk s twittersphere you can incite an insurrection at the u s capitol which led to the deaths of multiple people and still be allowed to spew hate speech and violent conspiracies on his platform it said in a statement if elon musk continues to run twitter like this using garbage polls that do not represent the american people and the needs of our democracy god help us all musk has made a dramatic series of changes since taking over twitter last month and installing himself as ceo calling himself chief twit he ousted the company s old leadership including the policy executive who oversaw instating the ban on trump and conducted steep layoffs that cut twitter s staff in half a subsequent ultimatum by musk to commit to a hardcore twitter resulted in further attrition decimating teams that run core functions such as user profiles on friday he announced he had restored the accounts of conservative satire site the babylon bee and right wing self help guru jordan peterson who had been suspended for anti transgender posts comedian kathy griffin who had mocked musk was also restored he announced in a tweeted letter the day he completed his 44 billion acquisition musk pledged not to make twitter a free for all hellscape and said he bought the platform because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner without resorting to violence but musk s rapid changes prompted concerns about the direction conversation on twitter would take the site was flooded with racist posts shortly after the deal closed to make musk the new owner as anonymous trolls spewed slurs and nazi memes arguing the old rules new longer applied days after assuming owernship of the site and following his reassurances to advertisers musk posted a conspiracy laden article regarding the attack on house speaker nancy pelosi s husband paul pelosi that led to additional consternation from advertisers the situation only got worse after the botched rollout of musk first major product blue verified which let users who paid 7 99 a month obtain a blue checkmark icon previously a signifier of public figures on the site twitter was flooded with impersonation attempts that targeted large corporations political officials and professional athletes among others musk dialed back the feature and delayed its re introduction for two weeks while twitter assessed the damage then saturday night musk restored trump s account david sacks an investor and a musk associate in the newly privatized twitter called the continued ban on trump an unjustified and unwarranted interference with the marketplace of ideas a tweet musk said was well put free speech is back in america sacks wrote in an earlier tweet right wing figures including members of the former trump administration and political personalities aligned with the former president celebrated musk s decision before he was reinstated trump addressed musk s poll and the subject of his account during video link remarks to the republican jewish coalition conference on saturday in las vegas he reacted coolly to the prospect of rejoining the site reiterating previous remarks that he would rather focus his attention on his clone website truth social i don t see any reason for it trump said of returning to twitter alluding to the social media network s reported problems with bots and declining engagement truth social has taken the place for a lot of people and i don t see them going back onto twitter while trump took the opportunity to promote his own website he said he appreciated the poll and welcomed musk s purchase i like that he bought it i ve always liked him trump said he s a character but i tend to like characters if he returns trump s reinstatement at the dawn of the 2024 presidential race could cement the platform again as a hyperpolarized political battleground trump used twitter to great effect to grip the news cycle and tear down opponents not only in the years before running for president but on the campaign trail and later in the white house though trump has said he wouldn t rejoin twitter even if he was asked some of his advisers told the washington post this spring that they doubted his commitment twitter was trump s most dominant megaphone allowing him to reach an audience of tens of millions of followers with dozens of messages a day in trump s contract with truth social he agreed he would make his posts exclusively available on truth social for eight hours before he could share them elsewhere the post has reported the agreement offered exceptions for political messaging political fundraising or get out the vote efforts which he could do anywhere at any time researchers and activists have argued that reinstating trump will embolden rule breakers and neutralize twitter s most potent tool for reducing harassment and lies suspending someone s account this will open up the floodgates to incredibly obnoxious behavior said joan donovan a research director of harvard s shorenstein center on media politics and public policy who has studied disinformation trump s reinstatement she said will not only help the former president drive the public conversation and influence the most popular medium for journalists and news junkies it will also help centralize a political outrage movement that has scattered across smaller right wing corners of the web this brings us back to 2020 where trump understands the power that what he says in public and on twitter can create mass hysteria she said the people he s mobilizing have not gone away they feel as strongly as ever that something is rotten in the government and they need an actual savior trump will rejoin a twitter that looks very different than it did when he sent his first tweet in 2009 to urge people to watch his brief appearance on late night with david letterman unlike his first time on twitter his audience will likely know what to expect from him it remains to be seen whether he can recapture his old audience after his twitter ban trump began posting messages onto a widely ignored blog that he discarded after 29 days due to its small readership trump later signed on with a small team of co founders to build a twitter clone truth social that launched earlier this year and promised to become a media powerhouse but trump has only 4 million followers on the site and his messages there receive only a tiny fraction of his previous twitter engagement and response the start up running it trump media technology group has also been undermined by bitter infighting federal investigations and increasing investor unease some critics expect that trump s reinstatement on twitter could further kneecap truth social which had counted on trump s involvement as its key differentiator in an increasingly crowded marketplace of right wing social networks meme pages and message boards trump had pledged to use truth social exclusively and was given 90 percent ownership in the start up its investment partner digital world acquisition saw its stock fall to near record lows on thursday due to concerns over trump s twitter return on truth social trump has continued to lie about widespread fraud in the election and share conspiracy theories related to qanon the jumble of bogus claims suggesting trump is leading a secret resistance against a global cabal of child eating satanists he s been dog whistling qanon on truth social hoping to get mainstream media attention just sending out all these conspiracy beacons to get momentum and energy around his name donovan said but there s nothing new about it a lot will depend on the lengths he will be willing to go to get attention

the federal reserve s rate hiking cycle is doing its job even though the labor market remains resilient stoltzfus said retail sales data showing a resilient consumer also suggests the u s economy may

is moving even faster san francisco fed president mary daly said monday that s important she added because the relationship between the actual fed funds rate and what daly called a proxy rate on the actual impact of the fed s moves can help tell policymakers when they need to stop raising interest rates as we make decisions about future rate adjustments it s going to be increasingly important to remain conscious of this gap between the printed funds rate and the proxy funds rate she said if we ignore this gap it raises the chance of tightening too much this overcorrection that we want to avoid daly said san francisco fed research shows that the proxy rate is more like 6 compared to the fed funds rate range of 3 75 4 the proxy rate takes into consideration public and private borrowing rates and credit spreads among other things markets expect the fed to raise its benchmark interest rate another 0 5 percentage point in december then increase a few more times in 2023 until the funds

crossroads as narratives build up around two very different outcomes that depend on data prints over the next few months as well as the reaction function of central banks especially the fed strategists led by ritesh samadhiya said in a note monday the first is a benign outcome where the fed executes a soft landing by cooling inflation without pushing the unemployment rate too high the other relatively gloomier scenario is one of a global recession which suggests further potential downside to risk assets the note said the high likelihood for both as suggested by leading indicators hints at a middle of the path outcome that could see markets range bound in the near future michael bloom fred imbert consumers appetite for credit cards rises refi outlook slumps survey shows

the federal reserve can bring inflation under control without causing a recession that doesn t mean there won t be pain the wall street firm still expects a weak economy ahead but it could be limited as the early signs so far suggest the central bank can achieve its hoped for soft landing the initial steps along this path have been successful but there is much further to go in 2023 goldman economist david mericle said in a client note over the weekend we expect another year of below potential growth and labor market rebalancing to solve much but not all of the underlying inflation problem unlike consensus we do not expect a recession goldman sees gdp growth of just 1 or so in 2023 a looser labor market and lower wage growth that all will come as the fed raises interest rates a few more times taking its benchmark borrowing rate to a range of 5 5 25 from the current range of 3 75 4 one reason for the firm s optimism is it sees inflation in its current form as not as bad as in the early 1980s the last time it was this high with some factors likely to abate on their own in the months ahead achieving a soft or at least softish landing is in large part a question of calibrating policy tightening correctly and while this isn t easy it has gone well so far this year mericle wrote jeff cox rail workers move closer to strike after one union rejects deal one of the

markets are acting like the central bank is moving even faster san francisco fed president mary daly said monday that s important she added because the relationship between the actual fed funds rate and what daly called a proxy rate on the actual impact of the fed s moves can help tell policymakers when they need to stop raising interest rates as we make decisions about future rate adjustments it s going to be increasingly important to remain conscious of this gap between the printed funds rate and the proxy funds rate she said if we ignore this gap it raises the chance of tightening too much this overcorrection that we want to avoid daly said san francisco fed research shows that the proxy rate is more like 6 compared to the fed funds rate range of 3 75 4 the proxy rate takes into consideration public and private borrowing rates and credit spreads among other things markets expect the fed to raise its benchmark interest rate another 0 5 percentage point in december then increase a few more times in 2023 until the funds rate hits around 5 5 25 daly has said she also expects the fed funds rate to hit around 5 and remain high until inflation starts coming down jeff cox

subin gina francolla bank of america says market could stay range bound after a recent bounce on increasing hope that inflation may be peaking bank of america thinks stocks could stay range bound going forward financial markets are at a crossroads as narratives build up around two very different outcomes that depend on data prints over the next few months as well as the reaction function of central banks especially the fed strategists led by ritesh samadhiya said in a note monday the first is a benign outcome where the fed executes a soft landing by cooling inflation without pushing the unemployment rate too high the other relatively gloomier scenario is one of a global recession which suggests further potential downside to risk assets the note said the high likelihood for both as suggested by leading indicators hints at a middle of the path outcome that could see markets range bound in the near future michael bloom fred imbert consumers appetite for credit cards rises refi outlook slumps survey shows americans are less likely to apply for auto loans or mortgage refinancing in the year ahead but more likely to try to get a credit card according to a survey monday from

rose more than 50 basis points from a year earlier according to a chart in a report published monday the analysts based their findings on monthly master trust reports released by card issuers including american express bank of america citigroup discover and jpmorgan chase today s acceleration in delinquency deterioration is being driven by high inflation coupled with declining consumer savings graseck wrote our outlook for delinquency deterioration is based on consumer savings continuing to decline while unemployment inches up to 4 3 by year end 2023 consumers fortified with high employment levels and covid stimulus payments had seen late payments and defaults fall to record lows during the pandemic that began to change in may of this year as delinquencies began ticking up according to the analysts delinquency rates are nearly back at 2019 average levels and are expected to reach 3 by the end of next year the bank s findings align with federal reserve data from last

the fed goldman sachs economists think the federal reserve can bring inflation under control without causing a recession that doesn t mean there won t be pain the wall street firm still expects a weak economy ahead but it could be limited as the early signs so far suggest the central bank can achieve its hoped for soft landing the initial steps along this path have been successful but there is much further to go in 2023 goldman economist david mericle said in a client note over the weekend we expect another year of below potential growth and labor market rebalancing to solve much but not all of the underlying inflation problem unlike consensus we do not expect a recession goldman sees gdp growth of just 1 or so in 2023 a looser labor market and lower wage growth that all will come as the fed raises interest rates a few more times taking its benchmark borrowing rate to a range of 5 5 25 from the current range of 3 75 4 one reason for the firm s optimism is it sees inflation in its current form as not as bad as in the early 1980s the last time it was this high with some factors likely to abate on their own in the months ahead achieving a soft or at least softish landing is in large part a question of calibrating policy tightening correctly and while this isn t easy it has gone well so far this year mericle wrote jeff cox rail workers move closer to strike after one union rejects deal

nearly 500 children under the age of 6 recently tested positive for lead poisoning in minnesota an ongoing health issue for which the federal government earmarks significant funding every year this fall hennepin county received a record 6 7 million grant from the u s department of housing and urban development to prevent lead poisoning part of a 125 million grant package distributed among 26 states only the cities of chicago and houston received more funding than hennepin county which has a large stock of homes and apartments that used lead paint the county inspects and removes lead paint from windows doors and stairs in at least 125 homes and apartments every year and the federal funds will allow the county to cover up to 12 000 in paint removal for each property replacing a window with lead paint can cost up to 11 000 said mike jensen the county s lead abatement program manager hennepin county s last federal grant to battle lead poisoning was 5 6 million the number of children with lead poisoning has gone down in the last decade jensen said but we can t stick a flag in the ground and declare the problem will be over anytime soon lead poisoning can only be detected by a blood test it can result in brain and nervous system damage slowed growth and development learning and behavior problems and hearing and speech complications the impact can be permanent or even deadly the covid 19 pandemic created a slowdown in lead abatement because workers couldn t go inside residences for inspections and there was a shortage of supplies to make repairs most homes used lead paint before 1978 when the federal government banned the product many of the properties are in low income neighborhoods where owners and renters may not be know about the effects of lead poisoning or that grant money may be available for repairs the number of minnesota children under 6 who tested positive for elevated lead levels has dropped from 900 in 2011 about 25 of the nearly 500 cases in 2020 occurred in hennepin county ramsey and st louis counties also had a significant number of poisoning cases it s a misconception that most children are poisoned by eating lead chips jensen said most actually get sick when windows and doors are opened and closed creating lead dust that can be breathed in or ingested the unborn babies of pregnant woman can also be exposed to lead poisoning since 2004 hennepin county has removed lead paint from 5 200 houses and apartment units the federal grants used for the program are awarded every four years and require up to a 25 matching grant from the county the county has an extensive education and outreach program about lead abatement said jensen officials use census tracts to target families most likely at risk looking at factors such as housing age income level and the history of elevated blood levels in the area this is then mapped out to help with partners who go out in the community jensen said we can get there before it happens and make sure kids aren t exposed while leaded paint is the biggest concern lead can also be found in imported spices such as turmeric and chili powder cosmetics imported candy traditional cookware pottery and imported aluminum cookware traditional chinese hispanic and indian medicines can be sources of lead hennepin county has a mobile x ray machine to test those products along with plastics and soil the county has 11 people on its lead inspection team and contracts with other organizations for outreach one such group is sustainable resources center a nonprofit that also works with the city of minneapolis and the minnesota department of health to create healthy and energy efficient homes the group visits residents answering questions about lead abatement and discussing how to enroll in the grant program it uses a van called leadie eddie that offers free lead testing in the community more than 20 000 children have been tested since the group started in 1976 families get the results within three minutes said rachelle menanteau peleska the group s director of education and outreach the rate of lead poisoning will now increase post covid so it s great timing to have the county grants available most property owners and tenants are receptive to lead abatement after they learn how serious the problem is peleska said but she said she becomes frustrated by landlords who don t want to cooperate with the grant program if a child tests positive for lead they are required to make repairs they have to shoulder very little of the cost peleska said it s a no brainer to make the houses safe housing is a right this makes kids safe and could save their lives

lcva2 at face value defensive oriented stocks such as telecommunication companies that were in a position to offer immediate access to shareholder returns in the form of lucrative dividends should have been able to perform well this year during the market downturn however the oligopoly like market conditions combined with the potent cash flows the companies were generating allowed them to become significantly more levered up than what would usually be considered acceptable the rising interest rate environment accompanied by increased capital expenditures dedicated to building up the 5g infrastructure as well as the fact that the risk free rates started slowly creeping up to the dividend yields the telecoms were offering started draining equity out of telecoms this year at an alarming pace this process hit telecommunication companies across the globe and vodafone nasdaq vod was no exception with the british based telecommunication giant losing more than a quarter of its market capitalization since the offset of the year once more leading to disappointing results for investors this has led to an interesting valuation with the company currently being sold for an ntm ev ebitda of 6 44x ntm p e of 10 44x and an ntm p fcf of 6 44x while offering an attractive dividend yield of 7 97 today we attempt to analyze the situation and attempt to dissect if we are dealing with a classic value trap or a possibly truly attractive and immersive investment opportunity vodafone vs s p500 ytd returns seeking alpha overview of the company vodafone group represents one of the leading telecommunications services providers in europe as well as one of the largest communications providers in the world as measured by both customer base and generated revenues the group offers its fixed line and mobile communication services to more than 650 million customers in 21 countries across three continents being founded all the way back in 1984 in the united kingdom the company has since evolved to become a true pan european telecommunications giant vodafone ended last year with â 45 58 billion in revenues while generating adj ebitda of â 15 20 billion as well as â 5 43 in adj free cash flow the u k based company provides a broad range of traditional services offered through mobile communications including call text and data access as well as fixed line services including broadband television and voice beyond its traditional portfolio offering vodafone also engages in products such as the internet of things comprising managed iot connectivity automotive and insurance services cloud and security portfolio comprising public and private cloud services as well as cloud based applications and products for securing networks and devices and international voice ip transit and messaging services to support business customers that include small home offices and large multi national companies vodafone group holding structure investor relations presentation the telecom empire vodafone has managed to build throughout the decades expanded way beyond only premium and high end markets such as germany and the united kingdom through distressed markets such as turkey to major growth markets such as africa regional footprint investor presentation fy 22 when analyzing telecommunication companies around the world there usually comes a point where we would have to discuss the debt levels of the company which are usually quite high and that remains the case with vodafone as well the company struggled with leverage for a long time as of the half year results the company was carrying a significant amount of debt totaling â 53 78 billion in gross debt and â 45 52 billion in net debt the net debt position increased by â 3 94 million to â 45 52 million when compared to the fy 2022 results using its definition of adjusted ebitdaal vodafone has a net leverage ratio of 3 53x and a gross leverage ratio of 2 99x financial results h1 fy 23 release the company holds a borderline respectable credit rating currently it received an investment grade rating from all three major credit rating agencies it carries a baa2 bbb and bbb credit rating from standard poor s fitch and moody s respectively credit ratings vodafone investor relations the main form of generating shareholder value for vodafone was its lucrative dividend program all things considered vodafone group is operating a very lucrative dividend policy within the current market environment between the london traded shares selling at around â 0 99 and the adr shares selling at around 11 69 the current dividend yield is roughly 7 97 dividend growth has definitely not been a strong point when it comes to vodafone as the company was forced to cut its dividends twice over the past decade in order to ensure the stability of its balance sheet the currently committed dividend distribution is about half of what the distribution was almost a decade ago currently the company is paying out â 0 09 on a semi annual basis through its equal â 0 045 interim and final dividends that leads us to the question of dividend safety the company should not in theory be struggling to keep up with its current dividend policy which costs slightly more than â 2 3 billion each year as a reminder vodafone generated â 5 43 in adj free cash flow last year latest developments indicate it s likely that fcf is going to come under pressure which led to some analysts even raising the question of a possible dividend cut but that seems rather unlikely from our point of view dividend distribution history author spreadsheet vod data management has reaffirmed its commitment to the â 0 09 year dividend policy but their stance on the issue sends a clear message dividend growth is likely out of the question for the short mid term yes so maybe just to frame how the board would think about the dividend we have a minimum commitment of eur 0 09 that was part of our midterm ambition we have been prioritizing deleveraging we have gone past the peak of 5g spectrum and liberty integration so that will support free cash flow we are doing a number of portfolio actions that will materialize synergy benefits et cetera if we complete everything that we want to complete clearly in the near term we have an energy hit but we have to look through that and when we look through it and let s say the exceptional inflation and we have the balance sheet effectively to absorb that if we look through it management still remains on the ambition of the midterm growth so we see the dividend intrinsically linked to that profile nicholas read ceo q2 2023 earnings call even though the company has engaged in some significant buy back programs in the past the results were mostly aimed at offsetting the share dilution originating from convertible bonds as a result the somewhat depressing valuation wasn t capitalized on by management whose almost sole focus is still placed on the efforts to deleverage the balance sheet shares outstanding tikr terminal iq capital data when asked about it during the latest earnings call management avoided providing a direct answer last year alone the company dedicated â 2 billion toward share buy backs and more than â 10 billion over the past decade but the overall results in this aspect lacked on capital allocation as you mentioned we have always indicated that our near term priority would be deleveraging and i think this is proving the right approach in the current macroeconomic conditions so you should expect us initially to allocate the proceedings towards further strengthening our balance sheet but we will form a full view on this once the transaction will have completed and the final proceedings will be set margherita della valle cfo q2 2023 earnings call valuing the telecom while it does remain true that vodafone is trading at relatively attractive multiples that do signal a possible value opportunity the depressed multiples also serve to embody the level of investor disappointment vodafone has garnered throughout the years in this context the sheer amount of equity erosion that has taken place is being actively priced into the company stock by investors over the past decade vodafone generated a negative 32 55 return for the same time period the average passive index investor managed to almost triple his principal even after the stark market spy decline this year this obviously does not take into account the dividends that were distributed over the period such as the â 1 02 major dividend after the company sold its verizon vz stake but does speak toward the sentiment surrounding the company vodafone and s p500 10 year returns seeking alpha with that being said we are not attempting to value vodafone back in 2012 but the company that it represents today as of today british based telecom does seem to be positioning itself well to be able to deliver above market returns over the upcoming period currently the market is valuing the company for an ntm ev ebitda of 6 44x ntm p e of 10 44x and an ntm p fcf of 6 44x as it offers an attractive dividend yield of 7 97 vodafone and industry peers tikr terminal iq capital data closing thoughts and arguments strictly fundamentally speaking it is somewhat hard not to conclude that vodafone represents an attractive investment opportunity from a value investor s perspective we can certainly recognize value hidden behind depressed multiples that could unlock along the way indicating a material upside potential but in our view catalysts for such an upside action are too far between the main issue we encounter with vodafone s current valuation is that the company is trading relatively in line with its us based counterparts such as at t t and verizon which possibly remains somewhat unwarranted in our view ultimately vodafone does offer a higher dividend yield accompanied by some strong upside potential if one is willing to accept the inherent risks associated with the investment but we remain unconvinced if the european telecom is a place in which given the market conditions one would be willing to take on such risks the bottom line is that we fail to recognize why the average income investor would opt to invest in the british based telecom instead of the already discounted american counterparts however for some international income investors vodafone could make a lot of sense given the right circumstances the slightly higher yield combined with the more lenient approach to the question of dividend withholding taxes from his majesty s treasury would make for a compelling argument further to the point we also fail to see a likely scenario where vodafone s valuation gets further depressed and opens the floodgates to an even more accelerated erosion of equity or a noticeable decrease in distributed dividends compared to its foreseeable cash generation potency making the company far from the worst investment opportunity for international income oriented investors
there s no doubt this is right perpetual s returns look better than they have in years boosted by a rotation to value and skamvougeras unique ability to use his influence and pressure to help force companies to make value accretive decisions from boral and brambles to tabcorp graincorp and iluka but equally it s impossible to separate the timing of skamvougeras sudden departure from the turmoil that has engulfed perpetual since chief executive rob adams announced the firm s merger with fellow asx listed fund manager pendal group including regal funds management s attempt to spoil that party by launching a separate bid for perpetual skamvougeras is yet to publicly comment on the pendal deal and did not deviate from that position on monday in perpetual s statement on his resignation he described his 18 years at the group split across two separate terms as truly rewarding and said he left with a strong team in place strong investment returns and fund flows building sign of discontent but within the small and close knit world of funds management in australia the sense that perpetual s equities team was deeply unimpressed by the pendal transaction has been growing stronger by the day skamvougeras departure will inevitably be read as the manifestation of this discontent advertisement to understand why this is the case it s important to understand what skamvougeras has achieved since replacing williams as head of equities in 2015 for most of his first five years in the job skamvougeras faced notable challenges three key challenges the first was the seismic shift in investor allocations from active stock picking to passive investing a trend that has put huge pressure on fund flows and fund manager fees australian fund managers have an extra challenge from the ever increasing size of superannuation funds which has allowed these institutions to take their investment management in house and away from stock pickers who had previously ridden this gravy train for all it was worth the second challenge was the changes at perpetual itself over the past 13 years which encompasses skamvougeras second stint at perpetual the equities team has lost two heads two deputy heads and one senior portfolio manager almost all of these stock pickers have gone on to start or join rival firms typically taking some funds with them advertisement skamvougeras third challenge was the market itself easy monetary policy since the gfc underpinned a rotation to growth stocks particularly in technology that made it difficult for a value manager in the australian market which is heavy on cyclicals and light on tech to outperform numbers from citi tracked the equities team s battle in the middle of 2017 60 per cent of perpetual s funds ranked in the top half of industry returns over one year and almost 90 per cent were in the top half of returns over five years but by 2019 only 20 per cent of perpetual funds were in the top half of industry returns over one year and less than 50 per cent over five years but skamvougeras stuck to both his value focused investment process and his combative style applying pressure to board and management teams aggressively if he thought they weren t delivering for shareholders shareholder activism it was skamvougeras who led the campaign for tabcorp to demerge its lotteries business it was skamvougeras who pushed boral to undo its ill fated push into the united states and for the stokes family to lift its takeover for the building materials group he helped cajole iluka to spin off its valuable iron ore mining royalty and helped put casino giant crown resorts in play leading to a rich takeover deal that succeeded despite a regulatory firestorm more recently it was skamvougeras who led the campaign against brambles 950 million move into plastic pallets in the us advertisement with interest rates rising and fomo markets a thing of the past perpetual s value focused style is delivering again the flagship perpetual australian share fund is now beating its benchmark over one two and three years with 92 per cent of equities strategies beating their benchmarks over three years but now skamvougeras the architect of that turnaround is on his way out the door to be replaced by deputy head of equities vince pezzullo a 26 year veteran of the firm lafitani sotiriou senior analyst at mst emerging and an outspoken critic of perpetual s merger with pendal says rob adams has spectacularly miscalculated the level of dissatisfaction inside perpetual s equities team about the pendal deal and now perpetual investments key man has walked for sotiriou the departure of skamvougeras is material enough to perpetual s fortunes that he believes the scheme of arrangement that facilitates the pendal merger may need to be delayed to allow pendal shareholders to consider the implications he even suggests that pendal could look to recut the deal given the perpetual team is a key part of earnings broadly the view inside the perpetual equities team is they have brought the same lens to perpetual s merger with pendal as they bring to any other deal big acquisitions and mergers deserve intense scrutiny advertisement the idea that the board would give adams the green light to do a massive acquisition when there are still questions about his previous deals most prominently the 2020 acquisition of barrow hanley which has seen assets under management fall by about 20 per cent in the last 12 months is something that perpetual s stock pickers are said to be struggling to get their heads around and skamvougeras departure would appear to suggest their views are not making much of an impact on the thinking of the board succession plan skamvougeras can feel pleased that he leaves perpetual s equities team in good shape having lifted returns got fund flows going the right way and developed a succession plan that has been heartily endorsed by the leadership team and board given he will be replaced by his deputy but the implications of his departure for adams and the pendal deal are less clear as sotiriou asks will other equities team members also leave and could this threaten the make up of the deal advertisement perpetual insiders are relatively relaxed about this prospect particularly as the court approvals that kick off the scheme of arrangement are imminent in a note to clients sotiriou suggests that one solution to the hot mess that the perpetual pendal deal has become may be a break up pendal could get perpetual s international business regal could get perpetual s australian business and there would be natural buyers for perpetual s trust and private clients divisions a lot of water would need to go under the bridge for something like this to eventuate but it might just be the sort of value accretive deal that perpetual s stock pickers love

markets while most of the money making trades of 2022 have been spun into reverse with stocks and bonds re correlating and rallying whether it s the time of year or recession uncertainty few seem inclined to chase the risk rally still there is growing recognition that the consensus view of recession and earnings downgrades could face mitigation from declining inflation a lower usd lower volatility and the acknowledgement of having to buy early could improve the risk outlook china remains hotly debated and polarising on a cross asset performance basis the trade is viewed positively through an equity lens but not so much for the currency or oil markets bears fear a prolonged property downturn and an inability to kickstart growth like in the past given debt levels while others think reopening is but a formality and will be catalyzed by the world health organization downgrading covid to an endemic oil crude oil prices collapsed further during friday s new york session before recovering into the nymex close as the correlation disconnect kicked in the recent extreme downside in oil is quite head scratching for many who were seriously wrong footed given that china has removed some of the covid 19 restrictions which should drive up demand however the keen driver of the prompt downside momentum is the growing unease that china will not loosen covid lockdown policies because infections are rising again and while correlation traders algos may have thought the move was too large and went too far compared to other china sensitive assets price action suggests portfolio investors have abruptly reversed course dumping the china reopening plays in favour of the consensus coalescing around a likely recession next year oil prices will bear a significant brunt if such a regime shift plays out calendar spreads are falling consistent with a recession in europe and china the us yield curve is inverted more now between two year and ten year maturities than at any time since september 1981 in addition to recessionary fears building and some physical grade softening the market is viewing us immunity for the crown prince and prime minister of saudi arabia as a precursor for more oil from saudi arabia although saudi is already pumping close to its maximum levels

chinese president xi jinping at the 17th summit of the group of 20 g20 in bali indonesia on november 15 xinhua indonesian people and global citizens hope the leaders refrain from using the precious moments during the summit simply as opportunities to criticize and attack one another one week before the 17th group of 20 g20 heads of state and government summit kicked off in bali kornelius purba senior editor of indonesia s english newspaper the jakarta post published an article titled g20 leaders please don t come to bali just to quarrel advising leaders unwilling to work together to address the world s economic and security conundrums to at least lower their ego as not to worsen the suffering of many people across the globe against this backdrop the g20 bali summit took place on november 15 and 16 it was the second in person meeting of the leaders of the world s major economies since the onset of the covid 19 pandemic following the virtual 2020 and hybrid online offline 2021 summits this summit would probably be the most divided and most uncertain summit to date xu feibiao deputy director of the center for brics and g20 studies at the china institutes of contemporary international relations told beijing review before the summit since late february major events under the g20 framework including ministerial meetings and working group meetings have had difficulties coming to a common statement or declaration even less sensitive issues such as tourism recovery have resulted in opposing emotions this is very rare in history xu said adding the international community at one point even worried the summit would encounter the same obstacles and not be able to issue a joint leaders declaration but the outcomes far exceeded original expectations as the participating leaders reached concrete and pragmatic consensus on several issues â we will take coordinated actions to advance an agenda for a strong inclusive and resilient global recovery and sustainable development that delivers jobs and growth the g20 bali leaders declaration read global society can indeed be said to have come to an inflection point a relatively successful g20 summit at this time can make history jia wenshan an academic member of the institute for global cooperation and understanding under peking university and distinguished professor at shandong university explained to beijing review common crises created in 1999 the g20 is an informal forum for international financial and economic cooperation it comprises 19 countries plus the european union its member countries are argentina australia brazil canada china france germany india indonesia italy japan mexico russia saudi arabia south africa tã¼rkiye the republic of korea the united kingdom and the united states with the exception of russia mexico and brazil 17 g20 leaders gathered in bali to discuss potential solutions for a series of imminent crises facing the world today a dizzying array of issues ranging from hunger to nuclear threats any of these calamities on their own would have constituted a big deal in the past decades but when all these unfavorable factors are superimposed no country is able to solve the problems single handedly anymore above all global economic recovery is facing enormous challenges on october 11 the international monetary fund released its latest world economic outlook report once again downgrading its forecast for the global economyâ with a sharp warning the worst is yet to come and for many people 2023 will feel like a recession the agency also pointed out that it expects global growth to slump to 2 7 percent next year with a 25 percent probability it could fall below 2 percent along with this gloomy outlook global economic governance is no longer working properly some developed economies have aggressively raised interest rates to solve their own inflation problems and in doing so have destabilized the global financial market and put enormous pressure on emerging markets and developing countries last but not least the pandemic is a wake up call for the world to create a more resilient medical supply chain countries everywhere are emerging from the haze of covid 19 and gradually returning to normal production modes and lifestyles nevertheless the healthcare infrastructure in developing countries is still weak and unable to cope with new global infectious diseases that may emerge in the future according to a recent world health organization survey as of january 13 less than 40 percent of the population in 88 of its member countries had been vaccinated in 36 of them this number even stood below 10 percent a joint response to challenges is the original intention of the g20 after the outbreak of the asian financial crisis in 1997 the group of seven industrialized countries namely canada france germany italy japan the united kingdom and the united states proved they were no longer able to dominate the global economic agenda in 1999 the g20 was created as a meeting mechanism for the members finance ministers and central bank governors and it was upgraded to an annual summit of leaders on the initiative of the u s following the financial tsunami triggered by the american subprime mortgage crisis sweeping through the world in 2008 today the g20 has evolved into a multilateral platform connecting the world s major developed and emerging economies together its members currently represent more than 80 percent of the global economy 75 percent of international trade and 60 percent of the world population we have no other option collaboration is necessary to save the world indonesian president joko widodo said at the summit s opening ceremony as g20 chair this year indonesia opted for the theme recover together recover stronger listing global healthcare architecture digital transformation and energy transition as its three priority issues all three topics are closely related to the economic and social recovery that is of concern to all countries in the pandemic s aftermath xu liping a researcher with the national institute of international strategy said in an interview with global people a comprehensive political journal in china the current situation of the world economy is similar to that in 2008 the risk of an economic and financial crisis exists xu feibiao said elaborating it is necessary for all countries in the world to jointly rise to the occasion in the short term it is imperative to work together to defuse financial risks and promote economic stability in the long run the international community needs to boost economic structural reform enhance sustainable development improve global economic and security governance and build a fair and equitable international order global recovery depends on the shared understanding of the interdependence of actions effectively steering the world s economies he pointed out the g20 2022 logo outside the summit s main venue in bali indonesia

prerequisite for economic development and economic growth and cooperation in turn can promote geopolitical stability wrangling over the russia ukraine conflict dominated the bali summit the conflict s impact on the global economy is two fold on the one hand russia is a big oil and gas exporter europe is heavily dependent on russia s energy and the imposed western sanctions on russia directly led to the current world energy crisis on the other hand both russia and ukraine are important grain suppliers and their grain exports have been greatly affected by the continuing conflict wang xiaowei a research fellow with the european studies center at the china university of political science and law told beijing review wang said the importance of the g20 to russia is on the rise compared with the brics or the shanghai cooperation organization the g20 is one of the few platforms for russia to have a direct dialogue with western countries although russian president vladimir putin did not travel to bali russia was not absent from the gathering during the summit russian foreign minister sergei lavrov had brief talks with german chancellor olaf scholz and french president emmanuel macron and

advertisement disney has fired its ceo bob chapek following a series of errors and woke controversies that cratered the firm s share price it has sensationally replaced him with his retired predecessor bob iger the company s board of directors tabbed iger to replace chapek sunday night the wall street journal reported putting an end to the ceo s reign the shakeup comes as an abrupt return to power for iger who prior to stepping down as ceo in february 2020 had served as disney s head exec for more than 15 years iger 71 had handed chapek the keys to his kingdom after a slew of false starts that saw him continue to steer the company for more than two years after airing plans to retire reportedly to the frustration of a waiting chapek at the time iger who caused ructions on his way out by forcefully speaking out against florida s so called don t say gay bill asserted his retirement was permanent and that he would not return to the role now it seems as those words were somewhat wayward with iger set to again take the reins it comes as the company has seen its share price plummet under chapek who earned a salary of 26 million in 2021 the company s poor performance under chapek has been blamed on a variety of factors disappointing financial results large losses in the streaming business and chapek s mishandling of the company s response to ron desantis don t say gay bill the bill limits lgbtq discussions in florida schools for students in the third grade and below under chapek disney also faced a backlash over a lesbian kiss in kids movie lightyear and a transgender man buying tampons in tv series baymax those productions were likely signed off during iger s tenure iger has worked for disney for more than four decades with 15 of those years coming in the company s hot seat which is now hotter than ever bob iger is now the ceo of disney after he quit the role in february 2020 replacing his underperforming protégé amid plummeting share prices susan arnold chairman of the board announced the change in a statement sunday night in which she thanked chapek 62 we thank bob chapek for his service to disney over his long career including navigating the company through the unprecedented challenges of the pandemic the statement read iger also shared a statement of his own about his excitement at returning but made absolutely no mention of chapek

further over the past year when many experts posited it would recover since losing more than 10billion during the pandemic shares of the company have fallen about 41 percent so far this year as of friday s close the stock hit a 52 week low on november 9 less than two weeks before the company s shock announcement where brass asserted that iger is uniquely situated to lead the company through this pivotal period former disney ceo bob chapek said he initially chose not to speak out against florida s don t say gay bill to balance the needs of customers and employees the press release cited that iger already has the deep respect of disney s senior leadership team also influencing the company s decision according to the statement was iger s illustrious career at the entertainment giant that saw him build it into one of the world s most successful and admired media and entertainment companies it further cited the re crowned ceo s strategic vision focused on creative excellence

was revealed he earned 66million a year about 1 000 times the salary of a typical disney employee if i learned one thing from my years at disney he continued it is that even in the face of uncertainty perhaps especially in the face of uncertainty our employees and cast members achieve the impossible the notice added that staffers would be hearing more about the shifting arrangement and what it entails in the coming weeks in the meantime iger wrote allow me to express my deep gratitude for all that you do shares of disney have fallen about 41 so far this year as of friday s close the stock hit a 52 week low november 9 no additional details about the shift were provided by iger or the company which has battled a slew of controversies over the past year amid its changing power structure

customer base would see the company nix phrases ladies and gentleman boys and girls during shows at disney world s iconic magic kingdom other rides such as the jungle cruise a staple of disney s theme parks for nearly 70 years got an overhaul to address years of complaints that it offered a racist view of indigenous people as uncivilized savages decisions reportedly made without iger s input chapek landed in hot water last spring when he took no public stance on ron desantis don t say gay bill which barred schools from discussing sexuality or gender with children between kindergarten and third grade chapek was criticized for not condemning the bill and tried to quell the backlash with a backtracking statement to staff pictured disney employees in california rallying against the bill on march 22 the company s lightyear spinoff also drew backlash after it showed a same sex kiss between two characters a scene insiders said chapek initially took out but reinstated following complaints from offended staff insiders at the time described a rift forming between iger and chapek with the former mentor reportedly growing increasingly frustrated with his protégé s decisions made without his or others input calls chapek made without the chairman s blessing according to the outlet included a dramatic reorganization of the company in october that saw 28 000 theme park staffers laid off to deal with accruing costs spurred by pandemic related closures and a shift in focus to the company s streaming service disney they also included the revelation of actress scarlett johansson s 35 million salary for starring in marvel movie black widow bob chapek s disasters as disney ceo july 2021 bob chapek gets the blame when a feud erupts after actress scarlett johansson sues disney accusing it of breach of contract in a dispute over the release of black widow former ceo bob iger is reportedly embarrassed by disney s approach to the suit march 2022 chapek faces a backlash from disney staff for failing to criticize ron desantis s don t say gay bill he eventually speaks out but is then bruised by a public battle with the florida governor march 2022 employees furious about the handling of the florida bill claim that disney execs censored overtly gay affection in recent movies the company backtracks on some of those decisions reinstating a kiss in the toy story spinoff lightyear june 2022 chapek ousts peter rice the well respected chairman of entertainment and programming the hollywood reporter says insiders are baffled by the decision this stuns me says one executive november 2022 costs at disney s streaming business are blamed for weaker than expected fourth quarter earnings shares continue to tumble before chapek is ousted advertisement the huge payday was leaked after johansson sued over the movie s release on disney rather than at movie theaters alleging she was being stiffed and underpaid when compared to her male counterparts the conflict reportedly embarrassed iger sources told nbc who remarked that while no longer ceo the company chairman still prided himself on the company s relationships with a list talent most importantly however chapek was criticized for not condemning desantis parental rights in education act dubbed by detractors as the don t say gay bill he moved to try and quell the backlash which eventually gave way to a backtracking statement from disney to staff declaring its opposition to the bill in the memo chapek said i want to be crystal clear i and the entire leadership team unequivocally stand in support of our lgbtq employees their families and their communities iger at right with chapek in september whose reign was largely unmarred by such disputes notably took a public stance against the bill leading to a rift between him and his handpicked successor we are committed to creating a more inclusive company and world weeks prior iger whose reign was largely unmarred by such disputes notably took a public stance against the legislation several longtime disney staffers said chapek s handling of the situation led to the worst week they ve ever had working at the company deadline reported at the time according to the outlet sources close to the company at the time said that employees were calling iger to air complaints and their dissatisfaction with chapek chapek meanwhile remained adamant that the company could better advocate for inclusivity through its increasingly woke content and by working with legislators behind the scenes an internal memo sent to staffers during those struggles revealed the memo s revelations however were met with outrage by senior staff who called chapek s decision weak and disappointing chapek later was forced to apologize in march he publicly decried the bill and announced disney had paused all its political donations within florida where disney world has operated for more than a half century chapek explained that he wanted disney to be a brand that could rise above the political fray and serve as a beacon of optimism and harmony in the world what we try to do is be everything to everybody chapek said at the time that tends to be very difficult because we re the walt disney company we certainly don t want to get caught up in any political subterfuge but at the same time we also realize that we want to represent a brighter tomorrow for families of all types regardless of how they define themselves he said the company s lightyear spinoff also drew backlash after it showed a same sex kiss between two characters a scene insiders said chapek initially took out but reinstated following complaints from offended staff after chapek announced the halting of florida political donations in his apology florida governor desantis responded by beginning the legislative process of stripping away disney s special zoning status known as the reedy creek improvement district which allowed it to save billions in tax dollars over the years this rapid surfacing of these controversies would contribute to the company s failure to rocket back to its former wealth this year as wall street had expected as well as tensions between iger and chapek who once the best of friends were reportedly not even on speaking terms at the time of chapek s succession late last year tension between the pair was palpable at a going away party for iger held at his posh los angeles estate in brentwood at the gathering which saw roughly 50 guests most of them disney staffers iger spoke at length about his time at disney in front of the crowd spending more than 10 minutes praising former colleagues however noticeably absent from the exec s songs of praise was chapek who iger barely mentioned sources told nbc it was extremely awkward said one of the guests who asked to remain anonymous because the party was private the tension was palpable according to the insiders iger now regrets how the changing of the guard has transpired but the exec has so far remained adamant that he s not returning to disney telling the times in january i was ceo for a long time you can t go home again i m gone walt disney world s magic kingdom sits deserted in july 2020 neither disney nor iger have offered an explanation behind chapek s apparent dismissal chapek has also yet to comment on his apparent ousting iger had personally handpicked chapek to succeed him in 2019 before stepping down late last year their rift according to insiders was said to have caused issues for chapek who sought to ingratiate himself among other disney executives who remained loyal to iger because of his glittering tenure at the helm of the entertainment giant chapek s subsequent mismanagement of the don t say gay scandal seemed to only worsen the situation with iger reportedly unhappy by his successor s weak flip flopping response neither disney nor iger have offered an explanation behind chapek s apparent dismissal chapek has also yet to comment on his apparent ousting

inflation data also indicates that the federal reserve s rate hiking cycle is doing its job even though the labor market remains resilient stoltzfus said retail sales data showing a resilient consumer

acting like the central bank is moving even faster san francisco fed president mary daly said monday that s important she added because the relationship between the actual fed funds rate and what daly called a proxy rate on the actual impact of the fed s moves can help tell policymakers when they need to stop raising interest rates as we make decisions about future rate adjustments it s going to be increasingly important to remain conscious of this gap between the printed funds rate and the proxy funds rate she said if we ignore this gap it raises the chance of tightening too much this overcorrection that we want to avoid daly said san francisco fed research shows that the proxy rate is more like 6 compared to the fed funds rate range of 3 75 4 the proxy rate takes into consideration public and private borrowing rates and credit spreads among other things markets expect the fed to raise its benchmark interest rate another 0 5 percentage point in december then increase a few more times in 2023 until the funds rate hits around 5 5 25 daly has said she also expects the fed funds rate to hit around 5 and remain high until inflation starts coming down jeff cox

going forward financial markets are at a crossroads as narratives build up around two very different outcomes that depend on data prints over the next few months as well as the reaction function of central banks especially the fed strategists led by ritesh samadhiya said in a note monday the first is a benign outcome where the fed executes a soft landing by cooling inflation without pushing the unemployment rate too high the other relatively gloomier scenario is one of a global recession which suggests further potential downside to risk assets the note said the high likelihood for both as suggested by leading indicators hints at a middle of the path outcome that could see markets range bound in the near future michael bloom fred imbert consumers appetite for credit cards rises refi

the fed goldman sachs economists think the federal reserve can bring inflation under control without causing a recession that doesn t mean there won t be pain the wall street firm still expects a weak economy ahead but it could be limited as the early signs so far suggest the central bank can achieve its hoped for soft landing the initial steps along this path have been successful but there is much further to go in 2023 goldman economist david mericle said in a client note over the weekend we expect another year of below potential growth and labor market rebalancing to solve much but not all of the underlying inflation problem unlike consensus we do not expect a recession goldman sees gdp growth of just 1 or so in 2023 a looser labor market and lower wage growth that all will come as the fed raises interest rates a few more times taking its benchmark borrowing rate to a range of 5 5 25 from the current range of 3 75 4 one reason for the firm s optimism is it sees inflation in its current form as not as bad as in the early 1980s the last time it was this high with some factors likely to abate on their own in the months ahead achieving a soft or at least softish landing is in large part a question of calibrating policy tightening correctly and while this isn t easy it has gone well so far this year mericle wrote jeff cox rail workers move closer to strike after one union rejects deal

last week the association of chartered certified accountants acca the foremost global professional accountancy body in its 118 year existence appointed 39 year old joseph opeyemi owolabi a nigeria born accountant the global president of acca for 2022 2023 a feat which makes him not just the first african appointed in that role but also the youngest to attain such height in this exclusive interview days after his inauguration he spoke on the strength of nigeria s banking systems how he emerged as the first african president of acca and his plans for the body the nigerian economy and other pertinent issues nume ekeghe presents the excerpts congratulations on becoming the global president of acca please give us a background on yourself and how you rose to this position i was elected the global president of acca and chairman of its board on the 10th of november 2022 at the annual general meeting and council meetings in the united kingdom so acca is the association of chartered certified accountants it s a global accounting body that is the largest in the world we ve got members and students in 171 countries we have a quarter of a million members and about 550 000 students about 800 000 members and future members our purpose is to develop the accounting profession that the world needs which includes everything happening in the world from climate change to money laundering issues challenges around automation cybersecurity and all of that so what we want to do is provide the accountants we need today but more importantly develop accountants that would solve complex problems tomorrow please speak on your educational background work experience and how long it took you to get to this feat i schooled here in nigeria i was born in lagos and grew up in that part of lagos called computer village i attended primary school here until i attended the university of lagos for my first degree at the college of medicine where i did a medical science program i started my career with zenith bank here in lagos i wrote a number of exams and certifications i m a certified information systems auditor afterwards i moved on to pricewaterhousecoopers pwc where i wrote my acca exams and became a qualified accountant in terms of work experience i ve obviously done banking as i mentioned with pwc i did things around cybersecurity moved on to financial reporting and later had different other roles then with ernest young ey i started their climate change sustainability services and business practice i moved to australia some six years ago working with pwc in australia as a senior manager and then with deloitte as a director before i started my company called rubicola so rubicon is focused on climate issues raising money to fund sustainable development goals sdgs pretty much so anything that would help reduce the carbon footprint so think about solar farms and green buildings so rubicola is the first firm in africa to be approved by the chartered banker institute cbi in london for the verification of green bonds on how i got here i ve been a member since 2011 i used to teach i love imparting knowledge and helping the next generation of accounts and so that was where i started getting involved with the association i stood for election in 2014 to represent nigeria in london and did that for about a year then i stood for the global council and got elected in 2015 and i ve been on the council in different roles i got elected again as the first person from africa as vice president two years ago got elected last year as deputy and thankfully now president how old are you i m 39 and will be 40 in two months earlier you mentioned you had a banking background how would you assess nigeria s financial system i think it is strong i think we ve got one of the strongest financial services centres in africa so you know the likes of zenith and gtb and access bank have gotten awards from the financial times ft in london and all over the world around sustainability and more few years ago when sanusi was central bank governor there was a recapitalisation of about n25 billion or so which gave nigerian banks the bandwidth to be able to do transactions which also came with a number of acquisitions around africa so you ll find that most of these banks are in the west africa corridor some of them even in new york i think the banking services or financial services as a whole is strong there are obvious areas for improvement some of that include things like conduct so people complain a lot about being charged fees that they don t know what it is about so there s a concept around fees for charge meaning you charge fees for services rendered so that s an area that could be improved but i ve lived in australia i can tell you that the banking system in nigeria in terms of transactions if you do a transfer you get an alert immediately and i think that is innovative that s cutting edge can you elaborate on the concept of service fees so there s a concept for fees for service such that it is only fair that you should only charge customers for services that you ve rendered i m not saying that s the case but sometimes you hear complaints about people not understanding what they have been charged for and it s not just in africa or nigeria it is all over the world so what you find is that in some countries like the uk or australia recently the government will have a royal commission of inquiry so if there s a problem with a particular sector it could be financial service could be anything else telecoms the government set up that inquiry so in austria we just had that that means the government now goes to look at that sector in that case there could be issues around compensation so what forward thinking organisations would do is that they don t need to wait for a royal commission to happen but think about their fees and be sure you do that audit to be sure that your customers understand the fees and the fee structure for an accompanied service so people are getting n100 and charged for xyz and they don t understand or they just get it annually that could be what we call conduct let s digress from financial services this is an election cycle what should be the major conversation on the economy for the candidates presently i would love to say i m not a politician but you could argue that i m a politician but without necessarily going into politics because it s always a contentious issue i think leadership is what africa needs across the board be it national state or local government now is the opportunity for citizens to ask questions to not just ask questions to focus on pertinent issues and not just issues around where someone is from i m part of an association where we have members from 171 countries even though we have not had anybody from africa i ve had the opportunity to be leading this organisation because we have value i think the critical thing is to go back to our values what are important to us and when i talk about values not just about those nice things like respect courage all of that but values could be what you want to see you could think of that as values i think for us in nigeria come 2023 we need to think about what issues matter to us most is it security is it power or is it education then we need to hold our leaders to account and ensure that we put the right people in the right place to guarantee that as acca president what are you planning to bring to the table different from your predecessor and how long is your tenure in terms of tenure it is usually a three year journey vice deputy and president so my presidential year is just a year which just started this week already so probably 51 weeks left of that in terms of what i would do the council which is the highest level of governance within acca assesses the strategy we have till 2025 my focus is delivering that strategy working with council members and our board to deliver that strategy but my main theme for the year is to connect our community like i mentioned we ve got 171 countries where we ve got members or students so i will be interested in connecting our communities for collaboration so think about covid a lot of people felt isolated and as we are coming out of that now in the last year there are still challenges around how do we work from home is it hybrid do we stay in the office so connectivity is important the other part i would love to do is to inspire future accountants i just talk to you on summary of my journey and i m also conscious that i m probably younger than most of my predecessors so i want to use that opportunity to be able to inspire that hunger and ambition in the minds of young people to reach for their dreams how will you assess nigeria s borrowing and resource management especially fuel subsidy and fiscal position it is a tricky issue depending on whom you talk to there are always different views about that i think we can all agree on some common themes there and that governments around the world have gone into debt which is the truth because of covid 19 so whether nigeria s debt has been caused by covid or not is left for us to look at but the fact is that most governments around the world from the us to uk went into significant debt which i think is putting pressure on future generations it is not just in nigeria that people are concerned about debt there s a lot of concern around the world around going into trillions of dollars globally in terms of debt so there are different ratios as an account to look at such as debt to gdp ratio all of that i think that s what should drive the conversation and can we do better so it s not just about getting debt but what are we using debt for what is more important is how are we using those funds can the citizens get assurance that if we borrowed n100 billion for roads they actually go to roads those are the challenges borrowing should not be too much because whatever you borrow is not free money future generations would have to pay in terms of taxes and what have you and it also put strains on generations to come however we also know that government might not be able to fund everything so they need to borrow so as accountants we re interested in do you have internal controls to ensure that those funds go to the appropriate place if it is going to go to healthcare it should go to healthcare then how do you repay them back it s not just borrowing do you have cash flows that would help you repay those funds if you don t repay them sometimes those funds are against an asset and we ve seen in some countries where the lenders have come to potentially retrieve those assets could you elaborate more on nigeria s economy this is more on economics but from an accounting perspective the numbers speak for themselves some would argue that there s bandwidth there are opportunities to still borrow but in terms of performance indicators what you d use to know performance is things like the interest to revenue so how much are you paying on interest and how much of your revenue goes to that and these figures are alarming and troubling and we know that already it means that we need to be conscious of it we need to think about how do we also reduce costs so there s a lot of commentary around our cost of governance the senate and all of that do we need to streamline that to reduce the cost again as accountants we focus on ensuring that accountants are not just counters they also think about strategy you mentioned earlier that your firm has a footprint on climate and with nigeria not being able to utilise this fully how can nigeria assess more green bonds in the near future nigeria is one of those few countries in africa that has got an increase in the uptake of green bonds about seven or six years ago under the leadership of the stock exchange and former ministry of environment who is now the deputy secretary general of the united nations there s been a lot of need for assessment and setting up the nigerian green bond advisory council speaking to the market participants about it there has been a lot of activities and we are working with clients in that space and one of client is infracredit to help them in that journey there is still a long way to go but i think in africa and even around the world nigeria was the first sovereign to issue a green bond back in 2017 and that was the first one coming from a sovereign world to get a cbi certification and only the fourth in the world to be a sovereign bond so there s a lot of i think uptick coming from this market there is still a long way to go but i think there is a need and hunger in the market to have green bonds as another type of financial instrument for both lenders and borrowers is nigeria at a place where it s okay or how much should it aim to access through green bonds no country is okay there is some literature out there that says we need potentially probably about 30 billion or so every year in africa to be able to address climate challenges from floods to increases in temperature to deforestation and all of those things also even though you have the funds around there is also talk around how do you get the eligible assets so it s not just having the funds you can mobilise the funds but how do you get eligible assets to help you put forward to investors institutional investors and have you to benefit from how best can africa fund its infrastructure deficit in terms of the deficit there are many ways you can fix that deficit and one of that probably would be green bonds so some of that deficit will probably be fixed by raising green bonds and green bonds are bonds that will go towards sustainable development goals an example is addressing the power challenge some of that funds would be on projects that should be in power so can we package some of that projects and turn them into solar wind farms or hydro that would save the environment and potentially also attract investors that are interested in environmental social and governance esg today a lot of institutional investors foreign direct investments fdis are looking for those kinds of projects and we can package for them there are a lot of modular solar farms people are doing that you can also do and feed into the grid potentially reducing the cost of power the other part would also be looking at other classes of assets that can be used but i think predominantly that s a key one and so there s actually traction already in the market they are doing some things but potentially we need to get all states moving in the right direction lagos is thinking of issuing something like that why can t other states follow suit as acca president what would you bring to nigeria how would you make your presence felt in nigeria soon after my inauguration i jumped on a plane to be here because nigeria is a key market for us we are interested in developing future accountants for a long time but more importantly to participate in different policy formulation we make recommendations into the financial reporting council of nigeria frcn exposure draft so we are here helping and assisting with policy formulation and assisting with the development of accounts and our future accountant but more importantly my role is not just for nigeria so i represent everyone and just being in that role itself and being a force for the public good which is how we want to see ourselves

i am extremely concerned by what i am seeing in the housing market when the federal reserve decided that it was going to start aggressively hiking interest rates it was obvious that there would be a housing crash i repeatedly warned my readers that prices would start declining and that home sales would fall precipitously needless to say that is precisely what has happened in fact last week we learned that home sales have now dropped for nine months in a row home sales declined for the ninth straight month in october as higher interest rates and surging inflation kept buyers on the sidelines sales of previously owned homes dropped 5 9 from september to october according to the national association of realtors this is already the longest streak of declining sales ever recorded and this new housing crash is just getting started but of course what we have already witnessed has been pretty breathtaking according to zero hedge u s home sales in october 2022 were 28 4 percent lower than they were in october 2021 this monthly decline pushed the year over year drop in existing home sales to 28 4 its worst level since 2008 sadly things are likely to get even worse in the months ahead the following are 3 major factors which will make 2023 a historically painful year for the housing market 1 the federal reserve fed officials keep assuring us that interest rates are going to go even higher this is literally suicidal behavior but they are going to do it anyway even though they fully understand what this will do to the housing market in fact an economist at the dallas fed just published research which shows that u s home prices could soon fall by as much as 20 percent u s home prices could tumble as much as 20 as the highest mortgage rates in two decades threaten to trigger a severe price correction according to research from the federal reserve bank of dallas fed policymakers need to strike a delicate balance as they try to deflate the housing bubble without bursting it dallas fed economist enrique martínez garcía wrote in the analysis published this week 2 the employment market officials at the federal reserve also know that hiking interest rates even higher will cause unemployment to go up we have already seen major layoff announcements at large corporations all over the nation and now we can add carvana to the list carvana is laying off about 1 500 people or 8 of its workforce friday following a free fall in the company s stock this year a weakening used vehicle market and concerns around the company s long term trajectory according to an internal message first obtained by cnbc s scott wapner the email from carvana ceo ernie garcia titled today is a hard day cites economic headwinds including higher financing costs and delayed car purchasing he says the company failed to accurately predict how this would all play out and the impact it would have on our business if the fed continues to raise rates eventually millions of americans could lose their jobs and because the vast majority of americans are barely scraping by from month to month all of a sudden we could have millions of homeowners that are unable to pay their mortgages just like in 2008 and 2009 that would cause a catastrophic spike in foreclosures and the ripple effects would be absolutely devastating for wall street 3 underwater mortgages during the last housing crash millions of homeowners found themselves deeply underwater on their mortgages as home prices fell rapidly if home prices end up plunging 20 percent or more in 2023 we will once again have vast numbers of americans that owe far more on their homes than they are currently worth in 2008 and 2009 large numbers of people that found themselves in such a situation decided to simply walk away from their mortgages if the same thing were to happen again it would cause an extraordinary amount of pain for lenders so let us hope that such a scenario does not materialize unfortunately we continue to get more numbers that indicate that we are heading into a very serious economic downturn for example we just learned that the conference board s index of leading economic indicators has now fallen for eight months in a row the conference board s leading economic indicators index showed that conditions further deteriorated in october with the gauge down 0 8 from the previous month that follows a 0 5 decline in september the u s lei fell for an eighth consecutive month suggesting the economy is possibly in a recession said ataman ozyildirim senior director of economic research at the conference board meanwhile yet another survey has found that the vast majority of u s consumers are currently living paycheck to paycheck a new employee report said on friday that as many as 60 of u s consumers are living paycheck to paycheck the report a collaboration between data analysis pymnts and lendingclub said 55 of nearly 3 500 people surveyed said they have limited spending capacity and 49 are shifting their shopping preferences the report said that 66 of those living paycheck to paycheck have slashed spending most americans will not be dealing with the harsh economic environment that is ahead from a position of financial strength when things get really bad millions of people will suddenly not be able to pay their bills in particular i feel really bad for those that purchased homes at or near the peak of the market so many of them are going to end up losing those homes we may have been able to avoid another housing crash if our leaders had pursued much different policies but that didn t happen and now we are going to experience an immense amount of chaos in 2023 and beyond the federal reserve created the largest housing bubble in american history by flooding the system with money and pushing interest rates all the way to the floor now they are violently bursting that bubble and the months ahead are going to be extraordinarily painful for the housing market it is finally here michael s new book entitled end times is now available in paperback and for the kindle on amazon about the author my name is michael and my brand new book entitled

london the escalating sino american rivalry and the broader concerns about china s economy have caused western firms to reevaluate their operations there and rightly so given the uncertainty surrounding president xi jinping s economic policies and geopolitical intentions it may be time for investors and corporate leaders to consider scaling back their exposure to chinese assets and markets the events of the past year particularly xi s dogged refusal to ease his strict zero covid policy and his confirmation as china s first three term president have spooked global investors likewise xi s common prosperity agenda which aims to redistribute wealth from the wealthy to the poor and rein in the country s new business elite has been viewed as anti business and damaging to economic activity as part of his common prosperity campaign xi pledged that the authorities would reasonably regulate excessively high incomes and encourage high income people and enterprises to return more to society with this kind of rhetoric it is no wonder that china s stock market dropped roughly 20 per cent last year china s policies have also led to vast capital outflows and an accelerated sell off of chinese stocks according to the institute of international finance investors withdrew 7 6 billion from chinese equities last month along with 1 2 billion from the bond market of course investors reactions to economic trends and political developments depend on their portfolios diversification needs risk appetites and investment horizons but prudent investors and business leaders will use this opportunity to assess their portfolios risks and consider what to do about their china positions clearly the widening gulf between the united states and china and the broader shift towards deglobalisation will upend how multinational companies run their business specifically companies must rethink how they obtain financing hire across borders and allocate capital they should also consider centralizing procurement and building resilient supply chains what paths could investors reassessing their china exposure take one option is to divest from all of their chinese assets reducing their exposure to zero but reducing exposure to china is likely to be a protracted process whether it involves shrinking a portfolio of publicly traded chinese stocks or unwinding a private equity investment repositioning will also likely be complicated as sellers must find buyers in an already challenged valuation market moreover investors looking to unwind their chinese holdings must consider the effects on their taxes intellectual property rights and transfer pricing as well as many other stranded costs and corporate investors who have long been bullish on china would need to come to terms with the possibility that they might not have any exposure to china s economy when growth begins to pick up alternatively investors could accept their sunk costs write down the value of their investments and still retain some exposure to china in essence this would mean acknowledging that previous investments cannot be recovered while holding off on making new ones in the context of an equity portfolio a sunk cost approach would result in recorded mark to market losses leaving investors with the option of retaining their positions in the event of a market rebound similarly a corporation that owns a factory in china may write down its asset value but instead of shutting it down and writing it off entirely it could run it as a going concern without expanding output or making new capital commitments thereby maintaining a foothold in china when the economy finally recovers another option is to double down investors could not only hold on to their current china exposure but also take advantage of low valuations and market weakness to enlarge their chinese footprint but even in this scenario global investors would be wise to recalibrate their investment strategies by adding a local partner to minimise the risk of expropriation companies that decide to stay and increase their presence in china however could be forced to operate as ring fenced businesses this would likely complicate financial reporting and increase their regulatory burdens particularly in the face of rising trade protectionism and regional balkanisation ultimately however investors and corporations committed to investing in china must be innovative in how they do business in and with china they would need to reevaluate the governance and board oversight structures of new local entities that may trade only on chinese stock markets they would also have to rely on unconventional metrics since traditional measures such as macro statistics p e multiples internal rate of return sharpe ratios and volatility measures similar to the vix are less reliable in such a fast moving geopolitical economic and financial environment whatever choice they make western investors in china face a completely different economic terrain than the one in which they operated for more than a decade this shift reflects domestic multiple political developments but it also attests to a new geopolitical order in which china and the us compete for economic technological and military superiority in a rapidly deglobalizing world investors must consider their next moves carefully dambisa

report released on sunday the development came as the economic and financial crimes commission and nfiu officials said they had intensified their surveillance on campaign spending by political parties and their candidates ahead of the 2023 polls multiple efcc and nfiu sources said their personnel were carrying out a series of joint operations to close in on several suspicious spending by parties

meanwhile the punch reliably gathered that the efcc and the nfiu are jointly tracking the financial transactions of presidential governorship national and state assembly candidates the operation also includes focused scrutiny on top bankers who were suspected of enabling very important persons to transfer huge stash of money though 18 candidates are contesting the presidential poll there are indications that the agencies are focusing on the leading parties and their candidates based on their capacities to generate huge donations including illicit funds which could be laundered under campaign or election expenditures our correspondent had in an exclusive report in may revealed that the efcc had asked the independent national electoral commission to furnish it with the bank accounts and other financial details of the political parties in a letter signed by its director of operations michael wetkas the commission demanded a list of all political parties their designated bank accounts and any other information that could aid its investigation it also asked the managing directors of access bank plc and polaris bank to provide details of the 14 accounts operated by the all progressives congress and the peoples democratic party and another organisation believed to be connected to the opposition party giving an update on the ongoing intelligence operation on friday sources explained that the efcc and the nfiu were scrutinising the financial ebb and flow of money into the accounts of the leading candidates particularly those who command a huge financial chest a source stated the anti graft commission is serious about preventing candidates from using this election period to launder stolen public funds hence the security watch on top bankers including managers chief compliance officers and others in the operations department of financial institutions anyone who flouts the protocol on money laundering will be dealt with they financial institutions have been warned to report every suspicious transaction or movement of huge amounts of money in the remaining 100 days to the general elections apart from bank managers it was also learnt that the anti graft agencies had given the chief compliance officers of banks a strict directive to enforce the necessary protocol against money laundering in their respective financial institutions the compliance officers were expected to report suspicious transactions by political parties and their candidates to the nfiu and the efcc for action though this is a mandatory action required of banks primary mortgage institutions insurance companies microfinance banks merchant banks trustee and finance companies stockbrokers and development finance institutions there were suspicions that many operators had not been complying faithfully findings also indicate that the financial intelligence agencies were equally monitoring the bureau de change operators following reports that some of them were assisting politicians to clean up their looted funds when asked about the operation the efcc spokesman wilson uwujaren said i don t have such information now but i will find out and let you know however uwujaren did not respond to subsequent calls and sms on the issue experts back operations an intelligence and security consultant abuh adam said the efcc operation would help curb vote buying during the election he urged the efcc to expose and prosecute anyone found culpable adams noted the outcome is what matters to nigeria this will make people now or in the future conscious of how to use monetary inducement on people people might see it as a witch hunt but that is the right thing to do in america if politicians embezzle funds they don t go close to politics but in nigeria politics serves as a cover let those with illicit funds be identified exposed and prosecuted another security expert oladele fajana said to me it is a welcome development but my questions are will the right things be done at the end of the day will this be extended to the so called big political parties or will it end up as a witch hunt against some persons and their parties

latest faa pilot production data confirms supply continues to outpace demand the air line pilots association int l alpa has released new data from the faa that reportedly demonstrates that the united states is producing a record number of certificated airline pilots this year with more pilots in the market today than there are jobs available according to the faa 9 397 new commercial airline pilot certificates have been issued in the last 12 months exceeding airline analyst forecasts and airline pilot demand in addition the u s has roughly 10 percent more flight instructors than before the pandemic which will allow for increased pilot production in the future this is good news that everyone in our industry should be celebrating said capt joe depete alpa president the decision to invest in america s aviation workforce made in the darkest days of the pandemic continues to pay off with record pilot production numbers unfortunately special interest groups in washington d c continue to spread misinformation about the pilot ecosystem in an effort to weaken air safety standards and shortchange frontline workers the truth is airlines are making money hand over fist flying fewer hours and have more pilots than before the pandemic despite the ongoing strong growth in the number of pilots available in the united states some special interest groups continue to spread misinformation blaming profit driven service cuts on a lack of available pilots their real goal is to weaken proven pilot training safety standards so they can hire less qualified aviators for lower pay and benefits airlines cut or modify service to small less profitable communities while adding additional service to markets that are more profitable it has nothing to do with pilot supply or safety regulations pilots don t make corporate business decisions about what cities to serve it s the airlines that make those choices and it s all based on profitability and their bottom line added depete pilots are trained for life to get passengers to their destinations safely and we are as frustrated as the flying public at the airlines service cuts flight delays and cancellations and fatiguing schedules rather than trying to pass the buck and blame workers airline ceos should commit to forgoing stock buybacks and own up to their service shortcomings the most recent faa data continues to support that the united states is producing more than enough certificated commercial airline pilots to meet or exceed airline hiring demand and compensate for retirements over the past decade even as new and more rigorous pilot training standards were enacted to enhance safety
