earnings will grow between 6 and 7 investment officer predicts earnings growth for the s p 500 s third quarter should come out to between 6 and 7 according to brad mcmillan chief investment officer for commonwealth financial network that would be below expectations of 9 9 from earlier this summer but better than the current factset forecast of 2 4 he made that prediction because the economy isn t as bad as expected with a strong labor market and rebounding consumer spending but he remained wary of the impacts of inflation foreign exchange rates and the worker shortage on companies in the index all of these will weigh on earnings although likely not as much as currently estimated mcmillan said we will get a win here but probably not that big of a win the factset estimate would make for the lowest period of growth since the third quarter of 2020 when it contracted 5 7 he said this is a very healthy growth rate given current conditions and should help act as a cushion for markets

nascent signs of improvement in supply side conditions there has been no progress on inflation she said none of this is painless but the high inflation we are experiencing is already inflicting pain on many people mester added she said she is advocating an even higher trajectory for interest rates than the median outlook of other fed policymakers as she is concerned that the fed has not made progress in its inflation fight mester who is a voting member of the rate setting federal open market committee said the danger of doing too little to halt inflation is greater than the danger of doing too much that likely will slow growth jeff cox stocks rebound reversing earlier losses to trade higher the s p 500 and nasdaq posted large rebounds tuesday reversing earlier losses that pushed

iran is rapidly expanding its ability to enrich uranium with advanced centrifuges at its underground plant at natanz and now intends to go further than previously planned a confidential u n nuclear watchdog report seen by reuters showed on monday while indirect talks between iran and the united states on reviving the 2015 iran nuclear deal have stalled tehran has brought onstream an ever larger number of advanced centrifuges the deal bans it from using to produce enriched uranium these machines are far more efficient than the first generation ir 1 the only centrifuge that the deal lets iran use to grow its stock of enriched uranium iran has been adding them particularly at two underground sites at natanz and fordow that may be designed to withstand potential aerial bombardment the third of three cascades or clusters of advanced ir 6 centrifuges recently installed at the underground fuel enrichment plant fep at natanz has now come onstream said the international atomic energy agency report to member states diplomats say the ir 6 is iran s most advanced centrifuge iran has also quickly completed the installation of seven cascades that were either not finished or at a very early stage of installation on aug 31 monday s ad hoc report showed end august marked the last visit by inspectors mentioned in the iaea s most recent quarterly report those seven cascades one of ir 4 centrifuges and six of ir 2m machines were fully installed but not yet enriching monday s report said iran has also informed the iaea it plans to add an extra three cascades of ir 2m machines at the fep on top of the 12 already announced and now installed the report showed of those three extra ir 2m cascades installation has already started on two of them the report said the report also showed that all the centrifuges enriching at natanz were still producing uranium hexafluoride uf6 gas enriched to up to 5 but now they were being fed with natural uf6 that contrasted to the quarterly report issued in september that said on aug 31 the centrifuges were being fed with uf6 enriched to up to 2 it did not explain the change in 2018 then president donald trump pulled the united states out of the iran deal and re imposed sanctions against iran that the deal had lifted iran responded by breaching the restrictions on its nuclear activities imposed by the deal if the deal is revived iran will have to put its advanced centrifuges into storage diplomats say
example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video the nobel panel at the royal swedish academy of sciences in stockholm said the trio s research had shown why avoiding bank collapses is vital st louis former u s federal reserve chair ben bernanke who put his academic expertise on the great depression to work reviving the american economy after the 2007 2008 financial crisis won the nobel prize in economic sciences along with two other u s based economists for their research into bank failures bernanke was recognized monday along with douglas w diamond and philip h dybvig the nobel panel at the royal swedish academy of sciences in stockholm said the trio s research had shown why avoiding bank collapses is vital with their findings in the early 1980s the laureates laid the foundations for regulating financial markets the panel said financial crises and depressions are kind of the worst thing that can happen to the economy said john hassler of the committee for the prize in economic sciences these things can happen again and we need to have an understanding of the mechanism behind those and what to do about it and the laureates this year provide that bernanke 68 examined the great depression of the 1930s when he was a professor at stanford university showing the danger of bank runs when panicked people withdraw their savings and how bank collapses led to widespread economic devastation he was fed chair from early 2006 to early 2014 and is now with the brookings institution in washington before bernanke economists saw bank failures as a consequence not a cause of economic downturns diamond 68 based at the university of chicago and dybvig 67 who is at washington university in st louis showed how government guarantees on deposits can prevent a spiraling of financial crises probably the most gratifying thing for us is that policymakers actually seem to understand it and the insights that we had which are pretty simple could be used in the actual financial crisis diamond told the associated press in chicago he added that he was very happy and quite surprised to get the call when it comes to the global economic turmoil created by the covid 19 pandemic and russia s war in ukraine the financial system is much much less vulnerable to crises because of memories of the 2000s collapse and improved regulation diamond said in a call with the nobel panel the trio s research took on real world significance when investors sent the financial system into a panic during fall 2008 bernanke then head of the fed teamed up with the u s treasury department to prop up major banks and ease a shortage of credit the lifeblood of the economy he slashed short term interest rates to zero directed the fed s purchases of treasury and mortgage investments and set up unprecedented lending programs collectively those steps calmed investors and fortified big banks the fed also pushed long term interest rates to historic lows which led to fierce criticism of bernanke particularly from some 2012 republican presidential candidates who said the fed was hurting the value of the dollar and running the risk of igniting inflation later the fed s actions under bernanke extended the authority of the central bank into unprecedented territory they weren t able to prevent the longest and most painful recession since the 1930s but in hindsight the fed s moves were credited with rescuing the banking system and avoiding another depression and bernanke s fed established a precedent for the central bank to respond with speed and force to economic shocks when covid 19 slammed the u s economy in early 2020 the fed under chair jerome powell quickly cut short term interest rates back to zero and pumped money into the financial system the aggressive intervention along with massive government spending quickly ended the downturn and triggered a powerful economic recovery but the quick comeback also came at a cost inflation began rising rapidly last year and now is close to 40 year highs forcing the fed to reverse course and raise rates to cool the economy central banks around the world are taking similar steps as inflation erodes consumers spending power in a groundbreaking 1983 paper bernanke explored the role of bank failures in deepening and lengthening the great depression of the 1930s before that economists cast blame on the fed for not printing enough money to support the economy as it sank bernanke agreed but found that the shortage of money could not explain why the depression was so devastating and lasted so long the problem he found was the collapse of the banking system panicked savers pulled money out of rickety banks which then could not make the loans that kept the economy growing the result the nobel committee wrote was the worst global recession in modern history ben bernanke s 1983 paper was startlingly original and of enduring importance not in explaining how the great depression started but in explaining why it lasted so long said former fed vice chair alan blinder an economist at princeton university that insight has affected economists thinking ever since diamond and dybvig showed that banks play a crucial role in resolving a nettlesome financial problem savers want instant access to their money but businesses need time to see their ventures generate profits before they can repay loans in full in a 1983 paper diamond and dybvig explored the banks key role as intermediary between savers and borrowers they also found that banks are vulnerable if savers fear their bank is in danger of failing they will pull their money out forcing the bank to call in loans to raise money to cover withdrawals to stop bank runs and their economic fallout governments can insure deposits and act as a lender of last resort to banks the insight if you could prevent the panic then the banks would be fine said simon johnson an economist at the massachusetts institute of technology who has written about the financial crisis that s a very very powerful idea that underpins how people think about financial stability diamond also established in

your buyer s guide to the best new punk and hardcore releases from around the world returns for october with reviews of high vis long knife zero again and more homepage photo balcanes by sara roca people in punk hate it when their friends become successful this much is established but what they do like is when those friends make huge honking records fit to be blasted into rusty arena rafters everywhere while crucially not actually going on to do so well i like that at least when it ends up sounding like this month s first two albums were we to hackily call curb stomp earth beach impediment black water the record that portland s long knife always wanted to make this would be to pass over their earlier career where they wanted to make records that sounded like poison idea and very little else having established their prowess in that one discipline and also having joined up with poison idea drummer steve hanford in a spinoff band fetish the four piece s horizons have expanded here they move at brisk punk tempo but crib groove and swagger from classic rock radio metal and vintage soul to epic epochal effect normally it s no compliment to suggest an album feels longer than it is but long knife pack so much into these 13 songs that the 25 minute running time is worthy of a double take there are pianos and choirs on song intros guitar solos like thin lizzy if they d transformed themselves into a straight up nwobhm band sax parts as good as any to come out of american punk since rocket from the crypt sorry ska fans layers of synth that somehow lend both prog and garage touches simultaneously and is guitarist scott goto channelling while my guitar gently weeps on the curse or am i away with the fairies any road curb stomp earth is a play for the big leagues crucially not a shit or cynical one on a par with turbonegro s transition between ass cobra and apocalypse dudes fucked up s between epics in minutes and hidden world or yes poison idea s between war all the time and feel the darkness on the subject of fucked up their 20 year evolution has included albums whose guitar tones arrangements and production values gave the feeling of erstwhile hardcore kids with ambitions of being oasis here and elsewhere there s been a drip gradual sea change concerning the perception of that band in a punk context it s definitely got more acceptable to like them possibly because everyone in britain no longer gets force fed oasis songs every day this brings us to blending dais the second album by london group high vis which touts posi anthems for the downcast over a swirling sound built from many parts shoegaze big coat post punk 90s era dischord records and for sure the obscene self regard of gallaghers n and l but remains commendably dreamily out of reach when it comes to easy categorisation high vis relevance to this column then comes in large part from their members british and irish hardcore background vocalist graham sayle in tremors and dirty money guitarist martin macnamara in crowd control and frustration to give an incomplete list sometimes that coiled spring ire is audible on blending 0151 finds sayle uplifting his liverpudlian roots on a song that s like u2 and dinosaur jr hooking up for a blitz tribute lyrically the vibe is more often a late thirtysomething taking stock of a fitful life and realising that he has it in him to push upward that high vis couch things near perpetually in walloping choruses and savage hooks mean listeners especially those seeing them live can gloss over these depths now we all join hands and make a wall goes the stirring join hands its mbv sugar guitar noise suitably wall like itself and does anyone write a line like that without idle dreams of seeing a room of kids take them at their word if any kind of wall gets spontaneously erected while arma x are kicking it live expect it to be the of death type this madrid band have a truly crucial way with demonic straight edge hardcore thrash even by the standards of quality control who ve released their debut lp violento ritual this goes unrelentingly hard the quintet released a couple of demo tapes prior to this but this is in a different league as regards speed precision and sheer dynamic satisfaction opening track heavy straight edge all subsequent titles and lyrics are in spanish lasts all of 44 seconds and manages to blueprint arma x s steez with a chugtastic crossover thrash intro boisterous bass breakdown and a guitar solo that doesn t so much divebomb as swoop to conquer their other songs are longer the result landing somewhere between the cro mags slayer worshipping euromosh and the 90s cleveland metallic hardcore scene vocalist leo occasionally slips into a near rap like cadence as on the midsection of culpables de tu odio though naturally there s an unearthly breakdown and steel handled axe invasion right round the corner zanjeer s debut release a six song 7 inch on breton label symphony of destruction titled parcham buland ast is one of the year s more interesting hardcore punk releases now the music isn t the interesting part by which i mean it s really good snarling crust rammage with metal hints and japanese noisepunk genuflections fresh flesh for fans of say framtid or extended hell and all but one cut under 90 seconds more atypically zanjeer s members come from pakistan colombia the uk and germany the latter their current location you might know guitarist zuri from his time in bogota s muro drummer steve lucas from nottingham heavyheads beast as god or frontman hassan dozakhi from pakistan s punk and rap underground which would arguably make you more qualified than me to write this review i did though find out wholly by chance that on parcham s opening song hamdullah dozakhi references a couple of bars from his mc gig in hip hop trio daranti group pretty cool but you d hardly know it s the same dude here blowing his top with some urdu language invective that properly goes for it taliban murdabad translates as death to the taliban so you get the idea there ijtimayi bemaari concludes fuck my country fuck my motherland after targeting theocratic bullies and islamic zealots blaming the west to distract from their own failings ättestor and zero again have each had a couplathree releases before this split 7 inch offered me a convenient opportunity to appraise them together the ä to z of ignorance indifference and idiocy is co released by four labels carabrecol which mainly seems to be a vegan food pop up dead invoices diy koło and tns three less than the ättestor lp from earlier this year a brighton assembly ättestor are fronted by darren bourne of tadpole records include two members of unease whose possibly one off tape i reviewed a while back and play efficient bassline forward stuff that s a bit uk82 and a bit anarcho s conflict wing with maybe some crusty motörheadisms in there too zero again scattered between southwest england and south wales are named after a rudimentary peni song but sit a fair distance from soundalike territory though you might still hear flashes in the higher pitched parts of dean evans vocals and ian glasper s fast tricky basslines damaged goods opens as a gothic punk brooder that betrays their killing joke jones and finishes at breakneck pace and with manic fervour passing ritual is top gear for all its 80 seconds not zero again s first full on hardcore song but maybe their best to date leeds twosome belk had been going two years or so before i heard them off the back of drummer george chadwick making an ungodly racket in the reflecting skin the committee human worth belk s first 7 inch isn t quite that gnarly but it gives it a fair crack five songs again sub 90 seconders more often than not take the route of a lot of guitar drums noiserock duos by having alex pearson s guitar tuned to a decidedly rhythm friendly almost bass like pitch sludgy rockers big body and warm water hitch the heft of floor to the blether of someone like usa nails and that s cool but i m predominantly about the freakier thrashers on this ep with ache body relating a mental health patient s tribulations navigating the medical establishment the committee of the title over zigzag jazzcore nice packaging on this one too akin to some youth attack records singles more four way kitty pooling action has brought us the debut lp by balcanes from oviedo in spain s atlantic northwest of the labels involved flexidiscos humo internacional màgia roja and pifia it s the third of those helmed by victor hurtado of dame area that plonked gloria eterna in my line of vision balcanes are heady slurring sludge punk with industrial inclinations that come to the fore on abstract wipeouts like futuro and ciudad campamento but more often hunker down in a groove and frack away to the point of widespread structural instability sure bet adherents of the bum em out by playing slow musical philosophy la paz no durará is about as pacey as balcanes get keeping matters spanish it s on a comparable tip to that barrera ep i reviewed in february and that s overcome in its midsection by a storm of grotesque distortion to that end notorio arraigo might be this disc s most unfettered rager well up there with bloody head or the shits and though they pull the time honoured move of going jazz for the closing track the sax work by guest kiko flores on bona nit is less abrasive than most of what comes before dropped with suitably minimal warning the road to nuclear holocaust is the first release by ä i d s five swedes who ve easily notched a century of collective dinmaking before arriving at this eyeball melting climax the instagram page linked above in addition to claiming the name stands for anti ism dogmatic skepticism seems to have been doing cryptic teaser posts for the last two years but if you weren t hip to that you can still do the apocalyptic bodypop to this extraordinary 12 inch of electrofied crustcore ä i d s comprise wolfbrigade s johan erkenvåg i think another of their number features too but pseudonyms abound anti cimex founder member charlie claesson henrik palm of in solitude and plenty more and christian berg from malmö synthpop classicists kite so people whose teaming up is entirely on brand people who like a bit of everything and one genuine un scene misfit not sure who s playing what but the synth parts and programmed drums often imitate the rigid clatter of the d beat most of these guys are more closely associated with as well as younger digi punk bucks like l o t i o n blood on blood is the biggest break from this building from a d a f ebm industrial pop shakedown into a scuzzy metal epic that circle fans might dig sadistic gravity which follows it is a beatless noise sculpture such as might be waiting for you at the end of the world the most singular release of this column hands down running the above joint and just about anything else close on the singularity scale are mutated void from halifax nova scotia not yorkshire reputedly recorded on a four track and certainly sounding that way roses forever is their debut lp and if you fail as comprehensively as me to put these 14 jolts of blackened shit fi in a box you might still keep it pinned to your turntable iron lung its label call mutated void skate thrash and while i don t disagree in that it could soundtrack both skating and thrashing that term brings to mind two or three semi codified punk styles none of which resemble this cody googoo and ben radford both have a shedload of other halifax bands to their name together and apart and don t offer full credits here but ben s a drummer by trade so i m guessing the bestial goblin like black metal vox are cody s doing songs are sequenced with almost no interspersing gaps so you might miss the baton being passed between one minute short banger race and the next no bother backyards is a lengthy outlier at 109 seconds touching on melody in an early la hardcore sort of way and the dumdum rhythmic approach of isolate the city tips over into that bm gone oi sound typified by bone awl as rotten sounds go mutated void s is legit fresh and they seem like tireless lynchpins in halifax s punk and skate scenes alike oh and they have a 7 inch out seemingly concurrently with the lp and equally worth hearing churchgoers a fairly new london band are equally fast and scrappy on their seven song demo tape released through static shock if a little more cleancut all things being relative their name presumably references early 80s canadian teen hc blazers the neos and that kind of hyperspeed chaoticism is the sort of muck we re dealing with here songs as short as 19 seconds or long as 67 recorded with a lack of finesse by people who know exactly how this shit ought to sound mark maccutchan brings street level aggro on the mic while gear humpers variously found in the annihilated vile spirit and negative frame bring the gawky ruckus and do one inside six minutes churchgoers are gunning for a very specific hardcore nerd sound north americans trying to be the fastest band in the world before grindcore was invented basically but that s a swish niche from my perspective maybe yours too

in little more than a month the war in ukraine has turned abruptly from a grueling largely static artillery battle expected to last into the winter to a rapidly escalating multilevel conflict that has challenged the strategies of the united states ukraine and russia russia s launch of massive strikes on civilian infrastructure monday in about a dozen ukrainian cities far from the front lines brought shock and outrage the strikes which secretary of state antony blinken described as wave after wave of missiles struck children s playgrounds and public parks left at least 14 killed and nearly 100 wounded and cut electricity and water in much of the country by launching missile attacks on civilians sleeping in their homes or rushing toward children going to schools russia has proven once again that it is a terrorist state that must be deterred in the strongest possible ways ukraine s united nations ambassador sergiy kyslytsya said at the opening of a general assembly session scheduled before the assault to promote world condemnation of moscow the attacks were the latest of many head spinning events from ukrainian victories on the ground to russian president vladimir putin s threat of nuclear weapons use that have changed the nature and tempo of the war in recent weeks and raised questions about whether the united states and its partners may have to move beyond the concept of helping ukraine defend itself and instead more forcefully facilitate a ukrainian victory advertisement so far the u s supply effort has been deliberative and process oriented in the kinds of weapons it provides and the speed at which it provides them so as not to undercut its highest priority of avoiding a direct clash between russia and the west that strategy is likely to be part of the agenda at tuesday s emergency meeting of g7 leaders and a gathering of nato defense ministers later in the week u s officials continue to express caution about precipitous moves turning points in war are usually points of danger said a senior biden administration official one of several u s and ukrainian officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss policy deliberations you can t predict what s around the corner russian leaders have cited their own turning point viktor bondarev head of the foreign affairs committee of russia s upper house of parliament wrote in a telegram post on monday that the strikes were the beginning of a new phase of what the kremlin calls its special military operation in ukraine with more resolute action to come advertisement putin speaking early monday to his security council said the attacks were retaliation for what he called ukrainian terrorism including the blowing up over the weekend of the strategic crimean bridge that is a crucial logistics route for russian occupying forces in southern ukraine the bridge destruction for which ukraine has only indirectly claimed responsibility came after a steady stream of ukrainian gains that buoyed both kyiv and its western supporters in a surprise counteroffensive begun in early september ukrainian forces recaptured more than 1 000 square miles of russian occupied territory in the north east followed by other gains in the south the ukrainian victories along with persistent reports of poorly equipped and low morale russian soldiers who fled the onslaught abandoning equipment and leaving behind their dead brought public criticism of the conduct of the war from inside russia including from some senior putin advisers within days putin had called for the military mobilization of up to 300 000 civilians to bolster his failing forces the humiliation was compounded by a chaotic implementation and the fleeing of hundreds of thousands of military aged men across neighboring borders in what was widely interpreted as a reference to nuclear weapons putin threatened to use all means available to defend russian occupied territory even as he moved to annex four ukrainian regions i want to remind you that our country also has various means of destruction and when the territorial integrity of our country is threatened to protect russia and our people we will certainly use all means at our disposal he said on sept 21 this is not a bluff the mobilization and nuclear threats the senior administration official said were signs of two things putin does know how bad he s doing that was a question mark before advertisement two it s definitely a sign that he s doubling down that we re not close to the end and not close to negotiations those realities don t give anyone any great comfort here the official said rose gottemoeller a former senior state department official for arms control and nonproliferation issues and former deputy secretary general of nato said the use of nuclear weapons is a dead end it shows the final failure of policy if he s somehow driven into that corner gottemoeller said it s the final throwing of the dice thinking that somehow everyone will panic and all of their supporters will force the ukrainians to sue for peace i don t see that happening share this article share i think we have to take these threats very very seriously she said with the monday strikes inside ukraine putin was clearly trying to reclaim the initiative but also to bolster the image of a unified strategy and leadership in his security council remarks reported by russian media he said the missile attack had been fashioned and recommended by his defense ministry in accordance with the plan of the russian general staff he made particular reference to the role of defense minister sergei shoigu whose absence from public view in recent days had led to speculation that he had been fired advertisement for its part ukraine has long combined its profuse gratitude for western weapons aid with demands for stepped up delivery of more and more sophisticated supplies the counteroffensive on the ground brought calls for battle tanks to move into contested territory which the united states and its allies have been reluctant to send this week kyiv attached new urgency to sophisticated air defense systems a ukrainian official referring to a list provided by the senior military command said ukraine s priority items include the patriot surface to air missile system mim 23 hawk missiles attack drones and nasams national advance surface to air missile systems as well as israeli air defense systems ukraine s pleas found new resonance in some quarters of washington after the monday attacks with senior democrats in particular demanding that biden move more quickly to supply ukraine i am horrified by russia s depraved and desperate escalation against civilian infrastructure across ukraine including in kyiv senate foreign relations committee chairman robert menendez d n j said in a statement i pledge to use all means at my disposal to accelerate support for the people of ukraine and to starve russia s war machine advertisement rep elissa slotkin d mich a former senior official at the cia and the pentagon tweeted that the need for air defense is urgent given the scale of these attacks providing these systems is a defensive not escalatory step and our european friends need to step up along with us to get the ukrainians what they need but there was little initial sign that the administration intends to change the relatively lengthy approval process by which it decides what weapons to send to ukraine and when the process includes a u s analysis based on its own reporting of conditions on the battlefield of what ukraine needs a senior u s

an australian company that s developing a fungal product to help farmers fight climate change is expanding its brunswick based laboratory to a space nearly 10 times larger in south portland frank oly a co founder and the coo of loam bio in the state of new south wales on australia s east coast traveled to maine this summer to check out the 3 500 square foot space at 35 foden road and give the final go ahead on the move we think portland is a great location oly told mainebiz it s close to the biotech hub in boston so there s a lot of talent and technical knowledge in the area we also think that with the great quality of life that maine has to offer we will be able to attract international talent i m really excited about expanding our operations to the area image courtesy loam bio fungal samples are tested for microbial soil sequestration one of the most elegant carbon removal solutions says loam bio s founder loam bio s north america bioprocessing manager and the lab s lead scientist cassandra o brien was integral to the search for a new space to build out the lab sasha bogdanovics of the boulos co and justin lamontagne of the dunham group brokered the deal it s pretty cool that they chose maine said bogdanovics who represented the tenant elegant carbon removal microbial soil sequestration promises to be one of the most elegant carbon removal solutions as it is quick globally scalable and provides huge benefits for growers loam bio s website says a farmer coats their seeds with the microbial inoculum before sowing and the plants and the microbes work together to build carbon in the soil and keep it there the company says that building soil has additional benefits such as increased soil health and nutrient rich crops and higher yields microbrial library loam bio started in 2019 in australia as an offshoot of a new south wales nonprofit called soilcquest 2031 a grassroots research institute of scientists farmers agronomists and educators that has a mission to help double the world s on farm carbon stocks by 2031 image courtesy loam bio from left cassandra o brien katherine lysak megan hall and dillon holton at loam bio s techplace lab the initiative was born out of the recognition that there is an urgent global need to reduce emissions and draw down gigatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to limit climate change and reverse global warming soilcquest s website says the goal is to integrate agricultural landscape resilience and productivity with carbon sequestration and environmental enhancement researchers at loam bio work with a diverse microbial library to develop new products which are at the intersection of climate and agriculture according to its website the company has developed a microbial seed coating that increases the quantity and stability of carbon being built in agricultural soils loam s products are backed by research and farm trials techplace startup loam bio s north american headquarters is in st paul minn its north american bioprocessing laboratory has been in shared bio lab space at brunswick landing s techplace since march 2021 said o brien who connected with loam bio as a specialist in fungal fermentation who once worked for a boston mass firm called indigo which has a similar mission image courtesy loam bio in addition to the ability to sequester carbon the fungus must have a good relationship it s expected that loam bio s pilot scale lab at 35 foden road will be built out by april 2023 the new location itself is advantageous as companies look to move north from boston o brien said we re trying to take advantage of that bio tech movement she said harvesting fungus so what does microbial soil carbon sequestration mean we harness fungal organisms from nature and put them through a series of genetic and laboratory screenings to see which ones will most likely promote soil carbon sequestration o brien said the way that works is we introduce them to agriculture spaces alongside crops like corn soy or cotton the idea is that the fungal organisms share a symbiotic relationship with the plants as the plant photosynthesizes and harnesses co2 from the atmosphere the fungal organism introduced to the plant will also capture that carbon she continued basically that carbon associates with mineral structures in the soil which enables the carbon to remain stable in the soil for a long period of time the idea is that the fungal organisms share a symbiotic relationship with the plants the company collaborates with farmers to monitor the amount of carbon being sequestered by the fungus throughout the growing season image courtesy the dunham group loam bio is leasing a 3 500 square foot space on the right side of 35 foden road where the left condo is owned by agren appliance the captured carbon is viewed as a kind of second crop that can be sold as carbon credits with the farmer earning most of the proceeds of the carbon credit sales and loam bio taking a percentage the maine lab grows the fungus that is found through a process called bioprospecting going into nature collecting plants isolating microbes from the plants and identifying what the microbes are through a genetic coding process that helps researchers predict whether they would be viable for soil sequestrations that s followed by lab procedures designed to ensure the fungus is safe for particular crop plants then to figure out how to grow the fungal organism every strain is different and requires different nutrients o brien said we have to put it through screening to figure out the best way to grow it at scale loam bio is still in the advanced field trial stage in the us we re not on the market quite yet as a product but our australian branch is preparing for a commercial rollout o brien said the company contracts with research farms around the globe that help with field trials the company has homed in on several different strains that are expected to have a good chance of having a positive impact on soil carbon sequestration in addition to the ability to sequester carbon the fungus must have a good relationship with the plant it s colonizing and cohabitating with at techplace the lab has about 500 square feet and four employees including o brien at 35 foden road the space will be expanded to 3 500 square feet the whole point of this build out is so that we can expand our team our production capacity and our research and development capacity she said this expansion in south portland will allow us to have the space and flexibility to explore exciting new technology that could help change the course of global warming another condo at 35 foden road is owned and occupied agren appliance a family owned appliance and mattress company

wall street plummeted on oct 7 as the federal reserve remained determined to hike rates indicating that inflation will persist against this backdrop it is necessary that investors carefully choose stocks that are sustainable to this end we recommend stocks like total energies tte amalgamated financial amal titan machinery titn otter tail ottr and pbf energy pbf which bear low leverage and therefore can shield investors from incurring losses in times of crisis now before selecting low leverage stocks let s explore what leverage is and how choosing a low leverage stock helps investors in finance leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same such borrowings are done through debt financing but there remains an option for equity finance this is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing however debt financing has its share of drawbacks particularly it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate so to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio one should always avoid companies that resort to excessive debt financing therefore the crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt as a debt free stock is almost impossible to find such an event shows how volatile the equity market can be at times and as an investor if you don t want to lose big time we suggest you invest in stocks which bear low leverage and are hence less risky to identify such stocks historically several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears the debt to equity ratio is one of the most common ratios analyzing debt equity debt to equity ratio total liabilities shareholders equity this metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears a lower debt to equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company story continues with the third quarter earnings cycle coming soon investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past but if a stock bears a high debt to equity ratio in times of economic downturn its so called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare the winning strategy considering the aforementioned factors it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt to equity ratio to ensure steady returns yet an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome to choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors here are the other parameters debt equity less than x industry median stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers current price greater than or equal to 10 the stocks must be trading at a minimum of 10 or above average 20 day volume greater than or equal to 50000 a

commentary china s yuan has slid against the dollar three things account for this 1 interest rates in the united states and elsewhere are rising while rates in china are declining 2 although all economies are slowing and indeed seem on the verge of recession china s economic and financial problems seem more fundamental and present greater uncertainties 3 geopolitical troubles especially in europe but also in asia are driving money into the relative safety of the dollar all these pressures seem set to persist and weigh on the yuan in the process china s economy will become more export dependent than ever not at all what chinese leader xi jinping wants foreign exchange movements have been striking to say the least since mid august the euro has dropped almost 8 percent against the dollar and britain s pound sterling has declined almost 10 percent at one point hitting a four decade low japan s yen has dropped about 8 percent against the dollar hitting lows not seen since the last century china s yuan has declined more or less in line with these other currencies recording almost a 6 percent slide against the dollar since early august the most immediate influence has come from interest rate differentials world markets are awash in highly mobile amounts of cash that flow quickly in the direction of the highest interest rates since last march the federal reserve fed has raised the benchmark rate paid in dollars by some 3 percentage points that exceeds measures taken by the european central bank ecb which to date has only raised its benchmark rate some 1 25 percentage points it also exceeds the bank of england which has raised its benchmark rate by some 2 0 percentage points with china the difference is even starker while the fed has raised dollar interest rates the people s bank of china pboc has actually cut yuan based interest rates albeit only modestly the difference has created a pull away from the yuan and into dollars it no doubt would have been more dramatic except that china s financial markets are less free than those in europe north america japan and elsewhere indeed this lack of freedom may well explain why the yuan s exchange value did not fall as far as the euro sterling or yen the picture shows a chinese migrant worker passing by the people s bank of china in beijing on may 1 2013 mark ralston afp getty images on an economic rather than a financial front matters also seem to favor the united states there can be little doubt that the u s economy is slowing and may already be in recession but the economies in the rest of the world look still more dubious britain s economy struggles with a new government that has hardly inspired confidence or given any reason to look for a quick turnaround especially because inflation there is if anything worse than elsewhere as with britain the european union s economy faces considerable downward pressure from inflation and especially fuel shortages as well as astronomical costs meanwhile economics in china looks even less attractive than in europe to be sure inflation in china is much less onerous than in europe or north america still the economy has slowed an unsettling amount from covid lockdowns drought heatwaves power shortages and financial uncertainties brought by the failures of several property developers it is not just that residential property development constitutes some 30 percent of china s economy but the failures have raised doubts about the viability of financial institutions across the country these economic and financial weights have made it clear that chinese growth will fail to come anywhere near the 5 5 percent real growth target set by beijing earlier in the year and may show none at all alone this picture would be depressing enough still against china s long record of rapid growth this year s halt unavoidably raises questions about the future viability of the country s general approach to economic management the yuan s weakness for all the troubles it reflects does have one virtue it makes china s exports cheaper on global markets with britain europe and likely the united states on the verge of recession china will no doubt see a decline in its exports going into 2023 they have been on something of a slide since earlier this year no doubt because of the weakness in major markets for chinese goods the recent foreign exchange declines will moderate that movement and offer a measure of relief xi as he begins his unprecedented third term in office will no doubt welcome whatever relief he can find for his vulnerable economy he will nonetheless face a strategic challenge from this help for exports because the weak yuan cannot lift china s domestic economic burdens especially china s financial difficulties the yuan will make china more export dependent and that will run counter to ambitions voiced by both xi and much of china s leadership to engineer the reverse and orient china more toward domestic spending and development not a happy start to xi s third term in office views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the epoch times
in the central valley where two thirds of the nation s fruit and nuts are grown the pastoral landscape masks entrenched racial and economic disparities life expectancy in fresno county drops by 20 years depending on where you live and it s those who live in historically poor redlined or rural neighborhoods who are most impacted by a resurgence of maternal and congenital syphilis are you familiar with syphilis hou vang a county communicable disease specialist asks a pregnant woman standing in the shade of a tree outside her home she lives with her parents in reedley california a small town 30 minutes southeast of the city of fresno surrounded by neat rows of grapevines orange groves and almond trees i mean you hear things she says distractedly eyeing a family member s car pulling into the driveway the woman allowed calmatters to report on her diagnosis on the condition of anonymity it s an std sexually transmitted disease we like to disclose in person in case there are any questions vang says you did test positive oh my god she breathes tearing up i have a lot of questions for my kid s dad 1 of 2 std investigator hou vang speaks with a pregnant patient to inform them of their diagnosis and provide information on july 14 2022 larry valenzuela 2 of 2 std investigator hou vang drives to a rural town in fresno county to make a home visit with a pregnant patient and provide them with information on july 14 2022 larry valenzuela vang works for the county health department where he s on the frontlines of california s fight against maternal and congenital syphilis rates of infection have ballooned to numbers not seen in two decades congenital syphilis occurs when the infection is passed from mother to baby during pregnancy if untreated the infection has devastating consequences causing severe neurological disorders organ damage and even infant death in few places is it worse than california s central valley fresno was the first county to sound the alarm alerting the state health department in 2015 when the number of cases more than doubled in one year it has only gotten worse since then today california has the sixth highest rate of congenital syphilis in the country with rates increasing every year in 2020 107 cases per 100 000 live births were reported a staggering 11 fold increase from a decade prior that rate far exceeds the california department of public health s 2020 target to keep congenital syphilis numbers below 9 6 cases per 100 000 live births a goal it outstripped almost as soon as it was set even more shockingly the syphilis rate among women of childbearing age was 53 times higher than the 2020 goal look at the resources put together for covid compared to resources for stds in general it pales in comparison dr mohammad nael mhaissen pediatric infectious disease specialist at valley children s hospital in madera at one point in the late 1990s rates were so low across the u s that the centers for disease control and prevention thought syphilis among men and women could be effectively eradicated from the population after all in many cases a single shot of penicillin is all that s needed to curb the infection but at both the national and state level public health departments were overstretched and woefully underfunded people slipped through the cracks and sexually transmitted infections of all types began to skyrocket once more increasing case rates have also gone hand in hand with increasing rates of homelessness and methamphetamine use inadequate prenatal care is the no 1 predictor for maternal and congenital syphilis it is a disease whose reemergence signifies severely inadequate access to health and social services systems when they rank developed nations on health measures the indicators always include sexually transmitted diseases said dr mohammad nael mhaissen a pediatric infectious disease specialist at valley children s hospital in madera and we re failing this should never happen vang knows when he has found a meth den the sharp acrid scent of the drug is unmistakable it smells like cat pee he s had doors slammed in his face and a gun flashed at him once he takes it all in stride accepting that many people are wary when a government vehicle pulls up in front of their home his job is to track down people who have tested positive for sexually transmitted infections and his most urgent cases are pregnant women who have syphilis vang carries with him a stack of postcards issued by the u s centers for disease control with pictures of syphilis symptoms to ask clients if they ve noticed any of the signs the images are graphic showing male and female genitals pock marked by bumps a newborn covered in a rash and a man losing his hair but the infection is also easy to misdiagnose especially when a whole generation of physicians have gone their entire careers without seeing the so called dead disease 1 of 2 hou vang shows the postcards issued by the u s centers for disease control with pictures of syphilis symptoms he carries to show patients what syphilis symptoms can look like on june 9 2022 larry valenzuela 2 of 2 hou vang shows the postcards he carries to show people what syphilis symptoms can look like on june 9 2022 larry valenzuela medical historians call it the great imitator because the symptoms are commonplace and disappear after a few weeks even though the body still carries the bacteria women in particular may never notice the painless bumps of early infection until it comes back months or years later to wreak havoc on their internal organs too often women aren t diagnosed until they re well into their pregnancy when the infection can cause severe physical and cognitive disabilities for the baby attacking their bones and nervous system if untreated there s a 40 chance the baby will die in 2019 the most recent year detailed state data is available 37 syphilis babies were stillborn and 446 were infected black babies were three times more likely to be born with syphilis compared to the statewide rate while hispanic babies made up nearly 50 of all cases native american infants were not included in this calculation because numbers are too low to be statistically stable it can be easy to blame women s choices for increasing rates but the truth is much more complicated the cdc noted in its 2020 sexually transmitted disease surveillance report that these disparities are unlikely explained by differences in sexual behavior and rather reflect differential access to quality sexual health care dr dominika seidman is an obstetrician and gynecologist with team lily at uc san francisco her group provides prenatal care and wraparound social supports such as housing navigation substance abuse and mental health treatment for vulnerable women for a long time there were no cases in san francisco seidman said in 2020 there were five but the low numbers are misleading even one case of congenital syphilis is known as a sentinel event in health care an event so rare and preventable that its occurrence should ring alarm bells this should be a never event seidman said it is an absolute disgrace that we are even talking about congenital syphilis it s hard to pinpoint one reason for the resurgence of this and other sexually transmitted infections which have also reached record setting numbers but high on the list is barriers to health care in a recent study led by state health department researchers babies born in the poorest census tracts in the state experienced congenital syphilis at 17 times the rate of those born in the most affluent census tracts this is a reflection of holes in our safety net and it s a reflection of all the different social determinants of health that play into poor health outcomes said dr ina park medical director for the california prevention training center at uc san francisco and co author of the cdc s 2020 sexually transmited infection treatment guidelines park was not involved in the study those social determinants of health or barriers such as housing instability or lack of insurance lead to missed opportunities to stop the infection from spreading in the first two years of california s outbreak between 2012 and 2014 nearly one third of mothers who gave birth to babies with syphilis were never tested before delivery and one third were tested less than 40 days before giving birth in contrast every mother who gave birth to syphilis free babies was tested early in their pregnancy according to state researchers those disparities haven t budged in the ensuing years in 2018 more than half of pregnant women with syphilis had delayed or no prenatal care according to a more recent analysis from the california department of public health half reported methamphetamine use and roughly half were recently incarcerated or homeless the report said it is structurally a socioeconomic issue a race issue said jennifer wagman a ucla researcher who in 2018 oversaw a study in kern county aimed at identifying why women were missing prenatal care we re not seeing wealthy white women with congenital syphilis babies it s just not happening wagman said this should be a never event it is an absolute disgrace that we are even talking about congenital syphilis dr dominika seidman obstetrician and gynecologist with team lily at ucsf in the central valley in particular language and distance create additional barriers one woman whom wagman interviewed for her study said you don t make it to the appointments because it s going to take too long on the bus or you won t make it back in time to pick up the kids at school you know transportation is a big big issue this is certainly true of vang s latest case in reedley he assures the woman that the infection is curable and that it s lucky it was caught relatively early in her pregnancy in her second trimester but her case is complicated she s allergic to penicillin the primary treatment option and will have to be gradually desensitized to the antibiotic over time she also has a seizure disorder and can t drive relying on family members for transportation the only hospital that can treat her is community regional medical center in downtown fresno 30 minutes away that s a far drive plus the time for desensitization that s a whole day not only for her but for whoever drives her said vang s boss jena adams that s a barrier they offer her a 20 arco gas card and 20 walmart card per treatment in hope that it will help offset the cost of transportation how did we get here back in the tower district of central fresno vang knocks on the red door of a single story ranch style house with a manicured lawn the next door neighbor comes outside and watches vang with suspicion no one answers vang tucks an envelope into the door jamb with the resident s name on it and drives around the block before pulling slowly past the house again to see if anyone has taken the envelope giving away that they are in fact home they were not it s the second time he has visited the house in as many days he s looking for a 19 year old man who tested positive for syphilis several weeks ago with no prior history an alarming trend that cropped up during the covid 19 pandemic records show the man s girlfriend is pregnant a month later vang will be back even though the man received a penicillin shot and claimed his girlfriend was treated she hasn t shown up in the county surveillance system meaning she likely wasn t tested or treated at eight months pregnant she and her unborn baby need to be treated as soon as possible otherwise the baby will be held in the neonatal intensive care unit for 10 days of intravenous treatment and even with that may suffer lifelong consequences larry valenzuela calmatters catchlight local hou vang knocks on the door to provide information to a possible patient in a fresno neighborhood on june 8 2022 tracking down infected and exposed patients is labor intensive the most effective follow up requires face to face interaction with investigators like vang knocking on doors visiting homeless encampments and shelters combing through mental health and social services files for current addresses and in some cases contacting family members or employers to track someone down but that work is expensive the in person time that s required to prevent a single case is so labor intensive that it s possible funding was not sufficient to effectively stamp this out ucsf s park said prior to the pandemic public health funding was notoriously low in the decade following the 2008 recession state funding for public health dropped by 64 federal funding helped fill some of the gap but across the country money dedicated to sexually transmitted diseases has remained stagnant with purchasing power decreasing by 40 the year that fresno county reported skyrocketing rates of congenital syphilis state spending on infectious disease reached its lowest point in a decade covid 19 led to an explosive infusion of emergency funds but public health money is typically siloed and can only be used for specific purposes i don t think we re going to see the true picture of what we re dealing with until covid is put to rest adams said in many instances recession era budget cuts equated to staffing cuts reduced hours and clinic closures in 2017 a survey by the national association of county and city health officials showed 43 of local health agencies cut staffing and one third reduced or eliminated services for sexually transmitted infection programs nationwide no agency or organization tracks std clinic closures in california but anecdotally health officials know it has happened fresno closed its full service clinic in 2010 kings county closed its hiv clinic later the same year sonoma county closed its hiv clinic in 2009 more recently the covid 19 pandemic and monkeypox outbreak have only served to further stymie the state s public health workforce sexually transmitted infection investigators in particular were extremely valuable during the early days of the pandemic due to their experience with contact tracing the majority of the team was pulled to do contact tracing for covid 19 nurses were pulled to do testing and vaccinations vang said larry valenzuela calmatters catchlight local the waiting room in the fresno county department of public health on june 8 2022 all nine of fresno s sexually transmitted infection investigators were assigned to covid 19 response vang and one other investigator were given every other day to respond to high priority syphilis and hiv cases between the two of them they struggled with their caseloads ballooning from a manageable 25 to an overwhelming 70 each for a full year the department couldn t offer treatment the same holds true at the state level in the health department s sexually transmitted diseases control branch which works to reduce the transmission of sexually transmitted infections the branch hasn t released detailed infection data or reports since 2019 because half of the branch s staff were redirected to covid 19 emergency response now monkeypox has further strained staff time and resources some staff remain redirected to the covid 19 response more than two and a half years later and the program is still working to backfill these positions spokesperson ronald owens said in a statement in addition many other std control branch staff are now currently redirected to monkeypox response what is the state doing now if she had all of the money in the world adams the fresno std program director said she would hire public health field nurses to work in tandem with her disease investigators and social services case workers the program had a taste of that in 2016 when the state sent extra resources its way nurses were able to provide syphilis treatments on the spot a critical strategy since the three shot treatment many patients need must be given exactly seven to eight days apart and many patients miss follow up appointments if they miss a treatment they have to start the antibiotic course from the beginning for a lot of clients it may be your one and only chance to help them when you have them adams said case workers could also help patients find substance abuse treatment programs and with housing needs by 2018 the combined forces of state local and even federal resources helped turn the outbreak around but the funds dried up and then the pandemic hit larry valenzuela calmatters catchlight local nurse prepares blood draw at the fresno county department of public health on june 9 2022 they lost their dedicated nurse the case worker transferred to another department a dual investigator and phlebotomist who could do blood draws for testing retired investigators were pulled for covid 19 work now they share resources with the tuberculosis and immunization teams which limits their flexibility they do have their own patients so i try to make things as quick as possible for them vang said in june this week we ve only treated one person pre covid we had two to three patients every day coming for treatment the most recent state budget included 30 million to combat syphilis and congenital syphilis that number is 19 million less than what legislators originally proposed but still represents the largest investment in combatting sexually transmitted infections in state history gov gavin newsom and state legislators also approved 300 million annually for public health filling some of the hole created during the great recession in a statement owens said the state health department will use the additional funding to work with local health departments the money will likely be used to bolster existing programs and address racial disparities seen among babies with syphilis owens said the state health department declined to make anyone available for an interview look at the resources put together for covid compared to resources for stds in general it pales in comparison craig pulsipher associate director of government affairs for aids project los angeles health and a member of end the epidemics which pushed for the money said the targeted funding will help offset the thinning of resources that inevitably happens when money is divvied up amongst the state s 58 counties the counties that account for the largest number of cases are often left with inadequate resources commensurate with the epidemic in those counties pulsipher said there are other bright spots on the horizon too last year newsom signed into law a measure making california the first state to require insurance plans to cover at home tests for sexually transmitted infections proponents of the measure say it s an important step toward eliminating testing barriers and bringing some services back to rural areas still considering the decade of underfunding coupled with population growth and more severe community needs the latest infusion of money is only the start of what experts say is needed to stop the spread look at the resources put together for covid compared to resources for stds in general it pales in comparison dr mhaissen in madera said these resources are lacking completely in public health and that directly contributed to its reemergence california spent roughly 12 3 billion between 2020 and 2021 to combat covid 19 in addition to 110 billion from the federal government vastly outstripping the amount spent on infectious disease prevention prior to the pandemic roughly 83 million the lack of public health resources pushed many of the testing and treatment responsibilities onto the primary care system but most doctors aren t equipped to interpret the complex test results which differ based on a patient s history of prior infection many primary care practices also don t offer treatment because it costs them thousands of dollars per dose to keep in stock the test results are very confusing i get confused said mhaissen who specializes in pediatric infectious disease he fields calls from across the state every day from obstetricians and pediatricians asking how to interpret results and what the best course of treatment is for mother and baby public health std investigators like vang are trained for this work but as funding has dwindled so has their capacity one hospital can t fix this one provider can t fix this mhaissen said back in fresno adams said she ll be satisfied her team s work has been effective once syphilis case rates are low enough for her investigators to work on other infections it would give me the opportunity to shift priorities and we could begin to focus on another std like gonorrhea or chlamydia adams said this article was produced as a project for the usc annenberg center for health journalism s 2022 california fellowship

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure

criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please
