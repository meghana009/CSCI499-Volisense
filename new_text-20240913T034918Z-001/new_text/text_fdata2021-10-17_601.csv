president biden had promised to halve u s greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 but an essential tool the administration planned to use to achieve that goal now appears out of reach the new york times reported friday that sen joe manchin a conservative west virginia democrat has indicated to the white house that he opposes the key climate measure in biden s multitrillion dollar climate and social programs package the president needs the support of all 50 democratic senators in order to pass the measure through a process known as reconciliation the program in question is the 150 billion clean electricity performance program which would financially reward utilities that transition to renewable energy and penalize those which do not experts say that the program would sharply reduce greenhouse gas pollution tied to electricity generation which today accounts for roughly a quarter of u s emissions manchin is at odds with his democratic colleagues manchin who leads the senate s energy and natural resources committee said during an appearance on cnn in september that energy companies are already transitioning to clean energy now they re wanting to pay companies to do what they re already doing he said makes no sense to me at all for us to take billions of dollars and pay utilities for what they re going to do as the market transitions manchin s office did not immediately return a request for comment saturday sen tina smith a minnesota democrat and champion of the clean energy measures said in an interview with the star tribune newspaper that manchin s characterization is just not right in fact what we re doing is we re providing utilities with support so that they can rapidly add clean power without raising utility rates smith said ties to the fossil fuel industry coal is a dominant industry in manchin s home state of west virginia as of 2019 the state is the second largest u s coal producer and relies on the fuel for 91 of its energy needs the energy sector accounts for 6 of the state s employment compared with a national average of roughly 2 the senator also has personal financial ties to the fossil fuel industry last year according to his public financial disclosure manchin received about 492 000 in dividends on stock from enersystems inc the coal business he founded in 1988 which is now controlled by his son joseph according to opensecrets which tracks political fundraising manchin is the top recipient of donations from the oil and gas and coal mining industries this election cycle after news broke of manchin s reported opposition to the clean energy program smith issued a warning to the white house on twitter let s be clear the build back better budget must meaningfully address climate change smith said using the administration s branding for the legislative package i m open to different approaches but i cannot support a bill that won t get us where we need to be on emissions smith said there are 50 democratic senators every one of us is needed get this passed smith told npr this month that she and manchin have been in regular contact about manchin s concerns u s credibility is on the line in two weeks world leaders will meet in scotland for a major united nations conference on climate change cop26 president biden and john kerry his climate envoy have been working to build u s credibility on climate issues after years of inaction and climate change denialism in an interview this week with the associated press kerry said that the administration s trouble passing its own climate policies hurts the effort to spur climate action abroad i m not going to pretend it s the best way to send the best message i mean we need to do these things kerry said he said that if congress fails to pass significant climate change legislation it would be like president trump pulling out of the paris agreement again a crucial moment for the health of the planet kerry also indicated that the conference talks are likely to fall short of securing the pledges that would be necessary if met to limit global warming to under 1 5 degrees celsius or 2 7 degrees fahrenheit from pre industrial levels under current worldwide commitments global emissions are expected to rise by about 16 in 2030 compared to 2010 that would put the planet on track for more than 4 degrees fahrenheit of warming by 2100 at that point rising sea levels would inundate coastlines extreme heat waves would be significantly more common and more intense floods and droughts would potentially displace tens of millions of people lauren sommer contributed reporting copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

bank fees transfer fees and long wait times oh my accepting payments in bitcoin btc 0 59 has some notable advantages the original cryptocurrency was built for an online world and eliminates or reduces many pain points for merchants by lowering banking fees reducing transaction costs compared with digital payment networks like visa v 0 44 and expediting the speed at which transactions are settled bitcoin isn t perfect though crypto and blockchain based assets are still new technology so many people aren t familiar or comfortable with how they work wild swings in bitcoin s price is also a major detractor as a form of payment as a result most merchants aren t even thinking about replacing traditional platforms run by visa and big banks just yet at this point convenience and peace of mind using incumbent networks outweighs any of the benefits of switching to blockchain based payments but here are three ways bitcoin could capture a larger share of the digital payments market bitcoin payment development in a word time all the various movements going on with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be summed up in one way it is going to take time before bitcoin becomes an accepted medium of digital exchange for things of value though other younger blockchain networks like ethereum eth 1 06 have received greater interest of late it s noteworthy that there are thousands of developers hard at work on bitcoin or on projects built on its platform some of them can be found at legacy payment networks themselves for instance visa s network supports debit cards backed by cryptocurrency accounts and the company has a small segment working on other methods to integrate bitcoin into its system nevertheless bitcoin still has a ways to go before it can overtake massive and powerful institutions like visa and the banking partners that dominate the payments business more bitcoin facilitators not just hodlers as the cryptocurrency movement has gained momentum a term has arisen to describe some of its most avid proponents hodlers hodl is a now intentional misspelling of hold an encouragement to hold onto cryptos even during some of the sharp downturns and frenzied swings in value it has also retroactively been coined as an acronym for hold on for dear life individuals aren t the only bitcoin hodlers out there some notable companies have added bitcoin to their balance sheets including square sq 1 97 tesla tsla 1 65 microstrategy mstr 0 91 and latin american e commerce leader mercadolibre meli 2 00 some of these firms may simply have bitcoin as an alternative to cash with the expectation that bitcoin s price will rise over time others like square are trying to make bitcoin a standard of business exchange square chief executive officer jack dorsey said this past summer that square was building a new developer ecosystem to accelerate bitcoin s usefulness as a payments platform even the country of el salvador has made bitcoin an official currency though implementation has been dubious so far as a result of some bitcoin holders work a growing list of items and services can be purchased with bitcoin everything from low value items like socks to expensive goods like real estate or a college education given more development more businesses and consumers might warm to accepting bitcoin as payment this could lead some to start spending their crypto assets rather than just hodling them use of derivatives a stabilizing force over time financial products such as futures and options built atop or denominated in bitcoin could go a long way toward advancing its use as an everyday form of payment leading derivatives marketplace cme group cme 0 36 launched bitcoin futures back in late 2017 and has steadily added other bitcoin contracts in the years since these financial instruments help institutions that own or utilize bitcoin to manage their risk since bitcoin volatility is wild compared to national currencies like the u s dollar in which organizations have to pay their bills and taxes an apt analogy might be airlines which use derivatives to manage big swings in aircraft fuel if more businesses are to accept bitcoin payments and utilize the bitcoin blockchain rather than a traditional payments network like visa a way to protect against downturns in value is critical bitcoin has gained an important beachhead as a legitimate investment asset with a market value that exceeds 1 trillion however bitcoin has potential beyond that to simplify and reduce the cost of traditional digital payment systems but before bitcoin is ready to take on the legacy digital payments industry dominated by the likes of visa and big banks a lot of work needs to be done and it could take many years before that happens

no one knows how much total leverage there is in the stock market only fragments are reported margin loans are reported monthly and they provide a general idea of the trend in stock market leverage some types of leverage are not disclosed at all until something implodes spectacularly such as archegos other types of leverage are reported in bits and pieces if at all by a few banks and broker dealers in their quarterly financial statements if they so choose this includes securities based lending some banks brokers report securities based lending others don t on thursday and today some wall street banks and broker filed their q3 earnings reports and supplemental information with the sec and a few of them included in their supplemental filings some tidbits about their securities based lending sbl securities based lending is hot people who want to cash out some of the gains in their portfolios thank you halleluiah fed but didn t want to sell can use their portfolios as collateral for loans by the broker the proceeds of which can be used for anything buy more securities buy a house or a new vehicle or pay for a divorce settlement when asset prices fall enough the borrowers get a margin call and either have to either come up with some cash and put it into the account or they have to sell securities and pay down their sbl balances thereby turning into forced sellers goldman sachs didn t disclose anything about its sbl they re lumped into a larger loan category jpmorgan didn t disclose the amounts either but only said that in its asset wealth management division loans continue to be strong up 20 primarily driven by securities based lending bank of america disclosed its securities based lending in a footnote sbl balances in q3 jumped by 25 year over year to 49 billion morgan stanley also disclosed its sbl balances in the category securities based lending and other spread over two divisions which combined jumped 23 year over year to 89 billion charles schwab didn t separate out its sbl balances but lumps them into the category of receivables from brokerage clients which nearly quadrupled year over year to 81 billion but wells fargo reported that other consumer loans which are primarily sbls declined by 18 in q3 to 27 billion the decline might be a side effect of the sale of its asset management business to private equity firms gtcr and reverence capital partners announced in february this year no one tracks the overall outstanding balances of sbl each bank knows individually its exposure you d hope many banks lump them in with other loans and there is no overall summary figure and so no one knows how much leverage there is in the stock market in terms of these securities based loans but we know it s huge and ballooning given the amounts that are disclosed by a few banks margin debt blows out then dips regular margin loans are reported by brokers to finra which then reports them on a monthly basis which it did today they are the only measure of stock market leverage that is tracked it s an indicator of the trend in overall stock market leverage the tip of the iceberg stock market margin debt after spiking to another all time high in august ticked down in september to 903 billion up by 38 year over year and by 61 from january 2020 before the sell off started what s important in a chart like this that spans over two decades is not the absolute level of leverage compared to back in the day because the purchasing power of the dollar has diminished what s important are the trends and patterns the steep increases before every stock market sell off spikes in margin debt don t trigger sell offs and they don t predict sell offs because they sometimes lag those sell offs but leverage pumps up stock prices by creating buying pressure as borrowed money surges into the market and when the market tanks forced selling by leveraged investors creates selling pressure and amplifies the sell off and triggers its own downward spiral the fed has repressed interest rates to encourage borrowing and it contributed to this spike in leverage and to make it all work out it inflated asset prices via 4 5 trillion in qe in 18 months as part of its official wealth effect policy a few months ago in its financial stability report while pointing at archegos it warned out of the other side of its mouth about the vast unknown parts of leverage among hedge funds and insurance companies

the thriving restaurant chain faces a difficult year over year comparison but its strong momentum will help chipotle mexican grill cmg 0 84 reports third quarter 2021 financial results on oct 21 and investors have some key data points to pay attention to the tex mex fast casual restaurant chain has managed well and profited during the past 18 months while the rest of the industry has struggled to survive just this year chipotle s stock price is up 30 almost doubling the s p 500 s return here are three things shareholders need to know about this top restaurant stock before next thursday 1 the s hift to in person dining unsurprisingly digital sales experienced a huge boom during the pandemic in the second and third quarters of 2020 digital revenue more than tripled year over year underscoring chipotle s readiness to serve hungry customers in ways most convenient for them including curbside pick up drive thru and delivery this metric showed deceleration last quarter climbing just 10 5 and accounting for less than half of chipotle s total revenue as pandemic restrictions lift and people feel comfortable eating out again digital sales will certainly be under pressure and this coincides with a rise in in store dining we ve continued to make operational adjustments to adapt to the constantly changing environment which has led us to recovering about 70 of in restaurant sales thus far while retaining about 80 of digital sales ceo brian niccol said on the second quarter earnings call back in july niccol said he believes that roughly 15 of customers use both in person and digital channels so the overlap isn t high today it ll be interesting to see what this figure is for the just finished quarter any higher revenue cannibalization could be cause for concern for chipotle 2 inflationary pressures like many other businesses today chipotle is dealing with inflation as a percentage of revenue food costs in the third quarter are expected to be at or slightly above the 30 4 that they were in the second quarter supply shortages at food vendors coupled with higher beef and freight expenses will impact chipotle s total food costs in the third quarter and labor costs another major expense for a restaurant are expected to be in the low 26 range in the third quarter this is up from 24 5 in the second quarter and the rise is partly due to increased wages the company s restaurant level operating margin last quarter of 24 5 which was the highest it s been since the third quarter of 2015 will most likely decrease as a result of elevated input costs let s see what happens to inflation and let s see what happens to the economy over the next several months and we ll make the appropriate decisions at the appropriate time cfo jack hartung mentioned on the last conference call chipotle s proven pricing power insulates it somewhat from these inflationary pressures after raising prices earlier this year in june management says that menu price increases have so far been accepted well by customers with the leadership team saying it s really seeing no resistance whatsoever pay attention to additional commentary about this on the next earnings call 3 new store openings and lastly shareholders should focus on the number of new stores chipotle opened in the quarter after opening 56 new restaurants in the second quarter the company was still on track to open 200 new locations or slightly more for the full year with a footprint of 2 853 restaurants today the business is closely approaching the 3 000 mark management is planning for 70 of the new stores opened this year to be built with a chipotlane the company s popular drive thru option hartung said new chipotlanes are opening with about 20 higher sales compared to the non chipotlanes opened during the same time period what s more these locations drive more digital sales with more customers ordering ahead which is chipotle s highest margin transaction the business is well on its way to one day reaching its goal of operating 6 000 restaurants in north america to continue expanding in this difficult economic environment is indicative of chipotle s remarkable success shareholders should now be prepared when the business reports third quarter financial results on oct 21 the focus should be on the comeback of in store dining inflationary pressures and the new store pipeline

jin ding china daily a critical shortage of coal in india could cripple the nascent recovery of the indian economy by disabling a number of sectors especially manufacturing until tata power a private power distribution company sent text messages to its consumers recently people in india had no idea that there was any issue about the availability of coal which is used to generate around 70 percent of india s electricity tata power warned their consumers to use power judiciously stoking fears of power outages it was only after this that the mainstream media in india picked up the story but while indian government officials assured people that any possible crisis would be averted a number of provinces and regions started reporting power outages the indian government also explained that the current coal shortage has been caused by a number of factors including a sharp rise in demand occasioned by the economic recovery transportation difficulties caused by heavy downpours and floods in some places and a sharp rise in the prices of imported coal india in fact is the second largest importer of coal and coal prices have risen by up to 40 percent over the past two months leading to indian imports dropping to a two year low at a time when demand has grown 17 percent compared with the same period in 2019 that is before the covid 19 pandemic broke out on oct 10 in its official response to tata power s text messages the indian government went into complete denial indian power minister r k singh rapped the company for creating panic unnecessarily and warned distribution companies of stringent action if they resorted to rationing officials claimed that coal india limited the indian government owned and largest coal producing company in the world had reserves for 24 days and thermal plants had stocks for four days yet on oct 9 singh had told an indian newspaper that the situation was touch and go and that he was bracing for the next five or six months despite hoping that demand would start tapering off in the second half of october and ease the situation but there can be no doubt that there is a global power crisis indexed mainly by the rising prices of coal in the global market and its insufficient availability the problem is with both the supply side and demand side demand is bound to be unpredictable in a phase of recovery and supplies cannot be jacked up in the short term in india because domestic production has been falling and imported coal prices are rising china too is holding its breath on the coal front the world s second largest economy and the biggest consumer of coal is facing a power shortage having been hit by disruptions in electricity generation in some areas it s not just that perhaps china faces the same kind of structural problems as india it uses coal to generate about 70 percent of its electricity and given the size of its economy and the extent of demand has to import much of its coal so high global coal prices have hit it as well it s not a happy situation for the two most populous countries in the world which together consume more than 60 percent of the world s coal the next three on the list are the united states at 8 5 percent germany at 3 percent and russia at 2 7 percent the obvious answer to the coal problem is that china and india and also the us must wean themselves from coal and switch to renewable energy to be sure china is already a global leader in renewable and clean energy when it comes to renewable energy one source that is frequently touted is nuclear power but it comes with heavy investments transfers of technology at least for india difficult multilateral or bilateral negotiations and the omnipresent danger of a leak and its horrific consequences on human health and natural habitats renewables are the other way forward they are safe becoming increasingly cost effective and often do not involve really heavy investments though cutting edge technology transfers would help and they are the only way to slow down greenhouse gas emissions and thus global warming the problem is that at best they are medium term solutions it would be somewhat utopian to expect india and china to reverse their current fuel mix and generate 70 percent of their electricity by the next decade from renewables just as it is futile to expect us citizens to start using hybrids instead of fossil fuels to drive cars anytime soon the transition will have to be expedited everywhere but it still won t happen in a few years on the eve of the un climate change conference scheduled for next month in glasgow scotland it is incumbent upon all governments businesses as well as the general public to think outside the box to find a solution to the widespread use of fossil fuels policymakers have the biggest responsibility it is by now clear that a unifocal emphasis on supply side solutions will not work the trajectory our civilization is traversing necessarily means an enormous increase in the appetite for energy which also possibly means that even if we move forward with renewables at a fairly fast clip our demand for energy will outstrip the supply we must therefore look at the consumption side we have to renegotiate our lifestyles in such a way that our demand for greenhouse gas emitting consumables slows down the most obvious example is the private car policy will have to be deployed harshly now to discourage the use of cars as a postscript one may add that the annual climate change jamborees generate a huge amount of greenhouse gases with the example of the covid 19 pandemic before us could we not consider conducting the whole business over the internet other such global meetings could follow the lead the author is a senior journalist and

the build back better agenda under negotiation in congress includes sweeping public investments to make our economy more equitable sustainable and resilient in the face of future crises another major potential benefit several tax reforms on the table to help pay for the plan would also reduce economic inequality and curb harmful corporate behavior here we highlight corporate tax proposals in play on capitol hill that are designed to discourage corporate tax dodging and offshoring excessive ceo pay and wasteful stock buybacks corporate tax dodging and offshoring for decades large corporations have pitted countries against each other to drive their own tax bills lower and lower this has put an enormous strain on public budgets for education health care and other vital investments in the united states the percentage of total federal revenue from corporate tax receipts dropped from 32 1 percent in 1952 to 6 6 percent in 2019 according to the office of management and budget the biden administration has just forged a deal with more than 130 governments aimed at ending this global race to the bottom each of these governments has agreed to charge large corporations a global minimum tax on profits of at least 15 percent through rampant abuse of tax havens and other loopholes many u s corporations have gotten away with paying a much lower effective tax rate the effective rate is what corporations actually pay while the statutory rate is what they owe before accounting for tax breaks and credits one government survey found that u s based multinationals paid an average u s tax rate of just 7 8 percent in 2018 the institute on taxation and economic policy found that 55 large profitable u s corporations actually paid zero in federal income taxes last year the new corporate minimum tax would generate u s revenue of an estimated 148 billion over a decade this would go a long way towards covering the costs of vital investments in the build back better agenda for example it is more than enough to pay for universal free community college and more than twice as much as the cost of building affordable accessible housing for more than 300 000 families democratic lawmakers are also considering closing various other loopholes that have encouraged use of offshore tax havens the house ways and means committee has proposed other international tax reforms that would raise more than 300 billion over 10 years while president joe biden s more comprehensive plan would raise as much as 1 trillion corporate tax rate increase tired of reading the same old news from the same old sources so are we that s why we re on a mission to shake things up and bring you the stories and perspectives that often go untold in mainstream media but being a radically unapologetically independent news site isn t easy or cheap and we rely on reader support to keep the lights on if you like what you re reading please consider making a tax deductible donation today we re not asking for a handout we re asking for an investment invest in a nonprofit news site that s not afraid to ruffle a few feathers not afraid to stand up for what s right and not afraid to tell it like it is this piece was reprinted by truthout with permission or license it may not be reproduced in any form without permission or license from the source

company s gurugram office demanding better pay safer working conditions and social security benefits us senator elizabeth warren called for breaking up amazon and indian retailers demanded a government probe of the company after a reuters investigation showed the ecommerce giant had copied products and rigged search results in india the report reviewing thousands of internal amazon documents found that the us company ran a systematic campaign to create knockoffs and manipulate search results to boost its own private brands in india one of the company s largest growth markets the report showed for the first time that at least in india manipulating search results to favour amazon s own products as well as copying other sellers goods were part of a formal strategy at amazon and that at least two senior executives had reviewed it we believe these claims are factually incorrect and unsubstantiated the company said but did not elaborate it added that amazon displays search results based on relevance to the customer s search query irrespective of whether such products have private brands offered by sellers or not but a group representing millions of india s brick and mortar retailers said the government must launch an investigation into amazon indian retailers say foreign e commerce businesses like amazon and walmart s flipkart indulge in unfair business practices that hurt smaller firms allegations the companies deny the alliance of digital india foundation adif a non profit representing some of india s biggest startups said the practices detailed in the reuters report were highly deplorable and called into question the credibility of amazon as a good faith operator in the indian startup ecosystem in a blog post the group urged the indian government to take action against amazon s predatory playbook of copying rigging and killing indian brands warren a prominent democrat advocated the breakup of amazon and other tech giants in 2019 when she was running for president since then as a senator from massachusetts she has continued to apply pressure on companies like amazon these documents show what we feared about amazon s monopoly power that the company is willing and able to rig its platform to benefit its bottom line while stiffing small businesses and entrepreneurs warren said in a tweet this is one of the many reasons we need to break it

jin ding china daily a critical shortage of coal in india could cripple the nascent recovery of the indian economy by disabling a number of sectors especially manufacturing until tata power a private power distribution company sent text messages to its consumers recently people in india had no idea that there was any issue about the availability of coal which is used to generate around 70 percent of india s electricity tata power warned their consumers to use power judiciously stoking fears of power outages it was only after this that the mainstream media in india picked up the story but while indian government officials assured people that any possible crisis would be averted a number of provinces and regions started reporting power outages the indian government also explained that the current coal shortage has been caused by a number of factors including a sharp rise in demand occasioned by the economic recovery transportation difficulties caused by heavy downpours and floods in some places and a sharp rise in the prices of imported coal india in fact is the second largest importer of coal and coal prices have risen by up to 40 percent over the past two months leading to indian imports dropping to a two year low at a time when demand has grown 17 percent compared with the same period in 2019 that is before the covid 19 pandemic broke out on oct 10 in its official response to tata power s text messages the indian government went into complete denial indian power minister r k singh rapped the company for creating panic unnecessarily and warned distribution companies of stringent action if they resorted to rationing officials claimed that coal india limited the indian government owned and largest coal producing company in the world had reserves for 24 days and thermal plants had stocks for four days yet on oct 9 singh had told an indian newspaper that the situation was touch and go and that he was bracing for the next five or six months despite hoping that demand would start tapering off in the second half of october and ease the situation but there can be no doubt that there is a global power crisis indexed mainly by the rising prices of coal in the global market and its insufficient availability the problem is with both the supply side and demand side demand is bound to be unpredictable in a phase of recovery and supplies cannot be jacked up in the short term in india because domestic production has been falling and imported coal prices are rising china too is holding its breath on the coal front the world s second largest economy and the biggest consumer of coal is facing a power shortage having been hit by disruptions in electricity generation in some areas it s not just that perhaps china faces the same kind of structural problems as india it uses coal to generate about 70 percent of its electricity and given the size of its economy and the extent of demand has to import much of its coal so high global coal prices have hit it as well it s not a happy situation for the two most populous countries in the world which together consume more than 60 percent of the world s coal the next three on the list are the united states at 8 5 percent germany at 3 percent and russia at 2 7 percent the obvious answer to the coal problem is that china and india and also the us must wean themselves from coal and switch to renewable energy to be sure china is already a global leader in renewable and clean energy when it comes to renewable energy one source that is frequently touted is nuclear power but it comes with heavy investments transfers of technology at least for india difficult multilateral or bilateral negotiations and the omnipresent danger of a leak and its horrific consequences on human health and natural habitats renewables are the other way forward they are safe becoming increasingly cost effective and often do not involve really heavy investments though cutting edge technology transfers would help and they are the only way to slow down greenhouse gas emissions and thus global warming the problem is that at best they are medium term solutions it would be somewhat utopian to expect india and china to reverse their current fuel mix and generate 70 percent of their electricity by the next decade from renewables just as it is futile to expect us citizens to start using hybrids instead of fossil fuels to drive cars anytime soon the transition will have to be expedited everywhere but it still won t happen in a few years on the eve of the un climate change conference scheduled for next month in glasgow scotland it is incumbent upon all governments businesses as well as the general public to think outside the box to find a solution to the widespread use of fossil fuels policymakers have the biggest responsibility it is by now clear that a unifocal emphasis on supply side solutions will not work the trajectory our civilization is traversing necessarily means an enormous increase in the appetite for energy which also possibly means that even if we move forward with renewables at a fairly fast clip our demand for energy will outstrip the supply we must therefore look at the consumption side we have to renegotiate our lifestyles in such a way that our demand for greenhouse gas emitting consumables slows down the most obvious example is the private car policy will have to be deployed harshly now to discourage the use of cars as a postscript one may add that the annual climate change jamborees generate a huge amount of greenhouse gases with the example of the covid 19 pandemic before us could we not consider conducting the whole business over the internet other such global meetings could follow the lead the author is a senior journalist and

domestically there s a lot of uncertainty still there we know victoria and nsw will open up to each other in november we believe tasmania will open up when they get to 90 per cent south australia when they get to 80 per cent queensland is very uncertain and western australia won t be open until the new year but with the markets that will open we ll be activating a large amount of aircraft and people to get aussies flying again fitz is there a time in mind when you think flight activity will get back to pre plague levels or will that be the 12th of never qantas ceo alan joyce and partner shane lloyd credit steve christo alan joyce we will get back to pre covid levels after every crisis from september 11 to the global financial crisis there s a big hit in aviation traffic but it does come back my american colleagues say by the end of this year they ll be back domestically to pre covid levels the chinese carriers are back to 120 per cent of the pre covid levels domestically the europeans are already back to 70 per cent and rapidly improving so the world is on a path to recovery to where it was pre covid fitz and to get on a qantas jet will it take a double jab big tick or will there be exceptions alan joyce for international yes unless there are certified medical reasons or children which is no different from what happened with yellow fever domestically it is going to be subject to public health orders victoria and nsw are saying that they will only allow vaccinated people to travel we think western australia will have it as a requirement and we think other states will follow suit that may change when we get to 90 per cent like it will for restaurants and pubs qantas is finding there is big pent up demand for international travel credit louise kennerley fitz but doesn t the idea of qantas insisting that only double jabbed people get on the plane make you segregationist fascists with no interest in freedom and sell out bastards to boot alan joyce no first of all it s going to be government requirements and then secondly we all have a duty of care i have a duty of care first of all to my employees and customers and if you have a protection that reduces the risk by 90 per cent why wouldn t you apply it if somebody told me there was a problem in an engine but i could do a fix that would reduce the risk by well over 90 per cent of course i would do it fitz what about the cost of flights post plague alan joyce similar to pre plague as you call it or less our priority at least in the next year or so will be getting aircraft back in the air so we don t need to make the returns we were making pre covid we have 10 000 people stood down we were losing billions by sitting on the ground so that means we re going to be incentivising people to fly again the one thing that could have a short term impact on higher airfares is when governments open our borders late and we re scrambling for capacity but medium and long term we just want our aircraft back in the air and to be cashflow positive before the second lockdown we had jetstar selling 19 airfares to get people travelling again and we ll be doing similar things fitz some airlines like emirates kept flying to australia long after qantas put its planes in mothballs and there is some lingering resentment that the national carrier wasn t the last airline standing alan joyce there s a lot of misinformation on that because we did a lot of repatriation flights with the government and we ve been doing that all the way through the crisis even when india closed down it was qantas that came up with a process to do testing in india to isolate people in hotels to start the flights again and all crews were flying off to india staying on the aircraft before flying back again they were doing 23 hours of duty to get australians back and that never stopped and on freight flights we ve been flying lobsters to shanghai avocados to la and so on 2000 flights to support 120 000 jobs so it s wrong to say qantas abandoned the country if anything we were the no 1 airline to help the country get through fitz what about federal court action from when you outsourced 2000 workers do you have any regrets about outsourcing those workers alan joyce not at all we were in the middle of the biggest crisis in our history we had to make dramatic action for us to survive we fundamentally disagree with the ruling we re going to appeal it fitz the other thing facing airlines is growing awareness of the need to reduce emissions we ve got electric cars and soon electric trucks are electric planes in the pipeline loading alan joyce the problem is the weight of the battery with our current technology for a melbourne sydney flight the batteries would have to be 34 times the weight of fuel costs you need so it s not economically or technically feasible but the biggest thing for us is sustainable aviation fuel usually in crops or using algae and we re investing a significant amount of money to get sustainable aviation fuel industry up in australia so that we can be carbon neutral by 2050 we ve already flown from melbourne to la on mustard seeds and it s a rotation crop so farmers get money out of it and it doesn t take from food stocks so it s something like that we need to get up and running in this country fitz meantime there s been some recent culling of the coveted chairman s lounge membership would i be right in saying you re getting contacts from various heavyweights trying to bully badger or beg you to let them back in alan joyce there s always been a culling of the chairman s lounge it is the most exclusive club in the country so it s great that everybody wants to be part of that but it s not like an order of australia forever the nz way courtesy of edmuzik on twitter i have a lovely yarn from across the dutch this week he recounted how at his pub trivia night this week a woman from the pharmacy next door wandered in and called out that she had five extra shots of the covid 19 vaccine if anyone wanted them whereupon five patrons wandered off to get them while the rest of the pub gave them a hearty round of applause stephdyhrberg marvelled in reply that in no other country could a stranger bowl up offer you a loaded syringe and you go cool hit me joke of the week a man is lying in the hospital waiting to be the first person in history to receive a brain transplant a doctor comes in and says congratulations but unfortunately since this is a new procedure your insurance isn t going to cover it all so we re going to give you three choices for brains and you can decide which you can afford ok what are they says the man to the doctor the doctor says well first there s engineer brain that s 100 a gram then there s astrophysicist brain that ll cost you 200 a gram finally there s anti vaxxer brain that s the most expensive at 1000 a gram the man looks at the doctor surprised that s absurd why is the anti vaxxer brain so expensive the doctor turns to him and says sir do you have any idea how many anti vaxxers it takes to get a gram of brain tweet of the week longer if you leave it in the ground shaun micallef replies to minister for resources

moscow russia with surging natural gas prices leading again to the greater use of coal totalenergies ceo patrick pouyanne highlighted the need to achieve stable prices as lower gas prices will reduce reliance on higher polluting coal in an interview with cnbc during a russia energy week panel in moscow pouyanne said the transition to cleaner energy has also created an imbalance in the market stressing high pricing is not good news of course immediately for my company results are better but for customers it is not replacing coal with gas is good for climate change but to do that we need to have a lower price coal today is king and is cheaper than all the other sources of energy he added in europe the use of coal produced electricity has increased as european coal futures have more than doubled since the start of the year while gas prices nearly quadrupled during the same period pouyanne noted this is not merely a european gas crisis but is also a global one caused by a huge hike in demand for gas from china and asia during the cnbc panel bp ceo bernard looney stated i think that this crisis in europe has reminded us that energy is part of the lifeblood of society and that energy use is only going in one direction and that is upwards at the end of the day if supply goes away and demand does not change that only has one consequence and that is an escalation in price rises just simply correcting a supply side issue without affecting demand will not result in a more stable system it will result in a more volatile system he added in reference to the efforts of governments to reduce fossil fuel production and use additionally looney said power shortages are also impacting households and businesses around asia forcing many factories to shut down and causing supply shortages panelists noted that a transition to cleaner energy has created higher demand for gas which is considered a cleaner fuel demand is further rebounding from the covid 19 pandemic as economies reopen and international travel resumes energy price rises have also caused supply chain disruptions and a shipping container shortage which both contributed to rapid inflation said pouyanne

moscow russia with surging natural gas prices leading again to the greater use of coal totalenergies ceo patrick pouyanne highlighted the need to achieve stable prices as lower gas prices will reduce reliance on higher polluting coal in an interview with cnbc during a russia energy week panel in moscow pouyanne said the transition to cleaner energy has also created an imbalance in the market stressing high pricing is not good news of course immediately for my company results are better but for customers it is not replacing coal with gas is good for climate change but to do that we need to have a lower price coal today is king and is cheaper than all the other sources of energy he added in europe the use of coal produced electricity has increased as european coal futures have more than doubled since the start of the year while gas prices nearly quadrupled during the same period pouyanne noted this is not merely a european gas crisis but is also a global one caused by a huge hike in demand for gas from china and asia during the cnbc panel bp ceo bernard looney stated i think that this crisis in europe has reminded us that energy is part of the lifeblood of society and that energy use is only going in one direction and that is upwards at the end of the day if supply goes away and demand does not change that only has one consequence and that is an escalation in price rises just simply correcting a supply side issue without affecting demand will not result in a more stable system it will result in a more volatile system he added in reference to the efforts of governments to reduce fossil fuel production and use additionally looney said power shortages are also impacting households and businesses around asia forcing many factories to shut down and causing supply shortages panelists noted that a transition to cleaner energy has created higher demand for gas which is considered a cleaner fuel demand is further rebounding from the covid 19 pandemic as economies reopen and international travel resumes energy price rises have also caused supply chain disruptions and a shipping container shortage which both contributed to rapid inflation said pouyanne

ones to watch in the lands of the rising dividend asian fund payouts dropped far less than the uk in pandemic and there s growth to be had too obtaining dividend income from outside the uk has become a popular option it has been fuelled by pandemic and collapse in dividends from british firms asian dividends fell back far less than those in the uk global dividends are expected to grow this year by nearly 11 obtaining dividend income from outside the uk has become a popular option for many investors in recent years a trend fuelled by the pandemic and the collapse in dividends paid by many british companies this search for dividends has resulted in investment funds with a broad global income bent becoming increasingly popular income funds concentrating on specific regions or countries of the world for example asia north america japan and emerging markets have also attracted investor interest according to the latest data compiled by investment house janus henderson global dividends are expected to grow this year by nearly 11 per cent with europe the uk and asia pacific leading the way one investment trust described by analysts edison as doing what it says on the tin will confirm the buoyancy of asian dividends when it announces its annual results this week henderson far east income one of a stable of funds run by janus henderson will state that it has managed its 13th consecutive year of dividend growth yet although the expected 1 7 per cent increase in the annual dividend to 23 4pence a share will be welcomed by income hungry shareholders it will be offset by the trust s poor overall performance the shares ended friday at 2 96 over the past one three and five years the fund has lagged behind its peer group in the process registering respective meagre overall returns capital plus income of just 3 9 5 9 and 16 8 per cent in other words any income returns have been undermined by the underwhelming poor share price performance of the trust s 40 holdings over these same three time periods only one similar stock market listed trust jpmorgan asia growth income has an inferior record albeit only over the past year its record over longer periods is better as the table shows all those asia pacific income funds not listed on the london stock exchange have outperformed henderson far east income over one three and five years mike kerley who has run the 440million stock market listed fund since 2007 and more recently in conjunction with sat duhra admits the trust s returns have been disappointing if we go back to pre pandemic times the trust s total returns were in line with those of its peers he says but the underperformance of dividend yield as an investment strategy has hit the trust hard the trust s shares are currently yielding close to 8 per cent an extraordinary figure especially when measured against its peers where yields of 4 per cent are more the norm kerley says the shares of the top 25 per cent of income yielding stocks across asia are currently standing at a 60 per cent discount to the rest of the market in other words their share prices are seriously depressed this is a result of investors huge appetite fuelled by lockdowns and working from home for alternative growth stocks such as chinese technology giants tencent and alibaba and companies involved in the drive towards a net zero carbon global economy there is a lot of hope built into the valuations of some of these growth stocks kerley cautions he believes that at some stage a catalyst will emerge that will reward fund managers like him who prefer to focus on well run companies that are cash generative and profitable it s frustrating he adds but the backdrop is in place for our investment strategy to work to shareholders advantage it s just a question of waiting for the shift in investor sentiment if the trust s share price were to increase strongly the 8 per cent yield would fall although the dividend payments would continue to rise two big themes dominate the trust s portfolio mining and financials kerley believes strong demand for commodities such as aluminium copper cobalt and nickel driven in part by the greening of the global economy is a big positive for mining companies such as rio tinto and bhp that are among the trust s top ten holdings asia is one of the few areas of the world offering investors access to a decent dividend mike kerley fund manager of henderson far east income asian financial stocks he argues will do well if interest rates rise as expected pushing profits up in recent weeks the trust has decreased its exposure to chinese stocks on the back of an expected slowdown in the economy triggered by higher energy costs and rising commodity prices although kerley and henderson far east income shareholders are patiently waiting for cash generative businesses in asia to come back into favour he believes the dividend outlook for the region is a positive one he says asian dividends fell back only 5 per cent as a result of the pandemic compared to 30 per cent plus in the uk with asian companies traditionally using less of their profits to pay dividends there is scope for future dividend growth especially if the region also benefits from economic growth it s a view shared by darius mcdermott of fund scrutineer fundcalibre he says asia is one of the few areas of the world offering investors access to a decent dividend it s a vast region embracing many world class companies which are really starting to embrace the dividend culture not only will uk investors taking the plunge benefit from diversification of their income sources but they will gain exposure to some excellent companies in growth mode mcdermott s favourite funds in this area are jupiter asian income guinness asian equity income and schroder oriental income

cleaning guru aggie mackenzie tells me my money she made 440 000 from tv work in one year but felt like she didn t deserve it the best financial decision aggie mackenzie ever made was giving up her job at the good housekeeping institute to present channel 4 tv series how clean is your house she told donna ferguson that she went on to earn up to 440 000 a year from her tv work a salary she felt she did not deserve the scottish presenter 66 lives in a mortgage free two bedroom house in north london but says her heart remains in the highlands where she grew up on her website aggiestips com she offers household tips on domestic matters what did your parents teach you about money not to fritter it away my father was a jack of all trades he was a blacksmith who repaired metalwork and ran the local garage my mother was a housewife when we were children then she worked as a cleaner at the local hotel even though dad ran his own business and had access to more cash than most people there wasn t much money around when i was growing up there were six of us and we lived in a three bedroom council house in rothiemurchus in the scottish highlands my parents were from poor backgrounds and it had been inculcated into them that money was not to be wasted they believed for example that holidays were frivolous and it was better to spend your money on furniture and items that last rather than experiences have you ever struggled to make ends meet not really i ve always been in jobs where i ve been paid ok and i m not stupid about money i ve always managed to live within my means have you ever been paid silly money yes i have in the mid 2000s i was paid ridiculous amounts the silliest money i ever earned was a 100 000 bonus i got for some tv work i had already agreed to do my agent was thrilled but i felt weird i didn t think i deserved it what was the best year of your financial life it was 2003 the first year i did the tv show how clean is your house i was still working four days a week at the good housekeeping institute earning around 50 000 a year then all weekend i d film the show in total i managed to earn an extra 100 000 in my spare time it felt amazing mackenzie starred in the tv show how clean is your house along with kim woodburn she says 2003 the first year she recorded the programme was the best financial year of her life when the second series was commissioned i realised i had to be brave and leave my job at good housekeeping i couldn t hack the pace of working all weekend when my children were small that s when i started being thrown all this money for doing series after series i was also getting advertising gigs and work in america in 2004 i earned 440 000 that made me feel a bit sick i didn t feel comfortable with it the most expensive thing you bought for fun it was an abstract sculpture by artist laura thomas for 1 500 i sent her pictures of colours and shapes i like and she created it based on that it still gives me a lot of pleasure what is your biggest money mistake on the advice of a friend i invested a six figure sum in a property investment scheme that promised a really good return but it turned out to be a pyramid scheme and soon folded i ve never worked out exactly how much money i lost but it would have been enough to give my children good deposits on flats so they could buy their own homes it was horrible when i found out but i ve managed to forgive myself and move on i never deserved that money in the first place the best money decision you have made deciding to leave my job at good housekeeping i had no guarantee my tv career would work out but i felt i had to seize the day i love my work and even though i m 66 i ve not even considered retiring i have a lot of freedom over how and when i work and i think that s invaluable rothiemurchus in the caingorms national park aggie mackenzie says that while she owns a home in north london her heart will always be in the scottish highlands do you save into a pension not any more there s quite enough in the plan and it seems to be making money by itself i started a pension when i was in my early 20s i was encouraged to do so by national magazine company which owns good housekeeping i m glad i did so as now i get 350 a month in pension income plus i got a tax free lump sum last year do you invest in the stock market i do through a financial adviser i have several isas and invest in a large number of investment funds i can t remember which ones but i know i don t invest in tobacco oil and arms i take 500 a month in income from my investments and yet my capital still manages to grow do you own any property yes i own the house i live in it s a modern two bedroom house in north london i bought it outright in 2016 for 770 000 after the marital home was sold following our divorce i suppose it has gone up in value since then but i m not sure i love living in london but my heart is still in the highlands and always will be what is the one luxury you treat yourself to perfume there s one i like called portrait of a lady it costs 140 for a 50ml bottle but it s my luxury and i absolutely love it if you were chancellor what would you do i would reinstate the sure start scheme which assisted families with young children living in disadvantaged areas i ve got lots of friends who work in the public sector who say the scheme made a huge difference to mums who were struggling with small children it provided places of support and safety where families who were struggling could be identified early on and the children given help at a young age by all accounts it worked really well and then it was taken away and it hasn t been replaced with anything i know it would make a huge difference to many families if it was brought back what is your number one financial priority helping my two sons get on the property ladder one is 30 and is in the process of buying with his girlfriend while the younger one is not yet ready to settle down but that s my priority to help them on their way because london rents are ridiculously expensive i d like them to have financial security and a nice place of their own to call home

moscow russia with surging natural gas prices leading again to the greater use of coal totalenergies ceo patrick pouyanne highlighted the need to achieve stable prices as lower gas prices will reduce reliance on higher polluting coal in an interview with cnbc during a russia energy week panel in moscow pouyanne said the transition to cleaner energy has also created an imbalance in the market stressing high pricing is not good news of course immediately for my company results are better but for customers it is not replacing coal with gas is good for climate change but to do that we need to have a lower price coal today is king and is cheaper than all the other sources of energy he added in europe the use of coal produced electricity has increased as european coal futures have more than doubled since the start of the year while gas prices nearly quadrupled during the same period pouyanne noted this is not merely a european gas crisis but is also a global one caused by a huge hike in demand for gas from china and asia during the cnbc panel bp ceo bernard looney stated i think that this crisis in europe has reminded us that energy is part of the lifeblood of society and that energy use is only going in one direction and that is upwards at the end of the day if supply goes away and demand does not change that only has one consequence and that is an escalation in price rises just simply correcting a supply side issue without affecting demand will not result in a more stable system it will result in a more volatile system he added in reference to the efforts of governments to reduce fossil fuel production and use additionally looney said power shortages are also impacting households and businesses around asia forcing many factories to shut down and causing supply shortages panelists noted that a transition to cleaner energy has created higher demand for gas which is considered a cleaner fuel demand is further rebounding from the covid 19 pandemic as economies reopen and international travel resumes energy price rises have also caused supply chain disruptions and a shipping container shortage which both contributed to rapid inflation said pouyanne

moscow russia with surging natural gas prices leading again to the greater use of coal totalenergies ceo patrick pouyanne highlighted the need to achieve stable prices as lower gas prices will reduce reliance on higher polluting coal in an interview with cnbc during a russia energy week panel in moscow pouyanne said the transition to cleaner energy has also created an imbalance in the market stressing high pricing is not good news of course immediately for my company results are better but for customers it is not replacing coal with gas is good for climate change but to do that we need to have a lower price coal today is king and is cheaper than all the other sources of energy he added in europe the use of coal produced electricity has increased as european coal futures have more than doubled since the start of the year while gas prices nearly quadrupled during the same period pouyanne noted this is not merely a european gas crisis but is also a global one caused by a huge hike in demand for gas from china and asia during the cnbc panel bp ceo bernard looney stated i think that this crisis in europe has reminded us that energy is part of the lifeblood of society and that energy use is only going in one direction and that is upwards at the end of the day if supply goes away and demand does not change that only has one consequence and that is an escalation in price rises just simply correcting a supply side issue without affecting demand will not result in a more stable system it will result in a more volatile system he added in reference to the efforts of governments to reduce fossil fuel production and use additionally looney said power shortages are also impacting households and businesses around asia forcing many factories to shut down and causing supply shortages panelists noted that a transition to cleaner energy has created higher demand for gas which is considered a cleaner fuel demand is further rebounding from the covid 19 pandemic as economies reopen and international travel resumes energy price rises have also caused supply chain disruptions and a shipping container shortage which both contributed to rapid inflation said pouyanne

as precious metals traders have waited out this extended sideways downward price contraction in price over the past 14 months a very broad pennant flag price formation is nearing an apex level that suggests may begin a new rally phase over the next 60 days support near 1 675 is a critical price level that has been tested three times over the past eight months the true apex of the pennant flag price formation will be reached near nov 15 2021 nearly 30 days before the u s debt ceiling issue will become another big issue in washington gold price flag initiated after 1 675 level based in march 2021 let s start with this gold daily chart i ve drawn an upper line from the peak price level in august 2020 across the recent highs in june 2021 additionally i ve drawn a lower line from the lows near september 2020 across a series of price levels that are acting as support these two major price channels have converged into a pennant flag type of price formation recently the unique price lows near march 2021 first identified the 1 675 price support level i believe the downward price trend from august 2020 to these lows in march 2021 represented a downward price wave phase for gold i also believe the recent upward price rally after the march 2021 lows and subsequent retesting of the 1 675 level while the pennant flag price pattern setup reflects a sideways price flag that is currently nearing the apex level the apex level of these types of price flags typically suggests a potentially explosive price trend will initiate possibly equal to the range of the price flag range in this case more than 250 the current price flag apex level in gold is near 1 800 a rally of 250 or more from this level would push gold up to levels near 2 100 or higher if my research is correct 1 675 must hold in order to prompt a bigger price rally in gold as the current pennant flag price formation in gold nears the apex level it is important to understand that increase price volatility will happen and there is a possibility that another downside price rotation possibly nearing 1 675 again could take place it is important that the 1 675 level continues to hold and act as support if this happens if the 1 675 level is breached then the critical support level for gold has been broken which may suggest a deeper downside price move is possible in my opinion i believe gold will attempt to settle between 1 700 and 1 860 over the next 4 weeks as we move closer to nov 15 true apex date the closer we get to that date the more likely we are going to see increased price volatility in gold and a potential for a breakout price trend the pennant flag formation which i ve drawn in magenta on the weekly gold chart below has already completed four of the five total price waves the 5th wave in this structure appears to be a bullish price breakout wave this along with what i believe will likely be an increased overall caution in the markets throughout q4 2021 and into early 2022 will push gold higher as traders move to hedge risks i wrote about the broader market trends and price patterns in may 2021 at that time i suggested a momentum base appeared to be setting up which could confirm the larger appreciation depreciation market cycles this research article was created before the current pennant flag price formation started to form overall the momentum base level in gold is still valid and the new pennant flag pattern suggests we are nearing a big breakout breakdown trend in precious metals over the next 12 to 24 months i expect very large price swings in the u s stock market and other asset classes across the globe i believe the markets are starting to transition away from the continued central bank support rally phase and may start a revaluation phase as global traders attempt to identify the next big trends precious metals will likely start to act as a proper hedge as caution and concern start to drive traders investors into metals
