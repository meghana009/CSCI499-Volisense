ben bernanke who led the federal reserve fed during the global financial crisis observed that the art of setting monetary policy was 98 talk and 2 action a significant rebalancing of that equation would be welcome after communications upheavals this week roiled markets and seemed to reveal a high degree of anxiety among central bankers while fed chairman jerome powell pledged to conquer inflation and effectively conceded a recession may be the price for doing so the process of getting to that point was messy officials in economies big and small are facing a similar dilemma quashing inflation without inducing a severe slowdown is a tricky task in the best of times and this is far from an ideal moment inflation has proven more pernicious than projected where policy makers are really tripping up is in signalling or flat out stating what their next moves will be well in advance central banks then find themselves scrambling at the last minute to reset expectations that they themselves created when inflation isn t behaving no wonder markets are unnerved have central banks inadvertently created a beast that they now can t really control consider all the fuss this week alone the fed raised its benchmark rate by 75 basis points on wednesday a bigger move than expected until just a few days ago hours earlier the european central bank convened an emergency meeting of its governing council the scheduled conclave was only last week to announce that it was hastening work on a tool to combat a surge in bond yields on tuesday the head of the reserve bank of australia went on prime time television for a rare interview where he signalled a period of substantial rate hikes lie ahead governor philip lowe had stressed last month that quarter point increments were business as usual prepare as well for spontaneous hikes in emerging markets indonesia and thailand look like prime candidates the question now is whether today s monetary chiefs dare dispense with some of the transparency to which they have allowed the public to grow accustomed a practice that would have appalled predecessors who preferred to speak in code and generalities forward guidance the art of telling people what you will likely do with the price of money before you do it worked when rates were around zero and inflation was quiescent it s clearly failing now after may s federal open market committee fomc meeting powell indicated moves of 50 basis points were his preference he repeated this expectation in a number of interviews which is why it seemed like a reasonable bet it wasn t until news articles monday however that the fed signalled 75 basis points would be more likely stocks plummeted and bonds retreated across the globe in his press conference wednesday powell said that the next hike would probably be either a repeat 75 basis point move or a return to the half point increase of may though he s given himself more wiggle room this may still end up being too specific markets recovered but who s to say gyrations won t resume again we have seen the grave shortcomings of forward guidance play out in real time this week for forward guidance to be credible today as it was for much of the prior decade a couple of key ingredients are needed the first is clear messaging this might sound obvious enough but it becomes more difficult the more specific officials get people hear a number say 50 basis points or an inflation or employment threshold required for a rate change and latch onto that tuning out the qualifiers that come with it another requirement is that the economy be in a condition that makes guidance possible with any degree of confidence when bernanke elevated forward guidance to something approaching an art form a development embraced and enhanced by his successors at the fed and policy makers across the world a plodding but lengthy recovery from the 2007 to 2009 crisis seemed like a reasonable scenario inflation appeared contained the world could be reasonably predicted though it may not have looked like smooth sailing at the time the past few years have been anything but easy to predict thanks to the pandemic the steep and short recession that followed covid s arrival the rapid snapback and the attendant surge in inflation the best days of forward guidance may be behind it bernanke nodded to some of these difficulties when he began a blog at brookings institution in washington in 2015 the year after he left the fed the downside for policy makers of course is that the cost of sending the wrong message can be high he wrote presumably that s why my predecessor alan greenspan once told a senate committee that as a central banker he had learned to mumble with great incoherence even greenspan for all his famous opacity set central banking on a path to greater openness in 1994 the fomc began publishing written statements with its rate decisions while this seems like a no brainer today it was revolutionary at the time greenspan came to appreciate that communications if used selectively and timed correctly could be a powerful tool in managing expectations of where interest rates and the economy were headed just not too much mind you forward guidance has put communications on steroids and markets on an intravenous drip while scaling back some of the excess will no doubt be greeted with howls it may just return some power to officials for all the tools at their disposal central bankers have come to look like they are prisoners of their own statements and projections time to take back some control bloomberg daniel moss is a bloomberg opinion columnist covering asian economies the views expressed here are the writer s own

the dow jones industrial average fell more than 740 points today although the markets looked fine yesterday after the federal reserve raised its benchmark lending rate by three quarters of a percentage point it didn t take long for the panic to set back in the dow jones industrial average lost more than 740 points today as investors digested the fed s biggest hike since 1994 and turned their attention to the economic outlook the dow closed the day below 30 000 for the first time in nearly a year and a half mortgage rates also soared higher as investors grew more concerned about a potential recession and the magnitude of that recession the big losers on the day were american express nike and caterpillar while the majority of the dow finished the day down there were four stocks in the index that managed to survive the blood bath the 4 survivors the big box retailer walmart wmt 0 35 finished the highest of any dow stock gaining just over 1 on the day over the last five days walmart has also managed to stay in the green despite very difficult trading conditions while we ve heard large retailers talk about the shift away from discretionary goods in recent days the consumer is still spending heavily on necessities such as groceries which can greatly benefit walmart which now generates about 60 of its revenue from groceries grocery stocks can do well in inflation because the stores can pass the higher costs onto the consumers walmart said earlier this year that it continues to take market share in the u s grocery category the company grew grocery sales in the low double digit percentage range last quarter the consumer goods giant procter gamble pg 0 08 also managed to scratch out a gain today with shares up roughly 0 6 with brands such as pampers tide bounty and gillette among many other cosmetics and household brands it made sense that investors shifted over to a stock like procter gamble today when there are concerns over a recession and rates are on the rise the market will look less favorably on tech and growth stocks because they are riskier in addition higher rates reduce the value of their future cash flows as well as their earnings power but people are still going to need paper towels diapers and shaving equipment during a recession making this stock more recession proof than others the other two stocks that eked out a gain today were merck and johnson johnson should you pile into these names i definitely don t hate the idea of adding some of these more recession proof names like walmart or procter gamble to your portfolio because people are always going to need these products making these companies potentially more durable during the volatility but that doesn t mean i wouldn t also take this sell off as an opportunity to go bargain hunting if a recession occurs it could end up being a mild one and recessions don t always last that long either when looking for discounts take a long view and focus on the business model as opposed to near term price action

our appetite for meat is costing us dearly animal agriculture is among the leading causes of deforestation and other forms of environmental degradation and meat is responsible for almost 60 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions from all food production if nothing changes the food sector will soon account for almost half of the world s total emissions budget assuming we wish to contain global warming to only 1 5 c by 2050 the recommendation of the intergovernmental panel on climate change trying to meet this goal without addressing animal agriculture would require other sectors to reduce emission beyond realistic levels subscribe to our newsletter weekly updates from the frontlines of neuroscience genetics longevity synthetic biology the future of food and more global meat consumption meanwhile has dramatically increased over the last few decades and is still on the rise projected to grow by about 14 percent by the end of this decade on the other hand phasing out animal agriculture entirely over the next 15 years could stabilize greenhouse gas levels for 30 years and offset 68 percent of carbon emissions according to a model run by researchers at stanford and berkeley less drastic and more realistic action would still be beneficial according to a study by the potsdam institute for climate impact research in germany just by swapping a fifth of meat for microbial proteins we could halve deforestation and related carbon emissions by 2050 such needs breed opportunity for the many companies willing to try their luck in this space and one of those is a startup called air protein that was founded by scientist turned entrepreneur lisa dyson she has a phd in physics from mit and has worked at stanford berkeley princeton and the department of energy s berkeley lab where she met fellow scientist john reed in 2008 the pair founded kiverdi a company that now holds dozens of patents on technologies to turn recycled carbon dioxide into alternative fuels in 2019 they spun off air protein which is based on the same idea of turning captured carbon into something useful their idea draws its inspiration from 1960s nasa studies about the challenges of feeding astronauts during hypothetical journeys to other planets it turns out there s an almost logical solution if you re on a long space journey on a spaceship asking how do you feed people is about the same question as how do you recycle carbon says dyson who made this the subject of a ted talk in 2016 air protein founder lisa dyson recycling carbon microbial proteins produced through fermentation are one of three main types of alternative proteins competing in a marketplace recently valued at 4 5 billion plant based products currently dominate the market and lab grown animal cells or cultivated meat is still largely in the research stage although they only hold a modest fraction of that market microbial proteins have been around for decades quorn made from high protein biomass obtained by fermenting a fungus called fusarium was launched in 1985 and accounts for the vast majority of the microbial protein consumed worldwide with sales of 156 million in the first half of 2021 of which just 14 million in the united states fermentation itself is historically one of the main ways of preparing and preserving foods dating back to ancient times and it leverages the growth of microorganisms anything from fungi to bacteria to transform ingredients into such marvels as bread yogurt cheese chocolate and alcoholic drinks in modern food production it s also used to make vitamins and enzymes that are then incorporated into a myriad of processed foods in the 1960s nasa wanted to make food by capturing the carbon dioxide breathed out by the astronauts concentrating it and then feeding it to microbes in a fermentation vessel that s essentially what air protein does we start with a process that s like making yogurt dyson explains if you look at traditional fermentation today to feed the system it uses glucose or sugar which is made up of carbon hydrogen and oxygen instead of glucose molecules we feed our system the individual elements carbon dioxide hydrogen and oxygen the cultures eat that and we end up with a high protein ingredient that has all the essential amino acids as well as bioavailable vitamins and minerals dyson says the product is like a high protein flour once we have that she says we then apply culinary techniques think of wheat flour and turning it into pasta to get texture and structure essentially what you re looking for when you bite into a steak or chicken breast then we add some spices and flavoring and we end up with air meat it would take a soy farm the size of texas to produce the same amount of protein that could be made in an air farm the size of a single neighborhood in houston the process is fast the cultures double in size every few hours which puts it ahead of even cultured meat to say nothing of the years it takes to produce meat by raising animals the technology to make a steak which is a cow takes two years and for that whole two years you re using lots of water and lots of land either through grazing or to grow soy to feed the cow which has the greenhouse gas footprint of a car dyson says by contrast our process takes a few days to make a steak has very low water utilization is carbon negative uses zero arable land and minimal land overall to be precise air protein says it uses 112 000 times less water and 524 000 times less land per kilogram than traditional meat production meaning it would take a soy farm the size of texas to produce the same amount of protein that could be made in an air farm the size of a single neighborhood in houston air protein first made a chicken equivalent in this way in 2019 and has since made scallops dyson says they have beef pork and more products in the pipeline that all sounds great but what do these products actually taste like as of yet there has never been a public tasting and only a small handful of unnamed people have tried them i m biased of course but other people have said they could feed it to their families and they d have no idea it s not real chicken dyson says one executive of a large food service chain thinks it s ready for retail we asked air protein to connect us with someone else who has tasted the product for another opinion but the company declined it will take at least a few more years before air meat hits supermarket shelves the microbes involved in the process are not yet approved for food production which means anyone sampling the meat now has to sign a liability waiver first dyson says air protein is currently working with the u s food and drug administration to gain a gras generally recognized as safe approval and early talks are underway with the european food service agency although the plan is to launch in the united states first engineering unknowns if fermentation has been around forever and the idea of using it to capture carbon dioxide and turn it into protein is at least 60 years old why hasn t this been done before because it s hard sums up dyson adding that because the process differs from traditional sugar based fermentation existing infrastructure facilities and bioreactors or fermentation vessels aren t suitable and need to be retrofitted and tweaked we had to invent and develop a way to do it and then make it as commercializable and economically attractive as possible she says scaling up production from existing infrastructure is already a huge challenge for the alternative protein industry but building an entirely new one could be daunting liz specht a biomolecular engineer and vp of science and technology at the good food institute a nonprofit think tank that advocates for alternative proteins and tracks the industry says that she believes that air protein s novel process could represent a production bottleneck access to infrastructure will be a challenge because there s just not a lot of ready to go fermentation facilities that aren t already being used by other industries she says from an engineering perspective there are still some unknowns these microbes are fixing carbon in a way that s pretty different from how plants do it and they re not very well characterized we don t have a long track record of industrial scale cultivation she adds almost all of the fermentation done historically has used sugar based carbon sources so there s a lot more working knowledge and experience in that field fermentation also requires very concentrated carbon dioxide to get growth so at the moment air protein is sourcing it in canisters from third party producers who obtain it as a by product of burning natural gas for ammonia and hydrogen production or the fermentation processes of beer and whisky it s certainly possible to be sustainable in terms of where that concentrated carbon dioxide comes from says specht adding that taking it from the air might be more complicated than it sounds dyson nevertheless thinks it s possible by using a process known as direct air capture which pulls carbon dioxide from the air although that technology is also still in its infancy even so that wouldn t necessarily be a sustainability upgrade according to ruben morawicki a professor of food sciences at johnson wales university in rhode island many industrial processes generate co2 as a by product so if this can be used for further processing it is a sustainability triumph he says starting with co2 captured from the atmosphere on the other hand would create an additional sustainability hurdle carbon capture needs energy plus other resources therefore when the environmental impact of carbon capture is added to the air protein system then the global benefit may not be so great specht sees the lack of land use as a major sustainability advantage for air protein you re not having to grow agricultural sugar based feedstock and the fact that you ve got a new class of organisms that wouldn t be competing to share that feedstock could be really beneficial from a scaling perspective she adds there is also a reduced contamination risk when working with microbes that don t grow on sugar feedstocks where many undesirable bacteria can also grow in more general terms morawicki thinks air protein s concept is exciting but not without concerns many attempts have been made to produce something using carbon dioxide as a precursor the problem with co2 is that it is the most oxidized form of carbon and therefore inert and from the energy point of view it is an uphill battle to convert it into something useful nature has its process of doing this it is called photosynthesis and is very inefficient just a fraction of one percent of the incident energy on plants is transformed into sugars so if the air protein technology is more efficient than photosynthesis it could be viable he says scallops made from air protein scaling up alternative proteins as a whole will need to scale up considerably to achieve change our latest data indicates that alternative proteins currently represent about 1 5 percent of total u s meat consumption and closer to 1 percent globally says specht quite a few analysts are looking at 5 percent to 10 percent by 2030 and then it could scale quicker beyond that but chris dubois senior vice president for protein practice at data analytics and market research company iri thinks that may be overly optimistic i don t see the basis for it there would have to be a tremendous amount of change in the industry in the formulations in the process in consumer acceptance to even think about getting to 4 percent he says sales of meat substitutes have fallen by 5 8 percent in the past year according to iri i think what we re seeing is a plateau we have just about as many new customers as people who are leaving the category we re also seeing people who remain in the category but slow down their purchase levels it s not bad it s just not growth says dubois there s still a lot of different oils and ingredients that don t look like food and that s holding the market back the stock market value of los angeles based beyond meat the maker of popular plant based burger patties and other foods is only a fifth of what it was just a year ago in late 2021 after a sharp decline in sales credit suisse market analyst robert moskow wrote in a research note that consumer interest in beyond is simply reaching a peak following disappointing revenue in the first quarter of 2022 beyond meat stock traded below the original ipo price of 25 for the first time according to dubois to accelerate growth the sector needs to create a stronger case for the sustainability of its products which as of today hasn t been proven the second big thing is to clean up the labels beyond meat has done a nice job but there s still a lot of different oils and ingredients that don t look like food and that s holding the market back he adds information opacity on ingredients and manufacturing processes are a key concern for consumers according to a survey on 1 025 people in the united states run by c o nxt and menu matters almost half of participants said they want to understand more about how alternative protein foods are created price parity is perhaps the biggest barrier in terms of greater consumer adoption according to specht since plant based meat is still two to four times the price of conventional meat scaling up is what dyson is focusing on at the moment that s the main thing we re doing now she says once that s up and running we ll have larger volumes and in the near future we ll have consumer events continuing to improve on taste and texture is of course one of the main challenges to consumer acceptance but dyson believes people will buy into air protein s sustainability story we are accelerating the transition to a climate friendly food system she says right now the food sector contributes more greenhouse gasses to the environment than the entire transportation sector so the way we re making food today is not going to sustain us when we hit 10 billion people by 2050 her vision for the future is also down to business we are building our own brand and taking our message directly to consumers we re trying to create a future where this is just considered meat where carbon negative fermentation is the way things are made she says you re eating the outcome of that she says and it s delicious nutritious and also good for the planet

the dow jones industrial average fell more than 740 points today although the markets looked fine yesterday after the federal reserve raised its benchmark lending rate by three quarters of a percentage point it didn t take long for the panic to set back in the dow jones industrial average lost more than 740 points today as investors digested the fed s biggest hike since 1994 and turned their attention to the economic outlook the dow closed the day below 30 000 for the first time in nearly a year and a half mortgage rates also soared higher as investors grew more concerned about a potential recession and the magnitude of that recession the big losers on the day were american express nike and caterpillar while the majority of the dow finished the day down there were four stocks in the index that managed to survive the blood bath the 4 survivors the big box retailer walmart wmt 0 35 finished the highest of any dow stock gaining just over 1 on the day over the last five days walmart has also managed to stay in the green despite very difficult trading conditions while we ve heard large retailers talk about the shift away from discretionary goods in recent days the consumer is still spending heavily on necessities such as groceries which can greatly benefit walmart which now generates about 60 of its revenue from groceries grocery stocks can do well in inflation because the stores can pass the higher costs onto the consumers walmart said earlier this year that it continues to take market share in the u s grocery category the company grew grocery sales in the low double digit percentage range last quarter the consumer goods giant procter gamble pg 0 08 also managed to scratch out a gain today with shares up roughly 0 6 with brands such as pampers tide bounty and gillette among many other cosmetics and household brands it made sense that investors shifted over to a stock like procter gamble today when there are concerns over a recession and rates are on the rise the market will look less favorably on tech and growth stocks because they are riskier in addition higher rates reduce the value of their future cash flows as well as their earnings power but people are still going to need paper towels diapers and shaving equipment during a recession making this stock more recession proof than others the other two stocks that eked out a gain today were merck and johnson johnson should you pile into these names i definitely don t hate the idea of adding some of these more recession proof names like walmart or procter gamble to your portfolio because people are always going to need these products making these companies potentially more durable during the volatility but that doesn t mean i wouldn t also take this sell off as an opportunity to go bargain hunting if a recession occurs it could end up being a mild one and recessions don t always last that long either when looking for discounts take a long view and focus on the business model as opposed to near term price action

that s when drummond formally joined leading and building kami s sales team he s been described as kami s designated adult a term drummond says reflects the special sauce he brings to the company but he s quick to warn experienced entrepreneurs might sometimes be talking to their past selves when giving advice there s a risk the world they re talking about which they re basing their advice on no longer exists he says adding he s been guilty of it too as he started building an industry standard cloud business sales team for kami he quickly realised the revenue structure wasn t sustainable in the long term so he dumped it and started over if he d been on the outside advising he wouldn t have recognised the industry dynamics had changed and that it needed a new revenue model he reflects wang reminds me of the stat that nine out of 10 startups fail so the odds were immediately stacked against kami like so many entrepreneurs their first few years were lean and few investors were willing to take a chance on them he says drummond adds that venture capitalists kept advising that education was a graveyard for startups many had tried to transform the classroom only to peter out yet digital devices such as google s chromebook and apple s ipad were hitting the market in the 2010s and teachers in north america would send unsolicited feedback on how much they enjoyed kami kami chief revenue officer bob drummond photo supplied figuring out who to sell to was a critical decision for the co founders at one point lawyers real estate agents media companies architects essentially everyone but teachers were using kami so much so that 99 of its revenue came from non education customers all wanting to take the company in different directions wang says it was a high stakes decision and drummond had seen it before my input at that point was focus or die we cannot make everybody happy we will all just get spread thin we have to choose a market he says you agonise for ages did we just turn down our biggest opportunity without realising it but all the success we have today comes from that one decision that we forced ourselves to make even if it means declining other lottery tickets startups like kami need to embrace the risk of focusing on one thing he says after all a ship in harbour is safe but that is not what ships are built for an opportunity is more like a ticket to do work drummond says it s an open door but there s a lot of work on the other side and if you go through there you re not going to be over here doing this job and you re going to do a half assed job on a bunch of things wang is emphatic that kami wouldn t be where it is without drummond s tremendous impact but it s not done growing nearly 1 5 billion students were affected by a 21st century pandemic that accelerated the uptake of digital learning solutions and pushed education systems toward learning from home the chief executive says kami is still barely scratching the surface of potential users as the call ends i notice unichem s blue and orange branding and remember wang is in a pharmacy sorry i ve gotta run and get something stuck up my nose it was a pleasure to speak

lambrecht told reporters as she arrived for a second day of talks with her nato counterparts in brussels german ex chancellor seeks to recuperate parliamentary office former german chancellor gerhard schröder has sent a letter to the bundestag budget committee that challenges the decision to revoke his right to a parliamentary office schröder was germany s chancellor from 1998 to 2005 after leaving office he was involved with russian energy firms gazprom and rosneft since moscow s invasion of ukraine he has drawn criticism for his ties to moscow the committee voted in may to wind down his office the office was allocated more than 400 00 418 000 last year in a letter to the committee s chair schröder s lawyer said that the former chancellor had learned via the media that his office was being put on hold this decision is based on the determination that he no longer has any continuing obligations arising from the office schröders lawyer said in the letter adding that this determination is not substantiated and that it was unclear what these continuing obligations would constitute the letter also argues that a resolution taken from the media is evidently illegal and unconstitutional schröder s lawyer said that he hopes for the chance to reach a mutually acceptable settlement by way of conversation on an even playing field gazprom cuts gas supply to germany by around 60 in 2 days russian energy giant gazprom has begun reducing the volume of gas it supplies to germany via the nord stream 1 pipeline to a daily maximum of 67 million cubic meters early on thursday on tuesday gazprom announced it would reduce the maximum delivery volume to 100 million cubic meters of gas per day down from 167 million cubic meters overall the cut represents an approximate 60 reduction in gas supplies to germany in just two days german economy minister robert habeck accused moscow of attempting to create unease and increase gas prices he added that it was still possible to source alternative gas supplies on the market albeit at a high price report 2 us volunteers in ukraine missing two americans who volunteered to support ukraine s armed forces have

disappearance but that if it s true we ll do everything we can to get them safely back home kirby went on to discourage americans from volunteering to fight in ukraine it is a war zone it is combat and if you feel passionate about supporting ukraine there s any number of other ways to do that that are safer and just as effective kirby said ukraine says russian companies use georgian entities to bypass sanctions david arakhamia ukraine s chief negotiator with russia said russian people and companies are circumventing western sanctions by making use of georgian entities to do so he told a german marshall fund event in washington that russians are heavily using georgian banks georgian financial system georgian companies and so on to dodge the west s sanctions regime if you are a sanctioned russian person you go to the internet you open up a georgian company open up remotely the bank account and start processing arakhamia added he also urged washington to take action to close the loophole what happened in russia s invasion of ukraine on wednesday ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy said defending the donbas region in eastern ukraine was vital as the outcome would

after conducting its own internal investigation activision blizzard s board of directors claims it has found no evidence to suggest that its senior executives and its own members ignored or downplayed gender harassment it s also urging its shareholders to vote against an upcoming proposal to craft a report about its own efforts to prevent abuse and harassment in a new sec filing activision blizzard asserted he board and its external advisors have determined that there is no evidence to suggest that activision blizzard senior executives ever intentionally ignored or attempted to downplay the instances of gender harassment that occurred and were reported that work also has not unearthed any evidence directly or indirectly suggesting any attempt by any senior executive or employee to conceal information from the board outside advisors after exhaustive review also determined the board never intentionally ignored or attempted to downplay the instances of gender harassment that occurred and were reported the initial complaint from the state of california filed after a two year long investigation accuses the company leadership of knowing about and failing to prevent numerous internal cultural issues subsequent reports and lawsuits have similarly included accusations that incidents were reported and either ignored or brushed aside with little meaningful consequences for the perpetrators after the initial slate of allegations over 20 employees had been fired as a result by the following october and over 20 more had been otherwise disciplined activision blizzard lawsuit timeline the story so far 68 images notably activision blizzard s committee response focuses specifically on harassment that occurred and was reported as defined by the company sweeping allegations against activision blizzard the internal investigation in question was first announced back in november following a california lawsuit and a sweeping wave of allegations of abuse harassment and gender related disparities at the company among them was the accusation that ceo bobby kotick knew of many of the issues at the company but failed to take action the activision blizzard board of directors backed kotick in a statement at the time saying it remained confident that bobby kotick appropriately addressed workplace issues brought to his attention as allegations mounted the board established a workplace responsibility committee to conduct its own internal investigation of the allegations the committee was run by activision independent director dawn ostroff and fellow independent director reveta bowers also joined the committee in april five months after the investigation was announced lulu cheng meservey was added to the board and joined the committee the committee s investigative work is said to have included reviewing individual instances of harassment as well as company policies and procedures reviewing source documents such as employee emails and interviews and conducting its own interviews of current and former employees the committee claims to have worked with the assistance of external advisors including law firms and experts in workplace issues to come to these conclusions but has only named one specific external advisor in its report gilbert casellas casellas is a former chair of the equal employment opportunity commission and his role in the investigation is said by activision blizzard to have involved reviewing data from investigated reports of gender harassment from across the us between 2016 and 2021 from these casellas concluded that there was no widespread harassment pattern or practice of harassment or systemic harassment at activision blizzard or at any of its business units during that timeframe mr casellas further concluded that based on the volume of reports the amount of misconduct reflected is comparatively low for a company the size of activision blizzard he board and its external advisors have determined that there is no evidence to suggest that activision blizzard senior executives ever intentionally ignored or attempted to downplay the instances of gender harassment that occurred and were reported no further detail was offered as to what specific elements of activision blizzard s workplace culture casellas was offered to look over as comparison points to reach this conclusion ign has reached out to activision blizzard to clarify who else was involved on this committee as well as what the nature of casellas contribution was and will update this article if a response is received activision blizzard s conclusions about itself come ahead of an upcoming meeting of shareholders during which a number of measures will be voted on including a shareholder proposal to prepare a report about its efforts to prevent abuse harassment and discrimination activision blizzard is actively urging its shareholders to vote against the compilation of such a report it s also discouraging shareholders from voting against a proposal for a director candidate to be added to the board that would be selected by activision blizzard s non management employees the latter proposal was suggested among other reasons as particularly beneficial in light of recent allegations regarding sexual misconduct at the company activision ceo bobby kotick reportedly had known for years about alleged sexual assault at the company but did not inform the board finally the company is advocating shareholders vote for approval of its executive compensation package which includes reverting kotick back to his 875 000 annual salary after he reduced it last october to 62 500 amidst calls for his resignation due to the allegations against him and the company kotick s actual pay is typically significantly higher due to stock and numerous other bonuses and awards though he opted out of several of these last year due to the work culture allegations as well as repeated criticism of his compensation package kotick remains eligible for several million in bonuses as early as july 18 if the board determines he has sufficiently made progress in improving the company s culture rebekah valentine is a

washington president joe biden told the associated press on thursday that the american people are really really down after a tumultuous two years with the coronavirus pandemic volatility in the economy and now surging gasoline prices that are slamming family budgets he said a recession is not inevitable and bristled at claims by republican lawmakers that last year s covid 19 aid plan was fully to blame for inflation reaching a 40 year high calling that argument bizarre as for the overall american mindset biden said people are really really down they re really down he said the need for mental health in america it has skyrocketed because people have seen everything upset everything they ve counted on upset but most of it s the consequence of what s happened what happened as a consequence of the covid crisis speaking to the ap in a 30 minute oval office interview biden addressed the warnings by economists that the united states could be headed for a recession first of all it s not inevitable he said secondly we re in a stronger position than any nation in the world to overcome this inflation as for the causes of inflation biden flashed some defensiveness on that count if it s my fault why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher you ask yourself that i m not being a wise guy he said the president said he saw reason for optimism with the 3 6 unemployment rate and america s relative strength in the world be confident because i am confident we re better positioned than any country in the world to own the second quarter of the 21st century biden said that s not hyperbole that s a fact biden s bleak assessment of the national psyche comes as voters have soured on his job performance and the direction of the country only 39 of u s adults approve of biden s performance as president according to a may poll from the associated press norc center for public research dipping from already negative ratings a month earlier overall only about 2 in 10 adults said the u s is heading in the right direction or that the economy is good both down from about 3 in 10 in april those drops were concentrated among democrats with just 33 within the president s party saying the country is headed in the right direction down from 49 in april the president outlined some of the hard choices he has faced saying the u s needed to stand up to russian president vladimir putin for invading ukraine in february even though tough sanctions imposed as a result of that war have caused gas prices to surge creating a political risk for biden in an election year he called on oil companies to think of the world s short term needs and increase production asked why he ordered the financial penalties against moscow that have disrupted food and energy markets globally biden said he made his calculation as commander in chief rather than as a politician thinking about the election i m the president of the united states he said it s what s best in the country no kidding no kidding so what happens what happens if the strongest power in nato the organizational structure we put together walked away from russian aggression biden spun out the possibility of chaos in europe if an unimpeded russia kept moving deeper into the continent china was emboldened to take over taiwan and north korea grew even more aggressive with its nuclear weapon ambitions biden renewed his contention that major oil companies have benefited from higher prices without increasing production as much as they should he said the companies needed to think of the world in the short term not just their investors don t just reward yourselves he said consumer prices have jumped 8 6 over the past year the steepest rise in more than 40 years republican lawmakers have said that biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package from last year kick started a spiral of price increases the president said there was zero evidence for that claim noting that other countries have endured higher prices as economies reopened and people became vaccinated still biden acknowledged treasury secretary janet yellen s contention that the spending had a limited inflationary effect you could argue whether it had on the margin a minor impact on inflation he said i don t think it did and most economists do not but the idea that it caused inflation is bizarre still high inflation has created a conundrum for biden he prioritized bringing back millions of jobs and has seen the unemployment rate return to close to pre pandemic levels the federal reserve on wednesday increased its benchmark interest rate in hopes of slowing the economy and pulling inflation down to its target rate of 2 the tightening of fed policy has caused financial markets to slump and led many economists to warn of a potential recession next year the president encouraged americans to stay patient they shouldn t believe a warning he said they should just say let s say

washington ap a transcript of an oval office interview thursday with president joe biden by ap white house reporter josh boak where the audio recording of the interview is unclear ellipses or a notation that the recording was unintelligible are used ap i wanted to thank you for taking the time to do this biden sure happy to ap and i m really interested in how you re thinking and how you re making choices during what seems like a really unique time in american history biden well i m making choices it s an interesting question i m making choices like i always have in the sense that circumstances change but my objective doesn t change does that make sense to you for example i have uh from the time i ve entered public life it s been about how to give ordinary working class and middle class folks a shot inaudible instead of everything being viewed as from the top down i m not a big is it working a reference to the tape recorder ap yeah we re good biden i m not a big believer in trickle down economy and um and so everything i look at from the time i took this office but even before that when i was a senator all those years is what s the best shot to grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out because when that happens everybody does well the wealthy do very very well and the biggest thing i think that when i came into this job that i have the greatest frustration with the last four years is that um uh everything was constructed and built and arranged in order for the top 1 to 3 of the population to do very well the rest was sort of i mean that literally everything else seemed to be an afterthought ap so let me ask about that right because you ve seen the polls there s a lot of voters who are very pessimistic when i look at the consumer sentiment survey the university of michigan puts out even democrats began to get really worried about a year ago regarding the economy and we ve had people that have basically been through a pandemic shortages of basic goods inflation some of the political divisions you re seeing right now on the hill with the jan 6 hearings and also a war in europe and how do you as a president provide a sense of stability and strength crosstalk biden well if you notice until gas prices started going up which was about the same time the university of michigan survey they had a very different view things were much more they were much more optimistic we came in and we started to grow the economy in significant ways we were able to ah you know go from 2 million shots in arms to 225 million people were having access to dealing with the pandemic we started opening up businesses and opening up access to go back to work etc but then in my experience the way i was raised if you want a direct barometer of what people are going to talk about at the kitchen table and the dining room table and whether things are going well it s the cost of food and what s the cost of of gasoline at the pump i mean literally at the pump and if you notice you know uh gasoline went up a you know 1 25 right off the bat almost when the putin s war started um and as i said at the time by the way i made it clear with helping ukraine and organizing nato to help ukraine that this was going to cost there was going to be a price to pay for it it was this is not going to be cost free but we had the option of doing nothing was worse if he in fact moved into ukraine took hold of ukraine and belarus where it is and he s been a threat to nato all those things would have even been more dire ap why is that because it seems like you knew the risks on ukraine with regard to higher gasoline prices biden sure ap that carried political risks for you at home biden sure ap so when when your aides said look at the situation how did you make that choice what would you tell someone in latrobe pennsylvania biden i m the president of the united states it s not about my political survival it s about what s best for the country no kidding no kidding so what happens what happens if the strongest power nato an organizational structure we put together walked away from russian aggression of over 100 000 troops marching across a border to try to to occupy and wipe out a culture of an entire people what then then what happens what happens next what do we do next ap what did you fear would happen next if you didn t do biden oh i fear what would happen next is you d see chaos in europe you would see the possibility they continue to move you already saw what they re doing in belarus what would happen in the surrounding countries watch what would happen in poland and and the czech republic and all the members of nato for example you know the reason putin said he was going to go in was because he didn t want them to join nato and uh he he he he wanted the sort of the finland ization of nato he got the nato ization of finland instead laughter no i m serious ap yeah biden and so the idea that if the united states stood by then what does china think about taiwan then what does north korea think about nuclear weapons beyond testing and pressure ap do you think americans have that sense of the stakes on a daily basis biden no i don t but i don t think look on a daily basis most households just trying to figure out how to put before even when things were going well just figure out how to put food on the table take care of the kids pay for their education just basic things you know look um one of the i ve always suggested to younger people that want to get into public life i ask them two things have you figured out what s worth losing over have you figured out what s worth losing over if you haven t figured that out don t get in politics go into a more profitable org enterprise go into business go into commerce don t be engaged but unless you know what s worth losing over don t get engaged number one number two the purpose of public service is to promote views that you think are best for the american people i made a commitment and i think i can say that i ve never broken if i make a commitment i wasn t going to run again this time i mean for real i was not going to run i just lost my son i was teaching at penn i liked it until all those guys came come out of the woods ap charlottesville biden the charlottesville folks and this other guy said good people on both sides when an innocent woman was killed etc and i made a decision i ve been doing this too long to do anything other than to try to do what was right i mean i m not there s nothing noble about it but it s not worth it so you asked me what would i say to the american people i d say to the american people i ve done foreign policy my whole career i m convinced that if we let russia roll and putin roll he wouldn t stop ap let me ask on another hard choice you made when you came into office it seems as though you made the choice to prioritize job growth republicans right now are saying to voters that inflation started with your covid relief package biden zero evidence of that zero evidence of that number one number two we ve reduced the deficit by 350 billion last year we reduced the deficit by a trillion 700 billion this year we grow the economy today today we have more people employed than in a long long time and we gained another 8 6 million jobs and guess what we still have hundreds of thousands of job openings ap so so do you think that when treasury secretary yellen said it might have made a marginal contribution to inflation that that was off did anyone apprise you interrupted biden yeah they apprised me ap of possible trade offs biden now you just said two different things you said republicans said i caused inflation she said it may have a marginal impact on it two different things you could argue whether it had a marginal minor impact on inflation i don t think it did and most economists do not think it did but the idea that it caused inflation is bizarre ap let me ask stepping back after yesterday s fed meeting i know that you ve said look our economy is strong we have these jobs it s the best look we ve had in decades but then you ve got serious economists who warn of a recession next year biden sure ap what should americans believe biden they shouldn t believe a warning they should just say let s see let s see which is correct and from my perspective you talked about a recession first of all it s not inevitable secondly we re in a stronger position than any nation in the world to overcome this inflation it s bad isn t it kind of interesting if it s my fault why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher you ask yourself that i m not being a wise guy someone should ask themself that question why why is it if it s a consequence of our spending we ve reduced the deficit we ve increased employment increased pay there was a survey done uh uh by the uh i forget which one it was which one it was now about three months ago you had more people had lower debt inaudible credit cards more savings in their savings account higher pay in the job they had more satisfaction in the job they had and they were in good shape financially ap i believe that was a fed survey you see this interesting shift though in the census pulse surveys which show people are clearly employed in a way they haven t been they are less dependent on unemployment benefits and the government for aid and yet more of them say they re having trouble with meeting their weekly expenses biden well two things ap what s that paradox biden well i think the paradox is part of it is i think what the failure of the last administration to act on covid had a profound impact on the number of people who got covid and the number of people who died now here s what i m i think vivek murthy is right and most of the international and national psychological association whatever it s people are really really down they re really down their need for mental health in america has skyrocketed because people have seen everything upset everything they counted on upset but most of it s a consequence of of of what s happening what happened is a consequence of the the covid crisis people lost their jobs people are out of their jobs and then were they going to get back to work schools were closed think of this i think we vastly underestimate this if you had and instead of your child being how old five ap five biden five years old if your child had been 17 years old two years ago ap i m not ready for that biden well get ready man boy or girl ap girl biden well i ll tell you what she s gonna she s going to be crazy about you until about age 13 and then hang on but all kidding aside here s the deal think about what it s like for the graduating classes of the last three years no proms no graduation no no none of the things that celebrate who we are think about it across the board how isolated we ve become how separated we ve become even practical questions like you know can you go out on a date i mean inaudible the normal socialization how does that take place there s overwhelming evidence it s had a profound impact on the psyche of parents children across the board and we lost a million people and nine for every according to a study of those million people nine significant family or close friends were left alive after they re gone ap so you re talking about a country that has undergone profound psychological trauma biden yes ap what can you as a president do to address that psychology biden be confident ap to make people feel more optimistic be confident biden be confident be confident because i am confident we are better positioned than any country in the world to own the second quarter of the 21st century that s not hyperbole that s a fact ap and do you think that s because the u s is stronger or because you see countries like china hitting speedbumps biden look i ve spent more time with xi jinping than anybody any other world leader imagine let me put it let me ask you a rhetorical question and you know i mean obviously you don t have to answer any of the questions ap i ll answer whatever you need biden no no no no no but think of this name me a single major company country in the world where that world leader wouldn t trade places with my problems for his in a heartbeat name me one not a joke ap do you think that biden there are none ap well so so i mean do you think people wouldn t want to be in switzerland right now biden no switzerland has their own problems right now when i said major i meant major power so but no i mean you know i just had the the american you know the whole hemisphere beautiful countries in the caribbean and beautiful countries that are have that are middle class countries that are having serious problems everybody s having them in the meantime we have a little thing called climate change going on and it s having profound impacts we got the tundra melting we ve got the north pole i mean so people are looking and and i think it s totally understandable that they are worried because they look around and see my god everything is changing we have more hurricanes and tornadoes and flooding people saw what i took my kids years ago to yellowstone park they call me daddy did you see what happened at yellowstone right well it s unthinkable these are 1 000 year kinds of events ap and yet you face a possible tradeoff in that climate change has this big impact and yet americans are unhappy about the cost of gasoline biden sure ap and fossil fuels and i m curious like what does that mean for you if you have to say we need to increase production in the short term and companies say but we don t have the long term incentives biden well i say in the short term do the right thing instead of you know they ve made 315 or 16 billion 35 billion dollars these major oil companies in the first quarter so i think it s three twelve five i don t know how many times inaudible don t buy back your own stock don t don t just reward yourselves i mean look here s what a lot happened one of the things i ran on when i was running is that i i come from the corporate capital of the world delaware more corporations incorporated in my state than all the rest of the united states combined not a joke literally and you know they try to make me my fr the maga party tries to make me out to be this socialist i got elected seven times not just six seven times in that state but one of the things that s changed is the notion of what constitutes corporate responsibility the fact that you re in a situation where you have a fortune 500 company you got 55 paid zero taxes made 40 billion dollars those surveys also show nobody including republicans in suburbia think the tax system is fair billionaires paying 8 all these things that are occurring that have to be shifted it used to be for example i ll give you one example it used to am i holding up aide tells biden time is almost up biden ok ap so let me ask you because you brought it up your domestic agenda in speeches you ve said your domestic agenda is key for helping the middle class and beating inflation biden yes ap do you have the votes as of today because biden yes i think it s changing well first of all i had the votes if i had told you garble you re not doing inaudible i m impressed by your objectivity how you write i m not being i shouldn t say that on the record because then you ll get in trouble ap i m in trouble anyway so it s ok biden but all kidding aside usually inaudible the question i get asked in the beginning with the recovery act can you get this passed how can you possibly do that i got 1 9 trillion dollars saved the economy it used to be long lines people in nice cars like we drive lined up just to get a box of food in their trunk people getting kicked out onto the street because they couldn t pay the rent thousands and thousands of people and guess what it worked secondly no here s the important point the second piece of this is that it also saw to it that we were able to provide for the funding for covid not only not only the shots and the shots in arms but also all the hospital costs we were able to reduce the cost of insurance my point is people would say how can you get that done if i did if any other president just passed that act and the infrastructure bill they d say god almighty name me a president that s done anything like that before at the same time aide tells biden time is up ap i guess one of the reasons why i ask is you did something revolutionary on child poverty and you know it with the child tax credit an idea that came in part from newt gingrich back in the day contract with america and a lot of families had hope from that they moved out of public housing biden that s right ap and then last year they learned that their incomes were effectively going down biden yep ap and so when you present your agenda to the public the reason why i m asking if you have the votes is because people really want to know biden sure they want to know and on that answer is no not one single republican not one not one would vote to extend it we re 50 50 and we lost one democrat vote so i m one vote short on that piece but for example i m going to be able to get god willing the ability to pay for prescription drugs there s more than one way to bring down the cost for working folks gasoline may be up to 5 a gallon but somebody who has a child with stage two diabetes is paying up to a thousand bucks a month for the insulin we can reduce it to 35 bucks a month and get it done we have the votes to do it we re gonna get that done that kinda thing i can t get it all done that s why i need the inaudible vote one more thing let s look at what our republican friends are going to have to face with the supreme court decision on roe what they re going to have to face in terms of the supreme court the failure the failure of this republican party to be willing to do anything to deal with the basic social concerns of the country and so i think you know i fully understand why the average voter out there is just confused and upset and worried and they re worried for example you know can they send their kid back to back to college what s going to happen are we going to take away the ability of people to borrow so i think there s a lot of reasons for people to want to know what comes next and do i have the votes i believe i have the votes to do a number of things one prescription drugs reduce utility bills by providing for uh i think we ll be able to get the ability to have a tax incentive for winterization which would they estimate bring down the average bill for the family normal home 500 bucks a year i think we would be able we re gonna get another 57 billion for semiconductors so we don t have the supply chain problem we had before keeping down the cost of vehicles i think we re going to be in a situation where we re gonna i know we are where we re going to reduce a person s average internet bill by 30 bucks a month because we have the money through the through the uh uh infrastructure bill to provide internet across country i think we re going to be able to have a fair tax system to have the votes it s going to be close to have a minimum tax on corporations of 15 make sure we re in a situation where the people who in fact are the idea that a billionaire is paying 8 of income and a teacher is paying 22 i think we re going to be able to get tax increases on super wealthy not a lot not a lot i m a capitalist you should be able to inaudible for god s sake pay your fair share just pay pay a piece of what you owe and i think we re gonna be able to do those kinds of things ap were you surprised crosstalk aide tells biden time is up biden i know i m supposed to go that s the last question ap were you surprised because you referenced the reason why you ran was charlottesville and i m curious have you been surprised when you say republicans weren t going to work with you at all on some of these issues did that surprise you given what you knew that compelled you to run and how do you deal with that environment and how does that compare to your predecessors who are on the wall biden well my predecessor on the wall didn t pass the inaudible his first year number one number two the reason you know why that predecessor is on the wall you never saw his picture in this office before i asked my brother to put together the office for me decide what desk i d have i didn t realize the outgoing president had to be out 10 o clock the incoming president by 2 o clock and you pick what you want and you got to get it all in by then so i inaudible jon meacham come in and he set my office up for me and so the desk they picked and you know everything everything except the wallpaper and i used to i came in here for eight years in a row as the vice president george washington s photograph is over there and i looked and i said why franklin roosevelt not that i don t like franklin roosevelt but why put that big portrait of franklin roosevelt and jon meacham said because no one ever inherited that kind of big circumstances and dire more dire straits than he did that last time i said oh that s encouraging and i said why abraham lincoln and he said the country s never been as divided since the civil war i knew those two things coming in but what i also believed was i could get some of it done there was a i just was reading an article inaudible that article by the uh the guy talking about biden and how he brought the country brought republicans together republicans and democrats anyway i ll i ll get it to you i ll find it oh here you go new york times magazine that s factually correct now there s a lot i couldn t get done ap because you re about to get the ocean safety bill which passed the house with bipartisan support biden well yeah by the way and when you remember i called for that everybody said oh no no no but guess what it s gonna pass but my generic point is that you know we re going to get gun safety we re not going to get what i wanted we re gonna get a part where everybody we re gonna get the uh the uh uh the the innovation competition act a hundred million bucks is going to be invested outside of cleveland by intel we re going to have another 57 mil you know there s forced arbitration i got rid of in sexual orientation sexual harassment cases juneteenth i got passed no one said it could be done i m not saying look at all i ve done but i knew that were probably probably 15 sort of traditional mainstream conservative republicans left and i include in that and i m going to get myself in trouble and i ll get him in trouble probably but the minority leader from kentucky he s a solid mainstream guy but you have the ah the folks from texas you have a lot of folks who are very very maga for example johnson you know and scott they re every five years social security medicare medicaid go out of existence you ve got to build them back they these guys mean it i mean why in the hell did you ever think that would happen in your lifetime and you re a young man ap i feel like i m getting more gray hair every day sir laughter biden well i tell you what well at least you re keeping it i d settle for orange if i had more hair but all kidding aside i think this is a process and i think what you re going to see this election is people voting their overall concerns as well even people who are not pro choice are going to find it really really off the wall when a woman goes across a state line and she gets arrested garble where she s doing even people who are you know i mean there s so many things these guys are doing that are out of the mainstream of where the public is and i think but it is i knew i was stepping into a difficult moment but can i say something off the record off the record discussion ap thank you sir copyright the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed

fully to blame for inflation reaching a 40 year high calling that argument bizarre as for the overall american mindset biden said people are really really down they re really down he said the need for mental health in america it has skyrocketed because people have seen everything upset everything they ve counted on upset but most of it s the consequence of what s happened what happened as a

states he said it s what s best in the country no kidding no kidding so what happens what happens if the strongest power in nato the organizational structure we put together walked away from russian aggression biden spun out the possibility of chaos in europe if an unimpeded russia kept moving deeper into the continent china was emboldened to take over taiwan and north korea grew even more

the baby formula shortage continues to impact many families as formula makers and the u s food and drug administration fda investigate what led to the national crisis for the week of may 22 may 29 the latest out of stock rate for infant formula jumped to 73 58 nationwide according to data by analytics firm datasembly this was nearly 4 higher than the week prior and was a significant increase from last month when the out of stock rate stood at 45 a spokesperson with datasembly told fox television stations wednesday that the infant formula stock situation in the u s continues to be quite volatile and the out of stock situation is expected to be nearing the peak while many american parents struggle to find infant formula health experts say the problem has been exacerbated for parents with babies who require a specific formula due to allergies parents struggle to find baby formula for allergies emily ingrich a 31 year old mother told fox that the process of finding baby formula has been difficult it s been horrible my son has a dairy allergy so he needs a specific formula that has been impossible to find she shared we live in a rural area of north carolina and have driven over three hours away to find his formula baby formula is offered for sale at a big box store on january 13 2022 in chicago illinois baby formula has been is short supply in many stores around the country for several months photo by scott olson getty images yet this is only one woman s story as many families struggle to find baby formula for their infant with allergies due to the nationwide shortage this is a challenging situation for new parents dr steven miller a pediatric gastroenterologist with johns hopkins children s center told fox being a new parent is amazing but also really stressful and this can definitely add to that additional stress especially for families who are struggling getting access for a baby who has extra needs babies who require a specialized formula commonly include premature infants babies who have trouble tolerating regular infant formula or breast milk or babies with certain medical conditions all of those kids have more trouble getting access to their formulas during this shortage miller continued related baby formula shortage out of stock rate continues to worsen jumping to 73 5 these types of allergies are most commonly associated with babies under one year of age and are different than the type of allergies typically found in older kids such as a peanut allergy according to kidshealth a milk protein intolerance from formula may lead to symptoms in babies including wheezing trouble breathing coughing throat tightness an upset stomach vomiting diarrhea swollen eyes hives a drop in blood pressure and blood or mucus in infant s stools but the severity of allergic reactions to milk can vary the same child can react differently with each exposure this means that even though one reaction was mild the next could be more severe and even life threatening where can i find formula for my baby with allergies extensively hydrolyzed formulas offer complete nutrition for infants who are allergic to cow s milk protein kidshealth explains dr jenifer lightdale a pediatric gastroenterologist who serves on the american academy of pediatrics committee said most babies with allergies who need hypoallergenic formulas have what we call a milk protein allergy where their immune systems are reacting to intact proteins in the formula casein is a cow s milk protein that is a common cause for allergy symptoms extensively hydrolyzed formulas break casein into pieces so about 90 of babies with a cow s milk allergy will tolerate these formulas infants with food allergies have less hypoallergenic formula options so as shortages of different formulas have occurred the families of these babies have had less alternatives to use if they cannot get more of their typical formula lightdale explained common brands include nutramigen similac alimentum and gerber extensive ha alimentum was one brand affected by february s recall when the fda warned consumers to avoid some powdered baby formula products from a sturgis michigan facility run by abbott nutrition which then initiated a voluntary recall elecare an amino acid based formula was also recalled according to findings released in march by federal safety inspectors abbott failed to maintain sanitary conditions and procedures at the plant the fda launched its investigation after four babies became sick with a rare bacterial infection after consuming formula manufactured at the plant all four babies were hospitalized and two died chicago based abbott said in a statement there is no evidence to link our formulas to these infant illnesses abbott noted that samples of the bacteria collected from the infants did not match those found in the company s factory ultimately this recall along with supply chain disruptions have caused major delays among retailers and companies this has also caused stores to put limitations on how much baby formula customers can buy so if you re on the hunt for specific formula doctors suggest talking to your pediatrician first especially if your baby must use a hydrolyzed or amino acid based formula if your baby requires a specific brand experts suggest discussing options with your pediatrician or calling a local food bank to see if they can help locate some formula they also recommend checking with smaller stores and pharmacies which may still have supplies when larger stores run out baby formula can also be very costly so for families who qualify based on income the women infants and children wic a federal program like food stamps that serves to help families can provide formula free of charge doctors also suggest seeking out local groups online many local parent groups have postings about unopened unexpired formula canisters available to give away or sell during this time experts say it s okay to look for formula online but check that it is sold by a reputable supplier unopened and unexpired formula substitutes miller noted if your baby has allergies they may still be able to switch to a different brand but similar type of formula lightdale agreed adding for example if the baby is on an amino acid based formula aaf that is being affected by the shortage then they should switch to another aaf alternatively if their baby is thriving on an extensively hydrolyzed formula ehf then they should switch to another ehf the north american society for pediatric gastroenterology hepatology and nutrition naspghan provides a list of formulas that are comparable and safe to substitute for each other however experts say any substitution should only be done under the recommendation and supervision of a healthcare professional if families are not sure what to switch to or if they have any questions about what to feed their baby they should talk to their baby s doctor who originally recommended or prescribed the allergy formula for the infant lighdale continued do not stockpile watering down formula while the baby formula shortage is a challenge for many parents doctors say parents should not try to make their own formula at home from cow s milk or add extra water to the formula to stretch supplies both of these things could make the baby sick sarah adams who is with ohio s pediatric primary care hudson made it quite clear on this point i do not recommend making your own formula adding the aap strongly advises against homemade formula she continued these are not safe and not fda approved infant deaths have been reported many do it yourself formula recipes are made from cow s milk and granular sugar that may be difficult for young babies to digest they also lack the specific vitamins and proteins found in breastmilk and fda approved formulas that are needed for basic nutrition adams also recommends not watering down formula citing this practice as dangerous that can lead to poor nutritional balance and serious complications additionally most experts don t defend stocking up on formula for just in case scenarios in general i m not in favor of parents buying up a ton of formula that they aren t sure they will need people stockpiling formula is part of why stores are running low miller explained that being said it would be okay for new parents to have a can or two of formula at home especially if they are thinking of using formula if you are actively using baby formula the aap advises buying no more than a 10 day to two week supply of formula the shortage is temporary parents are in this together please avoid stockpiling help your neighbors and focus on infant safety dr kelsey klaas a pediatrician at mayo clinic said expectant mothers encouraged to breastfeed if you are an expectant mother many doctors are urging women to consider breastfeeding especially due to the current formula shortage according to the mayo clinic breastfeeding provides the best nutrition for an infant and is the most widely recommended way to feed a newborn related baby formula vs breast milk doctors explain what parents should do amid formula shortage breast milk contains the right balance of nutrients for your baby and boosts your baby s immune system jay l hoecker an emeritus pediatrics specialist at mayo clinic said it s considered the gold standard for infant nutrition dr cynthia blanco a neonatologist in texas and a member of the american academy of pediatrics aap echoed hoecker saying if you have a healthy term baby your best choice will always be breast milk and a number of health organizations including the aap the american medical association ama and the world health organization who agree recommending breastfeeding as the best choice for babies experts say breastfeeding has chemicals that help defend against infections prevent allergies and protect against a number of chronic conditions additionally breast milk is the most cost effective option since it doesn t cost a cent and formula quickly adds up this shortage is a major headache and if moms make their own milk rather than buying it from the store that is one less thing to worry about miller noted adding the other thing doctors like about breastfeeding is that when babies breastfeed they can decide when they are full more easily than they can with formula this is part of why babies who are breastfed turn into kids who have a lower chance of being obese i am definitely a big fan of breastfeeding klaas noted she always encourages mothers to breastfeed when possible i absolutely support breastfeeding when possible we know that breastfeeding has benefits to both the infant and mother over formula feeding klass explained adding the current formula shortage highlights one particular benefit of breastfeeding which is that for a parent who is able to produce enough milk to meet the infant s needs infant nutrition is not reliant on external supplies health experts suggest that mothers who are exclusively breastfeeding ask their baby s pediatrician about vitamin d supplements for their baby since breast milk alone does not provide an adequate amount of the vitamin which helps the baby absorb calcium and phosphorus nutrients necessary for strong bones mothers who are anxious about breastfeeding may want to contact friends or family who have successfully breastfed as they may be a good source of information support organizations such as la leche league along with lactation consultants at many hospitals and clinics are available to help as well when will the formula shortage end earlier this week delta one of the world s largest airlines announced it would be joining the effort to bring more baby formula to the united states delta and the white house announced on june 10 that the airline s cargo division would donate 13 flights from the u k to the u s from june 20 24 transporting 212 000 pounds or about 3 2 million 8 ounce bottles of kendamil organic and classic formulas related baby formula shortage delta airlines to fly millions of bottles from uk to us kendamil will export at least 2 million cans of infant formula to the u s the equivalent of 54 million 8 ounce bottles according to the white house on wednesday the government also announced that base powder would begin shipping this month to a minnesota facility for conversion to a final product that will be made available in the coming weeks monthly follow up shipments will continue through november the u s department of health and human services said it is evaluating options for getting the product to the u s as quickly as possible the agency is leveraging a number of flexibilities to bolster the supply of products that serve as the sole source of nutrition for many infants while ensuring the infant formula can be used safely and provides adequate nutrition the white house wrote in a press release the fda remains in further discussions with manufacturers and suppliers regarding additional supply to ensure there s adequate infant formula available wherever and whenever parents and caregivers need it the white house also expects the recent resumption of production at abbott nutrition s facility will mean more supply soon you just don t know what formula your baby is going to tolerate and any formula change has to be

giraffe conservation are zoos doing anything to help there are at least 579 captive giraffe at 103 zoos throughout north america and more than 800 in european zoos including at least 150 in the u k unlike free living giraffe who form complex social relationships many giraffe in zoos are deprived of this opportunity and in several cases live alone or with just one other individual the international union for conservation of nature iucn which is the leading body on establishing conservation status for free living animals under threat of extinction lists giraffe as vulnerable populations in the wild are decreasing with up to 40 loss since 1990 major threats to giraffe include habitat loss and poaching it is certainly true that giraffe are under threat in their natural habitat but the question is are zoos doing anything to help it is certainly true that giraffe are under threat in their natural habitat but the question is are zoos doing anything to help the problems with captive breeding animals born in zoos die in zoos one of the main arguments of the zoo industry is the reason for continually breeding animals for lives in captivity is that they could theoretically one day perhaps maybe be released back the wild referred to as insurance populations zoos claim that they are saving animals from extinction by keeping species alive but the truth is animals born in zoos die in zoos hybridization notwithstanding that an animal born and raised in captivity would be unlikely to have the skills to survive in their natural habitat and would require long term rehabilitation before standing a chance of life in the wild data shows that poor management of giraffe breeding programs has resulted in hybridization of animals as of 2005 the main species of giraffe held captive in zoos were the reticulated and rothschild s giraffe but when testing was carried out to establish genetic variability between captive and free living members of the species it was found that the captive species were hybridized making them ineligible to be considered viable for insurance populations while clearly a result of mismanagement of captive giraffe the zoo industry s solution is to kill those who do not fit the genetic criteria they desire these innocent animals therefore pay with their lives either way if they fit the genetic mold they spend their lives in captivity if they do not they are killed as part of accepted management practice the difficulty of introducing captive bred animals to the wild even if it were not for botched breeding programs and the difficulties of release only the west african giraffe has been identified by the iucn as a species which would benefit from reintroduction efforts first and foremost this species is not one commonly kept by zoos as part of the industry s insurance population but the only example of reintroduction achieved to date has been carried out via translocation of wild giraffe within niger africa and not from zoos animals are held in zoos for display not conservation what is clear from the data available is that giraffe are not held in zoos for conservation purposes but for display this was confirmed by the eep the european equivalent of the aza ssp in 2006 that as no zoo board will accept an empty giraffe enclosure the short term goal is to keep the existing facilities filled with giraffe we know that giraffe suffer in captivity and even the zoo industry confirms that its goal is to stock its exhibits conservation experts agree that reintroduction is neither viable nor desirable this leads to one logical conclusion it is time to end the giraffe captivity keep wildlife in the wild liz
washington president joe biden told the associated press on thursday that the american people are really really down after a tumultuous two years with the coronavirus pandemic volatility in the economy and now surging gasoline prices that are slamming family budgets he said a recession is not inevitable and bristled at claims by republican lawmakers that last year s covid 19 aid plan was fully to blame for inflation reaching a 40 year high calling that argument bizarre as for the overall american mindset biden said people are really really down they re really down he said the need for mental health in america it has skyrocketed because people have seen everything upset everything they ve counted on upset but most of it s the consequence of what s happened what happened as a consequence of the covid crisis speaking to the ap in a 30 minute oval office interview biden addressed the warnings by economists that the united states could be headed for a recession first of all it s not inevitable he said secondly we re in a stronger position than any nation in the world to overcome this inflation as for the causes of inflation biden flashed some defensiveness on that count if it s my fault why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher you ask yourself that i m not being a wise guy he said the president said he saw reason for optimism with the 3 6 unemployment rate and america s relative strength in the world be confident because i am confident we re better positioned than any country in the world to own the second quarter of the 21st century biden said that s not hyperbole that s a fact biden s bleak assessment of the national psyche comes as voters have soured on his job performance and the direction of the country only 39 of u s adults approve of biden s performance as president according to a may poll from the associated press norc center for public research dipping from already negative ratings a month earlier overall only about 2 in 10 adults said the u s is heading in the right direction or that the economy is good both down from about 3 in 10 in april those drops were concentrated among democrats with just 33 within the president s party saying the country is headed in the right direction down from 49 in april the president outlined some of the hard choices he has faced saying the u s needed to stand up to russian president vladimir putin for invading ukraine in february even though tough sanctions imposed as a result of that war have caused gas prices to surge creating a political risk for biden in an election year he called on oil companies to think of the world s short term needs and increase production asked why he ordered the financial penalties against moscow that have disrupted food and energy markets globally biden said he made his calculation as commander in chief rather than as a politician thinking about the election i m the president of the united states he said it s what s best in the country no kidding no kidding so what happens what happens if the strongest power in nato the organizational structure we put together walked away from russian aggression biden spun out the possibility of chaos in europe if an unimpeded russia kept moving deeper into the continent china was emboldened to take over taiwan and north korea grew even more aggressive with its nuclear weapon ambitions biden renewed his contention that major oil companies have benefited from higher prices without increasing production as much as they should he said the companies needed to think of the world in the short term not just their investors don t just reward yourselves he said consumer prices have jumped 8 6 over the past year the steepest rise in more than 40 years republican lawmakers have said that biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package from last year kick started a spiral of price increases the president said there was zero evidence for that claim noting that other countries have endured higher prices as economies reopened and people became vaccinated still biden acknowledged treasury secretary janet yellen s contention that the spending had a limited inflationary effect you could argue whether it had on the margin a minor impact on inflation he said i don t think it did and most economists do not but the idea that it caused inflation

president joe biden said thursday the american people are really really down after a tumultuous two years with the coronavirus pandemic volatility in the economy and now surging gasoline prices that are slamming family budgets but he stressed that a recession was not inevitable and held out hope of giving the country a greater sense of confidence by associated press president joe biden said thursday the american people are really really down after a tumultuous two years with the coronavirus pandemic volatility in the economy and now surging gasoline prices that are slamming family budgets but he stressed that a recession was not inevitable and held out hope of giving the country a greater sense of confidence speaking to the associated press in a 30 minute oval office interview the president emphasized the battered economy that he inherited and the lingering psychological scars caused by a pandemic that disrupted people s sense of identity he bristled at claims by republican lawmakers that last year s covid 19 aid plan was fully to blame for inflation reaching a 40 year high calling that argument bizarre as for the overall american mindset biden said people are really really down the need for mental health in america it has skyrocketed because people have seen everything upset biden said everything they ve counted on upset but most of it s the consequence of what s happened what happened as a consequence of the covid crisis that pessimism has carried over into the economy as record prices at the pump and persistent inflation have jeopardized democrats ability to hold on to the house and senate in the midterm elections biden addressed the warnings by economists that fighting inflation could tip united states into recession first of all it s not inevitable he said secondly we re in a stronger position than any nation in the world to overcome this inflation as for the causes of inflation biden flashed some defensiveness on that count if it s my fault why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher you ask yourself that i m not being a wise guy he said the president said he saw reason for optimism with the 3 6 unemployment rate and america s relative strength in the world but restoring confidence so far has eluded biden whose approval ratings have been in steady decline as he has lost support among democrats and has little evidence to show that he could restore a sense of bipartisan normalcy to washington his oval office is filled with the portraits of presidents who faced crises that have imperiled the country and biden acknowledged there were parallels to his own situation a picture of franklin delano roosevelt hangs over his fireplace a place of prominence because the historian jon meacham told biden that no president had come into office with the economy in such dire circumstances there is also a painting of abraham lincoln who became president with a nation brutally divided and on the verge of the civil war yet biden s remedy is not that different from the diagnosis made by former president jimmy carter in 1979 when the u s economy was crippled by stagflation carter said then the u s was suffering from a crisis of confidence and the erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of america the president said he wants to endow the u s with more verve fortitude and courage be confident because i am confident we re better positioned than any country in the world to own the second quarter of the 21st century

still trying to steer his domestic agenda through congress after an earlier iteration last year failed to clear a 50 50 senate biden said i believe i have the votes to lower prescription drug prices reduce families utility bills with tax incentives and place a minimum tax on corporations he said his plans would lower expenses for many americans though the measure would be scaled back from earlier intentions for an expanded child tax credit universal pre kindergarten and other programs i m going to be able to get god willing the ability to pay for prescription drugs biden said there s more than one way to bring down the cost for working folks gasoline may be up to 5 a gallon but somebody who has a child with stage two diabetes is paying up to 1 000 bucks a month we can reduce it to 35 bucks

as elon musk addressed twitter employees for the first time in an all hands q a meeting the tesla and spacex ceo provided some more details about his plans for the social platform when musk first announced his bid to buy twitter for 44 billion he proposed the idea of authenticating all humans on twitter as we re well aware one of his biggest grievances with the platform is its bots and fake accounts today musk elaborated on what this plan might entail and clarified that he doesn t think human authentication is a requirement to use twitter he added that anonymity can be helpful for people to freely express their political views which is a priority for him according to bloomberg musk proposed an idea that users could pay to be authenticated as human through a tool like the subscription product twitter blue and that those users tweets might then be ranked above others regarding content moderation musk stayed true to his previous statements that people should be able to say pretty outrageous things as long as those statements are legal musk has routinely referred to himself as a free speech absolutist despite prematurely endorsing florida governor ron desantis for president who supported and signed legislation limiting discussions about race and lgbtq issues in state public schools but twitter s existing platform guidelines aren t that stringent in addition to banning illegal actions the platform bans hateful conduct attacking or threatening people based on race ethnicity gender sexual orientation religion disability etc depictions of graphic violence and promotion of suicide or self harm on the business side musk said he wants twitter to have over a billion users as of its last quarterly report twitter has 229 million monetizable daily active users user growth would directly support musk s other ideas for twitter he wants the company to generate more money through advertising in app payments and more creator features though twitter has rolled out some creator products like super follows ticketed spaces and tipping creators aren t relying on twitter for their income whereas running a successful youtube account can be a viable career musk said he wants twitter to be more like china s wechat noting that its users basically live on the app since it combines social media messaging calling games and payments into one app he also complimented tiktok owned by chinese company bytedance for keeping users entertained story continues it remains unclear how when or if this deal might close as musk demands more information from twitter about how many accounts are not actually real humans at the same time the stock market has suffered driving down twitter and tesla stocks alike which puts musk in a bind as twitter expects him to honor his 44 billion offer still musk claims to love twitter and is at least committed enough to answer employee questions some people use their hair to express themselves i use twitter he said
washington president joe biden told the associated press on thursday that the american people are really really down after a tumultuous two years with the coronavirus pandemic volatility in the economy and now surging gasoline prices that are slamming family budgets he said a recession is not inevitable and bristled at claims by republican lawmakers that last year s covid 19 aid plan was fully to blame for inflation reaching a 40 year high calling that argument bizarre as for the overall american mindset biden said people are really really down they re really down he said the need for mental health in america it has skyrocketed because people have seen everything upset everything they ve counted on upset but most of it s the consequence of what s happened what happened as a consequence of the covid crisis speaking to the ap in a 30 minute oval office interview biden addressed the warnings by economists that the united states could be headed for a recession first of all it s not inevitable he said secondly we re in a stronger position than any nation in the world to overcome this inflation as for the causes of inflation biden flashed some defensiveness on that count if it s my fault why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher you ask yourself that i m not being a wise guy he said the president said he saw reason for optimism with the 3 6 unemployment rate and america s relative strength in the world be confident because i am confident we re better positioned than any country in the world to own the second quarter of the 21st century biden said that s not hyperbole that s a fact biden s bleak assessment of the national psyche comes as voters have soured on his job performance and the direction of the country only 39 of u s adults approve of biden s performance as president according to a may poll from the associated press norc center for public research dipping from already negative ratings a month earlier overall only about 2 in 10 adults said the u s is heading in the right direction or that the economy is good both down from about 3 in 10 in april those drops were concentrated among democrats with just 33 within the president s party saying the country is headed in the right direction down from 49 in april the president outlined some of the hard choices he has faced saying the u s needed to stand up to russian president vladimir putin for invading ukraine in february even though tough sanctions imposed as a result of that war have caused gas prices to surge creating a political risk for biden in an election year he called on oil companies to think of the world s short term needs and increase production asked why he ordered the financial penalties against moscow that have disrupted food and energy markets globally biden said he made his calculation as commander in chief rather than as a politician thinking about the election i m the president of the united states he said it s what s best in the country no kidding no kidding so what happens what happens if the strongest power in nato the organizational structure we put together walked away from russian aggression biden spun out the possibility of chaos in europe if an unimpeded russia kept moving deeper into the continent china was emboldened to take over taiwan and north korea grew even more aggressive with its nuclear weapon ambitions biden renewed his contention that major oil companies have benefited from higher prices without increasing production as much as they should he said the companies needed to think of the world in the short term not just their investors don t just reward yourselves he said consumer prices have jumped 8 6 over the past year the steepest rise in more than 40 years republican lawmakers have said that biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package from last year kick started a spiral of price increases the president said there was zero evidence for that claim noting that other countries have endured higher prices as economies reopened and people became vaccinated still biden acknowledged treasury secretary janet yellen s contention that the spending had a limited inflationary effect you could argue whether it had on the margin a minor impact on inflation he said i don t think it did and most economists do not but the idea that it caused inflation is bizarre still high inflation has created a conundrum for biden he prioritized bringing back millions of jobs and has seen the unemployment rate return to close to pre pandemic levels the federal reserve on wednesday increased its benchmark interest rate in hopes of slowing the economy and pulling inflation down to its target rate of 2 the tightening of fed policy has caused financial markets to slump and led many economists to warn of a potential recession next year the president encouraged americans to stay patient they shouldn t believe a warning he said they should just say let s say

washington ap a transcript of an oval office interview thursday with president joe biden by ap white house reporter josh boak where the audio recording of the interview is unclear ellipses or a notation that the recording was unintelligible are used ap i wanted to thank you for taking the time to do this biden sure happy to ap and i m really interested in how you re thinking and how you re making choices during what seems like a really unique time in american history biden well i m making choices it s an interesting question i m making choices like i always have in the sense that circumstances change but my objective doesn t change does that make sense to you for example i have uh from the time i ve entered public life it s been about how to give ordinary working class and middle class folks a shot inaudible instead of everything being viewed as from the top down i m not a big is it working a reference to the tape recorder ap yeah we re good biden i m not a big believer in trickle down economy and um and so everything i look at from the time i took this office but even before that when i was a senator all those years is what s the best shot to grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out because when that happens everybody does well the wealthy do very very well and the biggest thing i think that when i came into this job that i have the greatest frustration with the last four years is that um uh everything was constructed and built and arranged in order for the top 1 to 3 of the population to do very well the rest was sort of i mean that literally everything else seemed to be an afterthought ap so let me ask about that right because you ve seen the polls there s a lot of voters who are very pessimistic when i look at the consumer sentiment survey the university of michigan puts out even democrats began to get really worried about a year ago regarding the economy and we ve had people that have basically been through a pandemic shortages of basic goods inflation some of the political divisions you re seeing right now on the hill with the jan 6 hearings and also a war in europe and how do you as a president provide a sense of stability and strength crosstalk biden well if you notice until gas prices started going up which was about the same time the university of michigan survey they had a very different view things were much more they were much more optimistic we came in and we started to grow the economy in significant ways we were able to ah you know go from 2 million shots in arms to 225 million people were having access to dealing with the pandemic we started opening up businesses and opening up access to go back to work etc but then in my experience the way i was raised if you want a direct barometer of what people are going to talk about at the kitchen table and the dining room table and whether things are going well it s the cost of food and what s the cost of of gasoline at the pump i mean literally at the pump and if you notice you know uh gasoline went up a you know 1 25 right off the bat almost when the putin s war started um and as i said at the time by the way i made it clear with helping ukraine and organizing nato to help ukraine that this was going to cost there was going to be a price to pay for it it was this is not going to be cost free but we had the option of doing nothing was worse if he in fact moved into ukraine took hold of ukraine and belarus where it is and he s been a threat to nato all those things would have even been more dire ap why is that because it seems like you knew the risks on ukraine with regard to higher gasoline prices biden sure ap that carried political risks for you at home biden sure ap so when when your aides said look at the situation how did you make that choice what would you tell someone in latrobe pennsylvania biden i m the president of the united states it s not about my political survival it s about what s best for the country no kidding no kidding so what happens what happens if the strongest power nato an organizational structure we put together walked away from russian aggression of over 100 000 troops marching across a border to try to to occupy and wipe out a culture of an entire people what then then what happens what happens next what do we do next ap what did you fear would happen next if you didn t do biden oh i fear what would happen next is you d see chaos in europe you would see the possibility they continue to move you already saw what they re doing in belarus what would happen in the surrounding countries watch what would happen in poland and and the czech republic and all the members of nato for example you know the reason putin said he was going to go in was because he didn t want them to join nato and uh he he he he wanted the sort of the finland ization of nato he got the nato ization of finland instead laughter no i m serious ap yeah biden and so the idea that if the united states stood by then what does china think about taiwan then what does north korea think about nuclear weapons beyond testing and pressure ap do you think americans have that sense of the stakes on a daily basis biden no i don t but i don t think look on a daily basis most households just trying to figure out how to put before even when things were going well just figure out how to put food on the table take care of the kids pay for their education just basic things you know look um one of the i ve always suggested to younger people that want to get into public life i ask them two things have you figured out what s worth losing over have you figured out what s worth losing over if you haven t figured that out don t get in politics go into a more profitable org enterprise go into business go into commerce don t be engaged but unless you know what s worth losing over don t get engaged number one number two the purpose of public service is to promote views that you think are best for the american people i made a commitment and i think i can say that i ve never broken if i make a commitment i wasn t going to run again this time i mean for real i was not going to run i just lost my son i was teaching at penn i liked it until all those guys came come out of the woods ap charlottesville biden the charlottesville folks and this other guy said good people on both sides when an innocent woman was killed etc and i made a decision i ve been doing this too long to do anything other than to try to do what was right i mean i m not there s nothing noble about it but it s not worth it so you asked me what would i say to the american people i d say to the american people i ve done foreign policy my whole career i m convinced that if we let russia roll and putin roll he wouldn t stop ap let me ask on another hard choice you made when you came into office it seems as though you made the choice to prioritize job growth republicans right now are saying to voters that inflation started with your covid relief package biden zero evidence of that zero evidence of that number one number two we ve reduced the deficit by 350 billion last year we reduced the deficit by a trillion 700 billion this year we grow the economy today today we have more people employed than in a long long time and we gained another 8 6 million jobs and guess what we still have hundreds of thousands of job openings ap so so do you think that when treasury secretary yellen said it might have made a marginal contribution to inflation that that was off did anyone apprise you interrupted biden yeah they apprised me ap of possible trade offs biden now you just said two different things you said republicans said i caused inflation she said it may have a marginal impact on it two different things you could argue whether it had a marginal minor impact on inflation i don t think it did and most economists do not think it did but the idea that it caused inflation is bizarre ap let me ask stepping back after yesterday s fed meeting i know that you ve said look our economy is strong we have these jobs it s the best look we ve had in decades but then you ve got serious economists who warn of a recession next year biden sure ap what should americans believe biden they shouldn t believe a warning they should just say let s see let s see which is correct and from my perspective you talked about a recession first of all it s not inevitable secondly we re in a stronger position than any nation in the world to overcome this inflation it s bad isn t it kind of interesting if it s my fault why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher you ask yourself that i m not being a wise guy someone should ask themself that question why why is it if it s a consequence of our spending we ve reduced the deficit we ve increased employment increased pay there was a survey done uh uh by the uh i forget which one it was which one it was now about three months ago you had more people had lower debt inaudible credit cards more savings in their savings account higher pay in the job they had more satisfaction in the job they had and they were in good shape financially ap i believe that was a fed survey you see this interesting shift though in the census pulse surveys which show people are clearly employed in a way they haven t been they are less dependent on unemployment benefits and the government for aid and yet more of them say they re having trouble with meeting their weekly expenses biden well two things ap what s that paradox biden well i think the paradox is part of it is i think what the failure of the last administration to act on covid had a profound impact on the number of people who got covid and the number of people who died now here s what i m i think vivek murthy is right and most of the international and national psychological association whatever it s people are really really down they re really down their need for mental health in america has skyrocketed because people have seen everything upset everything they counted on upset but most of it s a consequence of of of what s happening what happened is a consequence of the the covid crisis people lost their jobs people are out of their jobs and then were they going to get back to work schools were closed think of this i think we vastly underestimate this if you had and instead of your child being how old five ap five biden five years old if your child had been 17 years old two years ago ap i m not ready for that biden well get ready man boy or girl ap girl biden well i ll tell you what she s gonna she s going to be crazy about you until about age 13 and then hang on but all kidding aside here s the deal think about what it s like for the graduating classes of the last three years no proms no graduation no no none of the things that celebrate who we are think about it across the board how isolated we ve become how separated we ve become even practical questions like you know can you go out on a date i mean inaudible the normal socialization how does that take place there s overwhelming evidence it s had a profound impact on the psyche of parents children across the board and we lost a million people and nine for every according to a study of those million people nine significant family or close friends were left alive after they re gone ap so you re talking about a country that has undergone profound psychological trauma biden yes ap what can you as a president do to address that psychology biden be confident ap to make people feel more optimistic be confident biden be confident be confident because i am confident we are better positioned than any country in the world to own the second quarter of the 21st century that s not hyperbole that s a fact ap and do you think that s because the u s is stronger or because you see countries like china hitting speedbumps biden look i ve spent more time with xi jinping than anybody any other world leader imagine let me put it let me ask you a rhetorical question and you know i mean obviously you don t have to answer any of the questions ap i ll answer whatever you need biden no no no no no but think of this name me a single major company country in the world where that world leader wouldn t trade places with my problems for his in a heartbeat name me one not a joke ap do you think that biden there are none ap well so so i mean do you think people wouldn t want to be in switzerland right now biden no switzerland has their own problems right now when i said major i meant major power so but no i mean you know i just had the the american you know the whole hemisphere beautiful countries in the caribbean and beautiful countries that are have that are middle class countries that are having serious problems everybody s having them in the meantime we have a little thing called climate change going on and it s having profound impacts we got the tundra melting we ve got the north pole i mean so people are looking and and i think it s totally understandable that they are worried because they look around and see my god everything is changing we have more hurricanes and tornadoes and flooding people saw what i took my kids years ago to yellowstone park they call me daddy did you see what happened at yellowstone right well it s unthinkable these are 1 000 year kinds of events ap and yet you face a possible tradeoff in that climate change has this big impact and yet americans are unhappy about the cost of gasoline biden sure ap and fossil fuels and i m curious like what does that mean for you if you have to say we need to increase production in the short term and companies say but we don t have the long term incentives biden well i say in the short term do the right thing instead of you know they ve made 315 or 16 billion 35 billion dollars these major oil companies in the first quarter so i think it s three twelve five i don t know how many times inaudible don t buy back your own stock don t don t just reward yourselves i mean look here s what a lot happened one of the things i ran on when i was running is that i i come from the corporate capital of the world delaware more corporations incorporated in my state than all the rest of the united states combined not a joke literally and you know they try to make me my fr the maga party tries to make me out to be this socialist i got elected seven times not just six seven times in that state but one of the things that s changed is the notion of what constitutes corporate responsibility the fact that you re in a situation where you have a fortune 500 company you got 55 paid zero taxes made 40 billion dollars those surveys also show nobody including republicans in suburbia think the tax system is fair billionaires paying 8 all these things that are occurring that have to be shifted it used to be for example i ll give you one example it used to am i holding up aide tells biden time is almost up biden ok ap so let me ask you because you brought it up your domestic agenda in speeches you ve said your domestic agenda is key for helping the middle class and beating inflation biden yes ap do you have the votes as of today because biden yes i think it s changing well first of all i had the votes if i had told you garble you re not doing inaudible i m impressed by your objectivity how you write i m not being i shouldn t say that on the record because then you ll get in trouble ap i m in trouble anyway so it s ok biden but all kidding aside usually inaudible the question i get asked in the beginning with the recovery act can you get this passed how can you possibly do that i got 1 9 trillion dollars saved the economy it used to be long lines people in nice cars like we drive lined up just to get a box of food in their trunk people getting kicked out onto the street because they couldn t pay the rent thousands and thousands of people and guess what it worked secondly no here s the important point the second piece of this is that it also saw to it that we were able to provide for the funding for covid not only not only the shots and the shots in arms but also all the hospital costs we were able to reduce the cost of insurance my point is people would say how can you get that done if i did if any other president just passed that act and the infrastructure bill they d say god almighty name me a president that s done anything like that before at the same time aide tells biden time is up ap i guess one of the reasons why i ask is you did something revolutionary on child poverty and you know it with the child tax credit an idea that came in part from newt gingrich back in the day contract with america and a lot of families had hope from that they moved out of public housing biden that s right ap and then last year they learned that their incomes were effectively going down biden yep ap and so when you present your agenda to the public the reason why i m asking if you have the votes is because people really want to know biden sure they want to know and on that answer is no not one single republican not one not one would vote to extend it we re 50 50 and we lost one democrat vote so i m one vote short on that piece but for example i m going to be able to get god willing the ability to pay for prescription drugs there s more than one way to bring down the cost for working folks gasoline may be up to 5 a gallon but somebody who has a child with stage two diabetes is paying up to a thousand bucks a month for the insulin we can reduce it to 35 bucks a month and get it done we have the votes to do it we re gonna get that done that kinda thing i can t get it all done that s why i need the inaudible vote one more thing let s look at what our republican friends are going to have to face with the supreme court decision on roe what they re going to have to face in terms of the supreme court the failure the failure of this republican party to be willing to do anything to deal with the basic social concerns of the country and so i think you know i fully understand why the average voter out there is just confused and upset and worried and they re worried for example you know can they send their kid back to back to college what s going to happen are we going to take away the ability of people to borrow so i think there s a lot of reasons for people to want to know what comes next and do i have the votes i believe i have the votes to do a number of things one prescription drugs reduce utility bills by providing for uh i think we ll be able to get the ability to have a tax incentive for winterization which would they estimate bring down the average bill for the family normal home 500 bucks a year i think we would be able we re gonna get another 57 billion for semiconductors so we don t have the supply chain problem we had before keeping down the cost of vehicles i think we re going to be in a situation where we re gonna i know we are where we re going to reduce a person s average internet bill by 30 bucks a month because we have the money through the through the uh uh infrastructure bill to provide internet across country i think we re going to be able to have a fair tax system to have the votes it s going to be close to have a minimum tax on corporations of 15 make sure we re in a situation where the people who in fact are the idea that a billionaire is paying 8 of income and a teacher is paying 22 i think we re going to be able to get tax increases on super wealthy not a lot not a lot i m a capitalist you should be able to inaudible for god s sake pay your fair share just pay pay a piece of what you owe and i think we re gonna be able to do those kinds of things ap were you surprised crosstalk aide tells biden time is up biden i know i m supposed to go that s the last question ap were you surprised because you referenced the reason why you ran was charlottesville and i m curious have you been surprised when you say republicans weren t going to work with you at all on some of these issues did that surprise you given what you knew that compelled you to run and how do you deal with that environment and how does that compare to your predecessors who are on the wall biden well my predecessor on the wall didn t pass the inaudible his first year number one number two the reason you know why that predecessor is on the wall you never saw his picture in this office before i asked my brother to put together the office for me decide what desk i d have i didn t realize the outgoing president had to be out 10 o clock the incoming president by 2 o clock and you pick what you want and you got to get it all in by then so i inaudible jon meacham come in and he set my office up for me and so the desk they picked and you know everything everything except the wallpaper and i used to i came in here for eight years in a row as the vice president george washington s photograph is over there and i looked and i said why franklin roosevelt not that i don t like franklin roosevelt but why put that big portrait of franklin roosevelt and jon meacham said because no one ever inherited that kind of big circumstances and dire more dire straits than he did that last time i said oh that s encouraging and i said why abraham lincoln and he said the country s never been as divided since the civil war i knew those two things coming in but what i also believed was i could get some of it done there was a i just was reading an article inaudible that article by the uh the guy talking about biden and how he brought the country brought republicans together republicans and democrats anyway i ll i ll get it to you i ll find it oh here you go new york times magazine that s factually correct now there s a lot i couldn t get done ap because you re about to get the ocean safety bill which passed the house with bipartisan support biden well yeah by the way and when you remember i called for that everybody said oh no no no but guess what it s gonna pass but my generic point is that you know we re going to get gun safety we re not going to get what i wanted we re gonna get a part where everybody we re gonna get the uh the uh uh the the innovation competition act a hundred million bucks is going to be invested outside of cleveland by intel we re going to have another 57 mil you know there s forced arbitration i got rid of in sexual orientation sexual harassment cases juneteenth i got passed no one said it could be done i m not saying look at all i ve done but i knew that were probably probably 15 sort of traditional mainstream conservative republicans left and i include in that and i m going to get myself in trouble and i ll get him in trouble probably but the minority leader from kentucky he s a solid mainstream guy but you have the ah the folks from texas you have a lot of folks who are very very maga for example johnson you know and scott they re every five years social security medicare medicaid go out of existence you ve got to build them back they these guys mean it i mean why in the hell did you ever think that would happen in your lifetime and you re a young man ap i feel like i m getting more gray hair every day sir laughter biden well i tell you what well at least you re keeping it i d settle for orange if i had more hair but all kidding aside i think this is a process and i think what you re going to see this election is people voting their overall concerns as well even people who are not pro choice are going to find it really really off the wall when a woman goes across a state line and she gets arrested garble where she s doing even people who are you know i mean there s so many things these guys are doing that are out of the mainstream of where the public is and i think but it is i knew i was stepping into a difficult moment but can i say something off the record off the record discussion ap thank you sir

washington ap president joe biden told the associated press on thursday that the american people are really really down after a tumultuous two years with the coronavirus pandemic volatility in the economy and now surging gasoline prices that are slamming family budgets he said a recession is not inevitable and bristled at claims by republican lawmakers that last year s covid 19 aid plan was fully to blame for inflation reaching a 40 year high calling that argument bizarre as for the overall american mindset biden said people are really really down they re really down he said the need for mental health in america it has skyrocketed because people have seen everything upset everything they ve counted on upset but most of it s the consequence of what s happened what happened as a consequence of the covid crisis speaking to the ap in a 30 minute oval office interview biden addressed the warnings by economists that the united states could be headed for a recession first of all it s not inevitable he said secondly we re in a stronger position than any nation in the world to overcome this inflation as for the causes of inflation biden flashed some defensiveness on that count if it s my fault why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher you ask yourself that i m not being a wise guy he said the president said he saw reason for optimism with the 3 6 unemployment rate and america s relative strength in the world be confident because i am confident we re better positioned than any country in the world to own the second quarter of the 21st century biden said that s not hyperbole that s a fact biden s bleak assessment of the national psyche comes as voters have soured on his job performance and the direction of the country only 39 of u s adults approve of biden s performance as president according to a may poll from the associated press norc center for public research dipping from already negative ratings a month earlier overall only about 2 in 10 adults said the u s is heading in the right direction or that the economy is good both down from about 3 in 10 in april those drops were concentrated among democrats with just 33 within the president s party saying the country is headed in the right direction down from 49 in april the president outlined some of the hard choices he has faced saying the u s needed to stand up to russian president vladimir putin for invading ukraine in february even though tough sanctions imposed as a result of that war have caused gas prices to surge creating a political risk for biden in an election year he called on oil companies to think of the world s short term needs and increase production asked why he ordered the financial penalties against moscow that have disrupted food and energy markets globally biden said he made his calculation as commander in chief rather than as a politician thinking about the election i m the president of the united states he said it s what s best in the country no kidding no kidding so what happens what happens if the strongest power in nato the organizational structure we put together walked away from russian aggression biden spun out the possibility of chaos in europe if an unimpeded russia kept moving deeper into the continent china was emboldened to take over taiwan and north korea grew even more aggressive with its nuclear weapon ambitions biden renewed his contention that major oil companies have benefited from higher prices without increasing production as much as they should he said the companies needed to think of the world in the short term not just their investors don t just reward yourselves he said consumer prices have jumped 8 6 over the past year the steepest rise in more than 40 years republican lawmakers have said that biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package from last year kick started a spiral of price increases the president said there was zero evidence for that claim noting that other countries have endured higher prices as economies reopened and people became vaccinated still biden acknowledged treasury secretary janet yellen s contention that the spending had a limited inflationary effect you could argue whether it had on the margin a minor impact on inflation he said i don t think it did and most economists do not but the idea that it caused inflation is bizarre still high inflation has created a conundrum for biden he prioritized bringing back millions of jobs and has seen the unemployment rate return to close to pre pandemic levels the federal reserve on wednesday increased its benchmark interest rate in hopes of slowing the economy and pulling inflation down to its target rate of 2 the tightening of fed policy has caused financial markets to slump and led many economists to warn of a potential recession next year the president encouraged americans to stay patient they shouldn t believe a warning he said they should just say let s say let s see which is correct
temperatures spiked in a short amount of time humidity was high and wind was low in southwest kansas the cattle also hadn t shed their winter coats yet example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video a heatwave descended upon the midwest and south in june pushing temperatures into the 90s and triple digits in some areas the associated press reports that the dangerously high temperatures may have led to the deaths of two people in wisconsin now an unconfirmed video circulating on social media claims to show thousands of cattle dead in kansas some people on twitter have questioned whether the extreme temperatures led to the cattle s deaths one user who shared the video of the cattle claimed in a viral tweet on tuesday june 14 that a farmer told them heat was not to blame the question did heat lead to the deaths of thousands of cattle in kansas the sources the answer yes heat led to the deaths of at least 2 000 cattle in kansas what we found matt lara a spokesperson for the kansas department of health and environment kdhe said the agency is aware of at least 2 000 cattle deaths in southwest kansas that number is based on information from facilities that have contacted the agency for help with disposing of carcasses he added the combination of temperatures spiking in a short amount of time high humidity and low wind a rare weather event in kansas caused the cattle to die due to heat stress the state department of agriculture said in a press release jason walker a spokesperson for the department also told verify that the cattle had not yet shed their winter coats when the hot temperatures arrived the department doesn t require ranchers or facilities to report losses so it doesn t have data about the total number of cattle that died walker said the agency has been in contact with the beef industry and experts at kansas state university to help provide producers in the area with information and help as needed temperatures increased by 10 to 14 degrees from friday to saturday with little wind high humidity and lows only falling to about 70 degrees overnight walker said dodge city located in southwest kansas reached 100 degrees for the sixth time in 2022 on thursday june 16 the national weather service nws office in the area reported the city typically sees an average of two 100 degree days by the end of june data from kansas state university also show that the stress level for animals was severe or extreme in areas throughout southwest kansas over the weekend due to the heat according to the university of minnesota dairy cows begin to feel heat stress at much lower temperatures than humans in general mild heat stress starts for cows around 72 degrees with 50 humidity high producing cows which eat more and generate more heat can also begin to experience heat stress in well ventilated barns at temperatures as low as 65 degrees heat related deaths in cattle feed yards are typically rare because producers take precautions such as providing extra drinking water altering feeding schedules so cattle are not digesting in the heat of the day and avoiding moving cattle during the heat of the day the kansas department of agriculture said lara said kdhe has seen the video of dead cattle that is circulating on social media but is unable to confirm that it was shot in kansas the department of agriculture is also aware of the video but does not know where or when it was taken according to walker the deaths represent a substantial loss for some kansas ranchers as beef cattle is the single largest sector in the state s agriculture industry kansas also has the third largest number of cattle on ranches and feedyards in the nation according to information shared during a 2021 agriculture summit in the state but the losses will not lead to beef supply chain issues according to kansas secretary of agriculture mike beam
washington president joe biden told the associated press on thursday that the american people are really really down after a tumultuous two years with the coronavirus pandemic volatility in the economy and now surging gasoline prices that are slamming family budgets he said a recession is not inevitable and bristled at claims by republican lawmakers that last year s covid 19 aid plan was fully to blame for inflation reaching a 40 year high calling that argument bizarre as for the overall american mindset biden said people are really really down they re really down he said the need for mental health in america it has skyrocketed because people have seen everything upset everything they ve counted on upset but most of it s the consequence of what s happened what happened as a consequence of the covid crisis speaking to the ap in a 30 minute oval office interview biden addressed the warnings by economists that the united states could be headed for a recession first of all it s not inevitable he said secondly we re in a stronger position than any nation in the world to overcome this inflation as for the causes of inflation biden flashed some defensiveness on that count if it s my fault why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher you ask yourself that i m not being a wise guy he said the president said he saw reason for optimism with the 3 6 unemployment rate and america s relative strength in the world be confident because i am confident we re better positioned than any country in the world to own the second quarter of the 21st century biden said that s not hyperbole that s a fact biden s bleak assessment of the national psyche comes as voters have soured on his job performance and the direction of

just how it is appleson said there was a dead cat bouncing relief rally at the end of may during which participants were overly optimistic believing that a 50 basis point drop in yields meant the worst was behind the relief rally he said was spurred by crossover buyers leading up to it people came in and they said look at the relative value in the municipal bond space it is cheap we have 30

pressures abate markets are set to remain challenged said mark dowding chief investment officer of bluebay asset management part of rbc global asset management in the short term a mix of elevated inflation slowing economic growth and rising interest rates create a challenging backdrop for financial markets until inflation can turn lower and treasury yields stabilize other risk assets are set to remain on shaky ground continued aggressive fed moves will create a serious risk of recession said center for economic and policy research senior economist dean baker understandably the fed would want to raise rates to demonstrate its determination to keep inflation under control it is also hard to justify a near zero federal funds rate when the unemployment rate is close to 50 year lows however there is a serious risk that the fed will overshoot if it continues on this path the chances for a recession have clearly risen now even further said dws group u s economist christian scherrmann it s apparent the fed wants to regain its inflation credibility as it pushes ahead with much tighter monetary policy in order to get back ahead of the curve with inflation as measured by the consumer price index at an embarrassingly high 8 6 and in danger of going still higher he said the fed probably feels it has no alternative its reputation has been tarnished it therefore also has no alternative now but to follow through on its hawkish guidance even if a recession is the ultimate outcome and while the summary of economic projections sep offers an optimistic view on inflation and unemployment jeffrey cleveland principal and chief economist at payden rygel noted fed officials have made it clear that they are more afraid of doing too little to tame inflation than they are of doing too much as a result the economy may be in for an uncomfortable reality check having waited too long to act and now trying to catch up he said policymakers are poised to overcorrect of interest the sep suggests a fed funds rate at yearend of 3 4 well above the fed s implied neutral rate 2 4 and up from a 1 9 estimate three months ago how realistic is it to expect gdp growth to slow somewhat and inflation to tumble back toward 2 while the unemployment rate rises only slightly cleveland asked we re becoming more and more skeptical among troubling signs in the economy fewer mortgage applications and home sales more layoffs in the technology sector and negative real disposable personal income growth he said that said it will likely be a few more months before we get clear and compelling evidence that inflation is ebbing cleveland said further there s no guarantee that consumer inflation expectations will back off given the trajectory in food energy prices and rents the fed he predicts will raise rates 75 bps in july 50 bps each in september and november and 25 bps in december which would put the fed funds rate target at 3 50 3 75 we fear that even if policymakers acknowledge the risks of oversteering they would ultimately conclude that a little economic pain in pursuit of price stability getting inflation back to 2 is desirable cleveland said most fomc members agree that there could be more economic pain with 13 out of 18 members seeing an upside risk to their unemployment forecasts and many believe the sep projections which cut real gdp estimates and lifted unemployment projections are too optimistic based on the magnitude of the downward revision in the fomc s real gdp projections its projections of a gradual rise in the unemployment rate may prove too optimistic said mickey levy berenberg capital markets chief economist for the u s americas and asia and a member of the shadow open market committee ed al hussainy senior interest rate strategist at columbia threadneedle investments was blunter ignore the precise median forecasts he said they are likely still too optimistic and instead focus on the direction of travel in 2022 23 after wednesday s statement al hussainy said his belief is the fed is more likely to overshoot and tighten too much sacrificing growth employment in the process than to undershoot and allow inflation to surprise them to the upside again next year the fed he noted recognizes that an un anchoring of inflation expectations would be a disproportionately costly policy error for the fed relative to a shallow recession the front end of the rate curve remains vulnerable to sharp repricing when data surprises nullify the fed s already weak forward guidance i think this mix continues to favor staying long duration and in curve flatteners still the threats to the economy are not all controllable by the fed said alex strekel director of investment management solutions at clearwater analytics while the fed can take action to stabilize the u s it cannot as effectively impact these other risks heightening the probability that stagflation impact will occur even if not expressly coupled with a

police accountability advocates had hoped the state legislature would build on reforms from 2021 in this last session but an atmosphere hostile to the issue dashed those hopes when one key reform died in committee had lawmakers in olympia passed that reform the assistant police chief in kent who just received a 1 5 million settlement to leave his job could have been the last bad cop to receive a massive check instead of a pink slip instead he s just the latest example of how arbitration makes a laughing stock out of efforts to hold police officers accountable for misconduct arbitration is a common feature of many police union contracts which gives officers facing disciplinary action the right to appeal that decision to a private arbitrator the arbitrator then has the power to reverse any discipline and even order the police department to rehire the officer in the case of kent s assistant police chief arbitration complicated city leaders efforts to correct an initial error of judgment after an investigation by an outside law firm found that the officer had no plausible explanation for displaying nazi iconography in his office the mayor and police chief only suspended him with pay for two weeks once community members and advocacy groups protested the lenient discipline however the city opted for a taxpayer funded settlement to get out the officer of the department in a press release they said they opted for this course of action out of near certainty that firing the officer would lead to an arbitrator overturning the termination due to double jeopardy concerns stephen paolini associate regional director for anti defamation league pacific northwest said in an interview that allowing arbitration to operate this way when police officers face accusations of misconduct is an intentional policy choice he stressed that the price tag for this settlement should drive home for policymakers that these issues with accountability are systemic and need a statewide solution one potential fix sb 5677 which was sponsored by senator jesse salomon never made it out of committee last session if it had become law though salomon told me in an interview that future cases like kent s would definitely produce a different outcome his bill developed by the washington coalition for police accountability would require municipalities to establish procedures that meet a set of minimum standards for receiving complaints and conducting investigations regarding serious misconduct by police officers according to enoka herat a lawyer with the aclu wa who worked on the bill those standards will put police officers on equal footing with other public employees like teachers when appealing disciplinary action instead of allowing arbitrators to essentially conduct their own review of the alleged misconduct from scratch the bill would limit the scope of any officer s appeal to only overturning discipline that s arbitrary or capricious over the phone senator salomon expressed a kind of macabre optimism that his redoubled efforts could get the bill across the finish line in 2023 he said that it really fucking sucks that it might take an international embarrassment like the settlement for kent s assistant police chief to build the political will needed to pass this reform salomon s democratic challenger this fall dr patricia weber also expressed support for prioritizing police reform if she takes salomon s seat in the senate she said that the public s frustration over failures of accountability in cases of excessive force and discriminatory treatment merits a much closer look at the issue when the state legislature reconvenes in january for advocates like herat the renewed interest in shoring up the mechanics of accountability is long overdue in her view police officers have received special treatment compared to other public employees in matters of discipline for far too long in order to rebuild public trust in law enforcement she said people need to see a fair transparent and consistent process for holding officers who violate the public s trust accountable for their misconduct if that also saves taxpayers millions of dollars in settlements to make bad cops go away even better
president joe biden said thursday the american people are really really down after a tumultuous two years with the coronavirus pandemic volatility in the economy and now surging gasoline prices that are slamming family budgets but he stressed that a recession was not inevitable and held out hope of giving the country a greater sense of confidence speaking to the associated press in a 30 minute oval office interview the president emphasized the battered economy that he inherited and the lingering psychological scars caused by a pandemic that disrupted people s sense of identity he bristled at claims by republican lawmakers that last year s covid 19 aid plan was fully to blame for inflation reaching a 40 year high calling that argument bizarre as for the overall american mindset biden said people are really really down the need for mental health in america it has skyrocketed because people have seen everything upset biden said everything they ve counted on upset but most of it s the consequence of what s happened what happened as a consequence of the covid crisis that pessimism has carried over into the economy as record prices at the pump and persistent inflation have jeopardized democrats ability to hold on to the house and senate in the midterm elections biden addressed the warnings by economists that fighting inflation could tip united states into recession first of all it s not inevitable he said secondly we re in a stronger position than any nation in the world to overcome this inflation as for the causes of inflation biden flashed some defensiveness on that count if it s my fault why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher you ask yourself that i m not being a wise guy he said the president said he saw reason for optimism with the 3 6 unemployment rate and america s relative strength in the world but restoring confidence so far has eluded biden whose approval ratings have been in steady decline as he has lost support among democrats and has little evidence to show that he could restore a sense of bipartisan normalcy to washington his oval office is filled with the portraits of presidents who faced crises that have imperiled the country and biden acknowledged there were parallels to his own situation a picture of franklin delano roosevelt hangs over his fireplace a place of prominence because the historian jon meacham told biden that no president had come into office with the economy in such dire circumstances there is also a painting of abraham lincoln who became president with a nation brutally divided and on the verge of the civil war yet biden s remedy is not that different from the diagnosis made by former president jimmy carter in 1979 when the u s economy was crippled by stagflation carter said then the u s was suffering from a crisis of confidence and the erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of america the president said he wants to endow the u s with more verve fortitude and courage be confident because i am confident we re better positioned than any country in the world to own the second quarter of the 21st century biden said that s not hyperbole that s a fact biden s bleak assessment of the national psyche comes as voters have soured on his job performance and the direction of the country only 39 of u s adults approve of biden s performance as president according to a may poll from the associated press norc center for public research dipping from already negative ratings a month earlier overall only about 2 in 10 adults said the u s is heading in the right direction or that the economy is good both down from about 3 in 10 in april those drops were concentrated among democrats with just 33 within the president s party saying the country is headed in the right direction down from 49 in april the president outlined some of the hard choices he has faced saying the u s needed to stand up to russian president vladimir putin for invading ukraine in february even though tough sanctions imposed as a result of that war have caused gas prices to surge creating a political risk for biden in an election year he called on oil companies to think of the world s short term needs and increase production asked why he ordered the financial penalties against moscow that have disrupted food and energy markets globally biden said he made his calculation as commander in chief rather than as a politician thinking about the election i m the president of the united states he said it s what s best in the country no kidding no kidding so what happens what happens if the strongest power in nato the organizational structure we put together walked away from russian aggression biden spun out the possibility of chaos in europe if an unimpeded russia kept moving deeper into the continent china was emboldened to take over taiwan and north korea grew even more aggressive with its nuclear weapon ambitions biden renewed his contention that major oil companies have benefited from higher prices without increasing production as much as they should he said the companies needed to think of the world in the short term not just their investors don t just reward yourselves he said consumer prices have jumped 8 6 over the past year the steepest rise in more than 40 years republican lawmakers have said that biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package from last year kick started a spiral of price increases the president said there was zero evidence for that claim noting that other countries have endured higher prices as economies reopened and people became vaccinated still biden acknowledged treasury secretary janet yellen s contention that the spending had a limited inflationary effect you could argue whether it had on the margin a minor impact on inflation he said i don t think it did and most economists do not but the idea that it caused inflation is bizarre still high inflation has created a conundrum for biden he prioritized bringing back millions of jobs and has seen the unemployment rate return to close to pre pandemic levels the federal reserve on wednesday increased its benchmark interest rate in hopes of slowing the economy and pulling inflation down to its target rate of 2 the tightening of fed policy has caused financial markets to slump and led many economists to warn of a potential recession next year the president encouraged americans to stay patient they shouldn t believe a warning he said they should just say let s say let s see which is correct the president is still trying to steer his domestic agenda through congress after an earlier iteration last year failed to clear a 50 50 senate biden said i believe i have the votes to lower prescription drug prices reduce families utility bills with tax incentives and place a minimum tax on corporations he said his plans would lower expenses for many americans though the measure would be scaled back from earlier intentions for an expanded child tax credit universal pre kindergarten and other programs i m going to be able to get god willing the ability to

new york fear swept through financial markets thursday and wall street tumbled as worries roared back to the fore that the world s fragile economy may buckle under higher interest rates the s p 500 fell 3 3 in a widespread wipeout to more than reverse its blip of a 1 5 rally from a day before analysts had warned of more big swings given deep uncertainties about whether the federal reserve and other central banks can tiptoe the narrow path of hiking interest rates enough to get inflation under control but not so much that they cause a recession the dow jones industrial average lost 2 4 and was briefly down more than 900 points while the nasdaq composite sank 4 1 it was the sixth loss for the s p 500 in its last seven tries and all but 3 of the stocks in the index dropped wall street fell with stocks across europe after central banks there followed up on the federal reserve s big interest rate hike on wednesday the bank of england raised its key rate for the fifth time since december though it opted for a more modest increase of 0 25 percentage points than the 0 75 point hammer brought by the fed switzerland s central bank meanwhile raised rates for the first time in years a half point hike taiwan s central bank raised its key rate by an eighth of a point japan s central bank began a two day meeting though it has held out on raising rates and making other economy slowing moves that investors call hawkish a trader works on the floor at the new york stock exchange in new york june 16 2022 such moves and expectations for plenty more have sent investments tumbling this year from bonds to bitcoin higher interest rates slow the economy by design in hopes of stamping out inflation but they re a blunt tool that can choke off the economy if used too aggressively another concern is that with the change in policy there s been weakening economic data already said bill northey senior investment director at u s bank wealth management that raises the odds of a recession in the latter part of 2022 into 2023 the worries dragged the s p 500 into a bear market earlier this week meaning it had dropped more than 20 from its peak it s now 23 6 below its record set early this year and back to where it was in late 2020 that effectively erases 2021 which was one of the best years for wall street since the turn of the millennium the s p 500 fell 123 22 points to 3 666 77 the dow lost 741 46 to 29 927 07 and the nasdaq dropped 453 06 to 10 646 10 thursday s biggest losses hit the stocks of the smallest companies a signal of pessimism about the economy s strength the russell 2000 index of smaller stocks sank 81 30 or 4 7 to 1 649 84 not only is the federal reserve hiking short term rates it also this month began allowing some of the trillions of dollars of bonds it purchased through the pandemic to roll off its balance sheet that should put upward pressure on longer term interest rates it s another way central banks have been ripping away supports they earlier propped underneath markets to juice the economy the u s economy is still holding up driven in particular by a strong jobs market fewer workers filed for unemployment benefits last week than a week before a report showed on thursday but more signs of trouble have been emerging on thursday one report showed homebuilders broke ground on fewer homes last month rising mortgage rates resulting directly from the fed s moves are digging into the industry a separate reading on manufacturing in the mid atlantic region also unexpectedly fell corporate earnings estimates have not yet changed to reflect some of the softening economic data and that could lead to the second leg of this repricing northey said treasury yields swung sharply on thursday with the 10 year yield down to 3 23 from 3 39 late wednesday it had climbed as high as 3 48 in the morning near its highest level since 2011 higher rates have been delivering the hardest hits this year to the investments that soared the most through the easy ultralow rates of earlier in the pandemic which now look to be among the most expensive and risky investments that includes bitcoin and high growth technology stocks big tech stocks were among the heaviest weights on the market thursday but the sharpest losses hit stocks whose profits depend more on the strength of the economy and whether customers can keep up their purchases amid the highest inflation in decades cruise operators norwegian cruise line holdings royal caribbean group and carnival all lost more than 11 it s all a sharp turnaround from a day earlier when stocks rallied immediately after the fed s biggest hike to rates since 1994 analysts said investors seemed to latch onto a comment from fed chair jerome powell who said mega hikes of three quarters of a percentage point would not be common powell said wednesday the fed is moving expeditiously to get rates closer to normal levels after last week s stunning report that showed inflation at the

the baby formula shortage continues to impact many families as formula makers and the u s food and drug administration fda investigate what led to the national crisis for the week of may 22 may 29 the latest out of stock rate for infant formula jumped to 73 58 nationwide according to data by analytics firm datasembly this was nearly 4 higher than the week prior and was a significant increase from last month when the out of stock rate stood at 45 a spokesperson with datasembly told fox television stations wednesday that the infant formula stock situation in the u s continues to be quite volatile and the out of stock situation is expected to be nearing the peak while many american parents struggle to find infant formula health experts say the problem has been exacerbated for parents with babies who require a specific formula due to allergies parents struggle to find baby formula for allergies emily ingrich a 31 year old mother told fox that the process of finding baby formula has been difficult it s been horrible my son has a dairy allergy so he needs a specific formula that has been impossible to find she shared we live in a rural area of north carolina and have driven over three hours away to find his formula baby formula is offered for sale at a big box store on january 13 2022 in chicago illinois baby formula has been is short supply in many stores around the country for several months photo by scott olson getty images yet this is only one woman s story as many families struggle to find baby formula for their infant with allergies due to the nationwide shortage this is a challenging situation for new parents dr steven miller a pediatric gastroenterologist with johns hopkins children s center told fox being a new parent is amazing but also really stressful and this can definitely add to that additional stress especially for families who are struggling getting access for a baby who has extra needs babies who require a specialized formula commonly include premature infants babies who have trouble tolerating regular infant formula or breast milk or babies with certain medical conditions all of those kids have more trouble getting access to their formulas during this shortage miller continued related baby formula shortage out of stock rate continues to worsen jumping to 73 5 these types of allergies are most commonly associated with babies under one year of age and are different than the type of allergies typically found in older kids such as a peanut allergy according to kidshealth a milk protein intolerance from formula may lead to symptoms in babies including wheezing trouble breathing coughing throat tightness an upset stomach vomiting diarrhea swollen eyes hives a drop in blood pressure and blood or mucus in infant s stools but the severity of allergic reactions to milk can vary the same child can react differently with each exposure this means that even though one reaction was mild the next could be more severe and even life threatening where can i find formula for my baby with allergies extensively hydrolyzed formulas offer complete nutrition for infants who are allergic to cow s milk protein kidshealth explains dr jenifer lightdale a pediatric gastroenterologist who serves on the american academy of pediatrics committee said most babies with allergies who need hypoallergenic formulas have what we call a milk protein allergy where their immune systems are reacting to intact proteins in the formula casein is a cow s milk protein that is a common cause for allergy symptoms extensively hydrolyzed formulas break casein into pieces so about 90 of babies with a cow s milk allergy will tolerate these formulas infants with food allergies have less hypoallergenic formula options so as shortages of different formulas have occurred the families of these babies have had less alternatives to use if they cannot get more of their typical formula lightdale explained common brands include nutramigen similac alimentum and gerber extensive ha alimentum was one brand affected by february s recall when the fda warned consumers to avoid some powdered baby formula products from a sturgis michigan facility run by abbott nutrition which then initiated a voluntary recall elecare an amino acid based formula was also recalled according to findings released in march by federal safety inspectors abbott failed to maintain sanitary conditions and procedures at the plant the fda launched its investigation after four babies became sick with a rare bacterial infection after consuming formula manufactured at the plant all four babies were hospitalized and two died chicago based abbott said in a statement there is no evidence to link our formulas to these infant illnesses abbott noted that samples of the bacteria collected from the infants did not match those found in the company s factory ultimately this recall along with supply chain disruptions have caused major delays among retailers and companies this has also caused stores to put limitations on how much baby formula customers can buy so if you re on the hunt for specific formula doctors suggest talking to your pediatrician first especially if your baby must use a hydrolyzed or amino acid based formula if your baby requires a specific brand experts suggest discussing options with your pediatrician or calling a local food bank to see if they can help locate some formula they also recommend checking with smaller stores and pharmacies which may still have supplies when larger stores run out baby formula can also be very costly so for families who qualify based on income the women infants and children wic a federal program like food stamps that serves to help families can provide formula free of charge doctors also suggest seeking out local groups online many local parent groups have postings about unopened unexpired formula canisters available to give away or sell during this time experts say it s okay to look for formula online but check that it is sold by a reputable supplier unopened and unexpired formula substitutes miller noted if your baby has allergies they may still be able to switch to a different brand but similar type of formula lightdale agreed adding for example if the baby is on an amino acid based formula aaf that is being affected by the shortage then they should switch to another aaf alternatively if their baby is thriving on an extensively hydrolyzed formula ehf then they should switch to another ehf the north american society for pediatric gastroenterology hepatology and nutrition naspghan provides a list of formulas that are comparable and safe to substitute for each other however experts say any substitution should only be done under the recommendation and supervision of a healthcare professional if families are not sure what to switch to or if they have any questions about what to feed their baby they should talk to their baby s doctor who originally recommended or prescribed the allergy formula for the infant lighdale continued do not stockpile watering down formula while the baby formula shortage is a challenge for many parents doctors say parents should not try to make their own formula at home from cow s milk or add extra water to the formula to stretch supplies both of these things could make the baby sick sarah adams who is with ohio s pediatric primary care hudson made it quite clear on this point i do not recommend making your own formula adding the aap strongly advises against homemade formula she continued these are not safe and not fda approved infant deaths have been reported many do it yourself formula recipes are made from cow s milk and granular sugar that may be difficult for young babies to digest they also lack the specific vitamins and proteins found in breastmilk and fda approved formulas that are needed for basic nutrition adams also recommends not watering down formula citing this practice as dangerous that can lead to poor nutritional balance and serious complications additionally most experts don t defend stocking up on formula for just in case scenarios in general i m not in favor of parents buying up a ton of formula that they aren t sure they will need people stockpiling formula is part of why stores are running low miller explained that being said it would be okay for new parents to have a can or two of formula at home especially if they are thinking of using formula if you are actively using baby formula the aap advises buying no more than a 10 day to two week supply of formula the shortage is temporary parents are in this together please avoid stockpiling help your neighbors and focus on infant safety dr kelsey klaas a pediatrician at mayo clinic said expectant mothers encouraged to breastfeed if you are an expectant mother many doctors are urging women to consider breastfeeding especially due to the current formula shortage according to the mayo clinic breastfeeding provides the best nutrition for an infant and is the most widely recommended way to feed a newborn related baby formula vs breast milk doctors explain what parents should do amid formula shortage breast milk contains the right balance of nutrients for your baby and boosts your baby s immune system jay l hoecker an emeritus pediatrics specialist at mayo clinic said it s considered the gold standard for infant nutrition dr cynthia blanco a neonatologist in texas and a member of the american academy of pediatrics aap echoed hoecker saying if you have a healthy term baby your best choice will always be breast milk and a number of health organizations including the aap the american medical association ama and the world health organization who agree recommending breastfeeding as the best choice for babies experts say breastfeeding has chemicals that help defend against infections prevent allergies and protect against a number of chronic conditions additionally breast milk is the most cost effective option since it doesn t cost a cent and formula quickly adds up this shortage is a major headache and if moms make their own milk rather than buying it from the store that is one less thing to worry about miller noted adding the other thing doctors like about breastfeeding is that when babies breastfeed they can decide when they are full more easily than they can with formula this is part of why babies who are breastfed turn into kids who have a lower chance of being obese i am definitely a big fan of breastfeeding klaas noted she always encourages mothers to breastfeed when possible i absolutely support breastfeeding when possible we know that breastfeeding has benefits to both the infant and mother over formula feeding klass explained adding the current formula shortage highlights one particular benefit of breastfeeding which is that for a parent who is able to produce enough milk to meet the infant s needs infant nutrition is not reliant on external supplies health experts suggest that mothers who are exclusively breastfeeding ask their baby s pediatrician about vitamin d supplements for their baby since breast milk alone does not provide an adequate amount of the vitamin which helps the baby absorb calcium and phosphorus nutrients necessary for strong bones mothers who are anxious about breastfeeding may want to contact friends or family who have successfully breastfed as they may be a good source of information support organizations such as la leche league along with lactation consultants at many hospitals and clinics are available to help as well when will the formula shortage end earlier this week delta one of the world s largest airlines announced it would be joining the effort to bring more baby formula to the united states delta and the white house announced on june 10 that the airline s cargo division would donate 13 flights from the u k to the u s from june 20 24 transporting 212 000 pounds or about 3 2 million 8

facility for conversion to a final product that will be made available in the coming weeks monthly follow up shipments will continue through november the u s department of health and human services said it is evaluating options for getting the product to the u s as quickly as possible the agency is leveraging a number of flexibilities to bolster the supply of products that serve as the sole source of nutrition for many infants while ensuring the infant formula can be used safely and provides adequate nutrition the white house wrote in a press release the fda remains in further discussions with manufacturers and suppliers regarding additional supply to ensure there s adequate infant formula available wherever and whenever parents and caregivers need it the white house also expects the recent resumption of production at abbott nutrition s facility will mean more supply soon you just don t know what formula your baby is going to tolerate and any formula change has to be supervised by your pediatrician we went through three different formulas to find one that my son could tolerate ingrid continued adding it will be ok as mothers it s ingrained in our dna to make sure our children are fed safe and healthy this story was reported from los angeles

the u s federal reserve on june 15 raised its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points marking the sharpest rate hike since 1994 as inflation data released in recent days indicates no clear sign of easing though necessary to bring inflation under control the fed s more hawkish stance could plunge the u s economy into a recession dealing another blow to the biden administration and dampening democrats prospects in the upcoming mid term elections the u s central bank s faster monetary tightening could also create spillover effects hitting emerging markets and low income countries leading to a global financial rout u s federal reserve chair jerome powell rear attends a press conference in washington d c the united states on june 15 2022 xinhua liu jie inflation again surprised after a two day policy meeting the federal open market committee fomc the fed s policy making body decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to a range of 1 5 to 1 75 percent noting that the fed is highly attentive to inflation risks the central bank raised rates by 25 basis points in march beginning its rate hiking cycle as surging inflation in the united states smashed records in four decades it then raised rates by 50 basis points in may the 75 basis point rise was the first such move in decades since the may policy meeting inflation has again surprised to the upside pushing the committee to adopt a larger rate hike fed chair jerome powell said wednesday afternoon at a press conference the u s labor department reported friday that the consumer price index skyrocketed 8 6 percent in may from a year earlier marking the third straight month of inflation over 8 percent and hitting a new four decade high the figures dashed hopes that inflation had peaked from the perspective of today either a 50 or 75 basis point increase seems most likely at our next meeting said powell leaving the door open for another 75 basis point rate hike the fed chair noted that the committee would like to do a little more front end loading meaning the fed would implement larger hikes early in its rate hiking cycle a woman buys food at a food truck in new york the united states may 11 2022 xinhua wang ying recession risks up the fed s newly released quarterly economic projections showed that the median fomc projection for the federal funds rate at the end of this year has jumped to 3 4 percent much higher than the 1 9 percent projected in march the median projection for 2023 year end federal funds rate is 3 8 percent the economic projections also showed that fed officials median projection of gdp growth in the fourth quarter this year is 1 7 percent much lower than the 2 8 percent projected in march despite aiming to move policy into restrictive territory by year end the economic projections continues to paint a rather optimistic picture of the economy ahead sarah house and michael pugliese economists at wells fargo securities wrote in an analysis in our view it will take a more material slowdown in economic growth to bring core inflation back to the fomc s 2 percent target and more damage is likely to be inflicted to the labor market they said desmond lachman senior fellow at the american enterprise institute and a former official at the international monetary fund imf told xinhua that markets have declined sharply over the last few days creating the conditions for a hard landing later this year adam posen president of the peterson institute for international economics told xinhua that the speeding up or front loading of hikes makes little difference to recession risk and what matters most is how high the fed has to go to control inflation if they raise the projected terminal rate of this hiking cycle from around 3 percent to more than 4 percent that indicates that they may need a recession to bring down inflation posen said according to the estimates by bloomberg economics released wednesday a downturn by the start of 2024 barely even on the radar just a few months ago is now close to a three in four probability pedestrians walk past a supermarket in washington d c the united states on june 14 2022 photo by ting shen xinhua biden s major headache surging inflation has inflicted pain on american businesses and households resulting in a major headache for the biden administration especially as the mid term elections draw closer president joe biden and his party who have yet to address the issue with a viable plan would need to persuade voters that persistently high inflation is not due to policy failure but rather to pandemic related supply shocks and the ukraine crisis but that could be a tough sell the fed took a gamble which was a reasonable one ex ante to see how low they could drive unemployment when the arp american rescue plan was passed by in march 2021 however the fed should have shifted its stance towards tightening and abandoned the transitory language posen told xinhua it was clear inflation was going to come in higher and they should have updated their forecasts they should have been tapering quantitative easing and begun to tighten by no later than june 2021 said posen who had warned of higher inflation before a wall street journal opinion piece published on tuesday argued that the current inflation was predictable blaming the fed the congress and the president for adopting excessive fiscal and monetary policies greg cusack a former member of the iowa house of representatives told xinhua that he thinks the biden administration lost the narrative thread some time ago the surge in prices proving to be much more enduring and widespread than most in his administration believed is now the real elephant in the room i think the mood of the country is set mired in a gloomy assessment of the administration as well as a perception that democrats in congress are at fault for not doing more said cusack so it is very likely that there will be a gop wave in the fall elections bringing into power at the federal state and local levels people who are even further to the right than those now in office he said gas prices are displayed at a gas station in los angeles california the united states june 1 2022 photo by zeng hui xinhua spillover effects the fed s shift to a more hawkish stance could lead to spillover effects on emerging markets and low income countries given the u s dollar s essential role in the global financial system we are seeing that high u s interest are causing capital to be repatriated out of the emerging market economies which might now default on their debts and cause global financial market stresses lachman told xinhua during the april spring meetings of the imf and the world bank officials and economists warned about the potential spillover risks of the u s fed s more aggressive monetary tightening it could add pressure to capital outflows in emerging markets push up imported inflation increase debt vulnerabilities and reduce policy space malhar nabar division chief at the imf s research department told xinhua in a virtual interview earlier so there is a concern that emerging market economies that have borrowed heavily in dollars and especially on short maturity could find themselves in a difficult position nabar said and that would then lead to a slowdown in their economies he said or if they re not able to meet their debt service obligations then of course that would create wider debt problems posen noted that some low and middle income economies would have financial difficulties with the fed sharply hiking rates this will particularly hit those which are having difficulties with food and energy price inflation and with large hangovers from covid 19 he said that said most low and middle income economies are better positioned to ride out fed rate hikes this cycle than in the past posen added
the baby formula shortage continues to impact many families as formula makers and the u s food and drug administration fda investigate what led to the national crisis for the week of may 22 may 29 the latest out of stock rate for infant formula jumped to 73 58 nationwide according to data by analytics firm datasembly this was nearly 4 higher than the week prior and was a significant increase from last month when the out of stock rate stood at 45 a spokesperson with datasembly told fox television stations wednesday that the infant formula stock situation in the u s continues to be quite volatile and the out of stock situation is expected to be nearing the peak while many american parents struggle to find infant formula health experts say the problem has been exacerbated for parents with babies who require a specific formula due to allergies parents struggle to find baby formula for allergies emily ingrich a 31 year old mother told fox that the process of finding baby formula has been difficult it s been horrible my son has a dairy allergy so he needs a specific formula that has been impossible to find she shared we live in a rural area of north carolina and have driven over three hours away to find his formula baby formula is offered for sale at a big box store on january 13 2022 in chicago illinois baby formula has been is short supply in many stores around the country for several months photo by scott olson getty images yet this is only one woman s story as many families struggle to find baby formula for their infant with allergies due to the nationwide shortage this is a challenging situation for new parents dr steven miller a pediatric gastroenterologist with johns hopkins children s center told fox being a new parent is amazing but also really stressful and this can definitely add to that additional stress especially for families who are struggling getting access for a baby who has extra needs babies who require a specialized formula commonly include premature infants babies who have trouble tolerating regular infant formula or breast milk or babies with certain medical conditions all of those kids have more trouble getting access to their formulas during this shortage miller continued related baby formula shortage out of stock rate continues to worsen jumping to 73 5 these types of allergies are most commonly associated with babies under one year of age and are different than the type of allergies typically found in older kids such as a peanut allergy according to kidshealth a milk protein intolerance from formula may lead to symptoms in babies including wheezing trouble breathing coughing throat tightness an upset stomach vomiting diarrhea swollen eyes hives a drop in blood pressure and blood or mucus in infant s stools but the severity of allergic reactions to milk can vary the same child can react differently with each exposure this means that even though one reaction was mild the next could be more severe and even life threatening where can i find formula for my baby with allergies extensively hydrolyzed formulas offer complete nutrition for infants who are allergic to cow s milk protein kidshealth explains dr jenifer lightdale a pediatric gastroenterologist who serves on the american academy of pediatrics committee said most babies with allergies who need hypoallergenic formulas have what we call a milk protein allergy where their immune systems are reacting to intact proteins in the formula casein is a cow s milk protein that is a common cause for allergy symptoms extensively hydrolyzed formulas break casein into pieces so about 90 of babies with a cow s milk allergy will tolerate these formulas infants with food allergies have less hypoallergenic formula options so as shortages of different formulas have occurred the families of these babies have had less alternatives to use if they cannot get more of their typical formula lightdale explained common brands include nutramigen similac alimentum and gerber extensive ha alimentum was one brand affected by february s recall when the fda warned consumers to avoid some powdered baby formula products from a sturgis michigan facility run by abbott nutrition which then initiated a voluntary recall elecare an amino acid based formula was also recalled according to findings released in march by federal safety inspectors abbott failed to maintain sanitary conditions and procedures at the plant the fda launched its investigation after four babies became sick with a rare bacterial infection after consuming formula manufactured at the plant all four babies were hospitalized and two died chicago based abbott said in a statement there is no evidence to link our formulas to these infant illnesses abbott noted that samples of the bacteria collected from the infants did not match those found in the company s factory ultimately this recall along with supply chain disruptions have caused major delays among retailers and companies this has also caused stores to put limitations on how much baby formula customers can buy so if you re on the hunt for specific formula doctors suggest talking to your pediatrician first especially if your baby must use a hydrolyzed or amino acid based formula if your baby requires a specific brand experts suggest discussing options with your pediatrician or calling a local food bank to see if they can help locate some formula they also recommend checking with smaller stores and pharmacies which may still have supplies when larger stores run out baby formula can also be very costly so for families who qualify based on income the women infants and children wic a federal program like food stamps that serves to help families can provide formula free of charge doctors also suggest seeking out local groups online many local parent groups have postings about unopened unexpired formula canisters available to give away or sell during this time experts say it s okay to look for formula online but check that it is sold by a reputable supplier unopened and unexpired formula substitutes miller noted if your baby has allergies they may still be able to switch to a different brand but similar type of formula lightdale agreed adding for example if the baby is on an amino acid based formula aaf that is being affected by the shortage then they should switch to another aaf alternatively if their baby is thriving on an extensively hydrolyzed formula ehf then they should switch to another ehf the north american society for pediatric gastroenterology hepatology and nutrition naspghan provides a list of formulas that are comparable and safe to substitute for each other however experts say any substitution should only be done under the recommendation and supervision of a healthcare professional if families are not sure what to switch to or if they have any questions about what to feed their baby they should talk to their baby s doctor who originally recommended or prescribed the allergy formula for the infant lighdale continued do not stockpile watering down formula while the baby formula shortage is a challenge for many parents doctors say parents should not try to make their own formula at home from cow s milk or add extra water to the formula to stretch supplies both of these things could make the baby sick sarah adams who is with ohio s pediatric primary care hudson made it quite clear on this point i do not recommend making your own formula adding the aap strongly advises against homemade formula she continued these are not safe and not fda approved infant deaths have been reported many do it yourself formula recipes are made from cow s milk and granular sugar that may be difficult for young babies to digest they also lack the specific vitamins and proteins found in breastmilk and fda approved formulas that are needed for basic nutrition adams also recommends not watering down formula citing this practice as dangerous that can lead to poor nutritional balance and serious complications additionally most experts don t defend stocking up on formula for just in case scenarios in general i m not in favor of parents buying up a ton of formula that they aren t sure they will need people stockpiling formula is part of why stores are running low miller explained that being said it would be okay for new parents to have a can or two of formula at home especially if they are thinking of using formula if you are actively using baby formula the aap advises buying no more than a 10 day to two week supply of formula the shortage is temporary parents are in this together please avoid stockpiling help your neighbors and focus on infant safety dr kelsey klaas a pediatrician at mayo clinic said expectant mothers encouraged to breastfeed if you are an expectant mother many doctors are urging women to consider breastfeeding especially due to the current formula shortage according to the mayo clinic breastfeeding provides the best nutrition for an infant and is the most widely recommended way to feed a newborn related baby formula vs breast milk doctors explain what parents should do amid formula shortage breast milk contains the right balance of nutrients for your baby and boosts your baby s immune system jay l hoecker an emeritus pediatrics specialist at mayo clinic said it s considered the gold standard for infant nutrition dr cynthia blanco a neonatologist in texas and a member of the american academy of pediatrics aap echoed hoecker saying if you have a healthy term baby your best choice will always be breast milk and a number of health organizations including the aap the american medical association ama and the world health organization who agree recommending breastfeeding as the best choice for babies experts say breastfeeding has chemicals that help defend against infections prevent allergies and protect against a number of chronic conditions additionally breast milk is the most cost effective option since it doesn t cost a cent and formula quickly adds up this shortage is a major headache and if moms make their own milk rather than buying it from the store that is one less thing to worry about miller noted adding the other thing doctors like about breastfeeding is that when babies breastfeed they can decide when they are full more easily than they can with formula this is part of why babies who are breastfed turn into kids who have a lower chance of being obese i am definitely a big fan of breastfeeding klaas noted she always encourages mothers to breastfeed when possible i absolutely support breastfeeding when possible we know that breastfeeding has benefits to both the infant and mother over formula feeding klass explained adding the current formula shortage highlights one particular benefit of breastfeeding which is that for a parent who is able to produce enough milk to meet the infant s needs infant nutrition is not reliant on external supplies health experts suggest that mothers who are exclusively breastfeeding ask their baby s pediatrician about vitamin d supplements for their baby since breast milk alone does not provide an adequate amount of the vitamin which helps the baby absorb calcium and phosphorus nutrients necessary for strong bones mothers who are anxious about breastfeeding may want to contact friends or family who have successfully breastfed as they may be a good source of information support organizations such as la leche league along with lactation consultants at many hospitals and clinics are available to help as well when will the formula shortage end earlier this week delta one of the world s largest airlines announced it would be joining the effort to bring more baby formula to the united states delta and the white house announced on june 10 that the airline s cargo division would donate 13 flights from the u k to the u s from june 20 24 transporting 212 000 pounds or about 3 2 million 8 ounce bottles of kendamil organic and classic formulas related baby formula shortage delta airlines to fly millions of bottles from uk to us kendamil will export at least 2 million cans of infant formula to the u s the equivalent of 54 million 8 ounce bottles according to the white house on wednesday the government also announced that base powder would begin shipping this month to a minnesota facility for conversion to a final product that will be made available in the coming weeks monthly follow up shipments will continue through november the u s department of health and human services said it is evaluating options for getting the product to the u s as quickly as possible the agency is leveraging a number of flexibilities to bolster the supply of products that serve as the sole source of nutrition for many infants while ensuring the infant formula can be used safely and provides adequate nutrition the white house wrote in a press release the fda remains in further discussions with manufacturers and suppliers regarding additional supply to ensure there s adequate infant formula available wherever and whenever parents and caregivers need it the white house also expects the recent resumption of production at abbott nutrition s facility will mean more supply soon you just don t know what formula your baby is going to tolerate and any formula change has to be supervised by your pediatrician we went through three different formulas to find one that my son could tolerate ingrid continued adding it will be ok as mothers it s ingrained in our dna to make sure our children are fed safe and healthy this story was reported from los angeles

by mark mcdermott the manhattan beach planning commission last week unanimously if somewhat reluctantly voted in favor of project verandas a proposed four story 79 unit apartment building on rosecrans avenue which includes six low income apartments that qualify it for a streamlined non discretionary approval process under a state density bonus law the 96 217 sq ft project is located on rosecrans just above highland avenue at the former verandas site an event facility and the current tradewinds commercial building project verandas has been in the works for over three years and was formally submitted by local developer frank buckley a year ago due to its qualification under a state law meant to incentivize low income housing project verandas was only initially subject to administrative approval and not subject to usual processes such as an environmental review community development director carrie tai issued approval on march 29 the june 8 public hearing considered four appeals that attempted to overturn the project s approval the planning commission however likewise had limited purview over the project assessing mainly its compliance with the law i don t think staff is happy i don t think the city attorney is happy i don t think the planning commission is happy said commissioner jim dillavou because normally what would happen state law aside is we would have a kind of a similar dialogue that we had today but probably get a little bit more into the details of the project and be able to incorporate a little bit more of that community feedback and that s what the community clearly wants based on the comments that were submitted that s what we want so i think it s safe to say that we are all sitting in a very frustrated position commissioner gerry morton said a majority of the public wanted to see a less dense project and that normally the commission would have the ability to consider neighborhood impact and a project s suitability with the city s general plan we re really looking at this this appeal how the project complies with the density bonus outline and really legislation out of sacramento morton said i mean if people don t like certain legislation they can make their voices known there but we have to work with what we re given i ve reviewed the four appeals of the project in detail i ve looked for ways in which this does not comport with the law and i ve yet to find it so given that i can t personally vote in any way other than to reject the appeal and support the director s decision to move forward with the project dillavou emphasized that the developer had simply followed the law in submitting the project i don t think anybody is wrong this is a super unique situation he said the only thing we could do here is set the city up for significant litigation by deciding not to follow the law which would just be a painful expensive waste of time and money because the issue has been litigated a number of times and it s been upheld and so we can try to puff out our chest and say that we re manhattan beach and we re different we re not going to follow the law because we don t have to but after two years of fighting i think we lose one way or the other commissioner robert tokashiki said local officials have to bear the brunt of state decisions you know we get these directions coming out of sacramento yet they re not part of the conversation when staff has to put together an administrative decision he said it seems like they should be taking a little bit of the heat also buckley the developer gave a short presentation on the project in which he emphasized that under current zoning local not state the proposed residential use has less impact on the surrounding neighborhood than the existing uses and every other possible use which include hotel and retail we were initially introduced to the site by a new york developer seeking capital he was looking to build a 10 plus story luxury hotel buckley said needless to say we never wanted to do that deal and it never came to fruition thank goodness buckley and his team did look at a smaller boutique hotel but could never make it pencil out after months of analyzing every possible use case from mixed use retail to office to hotel we and our experts concluded that multifamily residential was indeed the highest and best use he said why because it helps the city reach its housing goals both market rate and middle class it optimizes sustainability by creating proximity between the labor force and the workplace it complements the restaurants and retail businesses located in el porto and the north end it has the least traffic impact when compared to alternative developments which include mixed use retail hotel and existing commercial use it improves access to public parking a 127 space underground parking garage is included in the project but buckley argued that because the two existing buildings being razed for the new project are under parked the project actually frees up over 200 spaces in the adjacent city and chevron lots that are currently used for parking spillover for existing uses and though it was not required the developer commissioned an independent traffic study peer reviewed by the city s traffic engineer the study indicated that the existing 931 daily trips would be reduced to 578 senior city planner ted faturos methodically went through all the issues raised by the four appellants returning again and again to what the city s actual authority is i d like to remind the commission that the project is subject to an administrative non discretionary review which means the review of the project must be based on compliance with objective and applicable development standards he said and also state density bonus law states that the word objective means involving no personal or subjective judgment by a public official the appellants still made their respective cases don mcpherson argued that the city could exercise eminent domain to take land between the manhattan village mall and the nearby golf course to meet the housing needs project verandas purports to do he said that the project should not be exempt from the california environmental quality act and that the commission is within its authority to require an environmental impact report he also said the city could exercise the planning commission has that discretionary authority he said this is not a ministerial process this is a public hearing and staff makes ministerial decisions but the planning commission exercises its discretion and in this particular case ceqa is absolutely clear that this project is subject to environmental review appellant george bordokas argued that the city granted the developer waivers for normal code requirements based on evidence supplied by the developer he suggested a second opinion and strongly argued that the project should be required to abide by the city s 30 ft height limit in its coastal zone it s a pretty nice development it really looks good he said it looks like it ll just really fit into the manhattan beach style but one thing that it doesn t do it only provides six affordable units and we need 406 as don just said it has 73 very profitable units for the developer so the developer is paying six units to the state to make money on 73 units and also not abiding by our local codes they are taking advantage of this community of our right to control the character of our town of our right to have laws that shape that character richard mackenzie representing a group of residents appealing the project likewise implored the planning commission to assert local over state rights this project undermines the very charge authority and legitimacy of the planning commission he said are its codes and enforcements applicable to only some projects but not to others if that is the case how can you plan for the city s future how can you legitimize your actions to some and not to others the very notion of planning is eviscerated by this project and the enabling legislation in our opinion the manhattan beach planning commission must go on record standing up for its own jurisdiction we are concerned for not only the character of our small beach community but also for the potential aspects of environmental impact finally appellant andrew ryan who owns the adjacent medical office building that buckley tried unsuccessfully to buy argued that a provision within state law would allow discretionary review if a preponderance of evidence showed the possibility of adverse environmental impact he said the chevron refinery located adjacent to the project site across the nearby el segundo border is likely to produce floating petroleum that could potentially end up in groundwater due to the project s subterranean excavation i don t think anyone here is going to doubt that petroleum isn t itself a toxic substance and it could have an impact on public health and safety ryan said commissioner kristin sistos delved further into the chevron groundwater issue at one point noting that if true this issue represented substantive grounds for the commission to exercise authority but tim wood a hydrogeologist retained by the developer who has examined the project site said chevron studies have repeatedly shown that its product plumes do not extend beyond the refinery site and in any case the groundwater beneath the site is not used for drinking water the groundwater is not used in this area not because of chevron he said the groundwater resources are deep where we pump our drinking water in this area you d be drinking salt water public testimony at the hearing was equally for and against somewhat surprisingly given the outpouring of opposition over the past five months that has included a change org petition with over 3 000 signatures against the project as much as i would love manhattan beach to stay the same way it is forever i realize it s naive to think that an acre of relatively undeveloped land near the beach will stay vacant said resident kevin covert it will be developed after reviewing the various options for the property i do believe that this project represents the best use and is good for the city i ve been both a renter and homeowner in manhattan beach and i am very attuned to the extreme lack of affordable housing it s become harder and harder to attract young families into this community said resident rod parsley if you ve been to la jolla in the last few years you know it s very hard to see someone walking down the street who s not over 85 years old we need young vibrant communities in manhattan beach in our school systems and i think this is a great way to help attract those types of families into our community resident ronald schendel said opposing the project did not mean opposing what the project could be if improved i think we need to get a little focused here he said the objections to the project are not to kill the project or to have no apartments there it s the height which would stick out like a sore thumb and it s all based on a waiver and the only reason for a waiver is evidence produced by the developer themselves that the project could not be built within the foot height limit i think it s hogwash that has to be challenged let s show our community and those outside of manhattan beach that we care about our community valuing reasonable density at current height requirements versus a community of mega projects said resident don barker let s have developers of mega projects go to redondo beach and other areas who wants redondo beach in manhattan beach buckley in his rebuttal to the appeals addressed the notion that the six low income units were the only part of the project addressing the area s housing shortage this project provides not just the six units but 73 units towards desperately needed housing stock he said the average price of a home in manhattan beach is around 3 million to rent a home in manhattan beach is 5 000 10 000 20 000 i have a friend who rents his home in the tree section for 23 000 a month it s getting ridiculous we need more rental product that s affordable for young families otherwise you re going to end up like carmel and just have a bunch of older folks living in manhattan beach buckley said developers throughout the south bay are looking for ways to provide housing but very few sites present the right opportunity to do so because of all the elements needed to make it work including a willing seller a fair price and good lot size the moons really have to align you have to check a lot of boxes he said we got very lucky with this property we think it s a unicorn i feel very comfortable with what we re proposing in this location would i be comfortable doing this at highland and manhattan beach boulevard no but this is next to a refinery it is upland from a main intersection and the views it is blocking are of a refinery and transmission lines i live work and play in the community and have been here for a long time i m very sensitive to what gets developed here and we ve taken this into consideration when we proposed this project er
