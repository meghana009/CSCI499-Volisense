december 9 2022 washington afp the united states on friday expressed alarm over a full scale defense partnership between moscow and tehran describing it as harmful to ukraine iran s neighbors and the world iran stands accused by western powers of supplying drones to russia which rejected the us allegations as moscow batters ukraine s energy infrastructure in search of an advantage in the bloody conflict washington has previously condemned iran russia security cooperation but on friday described an extensive relationship involving equipment such as helicopters and fighter jets as well as drones with the latter items resulting in new us sanctions russia is seeking to collaborate with iran in areas like weapons development training white house national security spokesman john kirby told reporters moscow is offering iran an unprecedented level of military and technical support that is transforming their relationship into a fully fledged defense partnership he said we have also seen reports that moscow and tehran are considering the establishment of a joint production line for lethal drones in russia we urge iran to reverse course and not to take these steps moscow s un envoy vassily nebenzia pushed back later in the day telling a security council meeting that the military industrial complex in russia can work perfectly fine and doesn t need anyone s assistance the drone allegations he said were already refuted multiple times before earlier kirby announced that the united states would sanction three russian based entities active in the acquisition and use of iranian drones the sanctions target the russian aerospace forces the 924th state center for unmanned aviation and the command of the military transport aviation the united states will continue to use every tool at our disposal to disrupt these transfers and impose consequences on those engaged in this activity secretary of state antony blinken said in a statement on the sanctions last month tehran admitted it had sent drones to russia but insisted they were supplied before the invasion of ukraine sordid deals kirby said the united states is also concerned that russia intends to provide iran with advanced military components including helicopters and air defense systems iranian pilots have reportedly been learning to fly advanced sukhoi su 35 warplanes in russia and tehran may receive the aircraft within the next year which would significantly strengthen iran s air force relative to its regional neighbors kirby said the united states also believes that iran is considering the sale of hundreds of ballistic missiles to russia he said britain s foreign secretary james cleverly took aim friday at the sordid deals between moscow and tehran saying in a statement that iran had sent drones to russia in exchange for military and technical support from moscow this will increase the risk it poses to our partners in the middle east and to international security cleverly said vowing that the uk will continue to expose this desperate alliance and hold both countries to account kirby on friday announced a new 275 million aid package to help boost ukraine s air defenses against russian drones in particular he said the aid will soon be on its way to provide ukraine with new capabilities to boost its air defenses and counter the threats that ukraine is facing from drones the pentagon released details on the package saying it includes counter drone equipment as well as ammunition for himars precision rocket systems 80 000 155mm artillery rounds some 150 generators and other equipment the united states has previously said that generators were being provided to kyiv to help ukraine with its electricity needs amid repeated russian strikes on energy infrastructure the latest package which is made up of equipment taken from existing us stocks brings washington s military assistance to ukraine since russia s february 24 invasion to more than 19 3 billion
barring any emergency sessions scheduled in the next three weeks the michigan state legislature is done for the year that means the entire legislative session is over as half the lawmakers turn over in the new year the final days lead to what is called lame duck session when the final efforts to pass bills are made sometimes a fast and furious affair this year was a bit lame all of these bills do expire on dec 31 of this year said senator jeremy moss a democrat from southfield lame duck can be an incredibly productive and intense session like it was in 2018 before the governor s office changed parties or it can be like this year when not much gets done and the year ends early we re going into a democratic trifecta but we still have a democratic governor so there is no way republican only projects that the governor would sign into law said sen moss it had to be something bipartisan there was talk about surplus spending earned income tax credits or possibly a gas tax break in the end the biggest bill passed in lame duck was about recycling and creating an environment focused on holding polluters liable and boosting recycling services we were overdue for this which is why i think there was a sense of political urgency to do this during lame duck said jeff johnston spokesman for egle we want michigan to be in a leadership position again in waste management for some political reasons there were also dozens of disappointments the bill that would stock every school and child care center with water filters never given a vote in the house for years both sides have repeatedly called for transparency in government we ve put forward our legislation to at long last subject michigan s state government the legislature and the governor s office to greater transparency said moss the bill was never brought to the floor for a vote now after the new year the entire process will have to restart moss said that with as slow the end of this session had been the start if next will be a flurry for the first time in 40 years democrats will have full control and their agenda can push forward including his foia bill i ve already talked to my friend and partner across the aisle state senator ed mcbroom we are both returning next term said moss we are going to continue to work on these efforts so at long last we can get it done during the session
archived document may contain errors 108 september 26 1990 how to improve the u s japan security alliance umodumon the united states japan military alliance is being strained declining cold war tensions between the u s and the soviet union and rising economic competition between the u s and japan are placing unprece dented pressures on it rather than receding in importance in the post cold war world this alliance may become more important to japan and the u s as the basis for long term stability in asia and expanding bilateral political cooperation the pentagon rightly calls this alliance the linchpin of american strategy in asia under the 1960 mutual defense treaty the u s is committed to defend japan while japan provides bases for american forces under pres sure from washington japan steadily has increased the size of its defense for ces over the past decade japan now deploys more destroyers frigates and anti submarine warfare aircraft in the far east than does the u s tokyo pays about 2 4 billion or 40 percent of the annual cost of maintaining the 50 000 american gis based in japan slow in gulf crisis japan however can do more much more this has been made dramatically clear by the current persian gulf crisis though the gulf provides japan with 70 percent of its oil needs compared with only 10 percent of america s oil needs japan has been agonizingly slow to contribute to the joint effort to restore peace and stability to the gulf only after one month into this crisis and after much american pressure did tokyo agree to spend up to 1 billion to extend logistical support to the multinational forces in the gul send 100 japanese medical personnel to the gulf and give emer gency aid to countries like egypt and turkey this should be only the first installment of a contribution that must reflect japan s economic stake in mid dle east peace tokyo should be contributing at least 500 million a month tokyo should realize that its response to the gulf crisis will affect future u s support for its alliance with japan beyond the persian gulf crisis japan can afford to pay more to support american forces in japan purchase more american made weapons and im prove its own defense logistics communications and air defenses reversing defense technology flow japan also can improve its defense relationship with america by allowing u s access to japanese technology with defense applications like advanced semiconductors and fiber optics this will help reverse the largely one way flow of defense technology from america to japan which in part sparked u s congressional criticism last year of a 1988 agreement that allows japan to work with american firms to produce the next generation fighter for japan s air force known as the fighter support experimental fs x in addition as the u s military commitment to oppose iraq grows japan also should be ready to provide financial support for egypt and turkey key allies in containing iraq japan should also consider substantially funding any post conflict peacekeeping forces an effective u s japan defense alliance will continue to be necessary to ensure asian stability from japanese bases american forces are better able to deter asian based soviet forces than from the american bases in south korea japanese bases also will be critical to any u s effort to resupply south korea should it be attacked by north korea most important perhaps the u s japan alliance reassures the rest of asia where animosity toward and fear of japan runs understandably high stem ming from japan s aggression and harsh occupation during the 1930s and 1940s for one thing the alliance directly affects the way that the japanese improve their military capabilities american shield for another the alliance protects japan with the american shield thus giving japan no reason to expand its military might to the extent that would be needed if it were japan s only protection without the alliance with america japan might feel compelled to launch the kind of large scale military build up that would defend japan but would terrify its asian neighbors thus destabilizing asia japanese leaders realize that a rearmed japan is neither in their country s interest nor that of its neighbors furthermore the u s japanese alliance is the basis for american japanese cooperation in other areas such as scientific research finding a set tlement to the cambodian conflict and aiding the philippine economy this alliance for all its good nevertheless is under strain declining u s defense budgets and japan s stubborn denial of access to american business in japan s industrial and service markets undermine support in america for the alliance these strains could be increased by japan s apparent reluctance to support materially u s efforts to oppose iraq if such strains continue they could prompt an agonizing reappraisal of whether america should keep troops in japan as such washington must continue to press tokyo to dis mantle its non tariff barriers to u s businesses and further reduce its 49 bil lion trade surplus with the u s the bush administration plans to reduce the 50 000 u s military person nel in japan by 5 000 to 6 000 over the next three years these reductions are budget driven but it is critical to both countries that u s forces in japan should be sufficient to deter potential soviet aggression in the region and to assist in protection of sea lines of communication from southeast asia to the persian gulf to further strengthen the u s japan alliance the bush ad ministration should stress to japanese leaders and the u s congress that a strong american japanese alliance must be preserved as a critical element of stability in asia press tokyo to increase foreign assistance to egypt and turkey and to pay at least 500 million per month as japan s fair share of the costs of the persian gulf peacekeeping forces urge tokyo to complete the structural reforms that it has promised in the recent structural impediments initiative sh agreement to remove the barriers in the japanese market which contribute significantly to the chronic american trade deficit with japan in western europe where such barriers do not exist america enjoys a trade surplus praise tokyo for improving its defense over the past decade but tell tokyo that further improvements are needed in base defense military com munications and logistic support urge japan to increase long term support payments for american for ces in japan from 40 percent to 75 percent out of a total cost of about 7 5 billion by the end of the decade improve u s japanese military cooperation by increasing the number of bilateral and multinational military exercises involving japan obtain greater access over the next eighteen months to defense re lated japanese technology in computer science missile guidance systems armor piercing shells and laser technology urge japan to

backgrounder updae no 06 july 27 1990 asun threats remain while cold war tensions appear to be easing in europe political and military challenges in asia continue to make the u s japan alliance a strategic necessity for both countries moscow remains the dominant military threat in asia even though soviet leader mikhail gorbachev has promised to reduce soviet forces in asia by 200 000 by 1991 in addition he has withdrawn some soviet naval and air forces from vietnam s cam ranh bay these soviet reductions however appear to exempt the soviet military dis tricts nearest to korea and japan a pentagon strategy report on asia prepared for congress and issued in april notes that in areas near japan soviet capabilities still appear to far exceed those needed for defense i for this reason presumably japanese officials remain skeptical about soviet military cutbacks 3 principal soviet wartime military objectives in northeast asia likely would be to gain control of the sea of japan and the sea of okhotsk to deploy the soviet pacific fleet s 34 ballistic missile submarines the soviets also will seek to prevent control of pacific ocean sea lanes by japanese and u s naval forces beyond about 500 miles from japan and to deny control of the straits of tsushima tsugaru and la perouse to japan 4 powerful soviet forces of the 51 soviet army divisions in asia about 26 divisions with absut 260 000 men are in the far east military district near korea and japan these appear to be exempt from gorbachev s promised reductions soviet air force units near japan are being upgraded with new fourth generation fighter aircraft like the mg 29 fulcnim and su 27 f7 anker these are regarded as similar to america s f 15 eagle and f 16 falcon fighters based in japan about 85 soviet tu 26 backfire bombers are in this region as are increasing numbers of tu 95h bear strategic bombers a recent japanese defense agency study states that by the mid 1990s elimination of obsolete ships may reduce the soviet pacific fleet by 27 per cent this report cautions however that owing to steady soviet fleet modern ization the proportion of nuclear powered submarines in the soviet pacific fleet may rise from 55 percent to 75 percent and missile carrying com batants will increase from 71 percent to 87 percent of fleet strength 6 this fleet now includes two mev class anti submarine aircraft

to sip a peace treaty ending their world war h hostilities primarily because moscow continues to occupy japan s northern territories the islands of etorufu kunashiri shikotan and a smaller group called the habomais tokyo wants these islands returned but the soviets refuse for moscow these islands provide air and naval bases that complete a defensive bastion in the sea of okhotsk which provides safe haven to soviet ballistic missile submarines the soviets heavily have fortified the northern territories and nearby sakhalin island with troops artillery and fighter aircraft this march the soviets held a large military exercise near sakhalin island involv 9 ing 130 aircraft that simulated attacks on aircraft carriers gorbachev s need for japanese trade and investment and japanese leaders desire to assist gorbachevs reforms have prompted a flurry of diplomatic activity including visits by several prominent japanese leaders to moscow and soviet officials to tokyo most recently soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze visited tokyo from september 5 to 7 these visits cre ate the impression that japan and the soviet union desire a solution pre vious soviet statements ho we ver have indicated that moscow is not willing to return territory to japan but on september 7 shevardnadze indicated moscow was willing to negotiate about the future of the islands tokyo will not give any economic aid to moscow until the dispute is settled 12 if gor bachev has a proposal it may not be revealed until he visits japan next year additional challenges even if the soviet threat in asia diminishes the u s japan alliance is essential to enable both countries to meet other poten tial security challenges one possible threat is war on the korean peninsula despite the very slight thaw in relations between north and south korea the unpredictable and volatile north korean government retains one million men under arms and reports persist that pyongyang may acquire nuclear weapons within

alliance provides a forum for japan to help counter aggressors like saddam hussein in the persian gulf who threaten the west s access to oil japan s improved self defense forces despite unique political constraints the japanese self defense forces qsdf have been improved steadily during the 1980s japan s constitution written during the u s occupation after world war il renounces the threat of force as a means of settling international disputes and the acquisition of military strength amounting to war potential this constitution has been in terpreted by most japanese as prohibiting japan from obtaining offensive weapons systems like intercontinental ballistic missiles and aircraft carriers and has ingrained pacifism deeply in japanese society there is strict civilian control of the jsdf for example the highest ranking jsdf officer the chairman of the joint staff council is not a member of japan s national security council the ministry of finance and the foreign ministry often have more power over military procurement decisions than does the jsdf in the 1980s tokyo s evansion of its defense roles came in response to new military minions adopted bytokyo at washington s urging these in clude the 1981 decision by then prime minister zenko suzuld to defend japan s sea lanes out to 1 000 miles this led to the 1986 decision of his suc cessor prime minister yasuhiro nakasone to raise defense spending above what had been a politically sacrosanct level of i percent of gross national product as a result last year japan spent 1 01 percent of gnp on defense or 27 15 billion tokyo s defense expansion can be measured more in quality the quantity of japan s defense forces have not increased much beyond levels mandated in 1976 between 1981 and 1989 japanese defense

improvements the jsdf suffers from insufficient war time supply stocks and logistical support ammunition stockpiles are enough for only a few days of combat and reserve forces number less than 50 000 the japanese navy lacks the support ships to fulfill its mission of defending sea lanes out to 1 000 miles in addition military facilities throughout japan are very vulnerable to attack the jsdf s low pay hampers recruiting as a result the army is about 14 percent below normal strength 21 a lack otlive fire training also raises doubts about the jsdf s wartime effectiveness zz the next five year d gense plan is expected to address deficiencies in the logistic support system nationalist urging in addition to the constitutional constraints on the jsdf japanese leaders often have reaffirmed that japan does not seek to be come a military power rejecting this are nationalists like diet member shin taro isnara who urges japan to build a defense capability independent of the u s though ishihara s views are far from mainstream they prompt con cern by some americans that japan eventually may seek military power com mensurate with its economic power to do so japan would need a large power projection capability and nuclear weapons for the foreseeable future this is very unlikely the desire by some in the japanese navy to build small antisubmarine aircraft carriers like those used by the british navy is viewed as a sign that japan also may want to expand its navy yet building small aircraft carriers would trigger sharp political opposition and building a large aircraft carrier necessary for a world class naval capability would be only slightly less dif ficult politically than building nuclear weapons rather than increasing its defense outlays it is more likely that tokyo will face political pressure to cut back defense spending 2gs the soviet global threat recedes and the u s cats its defense budget the japanese ground self defense force reportedly is planning a

critical link in the network of u s led alliances that preserve stability in asia example its japanese bases enable the u s to reinforce its forces in south korea quickly and provide logistic support for u s naval deployments to southeast asia and the persian gulf u s forces in japan include the 5th air force headquartered at yokota air base which includes two tactical air wings together comprising about 160 aircraft ile 7th fleet is headquartered in yokosuka ile fleet deploys the aircraft carrier midway which is to be replaced by the independence in 1991 about eight escort ships three attack submarines and three am phibious transport ships ile 3rd marine expeditionary force is based in okinawa it includes one division and an air wing the u s army s 9th corps based at camp zama primarily is responsible for logistic support enhanced cooperation in recent years u s and japanese military cooperation has been enhanced by increasing the number of joint studies on defense plans operations and sea lanes defense ensuring that japanese and american military equipment is compatible and improving and expanding military exercises japanese naval forces for example participate in the bian nual rimpac rim of the pacific exercises which include other asian al lies like australia and south korea ile most recent rimpac exercise was this spring tokyo has increased its support for the 50 000 u s military personnel in japan support payments in 1989 amounted to 2 4 billion or about 40 per cent of the cost of maintaining u s troops this is the most generous military support payment the u s receives from any of its allies west germany has paid about the same amount of dollars to support about five times as many u s troops that are based in west germany american officials believe that japan can pay more perhaps as much as 50 percent of total support costs or about 3 billion contributing to japan s defense but by the end of the decade however japan can pay much more as much as 75 percent of the total cost of maintain ing u s troops in japan this contribution to maintaining u s forces in japan recognizes that it would be awkward for japan directly to offset the 27 this view is aw evrewd in lwense ofjapan 1 9 p 85 28 sbwqic framework p 6 costs of the 7th fleet as well as u s troops in korea and the philippines which also contribute to japanese security japan already implicitly recog nizes the contribution of u s forces in the philippines to its security by giving generous foreign aid to the philippines the bush administration should continue to press japan to increase its sup port payments for u s forces pressure to cut the u s budget and pressure from the congress have prompted military cutbacks in asia the pentagon al ready plans to cut 14 000 to 15 000 of the 135 000 military personnel in a2sia 9 by 1993 cutbacks in japan probably will reach 5 000 to 6 000 personnel further unspecified reductions are also planned by the pentagon the initial cutbacks of u s forces in japan will not result in a significant reduction in u s capability in the region but u s defense officials caution that future reductions may result in decreased u s capability unless they are made in conjunction with soviet military reductions in the region is t11is allunce still necessary some in the u s suggest that the american security relationship with japan has benefited japan far more than the u s for example selig har rison a senior associate at the carnegie foundation for international peace and clyde v prestowitz jr president of the economic strategy institute complain that the estimated 40 billion a year the u s spends to maintain defense foros in asia reduces america s ability to compete economically with japan 3u others suggest that a strategic divorce in which japan ends its militarily subordinate relationship to the united states and perhaps achieves military pre eminence in asia is necessary to avoid further ten 31 sion 71bese critics ignore the fact that the u s japan alliance allows japan to im prove its military forces without threatening its neighbors should the soviet threat further recede the united states and japan then become the most powerful coalition in asia political stability in asia will then depend on the military and economic power of this coalition in addition it is far from cer tain that u s military cutbacks in asia will translate directly into savings at home or increased u s economic competitiveness american political in fluence in asia rests largely on its strategic alliance network in which japan plays a central role but if trade friction between japan and the u s increases then american support for the military alliance with japan may decrease to the point where the u s painfully

for 70 percent of japanese oil needs japan has supported the united nations embargo against iraq and has promised to send 100 medical personnel to the persian gulf and has pledged to spend 1 billion for transporting supplies and underwrit ing trucks and housing to american military forces in the gulf yet this sup port is a pittance for a nation of japan s wealth japan s small contribution was called contemptible tokenism on september 10 by senator john mc cain the arizona republican mccain also called for japan to assume half the costs of the persian gulf operation desert shield and said we sincerel want japan to shoulder the international responsibilities of a great state 31 frustrated congress further u s congressional resentment was ex pressed on september 12 when the house of representatives voted 370 to 53 to pass an amendment to the defense department authorization bill call ing on japan to assume the full cost of stationing u s troops in japan 33 fol lowing this criticism tokyo announced that it would contribute an additional 3 billion 2 billion for assistance to frontline states like egypt gpd turkey and 1 billion more to support the multinational military effort this brings to 4 billion japan s pledges to support the states trying to contain iraqi ag gression the japanese have hotly debated whether they can send military forces to support allied troops in the persian gulf after the suggestion by the pen tagon that japan send some military forces to the gulf the government of prime ministgrtoshild kaifu decided that doing so would violate japan s constitution 5 to get around the constitutional restrictions some in japan s ruling liberal democratic party now propose to create a peace cooperation corps to provide medical transportation and communication support to united nations peacekeeping forces but other ldp members like foreign minister shintaro abe oppose this idea as a half way measure and want to send japanese troops to the gulf

forces to the gulf washington should urge japan to make alternative contributions specifically the bush administration should urge japan to offset at least 500 million per month of the cost of deploying american peacekeeping forces in the gult this could be in the form of airlift ing and sealifting u s military personnel and equipment or by paying for the transport of that equipment quickly disburse its pledged economic assistance to egypt and turkey key countries whose economies must be kept stable so they can assist in containing iraq this should then enable the u s to reduce its economic as sistance to those countries use civilian airliners and ships to transport supplies to u s and al lied forces to the gulf this does not exceed japan s constitutional limits on the use of its military forces overseas substantially fund any post conflict peacekeeping forces mandated by the united nations increasing defense technology cooperation just as important tokyo can reverse the nearly one way flow in defense technology since the 1950s this flow has been from america to japan ex ample japan has co produced under license major u s weapon systems like the f 15 eagle jet fighter in the 1989 dispute over the co development of japan s fs x support fighter many members of the u s congress expressed concern that transfer of u s defense technology based on the design of the f 16 falcon fighter could increase japan s industrial competitiveness whether or not these congressional concerns were warranted they exposed the unacceptable one way flow of technology transfer because of congres sional pressure provisions of the fs x agreement allowing greater u s ac cess to japanese technology were strengthened the agreement provides the u s access to japanese technology used to improve the aircraft like com posite material wings and miniaturized phased array radars the final fs x agreement should be the model for u s japan defense technology cooperation while the experience of the fs x dispute has made tokyo reluctant to consider co development projects as large as fs x several japanese defense and government officials suggested to the heritage foundation last month duringtokyo discussions that japan is willing to proceed on much smaller defense co development projects such as com ponents of surface to air missiles slow progress in addition to co development agreements tokyo should meet washington s requests for u s direct access to japanese technology that has defense applications in january 1983 tokyo exempted tran fer of military technology to the u s from japan s ban on weapons exports this led to a november 1983 agreement designed to achieve such transfers progress however has been slow this february for example washington asked for ac cess to japanese developments in large scale integrated semiconductors gal lium arsenide semiconductors fiber optics phased array radars composite materials and biotechnology tokyo has yet to give its okay japan however seems more willing to agree to a u s proposal to conduct joint research on missile en qes magnetic field analysis missile guidance systems and anti tank shells to improve the process of defense technology transfer from japan to the u s the pentagon must make the acquisition of japanese defense related technology a top priority primarily responsible for this is the office of the undersecretary of defense for international security programs it has been vacant since last october the pentagon therefore has not been able to exer cise sufficient leadership on promoting technology flow back from japan 37 for its part tokyo must convince private japanese companies to allow washington access to new technology strategic defense opportunities tokyo s 1986 decision to participate in re search under the u s strategic defense initiative sdi offers an additional opportunity for the u s to increase access to japanese defense related tech nology two industrial consortia involving american and japanese com panies one led by japan s hfitsubishi heavy industries and the other led by the tj s uiv corporation are conducting research on possible missile defen ses 38 u s japan cooperation in sdi eventually should lead to cooperation in establishing missile defenses for the u s such cooperation would be ad vantageous given japan s proximity to soviet ballistic missile submarine operating areas in the sea of japan and the sea of okhotsk missile defense systems in japan would be better able to intercept soviet submarine launched missiles that might be targeted on the u s this july a japanese defense official suggested tothe heritage foundation the possibility of u s japanese co development of a successor to japan s hawk anti aircraft mis siles he suggested that the new missile would be able to intercept north korean ballistic missiles how to improve the allunce the value of u s japan alliance to each partner can be increased by ad dressing specific political economic and military concerns to improve the u s japan alliance the bush administration should stress to the congress the need to preserve the u s japan alliance the administration should emphasize

fairer access to japanese markets japan has promised to raise fines to deter cartels reduce complexity in the japanese distribution system and abolish government restrictions on foreign investment as part of the recently concluded structural impediments initiative sh talks the u s must ensure that tokyo fulfills these promises too oftentokyo makes commitments that it almost immedi ately ignores urge japan to improve the effectiveness of its defense forces the u s should urge japan to build better base defenses better communications networks improve logistic support for naval forces by building more at sea replenishment ships and improve realistic training for japanese forces these improvements should enhance the jsdf s capability to fulfill its mission of defending its sea lanes out to 1 000 miles reduce the number of u s forces in japan only as the soviet threat in northeast asia is reduced washington should maintain in japan the air and naval forces needed to deter soviet attack in particular the u s should deploy at least one aircraft carrier battle group in japan as it gives u s military planners the greatest flexibility in responding to future threats urge tokyo to increase its off the shelf purchases of weapon systems for example systems that tokyo may seek to acquire like awacs and tanker refueling aircraft and additional aegis naval radar systems should be purchased in the u s these purchases are an important way for japan to reduce its trade surplus with the u s increase the realism of u s japan military exercises only recently for example have u s and japanese forces held multi service exercises in volving land naval and air forces and only recently have japanese naval for ces participated in merchant convoy escort exercises these exercises are closer to realistic wartime scenarios and they should be increased conclusion this june 23 marked the 30th anniversary of the 1960 u s japan security treaty thistreaty remains the linchpin of u s strategy in asia thetreaty also has provided the defense shield behind which the japanese economy has prospered enormously this defense relationship could weaken as the soviet union diminishes as a global and regional threat and as suspicion builds in washington that tokyo continues to deny access to its markets if americans perceive that japan s support for u s efforts in the persian gulf is inadequate the partnership could weaken further george bush must tell prime minister toshild kaifu that a strong u s japan defense relationship will require continued japanese economic structural reform and added japanese willingness to contribute to opposing global threats like that now posed by iraq contributing to global stability a strong military alliance can benefit america economically by providing a forum for increased u s access to defense technology most important the u s japan alliance can provide a foram for japan to contribute to global stability should cold war tensions recede but how japan decides to assist the american effort to stop iraq now presents the most serious test of the value of this affiance to both partners richard d fisher jr policy analyst

without congressional approval in response to an emergency latest developments in ukraine dec 9 national security council spokesman john kirby told reporters at the white house friday the equipment

washington previously announced it was sending four avenger short range air defense systems that use stinger missiles made by raytheon technologies corp rtx n and hawk interceptor missiles u s allies have also been sending air defense systems in total the united states has committed 20 billion in security assistance to ukraine since the beginning of the biden administration since 2014 the united states has committed approximately 22 1 billion in security assistance to ukraine and more than 19 3 billion since the beginning of russia s unprovoked and brutal invasion on february 24 to meet ukraine s evolving battlefield requirements the united states will continue to work with its allies and partners to provide ukraine with key capabilities according to a pentagon statement russia s weapons meanwhile russia is expanding and modernizing its nuclear arsenal at a time when russian president vladimir putin has repeatedly suggested he could use nuclear weapons to protect russia u s

states hold about 90 of the world s nuclear warheads enough to destroy the planet many times over putin said friday that russia s near total loss of trust in the west would make an eventual settlement over ukraine much harder to reach although contacts between russian and u s intelligence services were at least continuing at a news conference in the kyrgyz capital bishkek putin lamented the failure to implement the minsk agreements cease fire and constitutional reform deals between kyiv and russian backed separatist forces in eastern ukraine in 2014 and 2015 by russia france and germany at the outset of the war in ukraine we thought we would still be able to agree within the framework of the minsk peace agreements what can you say there is a question of trust putin said and trust of course is almost at zero since suffering a series of military setbacks putin has increasingly pitched his invasion on ukraine as a fight to defend russia against an aggressive collective west russia is working on obtaining more weapons from iran including hundreds of ballistic missiles it is also offering tehran an unprecedented level of military and technical support in return britain s u n

putin accused the west of using ukraine as a tool against his country for many years the west shamelessly exploited and pumped out its resources encouraged genocide and terror in the donbas and effectively turned the country into a colony he said now it s cynically using the ukrainian people as cannon fodder as a ram against russia by continuing to supply ukraine with weapons and ammunition

archived document may contain errors 29 july 17 1978 housing and community development amendments of 1978 so 3084 h r 12433 status the housing and community development amendments of 1978 were reported out of the senate committee on bankingy housing and urban affairs on may 151 1978 the subcommittee on housing and urban affairs which held hearings for 11 days january april 1978 approved the bill following three days of markup testimony was dominated by members of congress representatives of the department of housing and urban development hud and local governmental officials s 3084 is a compilation of three major bills they are s 2637 submitted by senator proxmire d wisconsin on behalf of hud to amend and extend their programs for housing and community development s 2708 s 2709 submitted by senator morgan d north carolina on behalf of the farmers home administration fmha to ameliorate rural housing deficiencies by extending the rural housing act and title iii respectively having passed from committee the bill is now pending on the senate calendar floor action is expected sometime in late july the concurrent house bill h r 12433 was given consid eration on the floor june 26 29 1978 and is expected to start receiving final consideration the week of july 17 except for minor modifications it embodies exactly the same provisions as s 3084 however h r 12433 has been subjected to numerous revisions on the floor amendments the major amendment which passed 244 140 on june 29 grapples with the allegation that hud repeatedly changes the legislative intent of congress by means of regulation for example representative stanton r ohio cites the subversion of the community block grant by regulations which target and thus restrict funds these regulations he charges effectively eliminate the ability of the local governments to deal with their specific needs more importantly these regulations ig nore the original congressional intent and allow bureaucrats at hud to make the laws as they see fit in the words of representative garry brown r michigan we should not be placed in a position where non elected bureaucrats change the meaning of our words as approved by the house this veto amendment requires hud to submit all housing and community development regulations to congress allowing either house 90 days to dis approve them one house veto this amendment may be seen as either retaliatory or defensive by the house that is either the house is striking at the autonomy of hud or their action may be viewed as trying to regain control of hud which by em ployment of extensive regulatory activity managed to elude the legislative intent of congress in either case the passage of this amendment may only be construed as a victory for the house other adopted amendments include the guarantee that requirements for the allocation of community development monies not restrict the access of smaller communities to these funds grassley r iowa watkins d oklahoma the prohibition of directly awarding technical assistance grants by hud to community organizations the intent here is to return control to the ranks of local government by this amendment grants may be received by community organizations only if they have passed through the local government brown r michigan delaying for one year federal housing assistance to un insured states and low income housing programs ashley d ohio earmarkinq 12 million of section 202 elderly housing funds to develop security measures for elderly public housing inadequate security measures have frequently

demonstration to determine how to get more owners to participate in the rental subsidy program panetta d california raising the mortgage ceilings for the section 227 d 3 program mortgage insurance to finance rental or cooperative multifamily houses built by public non profit sponsors for low and noderate income households the amendment would increase the amount of a mortgage which hud could insure to between 18 450 and 41 494 depending upon the number of units these new ceilings would be in line with the current mortgage ceilings for the profit motivated builder in section 221 m 4 housing background the first federal efforts at public housing date back to the depression however there was no meaningful legislation until the housing act of 1949 which embraced the goal of a decent home and suitable living environment for every american family l further the act mandated the elimination of sub standard housing by slu m clearance demolition as well as the stimulation of housing production and community development to alleviate the housing shortage the construction following this legislation remained at a relatively low level through the 1950 s and early 19601s from 1949 1963 cumulative completed projects reached only 118 at which time planning begun numbered almost 12 times as much 2 briefly the federal government operated in this era as a planner not a doer by 1965 hud having entered the scene cranked up the federal home building machinery hud s share of total u s market starts rose from 15 4 percent in 1965 and peaked at fully 36i7 percent in 1970 since that time and the federal housing moratorium of january 1973 the gov ernment has fallen back to about 10 percent of total market starts unfortunately accompanying this construction record are the demolitions 1 pl 81 338 sec 2 2 john c weicher urban renewal national program for local problems washington d c american enterprise institute for public policy re search 1972 p 2 3 hud share of total market starts unpublished statistics estimate of housing demolition in the u s under governmental programs through 1967 program urban renewal 404 000 highway 330 000 public housing 320 000 sites 177 000 equivalent demolitions 143 000 local code enforcement n a total 1 054 000 these depressing statistics coupled with the outbreaks of violence in the nation s urban areas led to the replacement of urban renewal by federal programs of rehabilitation in spite of this removal from the inventory in the 1960 s was projected at a higher rate than in the 1950 s 5 9 million units compared with 4 5 million 4 these programs generally tended to be project oriented without taking into consideration outside f orces that m y affect eb thousifig that is built or renovated the section 236 program rent subsidy for example had a strong project focus and tended to be applied in a similar fashion in both slums and stable neighborhoods and in urban and rural neighborhoods 5 in the early 1970 s these programatic rejoinders of the federal government to the gation s urban crisis gave way to a plethora of new flexible programs known as neighborhood preservation the flexibility they provide is im portant anthony downs a senior fellow at the brookings in stitution writes urban conditions in american cities appear in an immense diversity of forms and combinations so it is important for national urban policy to allow diversified responses to those conditions largely determined at the local level hence each city and in some cases each neighborhood should choose its own strategy for coping with its problems further the programs of the 1970 s differ from those of the 1950 s and 1960 s in that the early programs often assumed that a one time infusion of aid would be sufficient to stabilize a neighborhood and spur further public and private redevelopment this belief proved unfounded as the 235 home ownership program demonstrated provisions of the bill s 3084 is a compilation of several bills as mentioned above but includes other major legislation as well in all there are seven titles in the housing and community development amendments of 1978 which cover rural housing programs housing goals building codes for rehabilitated housing congregate public housing services housing rehabilitation urban home steading and the problems of financially troubled hud multi family projects in summary the function of each of the titles is title i community and neighorhood development and conservation would authorize an expansion of the section 312 rehabilitation loan and urban homesteading pro g r_ams an d a ftf6 nd the community development program section 312 has been in effect since 1964 providing loans for neighborhoods with concentrated community development efforts eligibility is based on 80 percent of an area s median in come and the bill proposes a sliding scale on interest rates as determined by need at present there is no income eligibility provision and all loans bear a statutorialy set interest rate of 3 percent one drawback to the median income formula is that for example a person earning 14 000 in montgomery county maryland is eligible for aid title ii housing assistance program would authorize funding for the housing assistance programs including programs of assistance to benefit the handicapped to improve security in publicly assisted projects and new guidelines for managing federally assisted projects this title is an extension of the u s housing act of 1937 and provides contract outlays for approximately 100 000 units of housing above the administration s requested level of 400 000 units for the low income families under the section 8 assistance payments and conventional public housing programs this title also attempts to minimize eviction and demolition of hud owned multifamily housing projects title iii program extensions would extend the basic mort gage insurance authority of the federal housing administration fha and other housing related programs simply section 302 of the bill extends the authority of the secretary of hud to administratively set interest rates for fha insured mortgage loans to meet the market at rates above the statutory maximum title iv congregate services would create a new program to provide certain services for frail elderly persons who re side in pubicly assisted housing title iv would establish a new program of funding for congregate public housing services within the department of housing and urban development as a step toward full implementation of the congregate housing provisions of the 1970 housing act the intent of this title is the prevention of unnecessary institutionalization of functionally impaired persons and allow elderly people to remain in the community enjoying the independence autonomy privacy and relationships that consti tute the very essence of a meaningful life formerly congregate services covered only low income housing in which some or all units lack kitchens and in which central dining facilities exist for the preparation of meals in 1970 congress appended to this congregate services for nonelderly handicapped and frail elderly persons in order to provide more comprehensive services s 3084 moves to expand the definition of congregate housing to include homemaker services assistance with personal care and grooming nutritionally balanced meal services and other nonmedical services provided in a residential setting title v rural housing extends and authorizes funding for rural housing programs and initiates a new program to assist very low income rural families to purchase and maintain their homes little attention is given to rural housing problems yet in fact rural areas experience severe housing deficiencies three fifths of all substandard housing in the nation 6 3 of the 10 6 million units is located in rural areas generally on farms or in places of less that 2 500 persons more per tinent is the fact that 36 percent of all rural housing was classified as substandard compared to 10 percent of all urban housing this title provides loans for very low income housing repairs and grants for governmental or nonprofit sponsors of housing projects for migrant and other domestic farm workers as well as a new deep subsidy homeownership program for persons of very low income who could not afford existing housing assistance programs title vi neighborhood reinvestment corporation act would incorporate in the housing and community development amendments of 1978 the neighborhood reinvestment corporation act passed last year by the senate this action serves merely to formalize and expand the ex perimental programs currently conducted by the urban reinvest ment task force under the auspices of the federal home loan bank board hud and other federal financial regulatory agencies title vii miscellaneous would amend various housing acts in order to provide for among other matters increased exemptions under the interstate land sales disclosure act increased participation by mortgage bankers in the programs conducted by the federal home loan mortgage corporation and a prohibition of expenditures by the department of housing and urban develop ment for the purpose of implementing the department s proposed reorganization o f multifamily and community planning and devel opment functions the rationale for this proposal is easy to understand since 1969 hud has had 20 reorganizations the funding for these reorganizations has been provided through funds meant for programming generally this title increases the ceiling on loans from 25 000 to 37 000 for multifamily improvements and increases the average per unit loan from 5 000 to 7 500 additionally the repayment period would be extended from 12 years and 32 days to 15 years and 32 days an interesting provision is section 706 which would extend the existing authorization of a day care center for the children of hud employees to include the establishment of hud day care centers in field offices as well as the participation by hud in the establishment of interagency day care facilities cost estimate the estimated budget impact of this bill by title is summarized in the following table cost by bill title by fiscal year in millions of dollars please see pdf for tables a includes an estimated 27 800 000 000 for annual contributions to assisted housing based on annual contract authority authorized b includes estimated authorization levels for rural housing loans and the home ownership assistance program authorized in title v this bill authorizes annual appropriations of 913 million above the amount requested by the administration for fiscal year 1979 an increase of 33 percent moreover as the housing assistance payments continue for as long as 40 years the total budget impact is far greater senate subcommittee members proxmire d wisconsin mcintyre d new hampshire morgan d north carolina and garn r utah claiming fiscal irresponsibility estimate that the bill provides for budget authority that is at least 11 5 billion in excess of the first budget resolution several of these are sizable increases over the administration request theselinclude 75 million for a new rent supplement program for tenants in financially distressed housing projects 480 million for annual assistance payments under the section 8 and public housing programs on top of the 1 195 billion requested by the administration the increase in total budget authority would exceed 11 billion 125 million more for the section 312 rehabilitation loan program on top of the 245 million requested by the administration the administration request was a fourfold increase over the 1978 level 71 million for operating assistance payments to pub lic housing projects on top of the 729 million re quested by the administration 51 million in increased payments under the urban homestead programs 20 million to establish a new congregate housing program in addition to these funding increases are the unrecorded carryover funds and the fluctuating contract authority programs that is money which was not spent last year is held on to and so adds to the next year potential expenditures the changing concept of housing needs since 1949 the united states has assumed a larger role in helping the poor however a concept of housing need is a social not a market criterion dependent not upon market forces but the whims of public policy the result of the change in policy is that minimum housing standards in the u s have changed drastically no longer accepting the 1949 standard s of one room per person and adequate plumbing hot water toilet and bath or shower federal law now demands in addition to this a satis factory level of housing maintenance services from the landlord and that only a modest proportion of income be spent on rent regardless of how low income may be a decent neighborhood now includes regular and satisfactory sanitation services ade quate police fire and health services schools libraries public transportation and recreational facilities the racial crisis of the 1960 s precipitated the elimination of barriers to the freedom of movement of black families into any section of the community thus if gains seem small to some it is in part because a good deal more is demanded now from federal urban programs this demand was reflected in a recent hud bulletinlo which announced that housing per se should no longer be empha sized instead federal progfamsshould encompass all problems external but contributory to the housing situation pollution mismatch of jobs and skills poor schools crime loss of jobs poverty fiscally strained budgets flight of people and in dustry eroding tax bases obsolete physical structures limited housing choices racism and discrimination and a spate of others all of which aim at the revitalization of the nation s urban areas in a recent speech 11 the president affirmed and expanded on this stating that there must be an extension and improvement of existing programs which involve all levels of government the president stressed the need for flexibility and the ability of the local government to respond to all of its problems that is in fighting the nation s urban problems the federal govern ment should not have to pay an ever increasing proportion of local expenditures as it has been doing over the past 16 years 12 to some however there is no limit to this conunitment repre sentative john conyers jr d michigan for example states the one explanation for the glaring failure of all the federal housing programs which has perpetually eluded policy makers is that when they try to solve the nation s housing ills in isolation without attacking all the other problems that stem from social inequality such attempts are doomed from the start nothing short of a full employment program one assuring each worker the right to a job at livable wages will solve the riddle of housing because of legislators like conyers and our inexorably expanding commitment to the poor the question for many sup porters of housing is no longer one of whether there should be a housing program but rather how extensive it is going to be arguments in favor while not providing for full employment s 3084 does greatly expand upon housing services for the handicapped the frail elderly and the poor both urban and rural in addition it would provide the funds to upgrade the housing stock of those persons unable to provide for themselves a decent living en vironment supporters of s 3084 believe it represents a major effort to refine and strengthen the nation s housing and com munity development programs this effort has as its goal the rejuvenation of our cities both large and small and the assurance that every american family will be able to have decent and affordable shelter 14 further they suggest that this leg islation builds on several themes the first is the commitment to the restoration and preservation of the existing housing stock a second primary theme that runs through this bill is the continued recognition of the needs of our elderly and handicapped citizens a third significant theme found throughout this bill is a concern for improving the management program operations of the hud and the fmha particularly in the programs designed to address the housing needs of the low income persons supporters contend that the greatest social service derived from s 3084 is the new congregate housing service title iv which provides a minimum 50 million of section 202 lending authority to meet the specific needs of the handicapped a total of 80 million is authorized over the next three years nationwide it is estimated that approximately 3 5 million e lderly suffer some degree of mobility limitation and about 2 4 million could be helped in a residential congregate setting with services studies of nursing home populations indicate that one third to one half of the residents would be able to function in less intensive care settings if they existed 16 thus they argue that the need for this program is significant supporters also emphasize the value of the rural housing ammendments which will authorize the fmha to pay the difference between 25 percent of the family s adjusted income and all homeownership costs including mortgage payments property taxes insurance utilities and maintenance the need for home ownership assistance is especially acute in the rural areas for two reasons the first is that there is little incentive for the private sector to construct rental units in rural areas where it is difficult to aggregate enough units to make investment profitable second inflation has been especially hard on single family homeownership opportunities for low and moderate income persons the level of income which is served by the fmha 502 homeownership program has been moving steadily upward resulting in no services for the fam ilies below this level as for social need empirical data detail a precipitous decline in the amount of substandard housing and consequently there has been a decline in the need for federal intervention in the housing market substandard housing has declined from 20 5 million units in 1950 to 15 4 units in 1960 to 10 8 million in 1970 to a projected 7 7 million units in 1980 if all government assistance programs were discontinued for this entire decade the difference in the number of substandard units would be only 1 9 million units or about the number of housing starts in the private market each year thus while substandard housing still remains it is significantly less than twenty years ago in part due to the demolitions of urban renewal arguments against the most prominent objection to s 3084 is the exorbitant costs of both the extentions of existing programs and the fiscal liberalism of the new ventures as cited above s 3084 in creases total budget authority by at least 11 5 billion and authorizes appropriations 33 percent 13 million in excess of administration requests for fiscal year 1979 more broadly some critics charge that federal programs do not serve the poor first they point out that federal programs according to the most recently available evidence reach rela tively small numbers of people and only a small proportion of families even at low income levels figure 1 the percentage of nonfarm renter families occupying federally assisted rental housing percent of united states fiscal 1968 estimate families in assisted public housing housing 20 rent supplement u9221 d 3 bmir to view figure please see pdf the conclusion here is that only a small fraction of even the most needy are served by federal housing programs a major fac tor in this shortcoming is the cost of supporting the bureau cratic inefficiency a study of federal housing programs in boston estimated the diversion of funds to intermediaries from federal programs for most of the programs an estimated one fourth to one half does not reach the residents but goes for federal and local administrative expenses and for tax benefits to investors 17 that is the federal government collects money takes its cut and finally redistributes the remainder this sort of behavior leads one to wonder about the admin istrative efficiency of the department of housing and urban development unpublished data reveal that while total hud ex penditures have been erratic hud administrative costs have been increasing at an almost perfectly linear rate for ex ample in 1969 when total hud expenditures fell to 36 percent of the previous year s total administrative costs rose 11 percent the same holds true for 1977 although not as dramatically administrative costs have risen on the average 1966 1979 est 9 6 percent annually rising as much as 18 percent as in 1969 the only year that these costs declined was 1974 and then only by less than 1 percent second the federal government since early 1977 has not followed its usual fiscal scenario instead of the rise in expenditures tapering off and starting to decline as the united states enters the fourth year of economic recovery and prosperity expenditures are being increased to new record peacetime levels both in absolute amount and as a percentage of national income the result is that the deficit is not decreasing in this third year of recovery it has been increased from 45 billion in the second year of recovery to 60 billion and it is being continued at that level in the coming fiscal year this has an impact upon housing because the massive government borrowing coupled with rising business demand for capital will be di verting the funds that would otherwise go into residential con struction in short the government is absorbing much of the available capital in the economy 18 the third failure of federal policy critics charge seems to be a symptom of the first and second the federal government enters the cost of housing and credit markets 19 some important construction costs such as energy are beyond the scope of housing and related economic policies but several other im portant factors interest rates material prices and land costs are very much subject to government influence which has re cently had the effect of making cost increases more severe rather than less title iii not suprisingly allows the sec retary of hud to set the interest rate at an arbitrary level a significant proportion of s 3084 title i is dedicated to the urban poor unfortunately rehabilitation does not bene fit the poor as it tends to increase the unit value raise rents and increase property taxes as a result it forces the poor to move to a lower rent district that they can afford as a rule rehabilitation benefits primarily the middle class the freedom for communities to seek their own solutions is not being achieved to the same extent as under the nixon ford and block grant approaches the need for local control in this matter is absolutely crucial unfortunately the pro posals of the new partnership once again insist upon a narrow categorical approach removing the policy choice from the com munity the federal government is again trying to create a scheme whereby all housing ills may be cured this type of programming has generally proved to be less well coordinated less succes sful and more expensive this is the general effect of title i which stresses rehabilitation and urban homesteading while deemphasizing block grants the opponents also argue that the spectre of substandard housing in the u s has greatly declined over the past 28 years and that the tremendous reduction from 20 million to 12 million units of substandard housing over the years 1950 1966 occurred at a time when all federal construction totaled only 50 000 units a year since the era of massive federal involvement in the housing industry the decrease in the number of sub standard units has progressed at a much slower rate finally they contend that s 3084 fails to provide local governmentsthe autonomy they need to solve individualistic pro blems that experience shows a national housing program cannot solve and that rather than expanding the block grant program s 3084 proposes to target funds for specific programs eric meltzer research assistant

market rally was hitting new highs with the s p 500 above its 200 day line for the first time in months but as investors re evaluated the jobs report and fed chief powell s comments the major indexes retreated the s p 500 fell below its 200 day line while the nasdaq tested its 50 day both hit resistance at the 21 day line late in the week the russell 2000 tumbled below its 200 day and 21 day lines and came right down to its 50 day just undercutting its 10 week line the rally leading dow is holding support around its 21 day the s p 500 is basically where it was after nov 10 when a tame october cpi inflation report buoyed stocks the nasdaq and russell 2000 are back to those early november levels but also late october peaks if you had to design a scenario to lure investors in to get roughed up repeatedly this current uptrend might be the blueprint a market rally of a few big one day gains followed by pullbacks over several sessions it s still a confirmed market rally however further losses such as the nasdaq or especially the s p 500 clearly breaking their 50 day lines would be worrisome tuesday s november cpi inflation report and wednesday s fed meeting announcement and powell s comments could provide a catalyst for a sustained market rally or a decisive sell off but they also could spur yet another big market pop that seems decisive only to be followed by yet another pullback time the market with ibd s etf market strategy what to do now investors should be wary of adding exposure until the cpi inflation report and fed meeting are in the rearview mirror even if markets jump on the inflation data and fed chief powell s comments investors should be selective about new buys in case the major indexes simply fall back over the next several sessions at some point a sustained steady market rally will take hold when that happens buying opportunities will be plentiful so get your stock market holiday shopping list ready a large number of stocks from a variety of

should you include graffiti on your layout when we set out to build our model worlds one of the questions we end up answering is how realistic we want to be this answer is defined by what we decide to include and what we chose to ignore most of these choices will create little controversy but there s one that s sure to get people to choose sides graffiti it s nothing new archeological digs at pompeii the famous roman city covered in ash by mount vesuvius in the year 79 uncovered graffiti not unlike what we see today other than being written in latin while that s certainly interesting our focus here is on railroad models so it s the graffiti we see on railcars we ll pay attention to one way to avoid the discussion is to model an era before the 1980s when graffiti on railcars was still most often chalk marks made by yard workers but by the end of the 80s graffiti was starting to proliferate modern modelers therefore have a choice to make include it or ignore it there are very strong feelings against it graffiti is vandalism and therefore illegal just as some folks don t wish to depict other criminal activity on their layouts they may decide not to include graffiti that s certainly legitimate these are our worlds and we get to decide what they should look like where we can run into a problem is if we claim to strive for realism by depicting the world around us accurately if we say this and model an era where graffiti is commonplace but it isn t to be found on our layouts then we miss our own stated goal so let s look at the pros and cons of whether you should include graffiti on your layout many well known modelers have included graffiti on modern era layouts i don t really overthink it if something is there i model it in some locations in miami the quality of the tags approaches that of mural artists often a gray cinder block wall looks better after being tagged however it is still vandalism unless you get permission says frequent mr contributor lance mindheim making choices some don t model the graffiti era but aren t opposed to it i don t model an era affected by much graffiti but if i did i d include it like any other detail such as rust broken boards weathered rolling stock peeling paint etc said mr contributing editor tony koester i can t decide that all structures in the 1950s were painted yesterday that all locomotives and rolling stock were shopped earlier this week i am not at liberty to edit out imperfections that said were i modeling a major city scene i would not go out of my way to depict someone being mugged or worse no sense looking for trouble but in recent years ignoring graffiti would involve a major editing effort and the resulting scene simply would not reflect reality tony said another of our contributing editors pelle søeborg sees it as a necessary evil personally i don t like graffiti i simply don t see the point in vandalizing other people s property but if you model present time as i do you can t ignore it it may sound contradictory that i hate graffiti but still model it but modeling is about making believable scenes i also don t like filthy locomotives i like nice clean locomotives better but i still weather my locomotives because that is how they look in the real world i model what i see raw and unfiltered and it is not always pretty cody grivno has ideas on how to add graffiti to your models here the realism problem another modeler who falls into the graffiti era is dave abeles graffiti is part of the scene on modern freight cars as well as areas along the tracks and right of way coincidentally my 1994 era predated much of the extensive graffiti we see today on equipment but i do roster some cars with it graffiti is a detail element like chalk drawings or trackside litter and as such it s important to include to some degree based the prototype but there s also model railroading rule 1 it s my railroad and i ll do what i want i m sort of on the fence on this graffiti thing says gerry leone however if you re a modeler who s modeling a could have been railroad or a should have been could be branchline or a prototype based railroad in which you ve eliminated or rearranged the prototype towns you re already tinkering with reality and creating your own world so if you ve taken the opportunity to say the union pacific s elk river branch is now a reality in my basement you can also say and freight car graffiti never came about in this world they re both equally as valid in my book and let s face it who among modelers is fully faithfully reproducing reality when they ve got two giant 2 56 machine screws holding the trucks on to their freight cars lou and cheryl sassi offer similar thoughts on whether you should include graffiti on your layout if you want to model an era which includes graffiti realistically you would most likely try to include some of it if you want to make your model railroad what you want and do not like drawings all over your cars then you leave it off remember the old adage it s your layout and you can do what you like modeling graffiti can be tricky some of it takes talent to create and if you want to replicate a particular car you ll have to develop similar talents if you don t already have them matt snell offered suggestions in a model railroader article in the april 2012 issue matt snell photo a polarizing topic matt snell reminds us about how touchy the subject can be the first thing of note is what a polarizing topic this can be i ve heard many near arguments about the plus minus of this subject with that said i model the modern era and if you are modeling any large urban area it is present and almost normal in varying degrees even the smaller and more rural areas have it and often always have such as the names painted on the side of a bridge or water tower then there s the trains themselves and as it stands right now what used to be limited to lower thirds of the solid side cars has now expanded to entire sides and even locomotives too where do they get the time and the paint railroad graffiti has a long history my next thought goes to the degree and what it represents or can i am told a large part of what we see is gang related i m not a criminologist by any means but what i see out there is a mixture of scribbles right up to pieces of art what i am sure of is that some taggers have become sophisticated enough to leave the required data intact so their work is not painted over by a railroad carman should you include graffiti on your layout when i m trackside watching the graffiti is

are projected at 190 billion down 3 5 billion from the august forecast this decrease is primarily driven by reductions in soybeans cotton and corn exports that are partially offset by gains in beef poultry and wheat soybean exports are forecast down 2 4 billion to 32 8 billion due to smaller production and increased competition from south america cotton exports are forecast down 1 billion to 6 billion based on lower unit values and subdued demand grain and feed exports are projected to decrease by 300 million to 46 2 billion with declines in corn sorghum and rice exports partially offset by higher exports of wheat and feeds and fodders the forecast for corn is down 600 million to 18 5 billion on lower volumes livestock poultry and dairy exports are forecast to increase by 300 million to 41 4 billion as increases in beef poultry and variety meat exports more than offset declines in pork and the value of dairy exports beef exports are up 500 million to 10 3 billion driven by higher prices ethanol exports are unchanged at 4 2 billion from the august forecast and remain a record if realized horticultural product exports are unchanged at 39 5 billion agricultural exports to china are forecast at 34 billion down 2 billion from the august projection due to lower export prospects for soybeans cotton sorghum and pork china is expected to remain the largest market for u s agricultural exports u s agricultural imports in fy 2023 are forecast at 199 billion up 2 billion from the august forecast largely driven by higher imports of horticultural products sugar and tropical products and grain and feed products a strong dollar while a headwind to the export forecast is partially responsible for the higher import demand 2023 outlook fy 2023 u s grain and feed exports are forecast at 46 2 billion down 300 million from the august forecast as lower corn sorghum and rice more than offset modestly higher wheat and feeds and fodders corn exports are forecast at 18 5 billion down 600 million from the august forecast on lower volumes despite higher unit values with remaining uncertainty on the continuation of the black sea grain initiative despite its recent extension and reduced exportable supplies in the united states u s corn prices are expected to remain high relative to other exporters low water levels in the mississippi river have disrupted grain deliveries to the gulf further hampering shipments and supporting prices sorghum exports are forecast at 1 6 billion down 400 million from the august forecast on lower volumes due to sharply reduced production early season outstanding sales of both corn and sorghum are far below last year feeds and fodders exports are forecast at 10 6 billion up 100 million from the august forecast wheat exports are forecast at 8 1 billion up 300 million from the previous forecast on higher unit values more than offsetting smaller export volumes u s wheat export prices continue at multi year highs making exports uncompetitive relative to other major exporters rice exports are forecast down 200 million to 2 billion on weaker sales to top markets in the western hemisphere due to high prices compared with south american exporters unit values are forecast higher due to a smaller crop fy 2023 u s oilseeds and products exports are forecast at 44 3 billion down 2 3 billion from the august forecast and down 1 4 billion from the fy 2022 record values are down almost entirely on a 2 4 billion reduction in soybeans soybean volumes are down due to smaller production offsetting higher carry in record u s crush and increased competition from south america soybean meal is left unchanged at 5 7 billion as lower volumes are offset by higher unit values soybean oil values are reduced 100 million to 900 million on lower volumes however unit values remain near record highs high u s premiums compared with south america will continue to limit shipments fy 2023 u s cotton exports are forecast down 1 billion from the august forecast to 6 billion on lower unit values cotton prices have fallen significantly and reflect concerns regarding lower global consumption consumers post pandemic rebalancing from goods to services purchases coupled with prospects for lower global economic growth is pressuring demand for cotton apparel and home textiles fy 2023 livestock poultry and dairy exports are forecast 300 million higher to 41 4 billion as gains in beef variety meats and poultry offset a decline in pork and dairy beef is up 500 million to 10 3 billion driven by higher unit values as domestic beef production is expected to fall poultry and products are up 300 million to 7 2 billion on slightly higher broiler and turkey meat volumes as global demand remains firm bolstering prices beef and pork variety meats are raised 100 million to 2 2 billion on greater volumes of pork variety meats and higher prices for beef variety meats the forecast for hides and skins is unchanged at 1 1 billion pork exports are forecast 300 million lower to 6 2 billion on tighter exportable supplies and weaker global demand particularly from china dairy is forecast down 100 million to 8 9 billion on lower volumes of skim milk powder cheese and several other products fy 2023 u s horticultural products are unchanged from the august forecast at 39 5 billion whole and processed tree nuts are unchanged at 9 5 billion with most shipments destined for europe and asia processed fruits and vegetables are unchanged at 7 3 billion on steady shipments to canada fresh fruits and vegetables are unchanged at 7 1 billion on stable shipments to top markets in canada and mexico fy 2023 u s ethanol exports are forecast at a record 4 2 billion unchanged from the august forecast and slightly higher than fy 2022 ethanol export unit value is expected to remain near a historic high level supported by persistently elevated corn and gasoline prices despite high export value a strong u s dollar and the threat of recession in many markets u s ethanol export volume may climb modestly higher canada remains the top market by a wide margin with continued good prospects for fuel grade ethanol holding near one third of total u s ethanol export volume also a record last year industrial grade ethanol shipments to south korea the united states second largest market could climb further sharply higher gasoline prices have created strong demand for relatively inexpensive u s ethanol in europe despite high duties at the border competitive pricing keeps u s industrial grade ethanol sales strong to other top markets most importantly mexico and india u s sales recovery to brazil appears constrained given the international energy agency s expectation for reduced brazil gasoline ethanol use in 2023 and brazil s real remains weak against the dollar import products agricultural imports in fy 2023 are forecast at 199 0 billion 5 billion more than the 194 billion recorded for fy 2022 and 2 billion above the august forecast other than the livestock dairy and poultry product group the forecast for all other major product groups is increased for fy 2023 from the previous forecast the strong u s dollar makes foreign agricultural goods comparatively affordable for the u s domestic market and partially accounts for moderate upward pressure on import volumes however the upward pressures on u s imports are expected to be tempered by a slowing economy coupled with continuing inflation which would slow domestic demand for consumer goods as well as agricultural products though agricultural products would be less impacted by these ebbing factors as consumers prioritize consumption of food and other necessities over more non essential goods some impact on agricultural import demand is still likely these competing economic forces help frame much of what is driving the modest forecast for fy 2023 total u s agricultural imports which if realized would represent a 3 increase over the previous year s recorded imports though a stark difference from the year over year import growth in fys 2021 and 2022 measured at 14 and 19 respectively the fy 2023 forecast would be a return to the patterns seen in the eight years from 2013 to 2020 when annual agricultural import growth rates ranged between 0 and 7 the largest component of growth for fy 2023 is expected to be horticultural products the forecast for horticultural product imports is adjusted upward by 1 billion over the august forecast to 100 3 billion a new record over the fy 2022 total of 97 2 billion the largest change within the horticultural products group from the previous forecast is a 300 million increase for fresh fruit imports due in part to ongoing droughts in key fruit producing areas of the united states high production costs and an ongoing decline in citrus production in contrast favorable production is expected in major exporting countries in south and central america the fresh vegetable import forecast is increased 200 million due to the same market factorsaffecting fresh fruit imports imports of processed vegetables in fy 2023 are expected to be 100 million greater than the previous forecast due to the continued unit value increases and strong purchasing power of the u s dollar discussed previously similarly forecasts for distilledspirits imports are raised 200 million and malt beer and wine import forecasts are each raised 100 million from previous forecasts due to the continued rise of unit values fruit juices nuts essential oils and cut flower and nursery stock are unchanged u s imports of sugar and tropical products are forecast to reach 30 7 billion in fy 2023 a 500 million upward adjustment from the previous forecast and 1 6 billion above fy 2022 sweeteners and product imports are expected to be valued at 7 2 billion 100 million above the last forecast imports of coffee and products are increased by 200 million as both values and volumes increase for those commodities due to strong exports from major south american exporters cocoa and products are also expected to increase 100 million on stronger imports from the ivory coast and south america fiscal year 2023 livestock poultry and dairy imports are forecast down 100 million to 26 2 billion as declines in pork and live swine are not offset by gains in beef and poultry pork imports are forecast 100 million lower at 2 6 billion primarily on volume reductions as tighter canada and eu supplies constrain trade live swine imports are 100 million lower due to a reduction in volumes and prices as a slower expected expansion of the u s pork sector weakens demand for canadian piglets beef is up 200 million to 8 7 billion on higher volumes from an anticipated fall in domestically produced processing beef poultry and products are forecast 100 million higher to 1 4 billion as u s outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai have negatively impacted domestic turkey meat production spurring imports dairy imports are unchanged the forecast for grains and feed product imports is increased 400 million from the previous forecast as reduced yields rising production costs and tight inventories keep pressure on prices across coarse grains and feed products globally rice wheat and processed grain products face similar challenges also leading to increased import values the forecast for total oilseeds and oilseed product imports are adjusted upward by 200 million alongside expected increases in unit values due to moderate decreases in domestic soybean production in addition to strong imports of canola from canada the forecast for other imports which contain cotton tobacco planting seeds and ethanol is unchanged from the previous forecast return to top of page

headquarters series the presiding bishopric spoke to the church news from the bishops storehouse at welfare square providing a glimpse into the church s vast welfare and humanitarian efforts around the world more than food the sights and smells of the bishops storehouse remind bishop caussé of his career working with supermarket chains and food distribution companies i m in many ways doing the same things bishop caussé said of his role as presiding bishop of the church i m still managing distribution systems but it s all different at the same time it s still very demanding challenging in many ways but it is easier because the lord helps it strengthens my testimony that this is the lord s work the bishops storehouse at welfare square is one of 124 bishops storehouses in operation worldwide at bishops storehouses individuals in need work with their local leaders to receive food and other items free of charge the church operates 32 farms ranches orchards and processing

church s welfare and humanitarian efforts in 2021 as stated in its annual report the church spent 906 million to help those in need through fast offering assistance which provides temporary financial

relief in communities across the world donated commodities including church produced goods provided to communities through food banks and other agencies donated clothing including discounted or free apparel given to deseret industries church operations including family services counseling employment centers farms and food processing facilities and deseret industries stores none of this would happen without the generosity of the members who donate of their money resources and time bishop caussé said it humbles me to see their examples and this is happening all around the world helping others and reaching out to those in need is at the heart of the gospel of jesus christ he said we wouldn t be the church of jesus christ if we did not follow or strive to follow his example every day one of the things that he showed us to do is love our neighbor as ourselves he taught us about the two great commandments to love god and love our neighbor these are our brothers and sisters all around the world bishop waddell said from emergency response to food security to vision care we are there the savior did what he did to bless lives and to set an example for us he tells us do the things you ve seen me do and so as a church we re doing what we can to follow his example the church strives to bless lives and serve as an example for all of us to reach out and care for those in need the difference between welfare and humanitarian aid bishop caussé explained that the church s welfare services are generally intended to bless latter day saints in need while humanitarian aid is typically for all of god s children welfare includes fast offerings self reliance services and food production and distribution humanitarian aid includes disaster relief and initiatives for food security and clean water church welfare is designed to be short term assistance that builds long term self reliance bishop waddell said sometimes when people think welfare in society they think handout the church s view of welfare is very different it s not the hand out it s the hand up it s trying to lift by lifting people by giving them an opportunity to rise up and overcome the challenges of life and to gain self confidence and self respect it s a remarkable thing to see church welfare humanitarian 4 bishop w christopher waddell first counselor in the presiding bishopric visits with

separately bishop budge said there isn t a clear line dividing them for example some of the humanitarian work the church does helps members living within the areas where aid is provided fueled in part by humanitarian donations the welfare system and the humanitarian system bless everyone he said church members have the opportunity to fast for a 24 hour period each month and donate a generous fast offering which is the value of the meals missed or more the lord trusts bishops to administer these resources to bless people in need in their ward boundaries surplus is sent to the stake and then to the church to be used for needs wherever they exist the law of the fast bishop caussé said is really the core of every welfare system in the church this is something that is unifying members of the church throughout the world building self reliance a year after typhoon haiyan one of the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded devastated the philippines in 2013 bishop caussé visited the city of tacloban the church had provided materials after the storm to help filipinos rebuild their homes while rebuilding many learned skills such as carpentry plumbing and construction management a newly called counselor in the presiding bishopric at the time bishop caussé visited a vocational school in tacloban and saw firsthand the impact of the church s aid we had hundreds literally hundreds

think of everything that happened in the past few years and how the welfare system of the church and the principles of welfare have helped people get ready for a temple to be built bishop caussé said each humanitarian project the church is involved in has a goal of self reliance he said for us self reliance is a principle of salvation it s a spiritual principle every time we ask the question how are we helping people help themselves expansion of the church s humanitarian efforts in september the church made two multimillion dollar donations to humanitarian organizations to help care for those in need the 32 million donation to the united nations world food programme marked the church s largest one time contribution to a humanitarian organization to date the donation presented by bishop

their faith bishop gérald caussé since bishop caussé was first called to the presiding bishopric 10 years ago the church s humanitarian budget has increased tenfold bishop caussé listed two of many ways this dramatic increase was achieved collaboration with organizations and planning with church areas we want to reach out to the most vulnerable populations people that really are in need anywhere in the world regardless of their nationalities their race or their faith bishop caussé said it s important to be in every place where there is a great need there are countries where we don t have a lot of members yet we are there working in collaboration with humanitarian organizations to help the people we have developed relationships with a network of organizations good organizations that we can trust in every part of the world and so this enables us to reach a higher scale such relationships are being established by local areas this work is not directed from salt lake city bishop caussé continued we have in every area of the church teams that work under the direction of the area presidencies and have developed those local relationships bishop waddell noted that each of the church s 23 geographic areas has a five year humanitarian plan based on needs in that part of the world then we work together to meet the needs that are real everywhere in the world he said with 8 billion people on earth the church s membership of nearly 17 million is relatively small by working with others we re able to expand our reach we re able to get to places that we wouldn t be able to get to otherwise bishop waddell said it really multiplies in many ways what we can do the church s humanitarian efforts in 2021 included 3 909 projects in 188 countries and territories the most projects and the most countries to date in 2020 the church and its members participated in 3 611 projects in 160 countries and territories and in 2019 3 221 projects in 142 countries and territories the covid 19 pandemic provided an opportunity to build relationships with organizations the church hadn t worked with before particularly in africa and asia bishop caussé added this is creating foundations that we believe are going to help us expand our reach in the future he said across christianity and other faiths bishop budge noted there s a common sense of love and desire to reach out and bless others by collaborating with other organizations we find common ground with others blessing the givers and receivers another way the church is expanding its reach is through the time talents and service that individual members provide throughout the world bishop budge said in 2021 latter day saints contributed 6 8 million hours of volunteer work more than 21 500 new community projects were facilitated using justserve a church sponsored program that matches volunteers with organizations in need a scripture in the doctrine and covenants teaches that men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause and do many things of their own free will bishop budge said quoting doctrine and covenants 58 27 i believe our members live that principle they engage in good causes all over the world of their own free

wednesday morning dozens of people gathered at communities foundation of texas to watch the dedication of a historical marker honoring dr marcellus cooper the first black dentist in texas but the day was also poignant because the man who had a hand in making sure cooper got his due wasn t there george keaton jr considered the foremost historian of black dallas past had died the night before at baylor university medical center after a brief battle with cancer he was 66 a marker commemorating the birthplace of dr marcellus cooper was dedicated the morning after dr george keaton jr died cooper s marker was one of several his organization had pursued bethany erickson it s difficult to find someone who hasn t benefited from keaton s insatiable thirst for knowledge about black dallas anyone who has taken one of his bus tours attended a historical marker dedication that he had advocated for or simply followed his work with the organization he founded remembering black dallas can probably point to an instance where keaton exposed a piece of history they were unaware of in 2019 he told dallas doing good that his interest in dallas history started with investigating his own family history during his time at north texas state university which is now the university of north texas after graduating he earned a master s in clinical counseling and a degree in guidance counseling he worked for dallas isd for 31 years before retiring first as an elementary school teacher then as a guidance counselor he formed remembering black dallas after a long membership with dr mamie l mcknight s organization with a similar mission black dallas remembered we started about four years ago out of what i felt was a need he said there was a void by the time i retired dr mamie mcknight had not been able to continue her organization for about the last 10 years his work has helped preserve the stories of those who came before and helped the city recognize history that was fading from public view he voiced yesterday that he thought that he would have more time because he still had so much to do the organization said in a facebook post announcing his death jerry hawkins a member of the dallas county historical commission and the executive director of the nonprofit dallas truth racial healing transformation echoed that statement he had so much more to do he was only 66 that s very young hawkins said he was not ready to die there were things he was still working on uncovering he was getting some stability in his organization he was going to lead a green book tour i recently talked to him and he didn t talk about dying he was not prepared to go which is sad i ve been feeling the weight of it a lot he was just not ready george keaton jr was instrumental in getting a historical marker noting the lynching of allen brooks don thomas ii hawkins and others who worked with him point to his body of work as a lasting legacy even recently keaton had pushed for a marker noting the lynching death of allen brooks whose body was hanged at main and akard streets in 1910 keaton also convinced the city to clean up and install a public memorial to the victims of the 1860 lynchings at martyrs park downtown near dealey plaza he was leading the effort along with other folks from remembering black dallas hawkins said of keaton s work on the markers which the historical society was responsible for reviewing they submitted the most applications for historical markers particularly for black folks who have been left out of the historical record in dallas most of the ones we approved at every meeting were ones that remembering black dallas and george keaton submitted and he also held webinar sessions so other folks could know how to apply for them and research them dallas civil rights leader rev peter johnson says that keaton was a pure historian he understood the relationship between yesterday and today and as a serious sensitive observer of history he had a clear understanding of how we got here johnson said he was very sensitive to making sure that this part of the world did not forget its history and the people who played important significant roles in shaping what dallas is today you can t have dallas history without black history and you can t have black history in dallas without dallas history it is all tied together in one of his last interviews before his death keaton explained his desire to show people what he called the hidden history of dallas i think it s most rewarding when we see people discover and learn about the place where they live he said after acknowledging that the city s history of segregation and its segregated present often meant dallas black history is hidden in plain sight hawkins said that keaton s work was vital and hardly ancient history on wednesday he pointed out that one of marcellus cooper s grandsons spoke at the dedication ceremony we heard from a grandson of somebody who was enslaved he said we re not that far removed from this a living descendant of an enslaved person was there talking to us this is recent history the fact that dallas past is still impacting its present hawkins pointed to studies regarding present day health infrastructure and economic inequity in historically black neighborhoods sometimes made some people frustrated with keaton s stances dr keaton was a teacher of history and folks like me wanted him to be more demanding if that makes sense hawkins said his family was enslaved on the caruth plantation they were the largest landowners in dallas and in my opinion and the facts support it they owe his family something he really didn t talk like that he just wanted the acknowledgment the caruth plantation grew to over 11 000 acres stretching the modern day communities foundation at caruth haven lane to south of smu and you know that was very admirable of him because he did the teaching and was willing to volunteer his time to help people learn these things but that s not justice he said justice is when your family can also benefit from the things that you all did for free but even with their differences over how history should be recognized hawkins said he respected and admired keaton i had a deep appreciation for him spent a lot of time with him learned a lot from him and was just amazed at all the things that he was able to do and accomplish he said he always picked up the phone for me courtesy remembering black dallas johnson said that keaton s patient way of explaining this history didn t mean that people were always comfortable hearing it for white southerners the history is embarrassing and difficult he said for black southerners and this is not just dallas but throughout the southern states the history is something we prefer not to talk about that s what i think made george so unique he was comfortable really forcing people to take a look at yesterday hawkins pondered wednesday on the void that keaton s death would leave i don t think he was prepared for this transition he said so there was no kind of succession plan no turning over of archives he has a lot of things that he collected it s a serious situation not just because he passed but what is going to happen with the legacy of his work johnson however said he sees a new crop of future historians coming into their own in an age when technology has made it easier to do research and ask questions most of them found keaton and his work i trust this generation of young people to be inquisitive and to want to know both black and white kids he said i trust that the challenges of society will produce the next generation of thinkers and the people who will ask questions and want to take a look backward to understand us today there will be other george keatons coming johnson said he would like to see keaton s legacy marked in some tangible way perhaps by having a dallas isd school named after him a university chair in his name or even a research area of the dallas public library but if the city was really interested in honoring keaton s legacy he said they d be ready to continue learning about dallas history even if it makes people uncomfortable george s commitment to exposing yesterday made a number of people both black and white uncomfortable he said so to me his legacy is that he had the audacity to make us uncomfortable and to face up to dallas history services for keaton will be held on saturday at christian chapel temple of faith at 14120 noel road an informal viewing will be held on friday from 1 p m to 7 p m at the evergreen memorial funeral home and his body will lie in state at the hall of state at fair park on thursday get the d brief newsletter dallas most important news stories of the week

on a recent blue skied morning high in the hills of south reno nevada a construction crew bent steel rebar for the foundation of a new house they used a machine about the size of a microwave you see how quick that went said peter picetti owner of pf picetti construction which is building the 4 000 square foot home i mean they just bent a 20 foot piece of no 5 rebar with two 120 degree angles to fit this crazy little corner right here the property has sweeping views of the forested mountain ranges surrounding it and the sprawling cityscape below it s objectively beautiful it s a very attractive place to be picetti said the home is being built in what s called the wildland urban interface or wui commonly known as the wooey that s where wildlands and development collide it s also where wildfire risks are the highest in 2020 there were more than 44 million homes in these zones across the country according to new research from the u s forest service and the university of wisconsin madison in fact nearly a third of the nation s homes are in the wui it s concerning the fact that we continue to grow in high wildfire risk areas rebuild in high wildfire risk areas assuming that a wildfire won t occur said kimiko barrett a wildfire researcher with the montana based research group headwaters economics since 2005 wildfires have destroyed more than 97 000 structures according to barrett s research last year colorado lost more than a thousand houses in the marshall fire the most destructive in the mountain west to date those homes barrett said weren t even considered to be in the wui arhit stock adobe com scorched homes in louisville colo from the 2021 marshall fire which destroyed more than 1 000 structures she added that many homes in high risk areas are still being built framed and sided with wood and then you place that in a very dry overstocked forest guaranteed that home is going to start burning if exposed to enough heat barrett said that s most visible in the west where more than 16 million homes are in fire prone areas as the uw madison data shows in colorado the amount has nearly doubled since 1990 to more than a million homes in nevada it s more than tripled to over half a million that s dangerous said brian bonnenfant who studies housing supply at the university of nevada reno s center for regional studies it s really been the last 10 years of this extended drought that s really impacted our forest throughout the sierras bonnenfant said now we re starting to see those impacts through large major uncontrollable aggressive fires in west reno two fires have hit a neighborhood in the wui zone the biggest was the 2011 caughlin fire which destroyed 28 homes and damaged 15 more bonnenfant said washoe county where reno is located is changing policies to increase its fire resilience that includes restricting building on ridges and mandating sprinkler systems for homes built far away from fire stations developers want to build in these really picturesque and beautiful spots because they get more money for that bonnenfant said there s got to be a balance right he said developers and local governments are just starting to shift their mindsets meanwhile scientists are beginning to understand the public health impacts of wildfires in the wui according to a new report by the national academies report co author marilyn black vice president of the chemical insights research institute said burnt man made objects like cars and plastics create a toxic mixture that hangs around long after a fire these sorts of toxicants can end up in ash and residue black said and that residue can permeate the ground it can get into our water systems our water table get into our water supplies to what degree however is not well understood according to the report black said that s why state and federal agencies need to fund further studies and develop new modeling tools for mitigating health risks to communities back at the construction site picetti said he doesn t anticipate demand for homes in picturesque spots like this to slow down around reno a 2013 ordinance requires new homes built in fire hazard areas to have 30 to 100 feet of defensible space picetti works with homeowners to comply but still he said destructive wildfires will reach some of these neighborhoods in the wui no matter what builders and homeowners do fires are gonna be have been and will continue to be a big part of destruction of property he said and the more we build up here the more structures will be at risk this story was

the high stakes fight over the stalled eagle act outsourcing bill now has a simple battle line the west coast tech investors and pro migration progressives versus everyone else the battle lines became visible on thursday when top technology investors fronted by amazon and microsoft emerged from the fog to announce their support for the outsourcing bill this force only appeared after their allies on the hill chiefly silicon valley rep zoe lofgren d ca failed to stop a loose alliance of opponents from lining up against the bill the opponents include most rank and file republicans some democrats the immigration lawyers association hospital chains a leading member of the black caucus and a medley of groups representing would be immigrants who fear they will be pushed aside by a flood of fortune 500 indentured workers progressive and conservative groups are trying to stop the eagle act i think it s really an unprecedented situation tweeted david bier a pro migration activist for the cato institute so far the tech guys are losing to everybody else the bill has been delayed at least one week leaving the advocates even less time to rush the bill through the senate the eagle act would turbocharge companies incentive to import college graduates most from india and china into a wide variety of fortune 500 careers that are needed by young american graduates including millions of swing voting graduates who helped the democrats abort a gop blowout in november section 7 of the bill is an end run around the annual green card limit rep scott fitzgerald r wi told the committee on rules on december 5 the visa worker inflow has been growing since 1990 and it has helped to keep tech worker waves flat since 2009 the inflow has also allowed c suite executives to suppress the workplace clout of professionals maximize share prices at the cost of other priorities and suppress the spinoff of rival companies by ambitious u s graduates the investor owned fortune 500 companies and their pyramids of subcontractors now employ roughly 1 5 million foreign contract workers in a wide variety of jobs needed by many underemployed and indebted u s technology graduates and their families the eagle act would accelerate the inflow by allowing fortune 500 companies to trade many more valuable green cards to indian graduates in exchange for several years of lower wage uncomplaining work but the bill also hides an even bigger corporate giveaway in section 7 it would let u s based employers trade the huge prize of lifetime u s work permits to an unlimited number of foreign workers in exchange for several years of cut rate blue collar or white collar service on december 7 pearl harbor day amazon suddenly appeared with a tweet we are proud to support the eagle act and are continuing advocate for common sense immigration reform on behalf of our employees and their families we urge congress to pass the eagleact lifting unfair per country visa caps for employment based green cards microsoft joined in microsoft has long supported the eagleact and its core provisions of eliminating eb per country limits and improving fairness in the green card process it s critical for congress to consider these issues and bring much needed relief to those facing these extraordinary backlogs the u s tech sector has hired so many visa workers that a growing share of its middle ranked and senior leadership consists are picked from a sprawling network of current and former visa workers for example microsoft s ceo and chairman is indian born satya nadella and twitter s recently departed ceo is parag agrawal who was apparently picked by the company s board while he was still an h 1b visa worker in turn the ceo report to the company boards which are dominated by representatives of major investors the eagle act would greatly benefit the two companies because they are the greatest users of the h 1b visa program the program keeps more than 500 000 foreign graduates in u s jobs by dangling the prize of u s citizenship in exchange for several years or more of dutiful servitude the myvisajobs site shows that amazon asked for 21 000 three year h 1b visas in 2022 plus 5 810 green cards as a bonus for those h 1bs are already in the united states in 2019 the company also hired almost 3 000 recent foreign graduates of u s colleges via the fast expanding optional practical training opt program the myvisajobs site showed that microsoft wanted roughly 11 000 three year h 1b visas in 2022 plus 3 000 green cards as a reward for its current visa workers the dhs site showed microsoft employed 900 foreign graduates with opt work permits in 2019 the federal government provides very little information about corporate hiring via the other l 1 j 1 and h4ed foreign worker programs those programs include roughly 600 000 foreign workers in jobs that could be performed by many of the underemployed american technology graduates in 2022 the u s government quintupled the award of green cards to indian graduates the tech companies public intervention is unusual because the investors prefer to do much of their public advocacy behind a screen of lobby groups astroturf fronts and plaintive pleas from camera ready advocates for example the very visible immigration voice group presents indian visa workers as the primary beneficiaries of the giveaway act but the group s advisory board consists of a long standing lobbyist for the tech industry and neil patel the owner of the dailycaller com and a former staffer for vice president dick cheney similarly the eagle act has been repeatedly pushed by fwd us which is an investor created advocacy group for more migration per country caps on green cards create decades long backlogs making the immigration system less efficient less fair fwd us declared in september the bipartisan eagle act would help fix that by reforming the caps said the fwd us report which did not describe the new work for work permits incentive and pipeline the breadth of investors who founded and funded fwd us was hidden from casual visitors to the group s website sometime in the last few months but copies exist at the other sites the 2013 founders included facebook founder mark zuckerberg microsoft founder bill gates john doerr at kleiner perkins matt cohler at benchmark and reid hoffman a partner at the greylock partners investment firm who also sits on microsoft s board this outsourcing campaign has been ignored by establishment outlets such as the new york times and the washington post which is owned by jeff bezos the owner of amazon the investors are being backed by their silicon valley ally lofgren they are also backed by leaders in the democrats pro migration identity group causes including rep pramila jayapal d wa the indian born leader of the progressive caucus these groups play up the gains for indian workers but they dodge the concerns about the act s section 7 incentives for the fortune 500 to hire foreign workers instead of americans new house dems just received a long dear colleagues from repzoelofgren repjayapal repraulruizmd repkarenbass and repjudychu in support of eagleact we must advance improvements that improve people s livelihoods while doing no harm to others here s the text pic twitter com chbhvxzd15 pablo manríquez pabloreports december 7 2022 so far the gop leadership has opposed the eagle act by saying it helps china s communist government get more access to u s business but democrats have added language to take that objection away from the gop leaders who are fully aware that one in six of their voters in november said immigration controls are their top priority apple s ceo tim cook is also backing the bill and recently met with gop leaders gop opposition to the eagle act is complicated by rep tom emmer r mn who managed the house republicans 2022 election campaign he eked out a narrow win in the 2022 election after he accepted huge donations from investor groups notably the gop campaign minimized criticism of the pocketbook damage caused to americans by president joe biden s cheap labor migration policies emmer was elected gop whip in the next congress overall investors and their companies employ roughly 1 5 million foreign contract workers in jobs that were denied to american graduates a 2021 study by the census bureau reported massive underemployment among u s graduates amid the replacement level inflow of visa workers the vast majority 62 of college educated workers who majored in a stem field were employed in non stem fields such as non stem management law education social work accounting or counseling in addition 10 of stem college graduates worked in stem related occupations such as health care the path to stem jobs for non stem majors was narrow only a few stem related majors 7 and non stem majors 6 ultimately ended up in stem occupations the pre inflation salaries in the tech sector rose from 78 845 in 2009 to 93 244 in 2018 and 104 566 in 2021 but that shows a slight decline of 0 3 percent according to the inflation calculator offered by the bureau of labor statistics as tech salaries stalled tech investors gained trillions of dollars in extra value from escalating profits and stock prices the flat salaries for tech workers also allow many employers to cut salaries for many other non tech graduates most college graduates have actually seen their real incomes stagnate or even decline since 2000 new york times columnist paul krugman wrote in april the replacement of free speaking american professionals with indentured foreign labor also allows executives to discard important civic priorities these priorities such as security privacy and durability of high tech infrastructure are sacrificed to lower costs and raise stock prices the resulting damage was exposed by losses at intel and boeing and by the bankruptcy and jailings at theranos the inflow of foreign workers also encourages coastal investors to minimize investments in inland states so redirecting jobs payrolls housing wealth and political power to the coastal states many polls show the public strongly opposes corporate labor migration into the jobs that americans need for middle class lives homes and families

north carolina treasurer dale folwell sent a bombshell letter to asset manager blackrock saying its ceo larry fink needs to resign or be removed from the firm s leadership team immediately over his obsession with pursuing a leftist political agenda folwell is the first state treasurer to call for fink to resign or be removed while others have withdrawn their state s proxy votes and divested state funds from blackrock as north carolina s sole fiduciary folwell said in the letter that he is skeptical fink would or could lead the necessary course correction and has lost confidence in his leadership due to fink s driving environmental social and governance esg policies larry fink s pursuit of a political agenda has gotten in the way of blackrock s same fiduciary duty a focus on esg is not a focus on returns and potentially could force us to violate our own fiduciary duty he wrote in the letter there is no blue money or red money at the treasurer s office only green blackrock needs to be totally focused on returns for their clients not on the political effort to transform the economy to your vision of carbon zero fossil fuels will be the engine that drives the world s economy for the foreseeable future he wrote the only way that i can see blackrock refocusing on its fiduciary duty to its clients is for a change at the top folwell says he wrote this on behalf of north carolinians and especially the north carolina retirement systems ncrs which is one of the country s largest public pension plans because he wants to ensure that the retirement benefits and savings for over a million people approximately 14 billion invested through blackrock in various active and passive funds in addition to around 55 million passively invested in blackrock stocks or bonds are being appropriately managed folwell added unfortunately larry fink s pursuit of a political agenda has gotten in the way of blackrock s same fiduciary duty a focus on esg is not a focus on returns and potentially could force us to violate our own fiduciary duty ultimately fink s continued ideological pressure could result in using esg scores against states and local governments lowering their credit ratings and thus driving up their cost of borrowing at taxpayers expense this not only concerns me as the state treasurer but as chair of the north carolina state banking commission and the local government commission at larry fink s direction blackrock has used the financial power of its clients to force the global warming agenda using proxy voting authority to push companies to net zero often in conflict with its fiduciary responsibilities for example in 2020 he used blackrock s clients votes against two management supported board members of exxonmobil because of insignificant progress towards green energy yet exxonmobil stock rose 60 in the 12 months since the board member election because of an increase in the demand for oil berkshire hathaway s charlie munger had it right when he said we don t need emperors voting shares in index funds based on their social agendas with that in mind i recently signed an agreement that enables ncrs to vote its shares managed by blackrock i recognize that you implemented a proxy voting system last year that allows investors in certain pooled vehicles to have some degree of control over their voting however the existence of the proxy voting program does not mitigate the need for a new direction at blackrock as mentioned more republicans across the united states have started to take aim at blackrock for its esg policies multiple republican led states across the united states have begun pulling money they have invested out of blackrock due to its leftist activism in financial investing additionally state treasurers from multiple states attended the state financial officers foundation sfof conference last month where many from across the country presented a strategy against esg policies the group launched a website and a video explainer hoping to educate americans on the dangers of esg policies at the conference multiple state treasurers explained to breitbart news that esg policies hurt each state differently but collectively hurt all american taxpayers financially hence they came together in a joint effort to combat the left wing policies masquerading as economics jacob bliss is a reporter for breitbart news write to him at jbliss breitbart com or follow him on twitter jacobmbliss

ukraine s evolving battlefield requirements the united states will continue to work with its allies and partners to provide ukraine with key capabilities according to a pentagon statement russia s weapons meanwhile russia is expanding and modernizing its nuclear arsenal at a time when russian president vladimir putin has repeatedly suggested he could use nuclear weapons to protect russia u s

over ukraine much harder to reach although contacts between russian and u s intelligence services were at least continuing at a news conference in the kyrgyz capital bishkek putin lamented the failure to implement the minsk agreements cease fire and constitutional reform deals between kyiv and russian backed separatist forces in eastern ukraine in 2014 and 2015 by russia france and germany at the outset of the war in ukraine we thought we would still be able to agree within the framework of the minsk peace agreements what can you say there is a question of trust putin said and trust of course is almost at zero since suffering a series of military setbacks putin has increasingly pitched his invasion on ukraine as a fight to defend russia against an aggressive collective west russia is working on obtaining more weapons from iran including hundreds of ballistic missiles it is also offering tehran an unprecedented level of military and technical support in return britain s u n

putin accused the west of using ukraine as a tool against his country for many years the west shamelessly exploited and pumped out its resources encouraged genocide and terror in the donbas and effectively turned the country into a colony he said now it s cynically using the ukrainian people as cannon fodder as a ram against russia by continuing to supply ukraine with weapons and ammunition

getty images the year 2022 has seen a robust return of airline traffic and many airlines have earned profits for the first time since the first quarter of 2020 the year included major operational disruptions and higher fares as demand was strong even with fewer flights flown yet like any year a lot happens in the u s airline industry choosing the top stories of the year is tough because a lot has happened i chose these stories based on the impact to the industry going forward here are five biggest things that happened in 2022 that will affect the operating environment in 2023 and beyond jetblue wins battle for spirit over frontier in february of 2022 spirit airlines and frontier airlines announced plans to merge in a mostly stock and small cash deal this seemed inevitable to many as the airlines share an ultra low cost business model and frontier s major owner and ceo each came from spirit while the world was contemplating what this merger might mean jetblue surprised many with an all cash bid for spirit that would pay their shareholders a larger premium that the frontier deal offered nominally after several failed attempts at getting shareholder approval it became clear that spirit s shareholders liked the jetblue deal better certain cash at a meaningful premium was preferred to stock with uncertain future value even for those that liked the business model story of the initial deal in late july 2022 the spirit board formally rejected the frontier offer and agreed to terms with jetblue while this deal will require a review by the u s justice anti trust offices as would have the frontier deal jetblue claims that the combination offers a significantly better chance of competing with the four largest u s airlines i serve on the jetblue board of directors boeing not to release new mid sized plane until 2035 boeing a proud american manufacturer somewhat quietly announced that they would not release a new mid sized aircraft until at least 2035 this means that a company with a huge history of innovation and leadership is basing the next decade or more on a plane originally designed in the 1960s the boeing 737 arguably boeing s fleet offerings today are struggling today against a more aggressive airbus pushing this decision off for so long suggests a change in the importance of commercial aviation for the company consistent with this boeing also moved their headquarters from chicago il to arlington va just outside of washington dc this suggests that their strong military design and manufacturing division is growing in importance and priority meanwhile airbus has bet big on hydrogen as a major component of sustainability while they aren t committing to a hydrogen powered aircraft until at least 2035 their core offering of the a320neo and variants is newer than the 737 by a few decades they also have set milestones on this hydrogen mission to help ensure they make this target easyjet an airbus operator and engine maker rolls royce successfully ran an airline engine on hydrogen in november the boeing actions are concerning for a company so important to aviation it suggests that boeing can t keep up with a world moving very quickly this could have significant implications for the industry over the next decade summer 2022 operations bring ire to dot secretary the summer of 2022 was difficult for airline operations airlines cut capacity quickly when the pandemic first hit but airlines found it harder to build back than to cut blaming staffing shortages weather and even air traffic control airlines had a high rate of flight cancellations and many long flight delays in august department of transportation secretary pete buttigeig called in the head of the largest u s airlines and declared the cancellations as unacceptable yet blaming just the airlines was seen by many as short sighted since the problems while realized at the airlines related also to airports air traffic control and even labor unions as well the role of governmental regulations or at least governmental pressure is uncertain as the industry moves into 2023 the secretary has made it clear however that airlines will be held accountable when things go wrong even if they can t fix it alone russian airspace closes forcing many flight changes the war in ukraine affects the global airline industry in a few ways most directly is the closure of russian airspace for many countries in retaliation for ukranian support russia is a physically large country and not being able to use their airspace has caused flight cancellations and some long detours europe to and from asia is most affected especially from scandinavia and other northern hubs while some lose due to this other hubs benefit the middle east hubs are far enough south that they can serve india and other asian spots without crossing russia on the way when people can t go some places that doesn t mean they don t travel at all they just go someplace else and those places benefit from that pandemic is over for airline travel despite the operational challenges of the summer airlines were happy to see a strong return to travel that extended even beyond the summer leisure travel reached levels close to 2019 and that bodes well for a profitable and growing 2023 for the industry the business travel segment is still somewhat uncertain most airlines reported business volumes at north of 80 compared to 2019 but higher fares made business revenue also close to 2019 airlines are figuring out what total demand looks like post pandemic ideas like blended travel or combining business and leisure trips and premium leisure travel has airlines thinking about new service offerings and new travel products this is encouraging and has airlines innovating in interesting ways the airline industry is constantly changing each year brings new challenges and opportunities just a year ago we saw the start of two new airlines in the u s avelo and breeze and this year was the closest to normal since 2020 but normal doesn t mean without significant events and the issues here will help drive changes in 2023 and beyond

after taking stock of the year s best tv shows movies albums and songs we round out a week of remembrance by looking back at 2022 s best performances in this list you ll find dramatic actors in film and the people who made us laugh out loud on television but we also made sure to account for some of the year s more unconventional entertainers read on to see who made the cut cate blanchett as lydia tár in tár often we praise performances for their transformation the character s perceived distance from the performer s everyday self the beauty of lydia tár is how much she resembles cate blanchett a widely lauded master of her distinctly highbrow craft tár spends her days shuttling between podcast tapings and new yorker symposia blanchett herself occupies the same milieu which may be how the actress makes the conductor a master class in ego gone awry lydia is essentially cate with an ethnomusicology degree a queer marriage and a willingness to internalize her own hype even tár s sexuality isn t that much of a stretch given blanchett s prior work in films like carol even before we learn exactly how tár has abused the power that comes with her position we can see her enjoy herself a little too much when browbeating a grad student or teasing an assistant with a potential promotion a temptation blanchett herself has surely entertained that tár is a genuine talent only emphasizes her tragedy she s a genius whose creation by blanchett in conjunction with writer and director todd field is itself an act of genius it s become a tongue in cheek meme that lydia tár is a real person a joke that s plausible only because watching her demands no suspension of disbelief alison herman paulina alexis as willie jack in reservation dogs i don t ask for much i simply ask that willie jack the ornery and profane but fiercely loyal mvp of hulu s stupendous reservation dogs appear in every scene of every other tv show just so i can watch her react to people ok mvp is the wrong framing reservation dogs the shaggy and continually breathtaking tragicomic tale of four resilient teenagers longing to escape their rural oklahoma indian reservation is a delicate ensemble masterpiece but willie jack who gets the first line of season 2 that line being sup shitass still steals every scene she s in often wordlessly she scrunches up her face and scratches her ear as two screwball elders lead a loopy prayer down by the river she crosses her arms and rolls her eyes through the nards youth summit she looms sagely in the background of various aimless antics before pushing the action forward with an impeccably timed skoden when she finally gets a true showcase scene in season 2 s penultimate episode the prison meeting room the vending machine raid the prayer it s a monster a showstopper an all timer but all she really needs to do to nail it is breath deeply and let out one quiet heartrending oh shit put her in everything all the time rob harvilla michelle yeoh as evelyn wang in everything everywhere all at once after being cast in supporting roles for decades michelle yeoh finally landed the top spot on a hollywood call sheet for the first time in a24 s everything everywhere all at once it s shameful that the opportunity took this long to come but that lost time only contributes to what is a tremendously moving versatile performance from the iconic 60 year old actress yeoh stars as evelyn wang an overtaxed laundromat owner who gets to experience all her lives that could have been as she becomes a full fledged action hero to save the multiverse it s a role or roles really that has yeoh doing everything from fight sequences involving butt plugs to romantic scenes featuring hot dog fingers and jamie lee curtis it s the goofiest we ve ever seen her while also the most vulnerable as all the wild quirks of the film give way to heart wrenching conversations between a distant mother and her distraught daughter yeoh has been showing her on screen talents in a wide range of roles since her start in hong kong action cinema in the 80s but everything everywhere puts them on display all at once and it s about time she s getting her due daniel chin matilda lawler as young kirsten in station eleven i once wrote that tv teens come in two types of terrible the blandly rebellious kind that smolders with generic rage and the kind that hogs the screen and disrupts the plot in dramas we re watching for the adults there s also the more benign kind that exists solely to satisfy a child sibling quota and thus spends little time on screen young kirsten is none of the above she s arguably the linchpin and the most compelling presence of one of 2022 s most emotionally resonant series lawler in her first regular tv role draws the difficult assignment of playing the younger version of a grown up character embodied by mackenzie davis who could qualify for this list herself not only does she have to persuade us that young kirsten could turn into adult kirsten but she has to show us how it happens even in the poignant scenes she shares with davis during the series most memorable episode goodbye my damaged home she more than holds her own lawler s performance stands out even in a strong year for dual timeline dramas in the show young kirsten becomes a precocious child actor before a virus interrupts her fledgling career for that aspect of the part the talented lawler hardly had to pretend ben lindbergh antony starr as john homelander in the boys when i tweet something out of pocket and nobody unfollows pic twitter com kfosfqhynj torb torbalderson july 12 2022 in the glorious goriest series the boys homelander s catastrophic powers are mostly derived from the fucked up superhuman might of his compound v juiced body but antony starr s performance as the program s bad superman is all about the things the guy can do with his face he whimpers and sneers he looks cocksure then agog he has the stubborn lower lip of vito corleone and the plaintive eyes of a shamed puppy he talks to himself in mirrors he basks and seethes he can t believe what he s seeing and has the twitchy features to prove it starr s performance is so competent it causes people problems and so strong that it hurts much like homelander that big bad baby himself katie baker sharon horgan as eva garvey in bad sisters it s 2022 and there s absolutely no excuse to not know who sharon horgan is i am however concerned about whether or not this woman finds the time to sleep the irish actress writer and director has launched hits such as catastrophe which she cowrote with rob delaney the hbo series divorce and myriad other comedic productions developed over the past decade additionally her instagram account remains one of the most entertaining places around horgan s latest project apple tv s bad sisters is easily the best thing i ve watched this year the show centers on a group of sisters hatching a plan to murder their monster of a brother in law john paul and while it s obviously hard to defend manslaughter horgan s writing is so brilliant that you re ready to throw morality out the window to cheer on the garvey girls as they seek to eliminate their sister s abusive spouse everyone on the cast is spectacular but it s horgan s portrayal of the eldest daughter eva that has you laughing the most as she and the rest of her sisters continue to fail throughout the series in shakespearean ways come for the diabolically funny dialogue stay for the scenic views of ireland and wait like me for a second season where some very earned

to the episode s main writer janine nabers made out to be a slave to his own overgrown studio machinery he shrugs it off when van flings hot grits in his face in perhaps the single funniest exchange i m fine of the show s fourth and final season justin charity bob odenkirk as jimmy mcgill saul goodman gene takovic in better call saul it s a minor miracle that we even got a final season of better call saul to begin with in one of the rare occasions in which the entire internet rallied around a noble cause we collectively prayed that bob odenkirk would survive an on set heart attack one that as the actor later recounted might have ended his life if not for some quick thinking cpr and defibrillator access that odenkirk pulled through an ordeal in which his heart stopped beating for 18 minutes was worth celebrating in and of itself but then he went out and delivered some of the finest acting you ll ever see better call saul featured a murderer s row of gifted performers your regular reminder that rhea seehorn should have multiple emmys by now and the television academy is populated by cowards but odenkirk was essentially pulling triple duty this season triples is best between jimmy mcgill saul goodman and gene takovic odenkirk had to embody three distinct personalities across multiple timelines in one moment the chameleonic character is sympathetic and morally conflicted in the next he s petulant and wounded at one point jimmy cum saul cum gene even threatens carol burnett a national treasure with all the menace of a serial killer by the time better call saul reached its conclusion there was no performer juggling more on their plate this year than odenkirk who more than did justice to an all time great series miles surrey dylan cumming as himself in the liberty university baseball team jersey reveal majesty grace pure unadulterated stage presence those are all words and phrases that come to mind when watching the best performance of 2022 no i m not talking about the chops of a broadway actress or harry styles blowing the roof off the forum or any number of the talented people who graced both the big and small screens this year i m talking about dylan cumming a pitcher for the liberty baseball team who put on the show of a lifetime in a team jersey reveal video before you dismiss me out of hand just watch the powder blues are absolutely incredible the powder blues reveal out of libertybaseball media team is down right immaculate pic twitter com aiymtodmlt stephen schoch bigdonkey47 february 24 2022 some of the credit here of course has to go to celine dion this video surely wouldn t have reached the same heights had cummings attempted to imitate someone with a less ridiculous vocal range and there are plenty of background contributors who made this possible too the people hitting their lighting cues the background dancers and flashlight operators the person operating the leaf blower seriously who got wind flowing through cummings s hair at just the right moment but the commitment the desperation the on time flinging open of the jacket that s purely cummings and that s the reason i ve watched this video approximately 25 000 times this calendar year megan schuster diego luna as cassian andor in andor at this point in my lifelong fandom i m rather exhausted by star wars and yet i can t heap enough praise on andor a wonderfully tense and grounded series created by rogue one writer tony gilroy starring diego luna as the reluctant rebel hero cassian andor andor tracks the titular character as he stumbles fatefully into the power politics of palpatine s galactic empire we already know andor dies in rogue one really everyone dies in rogue one and his namesake series taking the form of a counterterrorism thriller patiently stirs the groundswell of desperation that initially forges the rebel alliance in the interregnum between revenge of the sith and a new hope it s been a long while since the empire seemed genuinely menacing rather than pointlessly ubiquitous and cartoonishly overpowered and it s also been a minute since a hero in this universe played the underdog so convincingly charity the little voice in sbf s head that compels him to keep speaking to the press do you remember when bernie madoff went on the tonight show how about when the enron guys went on meet the press no well there s a good reason for that people at the center of white collar criminal investigations are usually smart enough to lay low and avoid the spotlight at least until the storm blows over but not sam bankman fried the disgraced crypto prince at the center of this year s biggest financial bust no it seems that sbf is determined to talk his way out of this mess and for anyone who s looked at the blockchain with a healthy distrust his semi apology tour has been pure schadenfreude as a recap the famously schlubby bankman fried founded the crypto exchange ftx in early 2019 and quickly became the white knight of digital currency he preached new agey concepts like effective altruism and invited regulatory oversight for a notoriously unregulated industry by the beginning of 2022 he was palling around with tom and giselle and giving endorsement deals to steph curry and larry david things were going great until suddenly last month when they weren t an investigation by a crypto news site revealed the way too cozy ties between ftx and a hedge fund sbf had founded from there the details get salacious but too difficult to sum up in a blurb like this just know there was a savvy strike by one of his rivals rumors of an in house psychiatrist prescribing adderall to ftx employees and the curious case of around 2 billion in missing customer funds and just like that the most virtuous house of cards in cryptocurrency collapsed into a pile of shitcoins it must be noted that bankman fried is no longer the ceo of the exchange and he has yet to be charged with a crime he has however stuck to his home in the bahamas since shortly after ftx declared bankruptcy but instead of laying low and conferring with his lawyers on how to avoid ending up in a minimum security prison he s been doing the one thing any crisis management pr specialist would tell him to avoid he s been trying to get his side of the story out there by any means necessary first there was his bizarre tweeting behavior that may or may not have been some kind of coded message then there was the twitter dm interview with a vox journalist where he typed seemingly earnestly that i feel bad for those who get fucked by it by this game we woke westeners play where we say all the right shiboleths and so everyone likes us hey guys last night in twitter dms i asked sam bankman fried when alameda first borrowed ftx customer funds what he really thinks of the sec and a lot more kelsey piper kelseytuoc november 16 2022 lately there have been more traditional interviews like this one with puck or another one with the podcast the journal which bears the title do you expect to go to prison short answer no long answer shrug emoji but my favorite came as part of the new york times dealbook summit which started like this a clearly very nervous sbf just spilled his la croix on his shirt kate clark kateclarktweets november 30 2022 once he got done spilling fizzy water on himself he subjected himself to a litany of questions from andrew ross sorkin at one point sorkin read a letter from an ftx customer aloud who asked why bankman fried thought it was ok to steal people s life savings to which he offered an extremely sbf answer yeah um i mean i m deeply sorry about what happened andrew ross sorkin reads a letter to sbf sorkin can you please ask sbf why he decided to steal my life savings sbf yeah um i mean i m deeply sorry about what happened pic twitter com p8ujlpd7sa greg price greg_price11 november 30 2022 sorkin went on to ask whether his lawyers advised him to do these interviews not surprisingly they hadn t rather sbf is a man alone determined to tweet through the biggest collapse in crypto history and give high profile interviews while he s under all sorts of investigations it s an act of public self flagellation for the ages just wait till michael lewis puts his mark on it sayles tramell tillman as seth milchick in severance severance is a tale of victims the poor hapless sods who ve had their brains severed to increase their usefulness as office workers and manipulators most everyone else wise to what lumon industries is up to then there s milchick tramell tillman the central cast s non severed supervisor who isn t so much the series villain as it is its highly competent gloriously mustachioed middleman it s milchick who through too warm smiles cheery platitudes and ostentatiously bestowed waffle parties keeps severance from tipping entirely into horror he infuses every scene he s in with a delightful if not entirely soothing sense of gee willikers no other scene in 2022 gave me quite as much joy as milchick s giddy surreal dance party the ex machina sequel i never knew i needed claire mcnear vanessa lachey as herself in the love is blind season 3 reunion it may have been her husband who earned a full blown meme cycle for his obviously i m nick lachey line the first time around but three seasons later vanessa lachey has emerged as the far more charismatic love is blind cohost this was especially apparent at the season 3 reunion episode where she channeled the over invested reality tv fan to the point that people on the internet wondered whether she was on molly we re talking shrieking clapping arm waving puppy eyes swiveling around in her chair and occasionally slumping onto her husband for support she even teared up as she recapped sk s altar rejection of raven besides just being fun to watch her genuine interest in the contestants relationship arcs guided her questioning and helped her drill down on some of the more uncomfortable truths that we viewers craved even more of a feat was that she somehow managed to channel real empathy for these people while doing it i ve grown accustomed to expect either bemused detachment à la andy cohen or faux concern à la chris harrison from my reality tv reunion hosts but with this season in particular lachey has blazed a new path forward for the art form nosy empathy obviously i m a fan of her

subscribe daniel kaluuya as otis oj haywood jr in nope roughly one week after the theatrical release of jordan peele s 2022 spectacle nope logan paul took to twitter to lambast peele s film which much like the blockbusters of steven spielberg doubled as a scathing look at the hollywood machine it seems like paul understood that but he didn t quite get daniel kaluuya s stoic lead performance in the film penning a tweet that promptly pissed me off way to strip all the life from a phenomenal actor daniel kaluuya by casting him as possibly the most mundane vanilla character i ve ever seen paul wrote oj a man who used the skills he picked up working with horses to understand interact with and defeat an extraterrestrial is dull a guy who had an intuitive read on every individual he encountered aside from jupe who was literally feeding oj s loaned horses to said extraterrestrial did logan paul even peep oj s vintage tee game maybe that s on me i related a lot with how oj moved throughout the film from his heightened anxiety whenever emerald was around jupe to his quick nope as he realizes that jean jacket has him pinned it s part of why i admire peele s ability to create characters who speak directly to me the fact that kaluuya could do so much in a role that required him to give so little is the real testament to his phenomenal acting but maybe that s my fault for giving a shit about what logan paul has to say about nope in the first place khal drake as 21 savage s hype man in a different timeline we re talking about drake s marathon verse on jack harlow s churchill downs a treatise on hollow luxury and pettiness that captures everything that made aubrey graham one of the biggest stars on the planet and the spirit guide for woebegone bros everywhere it was a two plus minute exclamation point meant to make fans forget about drake s lackluster 2021 which was defined by the bloated paint by numbers certified lover boy and a tiresome beef with ye better remembered for j prince photo shoots and chris paul jerseys than for any actual bars but like most bits of supposedly dominant culture in 2022 the jack harlow album came with a bang and left with a whimper mostly forgotten until the grammy nominations were announced last month at this juncture we must implore the recording academy to mackle less instead as the calendar gets set to flip we re talking about how we ll actually remember drake in 2022 as a sidekick to one of the most exciting rappers alive 21 savage you could technically date this development to last year when 21 propped up knife talk the most lasting cut on drake s latest monument to his own ego but the discussion about drake s run as the most overpaid second banana this side of kyrie begins in earnest with jimmy cooks the only true rap song on aubrey s house record released in june while honestly nevermind is better than its haters would like to admit jimmy cooks a cowardly last second cop out albeit a great one remains its defining moment that s almost entirely off the strength of 21 s verse a truly thrilling performance that opens with him calling us all pussies and gives will smith advice about pistol whipping drake s biggest contribution there is tossing 21 an alley oop at the close of his verse drake is nothing if not savvy so he quickly sought to capitalize on the success of jimmy cooks last month he returned with her loss an undercooked ep s worth of ideas spread out over 60 minutes to make up for its shortcomings he grafted 21 savage onto the project giving him less than a third of its run time but equal billing on the marquee and 21 delivered her loss along with jimmy cooks cash in cash out and a half dozen other show stealing performances solidified the 30 year old atlien as the defining rapper of 2022 drake meanwhile has been memed into oblivion for his opening lines on the album 21 can you do somethin for me can you hit a li l rich flex for me a bit of hypermasculine flirting disguised as a setup for a collaborator ultimately jimmy cooks and her loss salvaged what could ve been another down year for drake he just had to simp for the homie to make it happen maybe the lesson here is a simple one if you don t want to get reduced to being a hype man for one of the best rappers working today stick to the jack harlow features but if you want to get back on top sometimes you gotta ride your guy s coattails to get there sayles ayo edebiri as sydney adamu in the bear seemingly out of nowhere the bear practically smashed through our tv screens this summer the show s frenetic energy mirrored that of its lead character carmy jeremy allen white who earned much of the initial attention as the series resident chef de bad boy but in the end as viewers would come to realize it was sydney played expertly by ayo edebiri who grounded the series serving as an understated foil to carmy s masculine bravado sydney and carmy are two sides of the same coin both are highly intelligent ambitious and passionate about their work but only sydney has to contend with the verbal abuse dished out by restaurant manager richie ebon moss bachrach line cook tina liza colón zayas and carmy himself edebiri effectively channels the complicated struggle of working for someone you admire but also kind of hate it s a special if confusing dynamic that takes real skill to sell on the screen sydney s arc throughout the bear was a real thrill to watch and after the satisfying conclusion of the first season we all can t wait to see how she takes the new namesake restaurant to the next level aric jenkins misha brooks as creamcheese in players i don t know whether anyone watched players months after its first season aired on paramount it s seemingly locked in renewal cancellation limbo but everyone who missed it still has the chance to check out one of the year s strongest small screen comedies a mockumentary from the makers of american vandal players gives the last dance treatment to a fictional league of legends esports squad even as the series pulls off the difficult dance of respecting its very specific subject without alienating non league fans it also manages to deliver heart and hilarity in almost equal measure that players achieves that balance is largely a testament to brooks who plays trevor creamcheese polowski the founder and at age 27 old man of fugitive gaming creamcheese s convincing combination of overconfidence and insecurity makes him maddening and endearing and brooks brings the pathos that elevates his camera hogging character into much more than a caricature he and da jour jones who plays teammate organizm the toby esque bête noire to creamcheese s michael scott when the series starts are the real life wombo combo at the core of the show s success the fugitive bot laners maturation as teammates and individuals is reason enough to root for a second season lindbergh charlotte nicdao as poppy li in mythic quest yes another entry from a tv comedy about the video game industry i guess i have a type sorry stellan skarsgard you re totally my type too but i didn t want to double up on andor nicdao s delivery of because it s fun during an exchange about the supposed theft of her disappointing programming project in last week s mythic quest might be the funniest reading i remember from this year on paper it s a pretty humdrum line but she sells it so hard with her whole body and voice and hyper expressive face that it turns into a punch line guffaw is the only word for what my wife and i did when we watched it for the first time and the second and third this season has seen poppy continue to evolve or devolve from a plucky unconfident underdog to rob mcelhenney s domineering ian into a workplace despot in her own right albeit an awkward one that transformation has empowered nicdao to demonstrate her range setting her up to steal scenes from mcelhenney the ostensible star as she orders and pleads at the end of that clip respect me i do lindbergh angela bassett as queen ramonda in black panther wakanda forever how has angela bassett never won an oscar after black panther wakanda forever and bassett s performance as queen ramonda that drought should end in a few months though the academy tends to ignore superhero movies unfortunately it s rare to witness a performance with so much nuance power sadness anger and fear all rolled into one t challa s death was such a central theme of the black panther sequel and ramonda was the character who carried the movie for large stretches while ushering the audience along in a shared journey of grief the have i not given everything speech was incredibly moving it s already worthy of being deemed one of the best monologues in mcu history not only is bassett s ramonda one of the best performances of 2022 but it s also one of the best in the genre in a long long time arjuna ramgopal
abbott s 8 dividend hike defies disappointing results however it seems like chances are high that abbotts woes will turn out to be short lived the company claims that much of its troubles are due to covid 19 lockdowns in china and other temporary factors such as the infant formula recall despite recent volatility the companys top and bottom line growth in recent years has been nothing short of spectacular on friday the american medical device company once again reaffirmed its expectations for long term growth by announcing that it would raise its dividend by 8 5 to 51 cents per share the companys dividend growth streak now stands at 51 years making it one of the few dividend kings on the market growth interruptions are unlikely to last third quarter results showed that abbotts international medical device sales dropped by 9 year over year and were down 7 compared to the previous quarter however the company said this was due to a combination of supply chain issues and china lockdowns both of which are temporary issues helping to support this claim is the fact that u s medical device sales rose 11 year over year with both u s and international sales combined medical device sales were only down 0 5 compared to the prior year quarter growth was particularly strong for structural heart and diabetes care medical devices when taking all four main business segments into account nutrition diagnostics established pharmaceuticals and medical devices sales for the quarter came in at 10 4 billion down 4 7 year over year on a reported bases and 1 3 on an organic basis excluding negative foreign exchange impact from the strong dollar diagnostics in the u s were down 10 as this segment was negatively impacted by lower covid 19 testing related sales international diagnostics were only down 1 8 though we can likely expect international demand for covid 19 testing to decline as well established pharmaceuticals was the only segment that reported year over year growth for the third quarter with sales rising 4 9 this segment which operates exclusively in non u s markets with a focus on emerging markets sells tried and true pharmacy staples to underserved populations the nutrition segments sales were down sharply in the u s and were mostly flat internationally which was due to a manufacturing stoppage of certain infant formula products at abbott s sturgis michigan facility in february due to fda concerns about unsanitary conditions to make matters worse right after the factory managed to re open it had to be closed again due to severe flooding abbott resumed production at the facility again during the third quarter the factory stoppage and recalls slashed pediatric nutrition sales by 31 in the u s some issues could still persist while some factors such as the covid lockdowns in china and the infant formula production halt should soon hopefully be in the rearview mirror other issues could persist for a while yet for example covid 19 related diagnostic sales still have further left to fall especially on the international front not only have more people already gotten covid or been vaccinated by now far fewer employers businesses and big events are requiring people to get tested for covid before going to work travelling or attending large scale gatherings supply chain constraints could also prove persistent as well global political unrest raw materials shortages and high fuel costs continue hampering the production and distribution of certain products for many companies in abbotts case supply chain issues are hurting its freestyle libre sales in international markets and continue negatively impacting the production of certain electrophysiology products its difficult to tell for certain whether these issues will continue going forward but it seems like a possibility that shouldnt be ignored valuation and dividend analysis despite recent issues that should turn out to be temporary for the most part abbott has a three year revenue per share growth rate of 11 7 and a three year earnings per share without non recurring items growth rate of 44 3 abbott s 8 dividend hike defies disappointing results the stocks price earnings ratio of 24 27 is below the companys historical median of 31 77 and the peg ratio of 1 11 indicates fair valuation when ebitda growth is taken into consideration the gf value chart rates abbotts shares as modestly undervalued based on a combination of past growth historical valuation multiples and analysts estimates of future results abbott s 8 dividend hike defies disappointing results the companys latest dividend raise is an encouraging sign and continues the companys long history of commitment to growing shareholder returns unfortunately the trailing 12 month dividend yield of 1 76 isnt a strong point to build off of and the yield by itself likely wont entice investors however continuing to raise the dividend in the high single digits is still a step in the right direction that shows the company likely isnt expecting results to fall off a cliff any time soon abbott also raised its full year gaap earnings per share guidance in its third quarter earnings report it now expects 2022 earnings per share to come in at a range of 3 75 to 3 81 while this is lower than the earnings per share of 3 94 it reported in full fiscal 2021 its not bad considering all of the setbacks the company has faced this year takeaway abbott laboratories is a classic case of a series of unfortunate events tanking the share price even though the majority of its issues will be short lived the company has issued solid guidance is working to resolve its issues and continues to raise its dividend while the stock might not fully recover in the near term recovery from recent headwinds

the company s main product bitcoin isn t exactly popular just now and it didn t mine as much last month as it hoped to what happened if you think you re having a bad week spare a moment of thought for beleaguered cryptocurrency company marathon digital holdings mara 3 63 over the past week the bitcoin btc 1 25 miner s stock plunged by more than 27 according to data compiled by s p global market intelligence due to continued softness in the price of its core asset and a production update that failed to impress investors so what if the market can hardly get excited about bitcoin you can be sure it s shrugging about marathon digital the leading digital coin by market cap remains frozen in this crypto winter and the weather has been particularly cold in the aftermath of ftx s collapse although marathon digital is going about its business it s mining a cryptocurrency that few are eager about these days after market hours on tuesday the company issued its latest production and mining device installation update it said that in november it produced 472 bitcoin ending the month with a total of 4 200 in its possession as of dec 1 the company had roughly 69 000 actively producing mining rigs marathon digital said that its operations during the month were hampered by a curtailment at a mining site in texas this stoppage was due to a weather related spike in spot prices for energy at the site according to the company marathon digital added that it is working on optimizing curtailment strategies and site operations with the facility s new operator to improve its productivity at that location now what so marathon digital s weekly slide was due to a combination of traders being unenthusiastic about crypto and the news of its operational hiccup if the company finds a way to address the second issue one might expect some recovery in the share price but generally the current environment isn t ideal for cryptocurrencies and related assets
the company s latest financial engineering measure isn t being cheered by investors what happened u k based fintech paysafe nyse psfe had a lousy time on the u s exchange at the end of the week on friday the company s new york stock exchange listed stock took a 10 hit on some dispiriting news about the future of those shares so what just after market close on thursday paysafe announced that its board of directors has approved a reverse stock split the company will reverse split its common shares at a ratio of one new share for every 12 existing ones the move will be effective almost immediately after market close this coming monday dec 12 the freshly reverse split shares will begin trading the following day prior to the board s nod the company s latest piece of financial engineering was approved by shareholder vote at a special general meeting held on thursday the poll was overwhelmingly in favor of the measure with approval of over 95 while the reverse stock split didn t come as a surprise paysafe said in mid november that the relatively uncommon move would be put to a vote investors were nevertheless disheartened by the move a reverse stock split is frequently a strong signal that a company is at serious risk of having its shares delisted paysafe currently trades at barely over 1 per share now what it s important to note that any type of stock split reverse or standard does not change the market cap of the splitting party it only shifts the number of shares and their price additionally the motley fool s research indicates that stock splits have little or no long term effect on a company s share price rather this depends much more on fundamental factors and outside factors such as the state of the macroeconomy
example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video an ai art app faced increased scrutiny after it became popular online the company behind lensa is american not chinese though at least one other popular app is art generated by artificial intelligence has become the latest internet fad with several apps and websites producing stylized images based on photos uploaded by users some people though have been concerned about where the data uploaded to the sites is going who owns it and how it could be used for instance one viral tweet containing a tumblr post claimed a popular tool that makes anime style art is owned by the chinese company tencent and that the tech giant is also developing facial recognition software to be used by the chinese government to track down protesters the post surprised many users like one who replied wait that ai generator everyone was using was made by tencent likely referring to lensa the app that s been trending in the united states and has produced much of the viral ai generated content in recent weeks the question is lensa owned by the chinese company tencent the sources the answer no lensa is not owned by tencent however a different popular ai art tool different dimension me is what we found lensa is owned by an american company called prisma labs which is based in california but the original viral post is actually referring to another generator called different dimension me which takes photos and turns them into anime style images that one is owned by chinese company tencent it s hosted on qq com the messaging shopping and social media site tencent runs the viral post also goes on to claim that tencent has developed facial recognition technology that the chinese government is using to track down protesters so how much of that is true we know that tencent has facial recognition technology it in fact promotes it on its website it has also been widely reported that the chinese government uses face id tech to identify and track down protesters from crowds but whether tencent is involved in that process is unclear according to researchers at mit the company has collaborated with the chinese government in the past including on projects that involved tracking face data but no recent reports specifically tie the company to recent activity tracking down protesters
portsmouth point by thomas rowlandson 1814 given slang s hard wired identification with all things urban it s paradoxical at least at first glance how much the sea has come to register on its coinages but there it is and not just by chance the best incubators for slang are nailed down and shut tight inward looking and forced together willy nilly what john camden hotten termed the congregating together of people the result of crowding and excitement and artificial life the old slang collector cum purveyor of s m porn was thinking cities but they re not exclusive an external threat may help war is the obvious one 14 18 produced a vast increase in the slang vocabulary but there are alternatives worlds that are similarly closed and which generate their own languages among them is that of the sea which naturally means ships and they in turn mean sailors the influence of the sea on slang is thus worth more than just a glance this is not navy slang properly known if not that often as altumal and possibly from latin s altum mare the deep sea which is a whole other thing but the crossover from the watery world to the innately citified one of the counter language we must sadly sidestep such onboard characterizations as jemmy ducks who looked after the poultry jack dusty the stores assistant the dust being flour and jack nastyface the cook s number two gone too must be jimmy round a frenchman from je me rends i surrender and attributed to the napoleonic wars there are for starters the words that mean sailor there are 23 jacks in slang which probably makes it the biggest creator of homonyms in the lexis but only one counts here the one that abbreviates jack tar which refers to the old habit of smearing your breeches with that sticky liquid repellent substance in a primitive effort at waterproofing it also comes as jackie john and jackshite the image also gave tarpaulin plus tar and tarry breeks or tarry jacket which implied a man who had quite literally got his hands dirty learning the job and hadn t merely got there through connections breeks began as white and his jacket as blue and thus the bluejacket he roamed the sea which gave lagger and lag cull both from lag water and was thus piscine the scaly fish who was tough the otter and the sea crab which may have reflected a well known ballad featuring the crab a chamberpot and the suggestion that one had best look within before squatting he went shoeless which gave flatfoot obsessively washed down the decks thus swab and swab jockey and allegedly spat to excess thus gob from gob a clot of slimy substance he often fought the french but still borrowed their matelot though spelled it matlow as village people fans will recall the sailor is a popular gay sex object and usually twinned with something one might eat known as sea food he was also a blueberry pie lobster pot sea pussy and specifying his penis a piece of salt water taffy the uk s rock the sea itself tends to rhyming slang housmaid s knee coffee and tea river lea plus the briny and the jokily miniaturizingpuddle pond and ditch sailors meanwhile opt for oggin which in terms of sailing oneflogs the oggin as a selection of its many literary appearances makes clear is large deep wet and while a necessary given for the naval personnel who coined the term seems to suggest greater duty than pleasure safe on land the lubber may extol it the sailor merely falls in and does not invariably emerge one thing unites them ignorance of its origins the etymology of the word that is one belief is that sailors universally unable to pronounce ocean called it oggin this is a calumny and may surely be dismissed wilfred granville in his 1949 collection of sea slang suggests an abbreviation of hogwash which started off life meaning brewery swill which was fed to the pigs and thence bad beer or wine and indeed tea and in time and figuratively nonsense the oed as of 2004 rejects this but a link remains however tenuous one might feel it hogwash can mean drink one of the slang terms for the sea is the drink a noggin is a drink and before that a small drinking vessel oxford s suggestion therefore is of a play on noggin altered to oggin by metanalysis the same phenomenon that once saw words such as nangry and nanger not to mention the sansrkit nāraṅga which via arabic naranj and italian narancia gives english orange which is where absent alternative theories it must be left all that remains is a song the tune will be self evident if the skipper fell into the oggin if the skipper fell into the sea if the skipper fell into the oggin he d get sod all lifebelt from me but enough with water let us turn to alcohol not especially as drunk by jack ashore a compound that has illumined all manner of self indulgence ever since its appearance around 1860 but in slang s cheerful borrowing of seaborne imagery to denote that happy state wherein one is all at sea there is the basic drunk as a sailor or as a gosport fiddler which

under the table into his companions shoes the girls came off the streets of london after the street offences act of 1959 and their disappearance has done nothing for slang coinage the ratcliff highway london docklands homegrown sodom and gomorrah whose taverns and tarts saw for as many seafarers as ever did the ocean has long since fallen silent the ubiquitous ho may be accurate albeit bereft of a few letters but it hardly sets the juices flowing it was not always thus and the sea given jack s recreational partialities played its part all too aware of her dubious allure he called her a land pirate usually a highwayman but that didn t hold him back not for nothing are ships invariably she there are the basic ships the schooner the pinnace the privateer and the land carrack all these are relatively lightweight in terms of tonnage and punnage too the larger battleship is invariably old plain and dismissed as unalluring light as in unable to keep her heels on the ground is an old term for a loose woman the tilt boat playing with tilt as in falling over sustains the idea then we meet the light frigate double punning both on her sailing the streets and on the term frig from latin fricare to rub and meaning both to have sex and to jerk off oneself or a client the frigate comes in two flavours the frigate well rigged who is neatly fashionably dressed and the frigate on fire a specimen of hot stuff who is suffering some form of std best though rarely avoided she can also be a fireship setting aside rhyming slang s boat and oar barge which suggests a certain embonpoint and scupper into which one tosses unwanted waste thus linking to the use of crud muck scum and slime for semen we find hooker undoubtedly one of prostitution s leading synonyms and productive of a variety of back stories popular etymology suggests the denizens of corlear s hook known as the hook a red light area on the new york city waterfront there is also the city s use of hooker a tug that cruised to pick up incoming schooners off sandy hook and the sailor s affectionate nickname hooker for any vessel the link to corlear s hook is sanctified by bartlett s dictionary of americanisms 1859 which defines hooker as a resident of the hook i e a strumpet a sailor s trull on the other hand the memoirs of the ex madam nell kimball stated the moniker hooker came about in the civil war general joe hooker a handsome figure of a man was a real quif hunter and he spent a lot of time in the houses of the redlight district so that people began to call the district hooker s division sounds good yes but the term is thirty years older in the end like much slang the origin is probably a tweak of standard english in this case hook to catch to lure to entice but with strong reinforcement from both the new york city location and the sailor s nickname but monetary exchange is not mandatory looking back at some of the sea based novels produced around 1800 focused on what was still an unreformed navy the punning on naval jargon reaches near carry on proportions the post captain 1805 the components of the ship herself or the old bitch as she is sometimes termed are a ready source the cathead for instance is officially a protruding spar that keeps the anchor away from the superstructure there are two one per side the bow we know is the front of the ship and the stern its antithesis the post captain or the wooden walls well manned written in 1805 and as such the first of these works gives us dialogues such as these faith hurricane our lady passenger is a fine girl she has a good pair of cat heads yes sir she is nice and bluff about the bows though her stern goes unremarked later we also find this the captain is speaking to the 1st lieutenant about to go below to sleep with his wife women legitimate or otherwise being far from invisible onboard in this era mr hurricane bear a hand and get your anchor a cock bill it already hangs by the stopper my shank painter is let go and i have roused up a good range of cable on deck then let go the anchor how the knowledgeable must have sniggered not only the anchor which phallically dangles there is the bobstay a rope which holds

sailors were one of first occupational groups to be attributed a distinctive speech style smollett s roderick random offers lieut tom bowling described as a scoundrel of a seaman who has deserted and turned thief this is backed up lexically and bowling offers such as rigg d for dressed shake cloth in the wind for hurry up and don t lag astern you dog slang owes the sea a good deal other terms include these to be adrift loose and turned adrift all mean to be discharged from work to bring your arse to anchor sit down bring someone to their bearings to bring them to their senses cant a slug

lost but there are suggestion of the intensifier ker and scots loot a lout the deliberate mispronunciation ossifer seems also to have originated on board lubber seems to come from old french lobeor a swindler or parasite and of course leads to land lubber a landsman or incompetent sailor the clumsiness implicit in the nautical use implies a further link to lob a country bumpkin some parts are more

thus anchor and prop a stickpin with a safety catch that anchors it to the tie one s home one s address a younger relation or other small child who holds one back from social life in phrases to bring oneself to an anchor was to sit down to drag one s anchor to go slowly or to idle though the simple drop anchor means to defecate to swallow the anchor means both to stop doing something and to give oneself up to the police meanwhile to drop anchor in bum bay refers to that portion of churchill s epitome that was neither rum nor the lash let us conclude with food here we do step on board but some things are just too tasty to miss sailor s food irresistible only lexically what s for pud boiled baby rations came down to two words biscuits and beef though any meat that could be salted e g pork served muster all might have to endure multiple atlantic crossings before the barrel was finally opened and the meat after soaking consumed the first were of tooth snapping solidity the second was salted and not to be confused with what modern america terms corned beef from the corns of salt used in its curing and reaches its acme when paired with a bagel the first were known as hard tack the second as salt junk the hard was self evident tack comes either from another piece of self description standard english tack a quality of binding or solidity and is thus linked to tacky sticky or from the pleasingly nautical tackle which in this context is generic for food bread which would be brown and not only because of its inevitable population of weevils was tommy or soft tommy soft that is in comparison to the biscuits which was a poor pun on tommy brown if you soaked your hard tack in water and baked it with fat and molasses it became dandyfunk daddyfunk or dunderfunk and may represent a mixture of dandy a sloop and funk a stench though the link is unexplained salt junk plus old or tough junk which was dried and salted beef or pork played on the nautical jargon junk old or second rate cable or rope and possibly nodded to standard junk a lump or chunk the old rope imagery lead naturally to a sailor staple rope yarn stew from rope yarn properly used for twisting up into ropes alongside this was twice laid literally describing rope made from a selection of the best yarns of old rope this dish was made of the salt fish left from yesterday s dinner and beaten up with potatoes

pre packed and blessed with a new name canned willie the us army similarly provisioned called it corned bill why willie the obvious coarse etymology doesn t stand up that willie doesn t come on stream till the 1960s and this was established by the late 19th century canned willie remains mysterious and memoirs suggest inedible it might of course have been eponymous perhaps there was a hapless anecdote laden willie there certainly was a sweet fanny adams which does not only mean the landsman s dismissive nothing but to sailors denoted tinned mutton the blackly humorous nickname was based on the brutal murder and dismemberment of eight year old fanny adams at alton hampshire on 24 august 1867 the murderer one frederick baker was hanged at winchester on christmas eve and 5 000 spectators watched the execution there was also a real life harriet lane borrowed by the usn to mean chopped tinned meat in this case the reference was to harriet lane the victim and wife of the murderer henry wainwright executed 1875 coincidentally the uss harriet lane launched 1857 was commanded by one jonathan wainwright who was killed on board her during the us civil war the ship however was named for the niece of president james buchanan the modern navy offers a single anthropomorphism baby s head a steak and kidney pudding in which the smooth pastry rises like a shiny infant head it will not be

that came with a pastry crust there was more the unappetisingly named slumgullion or slum was defined by the slang collector as mean fish offal or other refuse and even more gruesome the watery refuse mixed with blood and oil which drains from blubber but even sailors were not expected to consume that loblolly can be traced to the 16th century it was a thick gruel choked down by peasants as wells as sailors and sometimes doubled as a simple medicine the word may be no more than echoic the sound of the thick gruel bubbling in a pot alternatively or maybe additionally it reflects a dialect term lob to bubble while boiling especially of a thick substance like porridge and the devonian lolly broth soup or other food boiled in a pot on shore the word has also meant a country bumpkin a weakling and in the us a mudhole and a fat child the loblolly boy was a junior crew member irrespective of weight who ran errands for his seniors burgoo and skillygalee are the equivalents of scotland s porridge and ireland s stirabout in all cases oatmeal boiled in water the former sailor and novelist captain marryat called it very wholesome more enterprising cooks threw in meat and veg the literary publican ned ward in 1704 cited it along with red herring and dried whiting as the dutchman s favourite food and once picked up by landsmen in kentucky burgoo became the basis of 19th century burgoo feasts british soldiers used it as a synonym for porridge the roots lie in arabic burgul cooked parched and cracked wheat as for skillygalee it defeats the etymologists and reached a greater fame as the echt workhouse prison sludge skilly often paired with toke i e bread it was this that no doubt induced poor oliver to make his celebrated request jack london described it as a fluid concoction of three quarts of oatmeal stirred into three buckets and a half of hot water while a tramp told orwell that it was a can o hot water wid some bloody oatmeal at de bottom lob dominion two buckets of water and an old shoe was equally tasteless and equally disinclined to confess to an origin some of these probably tasted good or at least they masked the basic ingredients where lack of flavour was balanced only by a garnish of unwanted species of insect life one definitely didn t this was soup and bouilli thus characterised by william clark russell in his lexicon of sailors language 1883 soup and bouilli taking it all round is the most disgusting of the provisions served out to the merchant sailor i have known many a strong stomach made food proof by years of pork eaten with molasses and biscuit alive with worms to be utterly capsised by the mere smell of soup and bouilli jack calls it soap and bullion one onion to a gallon of water and this fairly expresses the character of the nauseous compound it is however the same bouilli that graces the traditional french kitchen pieces of beef being simmered with vegetables to create a savoury stock and that which lies behind bully beef itself a variation on canned willie more palatable surely was pillau made of salt beef fowl rice and onions all cooked together indeed it sounds almost too good for the tars and may have been

grapeland on the same day that 2 million residents in the nation s fourth most populous city faced a boil water notice that garnered national attention a water system near this tiny east texas town issued similar warnings to customers marking the 68th boil water notice issued this calendar year and while houstonians responded to the news by scrambling to stock up on bottled water customers of the consolidated water supply corp proceeded as usual we ve had problems with the water since we ve been here said david wilshusen a 69 year old retired construction worker who has lived in an unincorporated area about a mile outside of grapeland s city limits for more than two decades you ll be having a shower and then all of a sudden where s the water aging infrastructure coupled with inflation driving up costs of supplies has left texas water infrastructure increasingly brittle this year there have been at least 2 457 boil water notices issued across the state an average of seven per day according to an analysis by the texas tribune of data from the texas commission on environmental quality seven of the 10 water entities that issued the most notices are in rural east texas of the remaining three two serve rural parts of north central texas the only agency to serve more than 50 000 people is the city of killeen about 70 miles north of austin which has a population of 156 260 people the complete picture of boil water notices is unclear the state s environmental agency relies on each water district to self report when they issue warnings which can cause the data to be incomplete officials say emil lippe the texas tribune an american flag hangs on the wall of a building in grapeland the small houston county town has its own water system near grapeland the consolidated water supply corp provides water to 5 586 households mostly in unincorporated sparsely populated areas of east texas that are heavily forested according to their internal data they lead the state in boil water notices this year with about six boil water notices per month according to the company s general manager amber stelly though the state environmental agency has only tracked 50 of those notices the city of austin by comparison has issued three boil water notices this year wilshusen the retired construction worker and his wife don t even bother to keep track of when they are or are not under a boil water notice last week they had heard about houston s boil water notice but weren t aware of their own consolidated alerts customers of boil water notices on their website but some customers lack reliable broadband access the company also shares information about boil water notices on the local radio station each morning and customers can sign up to receive alerts through email or text an option some customers are not aware of consolidated is very quick to text me when my bill is due but they can t text me and say you re under a boil water notice wilshusen said wilshusen relies on bottled water buying five cases of ozarka from the nearby brookshire brothers express grocery store each month he stacks the cases on and around a wooden chair in his kitchen pulling bottles out each day until the supply runs out wilshusen worries his hydration system won t last forever he is aging and is not sure how much longer he ll be able to lug the heavy cases of water into his home i m not a spring chicken anymore wilshusen joked he s considering drilling a well on his property emil lippe the texas tribune david wilshusen outside his home in houston county boil notices don t always mean contaminated water water service interruptions that trigger boil water notices can happen for a number of reasons this ranges from bad weather conditions a malfunction in the system or even human error and they are not always a sign of contamination that could endanger public health perry fowler executive director of the texas water infrastructure network said the notification systems could be improved so the public understands what is happening public utilities have a need to ensure that the public is informed and that they re safe they have an obligation to do that fowler said maybe there s room to have a notice that if it s a lower severity or lower public health risk where you re not going to have people scared to death about using their water in killeen residents have received 57 boil water notices this year kent cagle the city manager said the notices are largely related to development in the community as fiber is being installed on every street and water lines have been hit during construction most of our boil water notices only affect a half block or a few houses cagle said adding that it happens more in older areas of town to lower the risk of citywide boil notices cagle said the city has put water infrastructure needs in its operating budget without raising taxes we will have it where on an annual basis we replace the oldest water and sewer lines cagle said the majority of the consolidated water supply corp s boil water notices stem from system pressures falling below minimum requirements because of maintenance issues such as leaks and power outages stelly said though low water pressure doesn t in itself mean harmful bacteria is present it can be a threat to public health low water pressure can cause water to flow in the wrong direction and allow soil and other contaminants to enter drinking water the maintenance issues they face come in part from aging infrastructure texas water systems are old and some original pipes and frameworks have been used for more than 50 years i don t know why they won t go through and just revamp the whole entire system by putting in new pipes and everything said emily jones 74 who lives in an unincorporated area of houston county which includes grapeland jones said she and her husband drink bottled water only revamping a community s water system isn t easy fowler said it s a project that could take millions of dollars and a strong workforce two resources that rural communities are lacking despite the growing need for rural infrastructure according to a survey of utility companies conducted by the texas water infrastructure network a trade association that represents texas companies involved in water infrastructure 48 of utilities said their top investment priority next year is water and wastewater treatment another 30 listed water line repair or replacement as their top priority it s very expensive and in some cases the problems may be bigger than they re prepared to handle fowler said while the texas water development board appointed by the governor to support regional water plans does offer financial assistance for certain projects through the infrastructure investment and jobs act nearly 62 of utility companies surveyed did not apply for funding the water infrastructure network said some companies noted it s because the application and administrative process is too cumbersome fowler said it s up to both local and state governments to ensure they have the adequate funds they need to get the projects going it s not a mystery what we need to do but it takes political courage to go out and say what you need to be able to invest in your systems fowler said there s an obligation for local communities to have funding and there s a role the state plays to ensure they re providing the means to have affordable investments in water why rural texas struggles to keep up its infrastructure the struggle rural areas face to improve their water infrastructure has been compounded by drought inflation and a lack of human resources needed to apply for government aid officials say this year texas has experienced its worst drought since 2011 which has also contributed to infrastructure issues extended periods of drought can cause the foundation to shift and crack when rainfall comes the foundation lifts the water lines with it causing breaks consolidated water supply corp serves most of rural houston county along with parts of anderson county and walker counties in east texas the sprawling system includes 66 tanks 27 pressure planes and over 1 2 miles of distribution pipe per meter stelly said that with pipe and pvc prices on the rise due to inflation line replacement is cost prohibitive with material prices and loan interest rates on the rise we are instead focusing efforts on early leak detection and less invasive repairs she said grapeland a city of about 1 500 people has its own water system public works director kevin watts said that coupled with aging infrastructure small towns tend to offer low wages to their employees which makes it difficult to hire skilled workers you get people running your city infrastructure who most of the time aren t educated watts said sometimes they don t even have licenses they are working under someone else s state rep trent ashby a lufkin republican said the legislature should step in to support rural communities while urban and suburban areas enjoy the resources and technical expertise to secure state funding for water infrastructure and improvement projects rural water suppliers often lack the resources and expertise needed to navigate the complex bureaucracy of the state water funding process he said in a statement both the u s department of agriculture and the texas water development board have opportunities for funding but rural systems face barriers federal programs are typically loans and smaller entities lack the necessary rates to be able to repay loans said jason knobloch deputy executive director of the texas rural water association and they also don t have the administrative resources to fill out grant applications these utilities don t have the wherewithal to go through these tedious processes knobloch said and it s not efficient to take out a 2 million loan as boil water notices continue to pop up around all areas of texas fowler said he hopes more people are taking notice of how important reliable water infrastructure is when you re looking at millions of dollars in needs fowler said the fact that water drives our economy should make it a priority for everyone disclosure texas rural water association has been a financial supporter of the texas tribune a nonprofit nonpartisan news organization that is funded

an ai art app faced increased scrutiny after it became popular online the company behind lensa is american not chinese though at least one other popular app is example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video art generated by artificial intelligence has become the latest internet fad with several apps and websites producing stylized images based on photos uploaded by users some people though have been concerned about where the data uploaded to the sites is going who owns it and how it could be used for instance one viral tweet containing a tumblr post claimed a popular tool that makes anime style art is owned by the chinese company tencent and that the tech giant is also developing facial recognition software to be used by the chinese government to track down protesters the post surprised many users like one who replied wait that ai generator everyone was using was made by tencent likely referring to lensa the app that s been trending in the united states and has produced much of the viral ai generated content in recent weeks the question is lensa owned by the chinese company tencent the sources the answer no lensa is not owned by tencent however a different popular ai art tool different dimension me is what we found lensa is owned by an american company called prisma labs which is based in california but the original viral post is actually referring to another generator called different dimension me which takes photos and turns them into anime style images that one is owned by chinese company tencent it s hosted on qq com the messaging shopping and social media site tencent runs the viral post also goes on to claim that tencent has developed facial recognition technology that the chinese government is using to track down protesters so how much of that is true we know that tencent has facial recognition technology it in fact promotes it on its website it has also been widely reported that the chinese government uses face id tech to identify and track down protesters from crowds but whether tencent is involved in that process is unclear according to researchers at mit the company has collaborated with the chinese government in the past including on projects that involved tracking face data but no recent reports specifically tie the company to recent activity tracking down protesters

as flu season continues representatives from mu health care and boone hospital said they re seeing a larger demand for antibiotics as a result some local pharmacies are struggling to keep them in stock kilgore s medical pharmacy is one of three columbia pharmacies experiencing shortages the pharmacist in charge at kilgore s said for the past month amoxicillin hasn t been staying on the shelves for long that shortage has led to shortages of other antibiotics bill morrissey lead pharmacist said because when that one s not available the doctor switches to a different one and then we run out of that one also the pharmacy and mu health says the capsule form of amoxicillin isn t experiencing a shortage but because most children younger than age of 12 struggle swallowing pills parents turn to the oral suspension form of the drug it s not quite as liquid as a syrup but is easier for younger children to swallow you have parents who just want to take care of their kiddos morrissey said being a parent i fully understand that you want to you know in your mind do everything you can for your child so we try to find it call other pharmacies even if it s not a kilgore pharmacy and try to find it for them this year three respiratory illnesses have hit the nation influenza rsv and covid 19 the demand for antibiotics has followed a similar spread reaching across most of missouri the kansas city mayor quinton lucas tweeted a photo of nearly empty pharmacy shelves on monday because of the shortages pharmacists have to get creative morrissey said switching to other types of antibiotics or using the powder inside capsules the pharmacy has made due with its lack of amoxicillin for those who can t find a specific kind of medicine he said you should still ask it s not like there s only one antibiotic in the world morrissey added just ask questions and ask them to try to help you find a solution because that s what we re here for a representative from the missouri department of health said shortages like these usually happen at the manufacturer s level kilgore s added the pharmacy got a new shipment of amoxicillin friday afternoon
capital region congressman paul tonko is pushing legislation that would crack down on grinch bots computer programs that automatically buy up popular products including the hottest holiday toys the stopping grinch bots act named after dr seuss s notorious christmas stealing character is designed to halt the programs that can drive up the prices of hard to find toys each december congressman paul tonko stumped for the bill at heroes hideout a collector s store at the colonie center mall in colonie you know this manipulative effort to drive the prices upward and consume all the maximum numbers that they can is very hurtful to the consumer and certainly hurtful to business said tonko the legislation is modeled after a law passed in 2016 to crack down on similar price gouging on concert tickets the democrat from new york s 20th district is on the energy and commerce committee he says the new bill would apply to more than just holiday presents the pandemic showed that bots can be quickly adapted to exploit any market inefficiency with products including n95 masks and hand sanitizer being popular targets of bot attacks when supplies were low said tonko grinch bots can make things difficult for retailers especially those who stock collectible goods surrounded by rows of action figures plush toys and thousands of funko pop bobbleheads that resemble everything from huckleberry hound to snoop dogg heroes hideout owner steve duckett said his business relies on collectors selling or trading their toys i have direct accounts with everybody so funko hasbro mattel everybody then what we do is we buy collections from customers who are looking to sell off their collections that s really where we get affected is because they paid a higher premium for an item that really probably wasn t worth that much so they expect that return when they come to us said duckett according to duckett grinch bots can affect customers expectations and hurt his businesses reputation grinch bots aren t taking everything but they re taking a lot so unfortunately if we have that item that they couldn t get they think we participated even though we didn t so that s one thing we deal with said duckett and then it s an easy excuse too for the customer so like they ll say if something goes online and they can t get it oh it was a bot mark eagan president of the capital region chamber of commerce appeared alongside duckett in support of the legislation this christmas vendors that use the grinch bots should receive nothing other than coal in their stockings said eagan the bill has support in the senate too including from democratic majority leader chuck schumer of new york in the meantime tonko has already written to the chair of the federal trade commission asking it to take additional steps to protect consumers from grinch bots and to provide feedback to help inform members of congress on ways to finetune the legislation look let s have a happy holiday season and let s make certain the grinch doesn t spoil any of that season and that when children write that letter to santa that santa can deliver said tonko
bing jhen hong istock editorial via getty images investment thesis shortly after my recent comparison of intel corporation intc and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited nyse tsm tsmc the latter is already confirming my thesis that intel will be the new king of the hill going forward by announcing a 40b investment in a newâ trailing edge fab in arizona since tsmc will already have lost its process leadership by 2026 opening a tsmc n 1 fab in arizona means that this will represent an n 2 fab compared to the leading edge so despite statements of endorsement by the likes of apple aapl advanced micro devices amd and nvidia nvda tsmc s endeavor to internationalize its manufacturing footprint is just a breadcrumb with intel remaining the sole provider of leading edge foundry services in the u s and e u arizona fab updates recently two news items regarding tsmcâ s arizona fab project were announced first it was reported that tsmc â likely due to customer request from apple â had â upgradedâ its plans for its first arizona fab this fab was announced a few years ago as a 5nm fab scheduled to become operational in 2024 however the new reports and confirmed by tsmc indicate that tmsc is planning to produce 4nm chips instead the significance of this is minute already since the initial announcement it was known that 5nm would be trailing edge technology by 2024 the â upgradeâ to 4nm hasnâ t changed any of this since tsmcâ s 4nm delivers a â whoppingâ 6 shrink over 5nm making it simply a small derivative node of the 5nm technology before the nanometer marketing wars this derivative node would have been called something like 5nm see for example this slide for a few of the different 28nm derivatives the second announcement was that there will be a second fab with the total arizona investment increasing from 12b to 40b the second fab will begin operations in 2026 and it will be a node more advanced producing 3nm this will improve the total capacity from 240k wafers to 600k wafers per year however the issue remains that tsmc continues to invest in trailing edge capacity in the u s its new 5nm fab will be an n 2 fab in 2024 because intel will have 20a 2nm by then the second fab will be one node more advanced but also two years later which means intel will have 14a by then barring any delays obviously maintaining the status quo of the arizona fab being two nodes behind despite the multitude of endorsements from the likes of apple et al and despite the tsmc press release stating that it is bringing â leading edgeâ manufacturing capacity to the u s the reality is that it is not nevertheless for some silver lining tsmc said that the fab will generate 10b revenue per year given the wafer output mentioned above this implies an average wafer price of around 17k while some commentary said that this fab will only add a low single digit fraction to tsmcâ s global manufacturing capacity given that it will produce relatively leading edge capacity compared to older fabs such as 180nm it could contribute a nearly double digit percentage of tsmcâ s total revenue assuming tsmcâ s revenue grows to over 100b by then which is still respectable for just two fabs competitive implications while surely in 2026 all the above companies will still be selling 3nm products since n2 production is only starting in q4â 25 which implies the first n2 iphone will launch in the fall of 2026 overall tsmc now seems to be taking a page from the intel playbook of the last several years by investing in trailing edge fabs so as intel itself is an example of history suggests that this is simply not a winning strategy overall this is significantly shifting the winning cards to intel in the case that all the above companies remain tsmc customers then as mentioned above intel will be two nodes ahead in terms of u s based manufacturing technology for those to whom n3 vs 14a seems like a minor difference note that all the damage amd has done to intel in the data center was with a process advantage of a bit over 1 node 14nm vs 7nm which in terms of density is approx a 2 4x difference of course these companies will surely still buy wafers manufactured from taiwan but those will also be a node behind n2 vs 14a which still confirms the thesis of intel being the new king of the hill in any case if any company decides to go shopping for a leading edge foundry in the u s due to geopolitical reasons although there admittedly isn t much evidence this is major driver although intel has disclosed it is now engaged with 7 of the top 10 foundry customers then intel should emerge as the clear winner risks given that this article discussed 2026 there is still quite some uncertainty despite intel not having experienced any further process delays for well over two years now many people continue to doubt intelâ s ability to execute still given that intel is currently having 18a test chips in the fabs even if 14a gets delayed then intel would still be at parity with tsmc overall or one node ahead compared to tsmcâ s u s fabs another â riskâ is that unless the geopolitics worsen significantly ultimately there is no reason why companies such as apple wouldnâ t continue to buy tsmc wafers made in taiwan which will be one node more advanced than its wafers from the u s put differently it is unlikely that any company will start its chip development process like this â weâ re going to manufacture this new chip in the u s letâ s decide the best u s foundry for this chip â although this does fit into the general theme that tsmc is simply jumping onto the chips act bandwagon to build fabs in the u s even if they are not state of the art fabs lastly though there is no fundamental reason why tmsc couldnâ t either build a leading edge fab or upgrade for example the 5nm one to its latest process tech down the line investor takeaway ultimately the impact of the new arizona fab s will be rather small while the second fab will make the overall capacity a bit more respectable the majority of tsmcâ s capacity will still be located in taiwan this is especially the case for tsmcâ s leading edge capacity for comparison one of the initial criticisms or concerns about intelâ s foundry effort with intel foundry services started in 2021 was that it represented a trailing edge foundry which hence would have difficulty attracting fabless customers by 2026 the same could be said about tsmc instead an n 2 fab will only be moderately interesting as it will not be able to make the chips that the likes of apple amd or nvidia would want or at least have to produce in order to offer industry performance and power leadership simply put when someone like tim cook has to decide on where to source its 2026 u s wafer capacity from tsmc is not making this a hard decision i would predict that none of the major m and a series chips apple announces in 2026 will be manufactured in the arizona tsmc fab that is not to say this tsmc fab will be completely useless for example one of the reasons intel acquired tower was to offer a complete trailing to leading edge process portfolio nevertheless that is still different from purposely investing in a brand new n 1 fab so overall the new announcement hasn t changed the thesis i remain moderately bullish on tsmc mostly simply due to the favorable valuation
