the federal reserve has a simple inflation fighting playbook it goes like this keep applying upward pressure on interest rates until business and consumer spending across the economy weakens and inflation recedes historically speaking the fed s inflation fighting playbook always delivers a particularly hard hit to the us housing market when it comes to housing transactions monthly payments are everything and when mortgage rates spike which happens as soon as the fed goes after inflation those payments spike for new borrowers that explains why soon as mortgage rates rose this spring the housing market slipped into a steep housing correction but that housing correction could soon lose some steam over the past week mortgage rates have declined rapidly as of tuesday the average 30 year fixed mortgage rate sits at 5 05 down from june when mortgage rates peaked at 6 28 those falling mortgage rates give sidelined homebuyers immediate relief if a borrower in june took out a 500 000 mortgage at a 6 28 rate they d pay 3 088 monthly in principal and interest at a 5 05 rate that payment would be just 2 699 over the course of the 30 year loan that s a savings of 140 000 what s going on ass weakening economic data rolls in financial markets are pricing in a 2023 recession that s putting downward pressure on mortgage rates the bond market is pricing in a high probability of a recession next year and that the downturn will prompt the fed to reverse course and cut rates mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics tells fortune while the fed does not directly set mortgage rates its policies do impact how financial markets price both the 10 year treasury yield and mortgage rates in anticipation of a rising federal funds rate and monetary tightening financial markets increase both the 10 year treasury yield and mortgage rates in anticipation of a reduced federal funds rate and monetary easing financial markets price down both the 10 year treasury yield and mortgage rates the latter is what we re seeing now in financial markets as mortgage rates spiked earlier this year tens of millions of americans lost their mortgage eligibility however as mortgage rates begin to slide millions of americans are regaining access to mortgages that s why so many real estate professionals are cheering on lower mortgage rates it should help to increase home buying activity while lower mortgage rates will undoubtedly prompt more sideline buyers to return to open houses don t pencil in the end of the housing correction just yet the bottom line is the recent decline in mortgage rates will help at the margin but the housing market will remain under pressure with mortgage rates at 5 fewer sales slowing house price growth wrote bill mcbride author of the economics blog calculated risk in his tuesday newsletter the reason even with the 1 percentage point drop in mortgage rates housing affordability remains historically low if we include the increase in house prices payments are up more than 50 year over year on the same home writes mcbride there s another reason housing bulls shouldn t get too overconfident if recession fears which are helping to drive mortgage rates lower are correct it would cause some additional weakening in the sector if someone is afraid of losing their job they re not going to jump into the housing market while lower rates by themselves are a positive for housing that isn t the case when accompanied by a recession and quickly rising unemployment zandi tells fortune where will mortgage rates head from here researchers at bank of america believe there s a chance that the 10 year treasury yield could slip from 2 7 to 2 0 over the coming 12 months that could make mortgage rates fall to between 4 and 4 5 the trajectory of mortgage rates correlates closely with the trajectory of the 10 year treasury yield but there s a big wild card the federal reserve the fed clearly wants to slow down the housing market the pandemic housing boom during which home prices soared 42 and homebuilding hit a 16 year high has been among the drivers of sky high inflation reduced home sales and a decline in homebuilding should provide relief for the overstressed us supply of housing we re already seeing it plummeting housing starts is translating into reduced demand for everything from framing lumber to cabinets to windows but if mortgage rates fall too quickly a rebounding housing market could mess up the fed s inflation fight if that happens the fed has more than enough monetary fire power to once again put upward pressure on mortgage rates whether we are technically in a recession or not doesn t change my analysis i m focused on the inflation data and so far inflation continues to surprise us to the upside neel kashkari president of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis told cbs on sunday we are committed to bringing inflation down and we re going to do what we need to do want to stay updated on the housing recession follow me on twitter at newslambert

for decades donald trump has boasted with impunity about a subject close to his heart and ego his net worth i look better if i m worth 10 billion than if i m worth 4 billion he once said when disputing his ranking on the forbes billionaires list in a court case he acknowledged that when it came to describing the value of his brand i m as accurate as i think i can be and when he described his self aggrandizing style in his book the art of the deal he chose a phrase that has followed him ever since truthful hyperbole but now trump will face questions under oath about that pattern of embellishment in an investigation that may shape the future of his family real estate business the former president and his eldest daughter ivanka trump are expected to be questioned later this month by the new york state attorney general s office which has been conducting a civil investigation into whether he and his company fraudulently inflated the value of his assets his son donald trump jr was interviewed last week according to people with knowledge of the matter the attorney general letitia james has argued in court papers that fraudulent or misleading business practices reigned at the trump organization for years and she has said her investigators must question the trumps to determine who was responsible trump fought hard to avoid an interview but a judge ordered him to face questioning and investigators will seek to elicit answers that might reveal whether he approved any bogus valuations of his hotels golf clubs and other assets even a single misstep in the deposition could be costly for trump who is also the focus of a separate criminal investigation into the same issues although that investigation by the manhattan district attorney s office lost momentum early this year prosecutors are planning to review trump s answers and any incriminating statements or clumsy comments could breathe new life into it trump has derided james inquiry as a politically motivated witch hunt and denied all wrongdoing the former president who is no stranger to being deposed will present unusual challenges and opportunities for james lawyers according to accounts from people who have questioned him under oath in the past and a review of nearly a dozen depositions he is quick to spar with his inquisitors and often struggles to restrain himself once telling a lawyer that her questions were very stupid letitia james the new york attorney general has been conducting a civil investigation into former president donald trump s family business the deposition comes at a precarious moment for trump who is facing increasing legal scrutiny for his effort to overturn the 2020 election federal prosecutors investigating the jan 6 attack on the capitol are asking witnesses about him a house committee has uncovered new details about his conduct in the wake of the election and a district attorney in georgia has convened a grand jury to look into possible election interference by trump and his allies the interviews will mark the final stage of james three year civil inquiry teeing up one of the most consequential decisions of her tenure whether to sue trump and his company james facing the likelihood that a lawsuit would bring several more years of legal wrangling without victory assured could first pursue settlement negotiations with the former president s lawyers to extract a swifter financial payout if james does bring a lawsuit and trump loses at trial a judge could impose steeper financial penalties on the former president and even restrict his business operations in new york all in the midst of a 2024 presidential campaign that he has long hinted he will join james a democrat running for reelection has assumed the role of trump s chief antagonist in new york and in recent months she has adopted an unusually aggressive legal strategy including persuading a judge arthur f engoron to hold the former president in contempt of court as she battled to obtain his documents and testimony the depositions while a victory for james might not deliver a smoking gun trump could assert that he delegated the valuation of his assets to employees and that he was not deeply involved or he could invoke his constitutional right against self incrimination declining to answer at least some questions but people familiar with trump s approach to legal battles expressed doubt that he would keep quiet unlike in criminal cases a jury in civil cases like the one james might bring can draw a negative inference from a defendant s refusal to answer questions and if trump relies on his fifth amendment privilege as his son eric trump did hundreds of times in an interview with james office two years ago that could raise questions about what he might be seeking to hide and provide fresh fodder for his political opponents trump himself has ridiculed witnesses for invoking their fifth amendment rights once remarking that you see the mob takes the fifth and that if you re innocent why are you taking the fifth amendment james inquiry centers on whether trump s annual financial statements were a work of fiction a vehicle for exaggerating the value of his real estate so that he could secure favorable loans and other financial benefits james who has said that trump got caught using funny numbers in his financial documents is examining whether trump and his company used inflated valuations to mislead banks and the irs in challenging james trump s legal team would be likely to argue that he was entitled to some leeway in valuing his real estate a process that is widely viewed as more art than science trump s financial statements contained disclaimers that the value of his properties had not been audited or authenticated trump s lawyers might also argue that the banks that received his financial statements were hardly victims these lenders made millions of dollars from their dealings with trump who recently paid off some of his largest loans any lawsuit james might bring could have some holes as well trump famously does not use email so any directions he might have given his employees about drafting the financial statements were probably not in writing donald trump jr and ivanka trump looked on as their father then president donald trump spoke at a rally in dalton ga on jan 4 2020 trump is no novice when it comes to facing questions under oath having navigated numerous depositions in private lawsuits throughout his half century in the public spotlight when asked in 2012 how many depositions he had participated in trump perhaps hyperbolically put the number at over 100 yet the stakes are higher this time with trump facing scrutiny not from private lawyers but government investigators a relatively rare occurrence for the former president while trump responded to questions from the special counsel robert mueller he did so only in writing and unlike mueller who did not examine trump s personal finances james lawyers have spent three years investigating the minutiae of his company s operations if past depositions are any guide trump will be likely to strike a combative tone with james lawyers while portraying himself as the unwitting victim of a vindictive legal opponent he might also lob the occasional insult at his interviewers in a 2011 deposition he called a female lawyer disgusting after she requested a break to pump breast milk for her daughter and displayed the pump to illustrate her point that apparent lack of discipline could work to james advantage lawyers who have deposed him said trump thinks of himself as his own best advocate and might ignore advice from his attorneys to avoid directly answering questions he s completely fearless in a deposition said jason a forge who represented the plaintiffs in a lawsuit against trump s for profit education venture trump university and questioned him under oath he s way more engaged than a normal witness and you can tell he enjoys the challenge and revels in the verbal sparring said forge who predicted that there was no way he ll refuse to answer questions in short he added trump was the dream deponent the lawsuit ended in a settlement trump s willingness to talk arguably hurt him in a 2007 deposition for a lawsuit that also centered on the value of his assets in that case trump had sued journalist timothy l o brien for writing a book that cast doubt on the size of his net worth but in the deposition o brien s lawyer coaxed out a series of admissions from trump who acknowledged even my own feelings affects my value to myself and said that his net worth can vary actually from day to day and that he determined it by gauging my general attitude at the time he then added and as i say it varies have you ever exaggerated in statements about your properties o brien s lawyer asked him i think everyone does trump replied a judge ultimately dismissed trump s lawsuit the former president will have an added incentive to avoid candidly answering james questions the lingering criminal investigation into the very same conduct that inquiry faded from view early this year after the district attorney alvin l bragg declined to indict trump bragg who could utilize trump s statements in the civil deposition as evidence against him in a potential criminal case has already said that he intends to take careful stock of trump s answers in the depositions james investigators are likely to home in on trump s involvement in his annual financial statements trump who is synonymous with the trump organization had authority over all its operations and through questioning investigators will try to deduce a connection between his actions and the misstatements and omissions that lawyers for james told a judge that they had found in the documents her lawyers have also identified instances in which his two adult children made use of the documents ivanka trump submitted them to deutsche bank the company s largest lender and donald trump jr issued financial statements related to the assets in his father s trust their depositions will be likely to explore their roles at the company and their knowledge of the financial statements james investigators also are likely to press trump about his relationship with his longtime accounting firm mazars usa which compiled his annual financial statements in february james revealed that mazars had cut ties with trump a lawyer for james kevin wallace explained at a court hearing this spring why the investigation had taken so long telling a judge that although the trump organization s assets are as snarled and impenetrable as a russian nesting doll the attorney general s office had managed to obtain a very complete record this article originally appeared in the new york times

monitoring and management customer agreements in place to demonstrate ecotec s proven technology in oil and gas applications this year management commentary and outlook demand for our large midstream compression accelerated across geographies customers and horsepower categories during the second quarter said brad childers archrock s president and chief executive officer compared to the first quarter we grew our operating horsepower by 100 000 adjusted for asset sales and our horsepower utilization improved meaningfully to 87 at the end of june in addition year to date booking activity has doubled compared to the same period in 2021 providing a visible path to the full utilization of our fleet by the end of 2022 in aftermarket services we delivered sequential revenue growth of nearly 50 with solid gross margins as our customers began catching up on deferred maintenance and as industry wide labor scarcity is driving encouraging outsourcing trends for this work we continue to be excited about the outlook for our business despite near term challenges and uncertainties that have emerged for the global economy including intense cost inflation for compression we expect capacity across the industry will remain limited in light of continued capital discipline and extending lead times for new large horsepower units which has already allowed us to increase spot prices to record levels in the coming quarters we intend to reclaim the increasing costs we are currently experiencing as we raise pricing on our installed base of operating horsepower which we believe will translate into improved financial performance in 2023 through the cyclical noise we believe the impact of recent and unfortunate geopolitical conflicts will be lasting resulting in significant and sustained demand for abundant affordable and cleaner u s natural gas and therefore compression we remain focused on what we can control leveraging our best in class customer service and operational execution harnessing the digitalization of our compression platform and advancing our decarbonization strategy the strength of long term natural gas fundamentals and the investments we ve made to differentiate our compression franchise give us continued confidence in our ability to generate compelling returns for our stockholders concluded childers second quarter 2022 financial results archrock s second

patient traffic which we believe is related to an increase in patient appointment cancellations and staff shortages we are continuing to monitor these trends closely and expect patient traffic to increase again once cases of covid 19 moderate in contrast to our dental business during the three months ended june 25 2022 our medical business benefited from strong sales in point of care

deferred income taxes and income tax contingencies the allowance for doubtful accounts hedging activity supplier rebates measurement of compensation cost for certain share based performance awards and cash bonus plans and pension plan assumptions due to the significant uncertainty surrounding the future impact of covid 19 our judgments regarding estimates and impairments could change in the future there is an ongoing risk that the covid 19 pandemic may again have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows and may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity however the extent of the potential impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time table of contents 30 executive level overview henry schein inc is a solutions

strategically located distribution centers around the world to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency this infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices and a strong commitment to customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers needs while our primary go to market strategy is in our capacity as a distributor we also manufacture certain dental specialty products and solutions in the areas of implants orthodontics and endodontics we have achieved scale in these global businesses primarily through acquisitions as manufacturers of these products typically do not utilize a distribution channel to serve customers we conduct our business through two reportable segments i health care distribution and ii technology and value added services these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base our global dental businesses serve office based dental practitioners dental laboratories schools and other institutions our global medical businesses serve office based medical practitioners ambulatory surgery centers other alternate care settings and other institutions the health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global dental and medical operating segments this segment distributes consumable products small equipment laboratory

diagnostic tests infection control products ppe and vitamins our global technology and value added services business provides software technology and other value added services to health care practitioners our technology business offerings include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners our value added practice solutions include practice consultancy education revenue cycle management and financial services on a non recourse basis e services practice technology network and hardware services as well as consulting and continuing education services

chain equipment sales and service and other value added services allowing our customers to leverage the combined value that we offer through a single program specifically one schein provides customers with streamlined access to our comprehensive offering of national brand products our private label products and proprietary specialty products and solutions including implant orthodontic and endodontic products in addition customers have access to a wide range of services including software and other value added services table of contents 31 industry overview in recent years the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business domestically and internationally in part to address significant changes in the health care industry including consolidation of health care distribution companies health care reform trends toward managed care cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements our current and future results have been and could be impacted by the covid 19 pandemic the current economic environment and continued economic and public health uncertainty since the onset of the covid 19 pandemic in early 2020 we have been carefully monitoring its impact on our global operations and have taken appropriate steps to minimize the risk to our employees we have seen and expect to continue to see changes in demand trends for some of our products and services supply chain challenges and labor challenges as rates of infection fluctuate new strains or variants of covid 19 emerge and spread vaccine uptake and mandates increase and change governments adapt their approaches to combatting the virus including without limitation vaccine mandates and local conditions change across geographies for example vaccine mandates affecting our workforce whether imposed through government regulations or contracts with governmental authorities or other customers could potentially cause staffing shortages if employees choose not to comply as well as other consequences to our business or operations and managing and tracking vaccination status and ongoing testing for exempt employees could potentially increase our costs as could addressing inconsistent covid 19 vaccination mandates as a result we expect to see continued volatility through at least the duration of the pandemic industry consolidation the health care products distribution industry as it relates to office based health care practitioners is fragmented and diverse the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices due in part to the inability of office based health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to office based health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an office based health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier the trend of consolidation extends to our customer base health care practitioners are increasingly seeking to partner affiliate or combine with larger entities such as hospitals health systems group practices or physician hospital organizations in many cases purchasing decisions for consolidated groups are made at a centralized or professional staff level however orders are delivered to the practitioners offices we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial operating and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base table of contents 32 our trend with regard to acquisitions and joint ventures has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry this trend has resulted in our expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with and thus strengthen the acquired businesses as industry consolidation continues we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure although there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this we also have invested in expanding our sales marketing infrastructure to include a focus on building relationships with decision makers who do not reside in the office based practitioner setting as the health care industry continues to change we continually evaluate possible candidates for joint venture or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction if pursued if additional transactions are entered into or consummated we would incur merger and or acquisition related costs and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful aging population and other market influences the health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased health care awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded third party insurance coverage partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternate care sites particularly physicians offices according to the u s census bureau s international database in 2022 there are approximately seven million americans aged 85 years or older the segment of the population most in need of long term care and elder care services by the year 2050 that number is projected to nearly triple to approximately 19 million the population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to increase by approximately 27 during the same period as a result of these market dynamics annual expenditures for health care services continue to increase in the united states we believe that demand for our products and services will grow while continuing to be impacted by current and future operating economic and industry conditions the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms published national health expenditure data indicating that total national health care spending reached approximately 4 1 trillion in 2020 or 19 7 of the nation s gross domestic product the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united states health care spending is projected to reach approximately 6 2 trillion in 2028 approximately 19 7 of the nation s projected gross domestic product the latest projections begin after the latest historical year 2020 and go through 2030 government certain of our businesses involve the distribution manufacturing importation exportation marketing and sale of and or third party payment for pharmaceuticals and or medical devices and in this regard we are subject to extensive local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations including as applicable to our wholesale distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices manufacturing activities and as part of our specialty home medical supply business that distributes and sells medical equipment and supplies directly to patients the federal government and state governments have also increased enforcement activity in the health care sector particularly in areas of fraud and abuse anti bribery and corruption controlled substances handling medical device regulations and data privacy and security standards in addition certain of our businesses must operate in compliance with a variety of burdensome and complex billing and record keeping requirements in order to substantiate claims for payment under federal state and commercial healthcare reimbursement programs one of these businesses was recently suspended by cms from receiving payments from medicare although it is permitted to continue to perform and bill for medicare services the table of contents 33 amounts billed are being deposited in an escrow account pending resolution of an audit we have not recognized revenue for these services and have currently deferred 13 million in revenue including 8 million deferred during the six months ended june 25 2022 and 5 million deferred during the three months ended december 25 2021 government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care and there have been efforts to limit such private and government insurance programs including efforts thus far unsuccessful to seek repeal of the entire united states patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 as amended the aca in addition activities to control medical costs including laws and regulations lowering reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals medical devices and or medical treatments or services are ongoing many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and their evolving implementation may impact our operations and our financial performance our businesses are generally subject to numerous laws and regulations that could impact our financial performance and failure to comply with such laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business a more detailed discussion of governmental laws and regulations is included in management s discussion analysis of financial condition

financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap in addition to disclosing financial results prepared in accordance with gaap the company discloses information regarding adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda which differs from the commonly used ebitda ebitda adjusted ebitda both adjusts net income loss to exclude income taxes interest and depreciation and amortization and excludes discontinued operations share based compensation impairment charges equity method income loss fair value adjustments severance foreign currency transaction gains losses transactional gains and expenses gains on insurance recoveries certain tax credits and other cash and non cash charges and gains ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of performance defined in accordance with gaap however adjusted ebitda is used internally in planning and evaluating the company s operating performance accordingly management believes that disclosure of these metrics offers investors bankers and other stakeholders an additional view of the company s operations that when coupled with the gaap results provides a more complete understanding of the company s financial results ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss or to net cash from operating activities as measures of operating results or liquidity the company s calculation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and the measures exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating the company s performance ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the company s results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are i they do not reflect the company s cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments ii they do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for the company s working capital needs iii ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the company s debt iv although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements v they do not adjust for all non cash income or expense items that are reflected in the company s statements of cash flows vi they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters management considers not to be indicative of the company s ongoing operations and vii other companies in the company s industry may calculate these measures differently than the company does limiting their usefulness as comparative measures management believes ebitda and adjusted ebitda facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies these potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures affecting interest expense tax positions such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment affecting relative depreciation expense the company also presents ebitda and adjusted ebitda because i management believes these measures are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the company s industry ii management believes investors will find these measures useful in assessing the company s ability to service or incur indebtedness and iii management uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda internally as benchmarks to evaluate the company s operating performance or compare the company s performance to that of its competitors for further information please refer to ballantyne strong inc s annual report

the hezbollah lebanese resistance movement does not rule out going to war with israel over the regime s attempts to move in on lebanon s natural resources the movement s secretary general sayyed hassan nasrallah made the remarks on sunday amid a maritime dispute that escalated in early july after the israeli regime moved vessels into the karish gas field which lies inside lebanon s territorial waters given the entrance of the israeli vessels into the waters he said hezbollah s leadership discussed the options before the country there is a 50 per cent chance that the situation could be resolved and a 50 per cent chance that it could advance towards war hezbollah s reaction to the israeli regime in the circumstances depends on the results of ongoing indirect negotiations between beirut and tel aviv over the disputed maritime area nasrallah said on saturday us senior adviser for energy security amos hochstein arrived in beirut in order to meet with lebanese officials and mediate the talks between lebanon and israel over their long standing maritime border dispute just hours before the meeting hezbollah released a video showing israeli vessels operating in the disputed area in the mediterranean warning that all the occupying regime s platforms and targets were within the reach of its missiles nasrallah warned we have been ready over the past 40 years and are still ready to sacrifice our lives for our dear nation israel launched two wars against lebanon in the 2000s in both cases it was forced to retreat after suffering a humiliating defeat at the hands of hezbollah the arabic language al manar satellite television station affiliated with hezbollah aired the drone footage on sunday showing israeli ships at the karish field off lebanon s coast in the eastern mediterranean along with their exact coordinates the one minute video starts with hezbollah secretary general nasrallah s recent speech in which he warned that the resistance movement s precision missiles can hit any israeli target at sea or on land it then shows the arendal spirit platform the uk based energean power floating storage and production and stenna icemax drillship located in the karish gas fields the video ends with the footage of a rocket with the words the target is within range in arabic and hebrew hezbollah says its recent flying of drones toward the disputed karish gas field was aimed at conveying a message to israel the warning was broadcast just hours before us senior adviser for energy security hochstein was scheduled to meet lebanese officials in the capital beirut to mediate the ongoing talks between lebanon and israel over their long standing maritime border dispute the tel aviv regime claims the karish gas field falls within its so called exclusive economic zone while beirut rejects the claim the maritime row between lebanon and israel is over an area in the mediterranean sea spanning about 860 square kilometres block no 9 is rich in oil and gas israel relies heavily on gas and has long been developing a number of occupied offshore gas deposits in the mediterranean sea the two sides have held several rounds of talks to delineate their maritime borders and resolve the decades long dispute but to no avail last month nasrallah warned that no one would be allowed to operate in maritime oil and gas fields if lebanon was barred from its rights in extracting from areas off of its coast also in early july hezbollah flew three unarmed drones toward karish to warn israel not to conduct any extraction operation prior to resolving their maritime border dispute the secretary general of the organisation of the petroleum exporting countries opec says iran is one of the most important founding members of the intergovernmental energy body and plays a significant role in bringing stability to the global oil market iran and venezuela are among the most important founding members of opec their role is great in stabilising the oil market haitham al ghais said in an exclusive interview with the arabic language and kuwaiti al rai daily newspaper on sunday he said that opec s strength hinges upon its cohesion and solidarity among member states irrespective of all unfolding international developments iran has recently staged an exhibition of oil and gas to showcase its latest domestically produced petroleum industry equipment opec s important message to the world is that reduction in oil investments will result in increased prices ghais said stressing that an estimated 500 billion dollar annual investment is required to maintain the current production level of 100 million barrels per day the kuwaiti oil executive argued that the latest surge in oil prices is not exclusively related to the russo ukrainian conflict and that the reduction of surplus production capacity has contributed to the volatility of the market as well the world needs 12 trillion of investment in the oil sector for the next 25 years we expect the demand to increase by 3 4 million barrels per day this year and exceed 102 million barrels on a daily basis by the end of 2022 ghais said the london stock exchange and the new york stock exchange fix the prices of brent and west texas intermediate wti crude oil not opec some consumer countries in europe asia and america have even tapped their strategic reserves in a bid to push down prices the opec chief added ghais also said that his organisation welcomes renewable and clean energy and that oil and natural gas will remain the main energy pillars of the world the opec secretary general said more than half of the world s energy comes from oil and gas and it is difficult to replace them analysts expect iran to increase its supply of oil to the global markets by at least one million barrels per day bpd immediately after the removal of the american sanctions unconfirmed reports suggest iran is currently exporting more than 1 5 million bpd of oil tehran is ready to swiftly conclude the vienna talks on reviving the iran nuclear deal and give the united states another chance to act responsibly toward its contractual obligations under the 2015 jcpoa joint comprehensive plan of action accord says iran s lead negotiator ali bagheri kani the jcpoa was a deal signed in 2015 between iran and five major countries the us uk china russia china plus germany in which tehran agreed to develop its nuclear programme for peaceful purposes only however then us president donald trump unilaterally walked out of the deal in 2018 and slapped punitive sanctions on iran kani who also serves as iran s deputy foreign minister for political affairs tweeted on sunday that the islamic republic has shared its proposed ideas both on substance and form to pave the way for a swift conclusion of the vienna negotiations he explained that iran and the remaining signatories to the jcpoa p4 1 group of countries china france russia the uk plus germany have been in talks in the austrian capital with the purpose of fixing the damaging and complicated situation caused by the us unilateral and unlawful withdrawal from the jcpoa deal back in 2018 the senior iranian diplomat emphasised that iran is working closely with its jcpoa partners in particular the european union foreign policy chief josep borrell who is the coordinator of the jcpoa joint commission he said the aim of the cooperation is to give the us another chance to demonstrate good faith and act responsibly as iran we stand ready to conclude the negotiations quickly should the other side be ready to do the same kani added iran and the five remaining parties to the jcpoa have held several rounds of negotiations in the austrian capital vienna since april last year to restore the deal in quitting it four years ago then us president trump immediately restored sanctions on iran as part of what he called the maximum pressure campaign against the country those sanctions are still being enforced to this day by the joe biden administration even though it has repeatedly acknowledged that the policy has been a total failure

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure

s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

reliability standards the semiconductors in stion s thin film solar panels are made of copper indium gallium selenium and sulfur cigs traditionally cigs based materials have demonstrated the highest efficiencies of any thin film technology however there are many variations of the technology and performance varies widely based on how the materials are deposited and processed cigs semiconductor film is comprised of both metallic and non metallic elements station employs two separate process steps to form the semiconductor film the first is ideally suited for the deposition of metallic elements the second is ideal to supply and incorporate non metallic elements in the film these two processes enable exceptional large area uniformity bipv building integrated photovoltaics the solar photovoltaic panel is integrated into the building fabric rather than a tack on addition and the pv panel replaces conventional building cladding materials but with the added benefit of producing renewable electricity the key advantage of building integrated photovoltaics bipv is the marginal additional cost of installation bipv is one of the fastest growing segments of the photovoltaic industry bipv also delivers further advantages its applicability to a wide range of applications vertical and horizontal surfaces means a wider area can be employed to generate solar energy than just conventional rooftops further generating electricity at the point of use means that transmission losses are reduced and no upgrade of the grid is required bipv glazing can also deliver added energy saving benefits in reduced heat loss and heat gain and as a non mechanical system requires little or no maintenance over its lifetime the snpw range of bipv modules provides good environment adaptability is less sensitive to installation angle and is more suitable for vertical installation this provides all with the benefit of generating power without additional space requirements such as

columbia mo ap missouri attorney general eric schmitt won the republican primary for u s senate on tuesday with surprising ease ending months of worry among gop leaders that scandal scarred former gov eric greitens might win the primary and jeopardize what should be a reliably red seat in november in november schmitt will be opposed by anheuser busch beer heiress trudy busch valentine who defeated marine veteran lucas kunce and nine others in the democratic primary both also face a challenge from a well funded independent john wood who has the financial backing of former sen john danforth with nearly 90 of results in schmitt had more votes than his nearest two competitors u s rep vicky hartzler and greitens combined turning what was expected to be a tight race into a blowout i m proud of my working class roots and i m going to washington to fight for working families defeating socialism and leading the fight to save america schmitt said in his victory speech in suburban st louis greitens told a downcast crowd in another st louis suburb to go home with strength and pride god has a plan greitens said it doesn t always work on our timeline but it does work on his sometimes we have to practice patience greitens resigned four years ago following a sex scandal two criminal charges that were eventually dropped and a legislative investigation that could have led to impeachment hearings this year his ex wife accused him of abuse republican sen roy blunt s announcement last year that he would not seek a third term set off a frenzy for his job with nearly three dozen people in the two major parties filing to run schmitt defeated a field that also included hartzler u s rep billy long and mark mccloskey who gained notoriety in 2020 when he and his wife pointed guns at racial injustice protesters outside their home voter darrel durham a 63 year old heavy equipment operator from columbia said he thinks schmitt can bring a new voice to washington i like all of his positions on draining the swamp durham said on monday former president donald trump expressed support for eric presumably meaning either schmitt or greitens without picking between them comedian and navy veteran eric mcelroy was also on the ballot in the gop primary i trust the great people of missouri on this one to make up their own minds much as they did when they gave me landslide victories in the 2016 and 2020 elections and i am therefore proud to announce that eric has my complete and total endorsement trump wrote voter richard greenup a 66 year old computer programmer from columbia said he wants somebody that s going to support trump and that he chose schmitt over greitens because good or bad schmitt i don t think has that baggage greitens a former navy seal officer and rhodes scholar had been governor for a year when in january 2018 he confirmed a tv report about a 2015 extramarital affair he was subsequently charged with felony invasion of privacy for allegedly taking a nude photo of the woman and using it to keep her quiet that charge was dropped months later amid allegations that the chief investigator and local prosecutor mishandled the investigation greitens 48 says he was the victim of a political hit he faced a second charge accusing him of illegally using a donor list from a charity he founded to raise money for his campaign that was dropped when he resigned in june 2018 after the missouri house began an impeachment investigation greitens has denied the abuse allegations from his ex wife that she made in an affidavit in a child custody case she cited one instance where he allegedly slapped their then 3 year old son s face and yanked him by the hair in another she accused him of pushing her to the ground greitens also drew criticism for a june campaign video showing him brandishing a shotgun and declaring he s hunting rinos or republicans in name only schmitt 47 has gained attention for lawsuits that critics contend are politically motivated he sued china over the coronavirus school districts over mask mandates and the city of st louis over its plan to provide 1 million for women to travel out of state for abortions i ve always been a fighter and as your attorney general i have fought in court to protect our those liberties schmitt said in his victory speech citing mask and vaccine mandates among other things valentine 65 is the daughter of august gussie busch jr the longtime chair and ceo of anheuser busch who built the st louis based company into the world s largest beermaker the brewery was sold to inbev in 2008 valentine said she entered the race after witnessing the division in our country and the vitriol in our politics after hundreds of career politicians it s time for a nurse in the senate valentine said in a victory speech bob westlake 67 and his wife mary jo 69 both voted for valentine the chesterfield couple liked her push for better health care coverage health care is a big deal to us bob westlake said adding that they have a daughter with a chronic illness and that he and his wife are on medicare kunce 39 lost despite the endorsement of sen bernie sanders kunce served tours of duty in afghanistan and iraq

implied and or stated on today s call as well as any qualitative comments regarding performance should be assumed to be regarding the second quarter of 2022 as compared to the second quarter of 2021 unless stated otherwise finally i would like to remind you that the recording and retransmission of today s conference call is prohibited without the prior written consent of ta and with that jon i ll turn the call over to you jon pertchik chief executive officer thanks kristin good morning to everyone and thank you for your continuing interest in ta strength resilience consistency the ability to optimize opportunity and outperformance my 18 000 teammates at travelcenters of america have increasingly demonstrated these qualities in recent years and the benefits of their efforts were fully on display in the outstanding second quarter results we reported yesterday i believe that ta s performance and execution during what has been a challenging and dynamic past 30 months provides the best evidence that these results are sustainable and repeatable moving forward for the second quarter of 2022 as compared to the prior year quarter ta produced the following a 117 improvement in adjusted net income to 64 4 million a 67 improvement in adjusted ebitda to 122 8 million and a 56 increase in trailing 12 month adjusted ebitda to nearly 300 million versus the prior year period in short healthy top line growth translated into even greater operating leverage generating significant increases in income and operating cash flow remember that our q2 2021 growth over q2 2020 results were significant which makes this quarter s outcome even more impressive against a difficult comp so once again ta demonstrated multi year improvements that are both consistent and extraordinary i want to draw attention to ta s multi year financial improvement ta s 2019 adjusted ebitda was 131 million in 2020 our newly combined team generated an adjusted ebitda of 147 million despite facing the adverse effects of covid in 2021 we broke the 200 million mark with 220 2 million of adjusted ebitda and now we have generated just under 300 million of trailing 12 month adjusted ebitda these results demonstrate consistency resilience growth and significant value creation while much of this upside this quarter resulted from fuel margin strength can be found across our businesses most obviously within fuel margin ta s fuel team has intensively refined the supply management process enabling the team to leverage a favorably volatile period to efficiently maximize diesel margins which led to strong results i would underscore that this was not merely favorable market forces but circumstances combined with excellent team performance and execution starting with the commercial division margin expansion was driven in large part by strong truck service performance with substantial growth coming from our mobile maintenance business solidly outpacing any inflationary impact and many initiatives relating to technician compensation and retention improving tech efficiency and leveraging technology to improve the professional driver experience remain in front of us with value yet to be harvested shifting to hospitality we have been largely successful in thoughtfully increasing prices to offset labor and operating cost pressures here too many initiatives have just gotten underway including for example ta s customer loyalty program improving food operations and merchandising efficiency through leveraging technology with impacts that have not yet begun to take hold moreover we are carefully working on our various food and c store offerings to continue to find ways to improve top line as well as bottom line efficiencies and non fuel revenues were again strengthened by demand for diesel exhaust fluid or def we remain on track to have def dispensers on the diesel fuel island at all ta petros nationwide by the end of this year importantly i also wanted to touch on the resiliency of ta s business model while volatility and uncertainty has created challenges for our national economy as well as for the consumer motorists side of our business with inflation and wage compression impacting discretionary spending at the c stores and on food these same uncertainties and volatility are also creating the favorable fuel market conditions from which our team has been successful at generating diesel margin upside herein lies the resiliency of ta s business model and on this point of resilience i do want to offer my outlook for the remainder of 2022 my belief is that we can reasonably expect persistent volatility to remain at least through the end of 2022 led by the war in ukraine continuing supply constraints persistent inflation and gdp contraction while we expect this volatility to continue to modestly suppress gasoline volumes and hospitality we also expect to benefit from favorable diesel margin conditions that we saw in q2 with continued excellent execution by our fuel team we should expect ta s fuel margins to remain robust and mitigate macroeconomic driven softness in other areas which in turn should provide continuing solid overall performance we are not increasing our long term fuel cpg guidance however we are clearly signaling a strong likelihood that higher than typical fuel margins should persist through the remainder of this year in addition we are not content to rest in our existing performance and momentum we continue to pursue transformational initiatives in fuel including expanding ta s new small fleet program and the development of artificial intelligence to support diesel street pricing among other initiatives we expect these activities will begin to contribute new and higher margin volumes by the end of 22 and also may contribute more non fuel retail and hospitality sales moving to growth initiatives our robust acquisition pipeline totaling five highly probable opportunities and more than 25 locations under serious consideration positions us to add independent sites along active corridors to strengthen the ta network s geographic coverage also i am happy to report that the first two acquisitions we closed in april are significantly outperforming our proforma ebitda return expectations of a minimum mid teens return on investment largely due to synergies acquisitions will provide substantial incremental run rate ebitda next year and beyond furthermore since the beginning of 2022 we have entered into 50 travelcenter franchise agreements five of these franchise sites began operations during 2020 two during 2021 and one during the second quarter of 2022 we expect to open the balance of these 40 plus travelcenters between now and the third quarter of 2024 and have a go forward target of opening 30 annually these will begin to contribute meaningful incremental ebitda starting at the end of 2022 and into 2023 looking ahead we are making capital allocation decisions to achieve the best returns and continue to anticipate our non acquisition capital spend in 2022 to be between 175 million and 200 million beyond baseline amounts for standard break fix capital these expenditures focus heavily on growth opportunities and important remedial expenditures with the primary focus on customer facing and customer impacting opportunities and investments that generate efficiencies key areas include the physical plant of our locations and it systems in addition i would like to share a couple of points about our capital allocation philosophy as follows first we do not expect money spent to yield a one and done performance but rather contribute a cumulative effect from the many improvements we have made that should clearly demonstrate greater earnings capacity over time second even when considering our ongoing capital needs we continue to generate substantial amounts of cash flow which provides significant firepower to drive growth and generate shareholder value third despite our resilient business model as i discussed earlier we believe that maintaining a liquid and robust balance sheet is the important foundation for any deep value growth company moving beyond capital allocation we have spent substantial time in recent years reshaping the profile and prospects of travelcenters of america having achieved strong operating and financial results over the past few years we are now committed to closing our valuation gap to reflect our greatly improved company our current enterprise value in no way reflects the robust earnings and cash flow capacity of ta we will expand on this message and make the case for a higher valuation during our investor day on september 20 in new york city before i turn things over to peter i would like to take a moment to share important non financial achievements and recognition that demonstrate ta s commitment to leadership and excellence in recent months ta has been awarded the following one return to the fortune 500 at number 461 two the name by cranes as a top workplace for large companies in northeast ohio three being selected by usa today as a top 10 best gas station brand nationwide also looking forward ta is excited about the following ringing the closing bell at nasdaq on september 19 hosting a targeted investor day september 20 at nasdaq where we will showcase the depth of our management team and highlight ta s value proposition in tangible ways and releasing our first ever esg report in the next month we have worked hard to transforming this great 50 year old company over the past few years i think our q2 results show we are now graduating to a reliable durable and resilient company that consistently executes and strongly warrants consideration from deep value to growth oriented investors finally and as always i would like to end with an expression of gratitude to our teammates guests customers analysts and shareholders thank you all for your continuing commitment to ta petro and with that i will hand over the call to peter crage our cfo peter peter crage chief financial officer thank you jon and good morning everyone as jon mentioned this was another excellent quarter for the company when you consider these results not only on their own but as measured against our improved performance over the past two years they clearly demonstrate the ability of ta s business to continue to improve operating results and generate strong cash flow now to more detail on our results for the second quarter we reported net income of 64 million or 4 31 per share which more than doubled from last year s 2 02 per share excluding small one time items in both quarters as detailed in our earnings release we generated 117 improvement in adjusted net income against what was a very strong comp in 2021 adjusted ebitda which excludes two one time items in each quarter increased by 49 2 million or 67 primarily due to strong diesel cpg margin and non fuel gross margin particularly in our truck service business this was partly offset by elevated inflation induced labor and operating costs which are prevalent across the broader economy our fuel sales volume was slightly reduced by 9 3 million gallons or 1 6 to just over 574 million gallons the mix shows diesel sales volume largely stable and a 10 7 decrease in gasoline sales volume that likely reflects temporary demand destruction related to increases in retail pump pricing fuel gross margin increased 56 3 million to 156 6 million or 56 2 and combined margin cents per gallon improved 10 01 or 58 7 to 0 27 over the prior year this increase grew from unusual fuel market volatility at the macro level and solid execution by the travelcenters fuel team i will add that in july market volatility has abated somewhat from the levels we saw in the second quarter but we continue to generate a solid blended cpg margin of approximately 0 26 per gallon for the time being we believe it is prudent to maintain our long term guidance of 0 15 to 0 17 for blended fuel gross margin per gallon however as jon mentioned we do believe that volatility will remain elevated at least through this year due to broader supply and economic uncertainty and this volatility combined with excellent execution by our fuel team will generate higher cpg for the remainder of 2022 in the future as we begin to see volatility stabilize and realize meaningful impact from our recently launched initiatives such as ai in diesel pricing and our small fleet program these sustainable drivers of higher fuel margin will lead us to revisit this long term guidance and make appropriate upward adjustments that we are confident or sustainable non fuel revenues increased by 51 6 million or 10 3 and total non fuel gross margin increased by 28 7 million or 9 5 operating costs increased 26 1 million or 11 2 because of stronger business activity and continued inflationary wage and opex pressures against 2021 strength in truck service revenue is up 12 4 and diesel exhaust fluid up 44 7 we re largely price driven as we adjust to address inflationary cost pressures and continued growth in our mobile maintenance business variable costs were well controlled in truck service relative to the solid revenue increases driving improved profitability revenues from store and restaurant which includes both full service and quick service increased by 3 1 and 8 4 respectively sales here were offset by increased inflationary labor and operating costs we have been successful in managing these costs to dull the impact and are making adjustments to mitigate these inflation induced cost pressures on a site by site basis in advance of the improvements jon discussed relating to customer loyalty operations and technology sg a expense for the quarter came in at 6 5 of total fuel gross margin plus non fuel revenue as we continue to support our growth and efficiency initiatives as a reminder we have established a benchmark of costs on a relative basis to the growth in business and expect annual sg a to be in the range of 6 75 to 7 25 of fuel gross margin plus non fuel revenue we were below this range for the quarter and are comfortable that we can continue carrying our growth initiatives at this level of spend touching on our balance sheet for a moment at june 30 we had cash and cash equivalents of 565 million and availability under our revolving credit facility of 185 million for total liquidity of 750 million and no near term debt maturities we invested 39 4 million in capital expenditures during the second quarter and 90 million for the year thus far we continue to anticipate a cash spend between 175 million to 200 million on capex projects in 2022 while supply chain challenges continue to exist we have been largely successful this year in completing projects on time and at levels at or near our original budgets in addition to capex spend we also invested 52 million total cash consideration to acquire two franchise locations in april and a third added in july for approximately 15 million our typical mid year reassessment of our capital allocation plan is particularly important this year given growing recession expectations to be sure we deploy capital on projects that generate the best returns most quickly we are filtering our spend for the remainder of the year but to be clear any potential adjustments to our spend will not affect our long term plan to continue investing in our travelcenters and continue our growth trajectory we believe our strong liquidity position is important not only to the execution of our organic and inorganic growth strategy but also to position ourselves defensively against economic headwinds that concludes our prepared remarks operator we are now ready to take questions questions answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session the first question comes from bryan maher with b riley securities please go ahead with your question bryan maher b riley securities analyst good morning jonathan and peter thank you for the comments so far couple of questions on the pipeline for acquisitions can you drill down a little bit more on how deep that is i think you said in your prepared comments you re looking at five properties can you discuss may be pricing either on an absolute basis or on maybe a multiple of ebitda and who might be the potential sellers jon pertchik chief executive officer yes sure thanks bryan good to connect this morning really like to share our earnings this quarter the pipeline as we noted there are five that we call sort of highly probable we tend to look at things pretty conservatively so you can read into that as you may what we mean with a highly probable 25 that are under very very serious review again we look at things can we communicate conservatively there we have a pipeline of potential other sites that is on multiple on top of that bigger number pricing and an upside you know sort of talk about those two together because the first couple of that closed which frankly because they were franchise we expected while lower execution risk we didn t expect the synergies to be as significant as they re part of our network and we re doing far far better than what we had proformad and i think the inbound pre synergy multiples in general loosely speaking meaning i don t want to point to any one is five to six times something like that and then last your last question is who are these folks so to speak or what who are the likely kinds of sellers these are onesie twosies a single location some double locations there are no five six 10 many portfolios unfortunately though we re looking we continue to look initially these were just opportunistic where we found a location or two that was in a good corridor that we were just sort of we were shaking the tree and someone would come along we would engage and that s played out very well so far now we re getting a little bit more strategic in identifying a little more assertively corridors and then looking in those corridors with a great deal of focus i can envision a few years down the pike not today but a few years down the pike when the economy sort of renormalize restabilizes we may very well start getting into more ground up in a significant way i don t think that will be a part of our business in the very very near term and again in a scaled way in the near term it will continue to be these onesie twosies one or two location mom and pop existing travelcenters that we can roll into our network and see really significant synergies bryan maher b riley securities analyst ok thanks for that and on the capex good to hear that you are moving along despite supply chain issues but do you have any initial thoughts for what 2023 might look like and then also i know that prior c suite management used to sell some of the improvements back to svc on those 179 properties is there any scenario kind of this year and next year where you re may be adding in a restaurant or a truck service bay that you might sell back some of those improvements to svc jon pertchik chief executive officer so with the latter selling improvements no whether it s adding a restaurant adding a truck service pages short answer no it s not part of our strategy it s not how we plan to go forward in terms of next year s capex and we need to run our process and we re doing a mid year evaluation right now which any normal healthy company should do and as you do that in a year where we budgeted and this doesn t suggest there will be any change in the headline numbers i don t think there will be but when you budget when we set our budgets last september october inflation was like 5 2 it s now 9 so the mid year look you normally do in a healthy normal year you look with greater care we have to complete that we then got it rolled into our budget process for next year to really have a good answer but i do think at least through next year we will have a output in elevated capital budget and i don t want to suggest the range but i will say it will be elevated to what sort of a stable state normal renormalized capex budget would look like i still think we have at least another year here of very significant investments greater than the normal run rate to continue to effectuate the opportunities we have and really harvest some of the opportunities that are in front of us so i think we have at least another year of elevated capex bryan maher b riley securities analyst ok thanks for that and then just last from me on the fuel margins and congratulations for such a profound number it reminds me a lot of 4q 2014 which i m kind of dating myself covering the company where ta did i think 0 28 that quarter and then it faded off to still phenomenal in 1q 15 and kind of moved down to the very high teens and low 20s in the next few quarters do you think we see something like that play out again and peter is it safe to say that with 0 26 in july that the third quarter number likely has a two handle on it jon pertchik chief executive officer so there s a lot there first on dating yourself thank you for sticking around with us by the way like don t want to skip over that we definitely appreciate that and by the way we look back to at least i know we re able to look at q1 versus q1 and even though there were some high cpg back then overall q1 to q1 at least i know factually our ebitda overall was significantly better frankly it s really hard to look to another period to suggest what the pattern would look like here it could be flatter it could be steeper it could be we really just don t know what we do know is we are a different company now than we were back then and then we ve been since then and what we re learning and peter and i having been here a couple of years started to see maybe a year and a half ago was this unusual interesting resilience of almost quasi hedge between different parts of the business and i think as we re executing better we highlighted i try to really emphasize the market was very strong for us but the way the fuel team executed within that was that a whole another level and so there is just so many different variables we re a different company today very different than we were then and two the circumstances are different economically and otherwise so it s really hard to predict what the pattern will look like in the mid to longer term i just know we re in a really good spot between the changes we ve made the long list of yet to be harvested opportunities the ai machine learning and small fleet the franchise scaling up the acquisitions the loyalty program and on and on and on the truck service investments we re making in they re already performing at such a high level i m not really sure what the future will bring exactly but i know whatever it will bring we will execute at a very high level and now that we re 2 5 years into having these great quarter over quarter over quarter performances i have no reason to think that won t persist peter go ahead on the specific peter crage chief financial officer bryan on the two handle we certainly hope so i think as jon pointed out as we pointed out the causes for that are volatility created by external exogenous factors and we don t see those abating over the next 90 days so the third quarter we would expect something and we ve got obviously better at purchasing as we pointed out the field team has done an incredible job so we certainly hope that it has a two handle we expect it will the fourth quarter of course is more difficult to say because it s long it s out further bryan maher b riley securities analyst ok thank you and congratulations again on a phenomenal quarter peter crage chief financial officer thank you jon pertchik chief executive officer thanks bryan operator our next question comes from paul lejuez with citi research please go ahead with your question paul lejuez citi analyst hey thanks guys a couple of questions just on the lower gallons during the quarter curious how that looked on a month to month basis if you saw big fluctuations throughout the quarter and even maybe if you could give us an update on what you ve been seeing in july from a gallons sold perspective and then second would love to hear an update on the loyalty program and then last on the 42 franchise location just curious what needs to be done to get those up and running by 3q 24 as you laid out and if you re running into any sort of timing issues with those sort of getting pushed out toward the latter end of that 2024 timing thanks jon pertchik chief executive officer great thanks paul and thanks for the questions on the lower the reduction in gallons that basically and i ll let peter correct me to any extent i get this not perfectly accurately but the reduction we ve seen is pretty much entirely in gasoline which stated another way is motorists us all of us our behavior not trucker behavior so we still have we ve seen a persistence of diesel remember we re lapping a very strong year the prior year number one in fuel and general fuel volume growth very very significant last year so we re lapping that year and diesel volume to last year has been persistently sort of stable and i would say flat in terms of volume growth now we have a bunch of initiatives again at the ai machine learning for diesel street pricing the new small fleet program was just getting rolling so there s some real opportunities we have there but fundamentally it s sort of flat the entire reduction we ve seen is in gasoline volumes and i would say those volumes have never fully recovered to pre covid by the way and if they did it was the brief is the periods where we were up to pre covid gasoline gallons and so those never fully recovered i would say we ve seen a continuation of a very flat but continuing slight drop in gasoline volumes through the quarter as we got to the end of the quarter i think that s accurate to say anything on that peter before i move to loyalty and franchise peter crage chief financial officer no right on obviously we disclosed the 0 26 range for july so far volumes flat on diesel gas has accelerated and is declined slightly from the second quarter but that s to be expected jon pertchik chief executive officer right and consistent with what sort of the armchair perspective might be on the impact of a 9 inflationary rate and the labor participation or unemployment so labor participation rate which has been people are sitting on the sidelines not looking for a job is also about a one point to two points lower than what normal is and so i think that there is a relationship there in terms of loyalty program update there is not much of an update we ve been saying all along that really year end is the timeframe that we will or as we end this year into next year we will introduce a really comprehensively revised loyalty program we re basically on track for that i d say q1 of next year is when that will be in the marketplace again the small fleet program if that s what you re getting at ask a follow and i can share a little bit on that which is not the loyalty program more comprehensively and then on the 42 the number of franchises opening and delay and all of that they re really these when we first started to pursue franchise i surmised i speculated i theorized that we would find a lot of existing travelcenters mom and pops that we would convert to a ta and the process of conversion of an existing travelcenter to a ta is maybe months maybe half a year on the high end maybe more like a quarter to two quarters most of our new franchises are ground up builds and ground up just takes time and so that s what explains the significant lag have we seen some delays due to supply chain and all of that and labor pressures probably a little bit nothing major but yes probably a little bit within that but i feel really comfortable when we signal by that third quarter of 24 to open the 40 plus i think that s about right and no i don t think that it will be backend loaded i think it ll be a fairly even spread starting as we wrap up the end of this year into next year i think you ll start to see these popping up every month every few months a good handful and so on i think that s the way the pattern we expect to see paul lejuez citi analyst got it and jon you mentioned the small fleet program it sounded like maybe add something to share there just the progress that you re seeing on that initiative would love to hear more about it jon pertchik chief executive officer yes we re really it s something in the fuel area that the ai machine learning for street diesel which by the way we talk a lot about that because we re now we finished our phase 2 beta and we re preparing to roll that out and scale that as we get into these next couple of quarters here we re really really excited about that i also am just staying on that for a second i believe ai is going to benefit us in how we manage our supply and there is a long list of areas where ai is going to benefit us on the fuel side but to your question on small fleet that s the one other very significant area we ve had something like in the 300 plus range of active new fleet signed up with this remember these are smaller fleets you re not going to get massive gallons but because they are smaller fleets they re very meaningful margin cpg we have had over 1 000 applications submitted just working our way through that process so we ve gotten off to a really good jump start to really start to see it in dollars and cents is going to take a little while because again you need to scale it they are small fleets so by definition the volumes are going to be smaller but it s another area that as we get toward the end of this year and into next i think that s when we start to see measurably financial impact paul lejuez citi analyst great thank you for that jon pertchik chief executive officer thanks for the questions paul operator our next question comes from ari klein with bmo capital markets please go ahead with your question ari klein bmo capital markets analyst thanks and good morning maybe just following up on the fuel margin you mentioned that 0 26 in july just curious what that peaked at during the second quarter and you have been above the 0 15 to 0 17 per gallon range for a while now what would push you or what do you want to see before you increase the long term outlook there jon pertchik chief executive officer i ll let peter take the first part in a second one on the long term outlook i think this company has been around a long time and we ve made a lot of changes but because cpg is such a driver i want to continue to set a from a long term perspective set a conservative expectation while we continue to build the basic foundation of the company and so within that i think what you may have noticed this is the first time we ve really spoken about an outlook using the word outlook and then expressing and explaining what we expect for the back half of this year i think we re going to continue to do that so while we may speak in terms of a long term guidance expectation for fuel cpg i think we will supplement that and complement that with more short and maybe mid term at least short term changes to that long term perspective and so i still want to get further along in building the foundation of this business which again we ve gone from low 100s millions in ebitda this is the whole story to in excess of 200 million to now trailing 12 of right around 300 million we re really building a with a lot of liquidity we really building a sound solid deep value proposition here and i want to continue to stay conservative and so that s what we re going to continue to do but with emphasis we will as we just did in this earnings call we gave an outlook that supplements or complements that sort of long term base case and hopefully that s meaningful for folks to sort of consider us peter what would you add to the first part of the question peter crage chief financial officer within the quarter we saw in the month of june cpg expanse so early part of the quarter low to mid 20s in june spiked up into the high 20s low 30s for a period of time and that in june is when we saw a little bit of the softness that you see in the second quarter on volume so we saw that relation between spiking up cpg in june and a little bit of volume loss in that month but that gives you a sense of what happened in the quarter is mainly backloaded ari klein bmo capital markets analyst got it and then just on the diesel volumes it was down a little bit year over year obviously it was a tough comp but with the macro environment may be slowing and perhaps trucking demand being impacted how are you thinking about that moving forward jon pertchik chief executive officer i still i talk to my peers and some of our biggest customers i ve spoken to a couple of just in the last couple of weeks let s say and we stay through our fleet team stay very close with our biggest fleet customers and the bigger fleets in particular there remains a level of persistent tempered but persistent optimism again it s tempered and the further out you look the foggier the crystal ball becomes but at least for this as we look to finish up this year there still is a level of i would say tempered optimism about activity levels in freight activity on the bigger fleets so smaller fleets the spot business has softened a little bit and i think that s going to continue that s what i hear from our biggest customers both directly as well as through our fleet team and so that s how i m thinking about the rest of this year as we get to next year it will be a whole new set of challenges and variables just like from our first few months here where covid hit and then sort of phase 2 of covid with supply chain and all this other stuff we re going to continue to see storms of all kinds coming and going like we ve seen and we fought our way through and we ve had 2 5 years of great success and i think that will persist ari klein bmo capital markets analyst got it and then maybe just one last one jonathan you mentioned earlier the substantial cash flows and the company is clearly on stronger financial footing is a dividend something that you d consider at some point or any other form of capital return jon pertchik chief executive officer i wouldn t single out any one opportunity for capital allocation but we talk actively about capital allocation very actively and our balance sheet and in the context of acquisitions and some of these transformational initiatives as well as things like dividends and whether a one time dividend eventually maybe sometime down the line a recurring dividend all of those things are part of our dialog i don t want to say anything more specific as to what we might do in terms of capital allocation because i want to make sure we give all of these things their due consideration and it d be premature to say anything more specific at this point ari klein bmo capital markets analyst got it thanks for the color jon pertchik chief executive officer thank you appreciate it ari operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to jon pertchik for any closing remarks jon pertchik

2022 reconciliations with the appropriate gaap measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon i ll now turn the call over to travis stice travis stice chairman and chief executive officer thank you adam and welcome to diamondback s second quarter earnings call i d like to start by highlighting our second quarter performance we once again delivered operationally producing over 221 000 barrels of oil per day near the high end of our quarterly guidance range our discretionary cash flow or operating cash flow before working capital changes totaled 1 8 billion up 27 quarter over quarter setting a new high for the company this increase was primarily due to a favorable backdrop macro backdrop as well as improvement to our realized pricing as hedges put on last year continue to roll off our free cash flow for the quarter was 1 3 billion up 35 quarter over quarter we will return 63 of this free cash flow to our shareholders well in excess of our commitment to return at least 50 of free cash flow this return is made up of our growing and sustainable base dividend opportunistic share repurchases and a robust variable dividend our annual dividend is now 3 per share or 0 75 per quarter representing a 7 1 increase from the company s previous annual base dividend of 2 80 per share or 0 70 per quarter as previously announced the board elected to keep our total dividend per share flat quarter over quarter at 3 05 which is comprised of the 75 base dividend and a 2 30 variable dividend this puts our total annualized 2q dividend yield at nearly 10 additionally we took advantage of market volatility and repurchased nearly 2 4 million shares during the quarter at an average price of a little over 127 a share for a total cost of approximately 303 million we believe our opportunistic disciplined approach to our repurchase program brings the most value for our shareholders and continues to give us the flexibility to use either our variable dividend buybacks or as has been the case so far in 2022 a combination of both to hit or exceed our returns target as we move into the second half of the year it s hard to ignore the amount of free cash flow we expect to generate around 2 5 billion of current strip pricing in june we announced an increase in our capital returns commitment target moving it up from 50 to at least 75 of free cash flow beginning in the third quarter at 75 that s over 1 8 billion returned to shareholders or well north of 10 per share in just two quarters for total annualized return yield of approximately 17 this robust free cash flow profile led the board to double the size of our buyback program from 2 billion to 4 billion giving us ample running room to be opportunistic in the equity markets since the program was initiated in the third quarter of last year we ve repurchased over 8 3 million shares at an average price of 113 a share for a total cost of approximately 940 million this includes 1 8 million of shares we ve already repurchased in the third quarter for a total of 200 million at an average price of 113 70 a share our confidence to increase our returns payout is rooted in the strength of our balance sheet during the second quarter we opportunistically repurchased 337 million in diamondback senior notes at an average cost of 95 4 of par for a total of 322 million we focused on our debt coming due over the next 10 years significantly lowering our maturity towers while taking advantage of the volatile debt market we also recently redeemed 45 million in legacy energen in qep notes due 2022 at par as a result our balance sheet is stronger today than ever before our annualized net debt to ebitda is under 0 7 turns and we continue to improve our leverage profile with net debt decreasing by 267 million or 5 quarter over quarter these debt reduction efforts have helped decrease our interest expense by 25 year over year offsetting higher production taxes and lifting costs and helping push our unhedged realized cash margin this quarter to more than 83 a company record moving to the operations side of the business the environment in the permian continues to be challenged however we continue to focus on how we can mitigate the inflationary pressures we are seeing across nearly all facets of the business by lowering the variable pieces of our cost structure these efforts have allowed us to keep the high end of our capital guidance range flat at 1 9 billion and we do not anticipate any future changes yet we still haven t been able to offset all of the fixed pricing increases we ve seen which is why we ve moved up our third quarter capital range to 470 million to 510 million up from our capital spend of 468 million this quarter this takes into account the roughly 10 cost increase we expect on the frac side which is made up of increases in the cost of horsepower wireline services and fuel on the drilling side of the business we re seeing a similar level of pricing increases particularly from day rates casing and cement in the back half of this year we plan to operate approximately 12 drilling rigs and three frac crews as we mentioned last quarter we ve partnered with halliburton to secure our first e fleet frac core which will run in our martin county acreage off power generated from a central location and delivered via existing lines not only reducing our scope 1 emissions profile but also lowering our completion costs as a result of fuel savings and improved operational efficiency we expect this fleet to be operational early in the fourth quarter and it will simply be swapped in for one of our existing halliburton crews earlier this month we continue to lean into this technology and secured our second e fleet core this crew will be operational in the first quarter of 2023 and is expected to further reduce costs and decrease our environmental footprint it will also replace one of our existing crews on the drilling side we currently have one drilling rig running off line power in the delaware basin with two more electric rigs expected in 2023 just as we re seeing on the completion side the electrification of our drilling fleet has multiple benefits additionally we re utilizing spotter and intermediate rigs to take advantage of lower pricing as compared to the rest of our drilling fleet and are exploring downsizing surface casing size intermediate whole size to improve our drilling efficiencies pushing diamondback even further down the cost curve lastly we continue to work to earn our social and environmental license to operate part of this is our commitment to provide quarterly disclosures that detail our progress toward our environmental goals we are proud of how we have performed so far this year we re looking at multiple metrics including recycling nearly 40 of our produce water and keeping our total recordable incident level at multi year lows however flaring continues to be an issue we re diligently working with our gallery partners to build in redundancy accelerate plant turnarounds and meet the takeaway needs of our current development plan we remain committed to ending routine flaring by 2025 and are confident in our ability to achieve that goal we ve also spent hundreds of millions of dollars to lower our emissions profile by building pipelines and electrifying our production fields these projects have lowered our costs to date but due to the increase in the cost of power across the state of texas we had to move our lease operating expense guidance range up by 0 50 a barrel at 4 50 to 5 a barrel even with this move we continue to be the low cost permian operator and build on a long track record of cost control the second quarter was a record quarter for the company we delivered on our production guidance kept costs in line and distributed over 63 of our free cash flow to our shareholders we re well positioned to build off this momentum and are excited to begin returning at least 75 of our free cash flow to our shareholders this quarter we expect this industry leading cash returns program and our best in class operational machine to continue to deliver differentiated results for our shareholders with these comments now complete operator please open the line for questions questions answers operator and our first question comes from neal dingmann from truist your line is now open neal dingmann truist securities analyst morning guys my first question is somewhat on shareholder return specifically i think on your conference call a year ago i looked and travis i think you stated that as you looked at back then at supply and demand fundamentals you said i think suggests that oil supply was still purposely being withheld from the market driving your cull to not grow production so i m wonder when you look at today do you still believe that s the overall case of worldwide fundamentals or specifically supply and does that still drive is that you re still your primary decision that your primary driver of your decision for the nil growth or is this more based on investor request travis stice chairman and chief executive officer well certainly neal as we look into 2023 i think it s a little premature to do much forecasting into 2023 but i can tell you kind of our base case is looking at something at the same activity level probably generating something in the low single digits in terms of the growth rate but again it s more of an output but i think what you specifically asked about the call last year i think i highlighted really three things and then subsequently added a fourth and that was demand in pre covid levels wanted to see five year inventory levels somewhere returning to the five year average we still had a question about opec capacity and the one i added subsequent to our call was the administration continuing to embed uncertainty into our capital allocation process across the industry and so certainly three of the four those have been answered today neal there s still a lot of administration led uncertainty both in policy actions and in rhetoric but the other ones certainly appear to be answered so i think as the industry starts to pivot toward more focus on 2023 i think you ll still be governed primarily by the shareholders who own the companies but i do think you ll start to see a little bit of growth in the industry as we look into next year neal dingmann truist securities analyst great great response then my second question really i would say is on the notable capital spend discipline that you guys continue to have as many others we ve already heard about continue to increase their cost despite them previously saying that they were locked in so i m just wondering going forward would you all consider any type of i don t know like a vertical more vertical integration or any other new strategy while the focus remain more or less on the same as working with vendors and just the efficient execution travis stice chairman and chief executive officer well neal i think we ve been pretty successful with the existing model we ll always look at we ll always look and see what ways we can ensure lower execution cost we were a little bit flummoxed in the first quarter with all the commentary about locked in prices and then subsequently followed with capex raises and that s just not the way that we ve typically tried to communicate what our execution focus is but i do want to i know have a lot of employees listening in the call this morning and look i want to give a shoutout to organization for our ability to continue to manage cost in an inflationary environment again about a year ago neal we were talking about how you separate winners and losers in an inflationary environment it s always those that can control costs and while we ve taken our looks on the fixed cost side of the ledger we ve done a really remarkable job on the variable cost and i look for our organization to continue to lean into that in 2023 neal dingmann truist securities analyst very good thank you so much travis stice chairman and chief executive officer thanks neal operator thank you and one moment for our next question and our next question comes from neil mehta from goldman sachs your line is now open neil mehta goldman sachs analyst yeah good morning travis team first question is around capital returns and you did increase the share repurchase authorization to 4 billion from 2 billion previously it looks like you ve been leaning a little bit more into the repurchase with the pullback in the stock if you can just talk about your framework around variable dividend versus repurchases and how you re thinking about being countercyclical with how you deploy your share repurchases travis stice chairman and chief executive officer well we certainly think that there s a lot of value in our existing stock price and we think that oil and public equity stocks is really undervalued right now and so the two data points that you mentioned i think are good indicators of future behaviors the first being we spent about 500 million in the last two or three months repurchasing shares and the board just essentially doubled our authorization up to 4 billion so the base dividend still remains sacred sustainable and growing followed by in this environment share repurchases and as we ve committed to a month ago we ll make up the difference and keep our shareholders whole by returning at least 75 in free cash flow neil mehta goldman sachs analyst yeah thanks travis and then we love your perspective on the m a outlook we know that you ve been active over the last couple of years but is it fair to assume that given that you re prioritizing share repurchases at this point you think that s a better investment than that third party m a thank you travis stice chairman and chief executive officer yeah certainly neal that s the behavior we re demonstrating and as i just iterated just to emphasize oil in the public markets is really cheaper than the private markets and i think there continues to be a wide gap between those two points and i think you re also seeing stalled or failed processes as well which again indicates a spread between bid and ask so right now the greatest return for our shareholders is leaning into our repurchase program neil mehta goldman sachs analyst thank you sir operator thank you and one moment for our next question and our next question comes from arun jayaram from jpmorgan securities your line is now open arun jayaram j p morgan analyst yeah good morning travis and team maybe just a follow up to neal s question is how do you think about your process to engage in portfolio renewal in this kind of backdrop and perhaps a little bit more color it looks like you had about 85 million of property acquisitions in the cash flow statement i was wondering if you could provide us a little bit of detail on that and i think on a year to date basis that takes you just under 400 million of property acquisitions kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer yeah yeah arun the big deal is i think one 230 million deal we do capitalize a little g a and interest which flows through that number so it s not all property acquisitions but there s a couple of things that we do on the property side is just the typical blocking and tackling letting up we give our land teams the directive that we d rather drill 100 working interest wells across the board and so they re always working to send that up and block and tackle that but nothing of significance purchased in q2 travis stice chairman and chief executive officer and look arun being having boots on the ground here in midland i think all of our shareholders expect me and us to be in the deal flow at all times but that just means we look at things coming across the desk but i go back to say look at what our behaviors are and the separation between public and private expectations on value and that s i think that s the best way to think about what our forward plans are arun jayaram j p morgan analyst ok and just my follow up is you guys had really really strong oil price realizations in the quarter so i just wondered if you could just remind us about your mix between getting waterborne crude pricing versus call it a midland type of benchmark kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer yes so we have all of our oil and pipes go into the gulf coast a third of it going to houston and getting meh pricing two thirds going to corpus getting brent pricing and so we ve been the beneficiary of this water brent wti spread we have a little bit of exposure to the midland market we also have the ability to kind of flex that to the gulf coast with the space that we have and so the sell off in wti versus brent has resulted in really good oil realizations no guarantees that it s going to continue forever but that kind of fits the insurance policy that we ve put in place to invest in these pipelines and get our barrels to the most liquid markets arun jayaram j p morgan analyst great thanks guys kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer thank arun operator thank you and one moment for our next question and our next question comes from scott hanold from rbc capital markets your line is now open scott hanold rbc capital markets analyst hey thanks could you all give us some view on what you all are seeing on leading edge inflation and if you can give us a sense of what kind of savings you guys expect from the e fracs versus a regular frac or i mean how meaningful is that kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer yes scott good question i would say generally we took out capex on the low end and took up our average well cost estimate for the year i would say probably today we re probably up 15 today from the beginning of the year we ll probably exit a little higher than that so probably 15 year over year well cost increases but what the ops team is doing is not taking every phone call and just increasing prices we re trying to do some things to be more efficient you mentioned the e fleet travis just mentioned in his opening remarks that we re going to have a second e fleet coming in early next year that saves money not just on the horsepower piece but on the fuel piece these would be connected to two line power and the back end of a gas plant with burning dry gas in the permian so while gas prices have gone up they certainly haven t gone up as much as diesel i would say we probably save 50 ish a foot with that 50 a foot with that e fleet a couple of other things we are doing on top of that we are adding some preset rigs to replace some big rigs as those preset rigs cost a lot less with these big pads and long cycle investments we have that ability to do so teams also getting really smart on casing design cement design wherever we can pick up pennies that s just our stock and trade scott hanold rbc capital markets analyst a lot of pennies you re picking up good to hear that and to follow up and i m going to kind of belabor the point on shareholder returns and i know you all have done pretty well with executing your flexible plan but the bottom line is right now it appears that your stock is trading at a discount to peers meaning it looks pretty evident and like how do you all think about like what the best way to bridge that gap is in like what can you do to kind of force the issue to get your valuation more in line with peers or where you think it should be travis stice chairman and chief executive officer scott when i talk to our board and communicate what i think the success indicators are there s really five three of them were foundational that led us to success in the first 10 years and i think the two that i ve added are going to be foundational for the next 10 years but the three that we built the company on are execution low cost operations and transparency and we ve been very successful in differentiating ourselves with those the two that have recently been added are capital return and decarbonization and on the capital return we re now our yields is peer leading we re competitive on all forms of shareholder return measures and the last one is decarbonization in not only our disclosure but also in our performance and look those are the five things that we excel at and you can ask us questions about any one of those five and we can articulate chapter and verse why those are successful why we re successful with those and while you pointed out a dislocation in stock we believe fundamentally that we continue to do the right thing for our shareholders to generate the greatest value and it and we believe we re running this company not just for the quarter but for the next 10 years and longer scott hanold rbc capital markets analyst appreciate the color thank you operator and thank you and one moment for our next question and our next question comes from david deckelbaum from cowen your line is now open david deckelbaum cowen and company analyst thanks travis kaes and team appreciate the color too maybe if i could ask one on just capex in 2022 i think you all forecast that about 12 of your total budget going toward non d c is that a good contribution as we think about 23 and 24 kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer well good question david i think generally if you look at our past history we kind of whenever a deal happens the next year infrastructure midstream is 10 to 15 getting down to kind of 7 to 8 of total capital in the out years i certainly expect us to be closer to 78 of total capital in 2024 with a step down next year in 2023 i think the only the only wrinkle is we are all us and our peers are all spending a lot of money on environmental cleanup and so that s probably 30 million to 40 extra million a year that wasn t in the budget in 2017 and 2018 it s necessary dollars but generally i d expect our midstream infrastructure budgets to come down next year and into 24 probably a step change down to 7 or 8 a couple of years david deckelbaum cowen and company analyst thanks for that kaes and then maybe just as a follow up obviously the 3q capex 4q capex is going to be is going to follow with activity with 3q being higher than 4q as we think about next year though i think the expectation is that you guys would still be in that sort of 270 290 wells 12 rigs a few frac crews is that 460 million or so implied guide for 4q is that 460 to 4 500 million range like a reasonable run rate to think about 23 or are there explicit reasons why you would want us to be guided away from that kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer yeah i mean i think it s just too early to talk about 23 inflation i m certainly kind of in the camp that we re not willing to continue to concede margin expansion on the service side perpetually so we re going to see where things shake out over the next six months like we said earlier in the call there are some things we are doing to increase efficiency and lower costs i would just say generally i think you re right on activity going into 2023 i can t i m not going to comment yet on service prices and where things head particularly with some of the stuff that s out of our control like steel continuing to go up in price david deckelbaum cowen and company analyst i appreciate it guys the only inflation i m baking in is capex per share so thanks for the color kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer it s a good new metric now operator thank you and one moment for our next question and our next question comes from derrick whitfield from stifel your line is now open derrick whitfield stifel financial corp analyst good morning all and congrats on your quarter end update with my first question i wanted to focus on your operational efficiency would it be safe to assume the improvement you experienced in your drilling and completion efficiency metrics over the last couple of years has at least plateaued as a result of service tightness and the dilution of experienced crews kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer yeah derrick i think that s a fair statement certainly the business has got a lot harder to operate and execute this year we know it s on us though to make sure we have the right supervision in the field to make sure green hands are trained up quickly it s something that we are seeing we do spend a lot of money near the wellhead to make sure our supervision oversees what s going on in the field but then there s a couple of other things that kind of go the other way right so these spud rigs that we re putting in place they drill a little slower but they cost half as much as the big rigs so i think generally we kind of hit the efficient frontier on days td this year but now we re getting some things that might slow things down but spend less money per well derrick whitfield stifel financial corp analyst that makes complete sense and as my follow up i wanted to touch on the inflation reduction act which could be voted on this week focusing on the minimum tax and methane fee components could you speak to the implications for diamondback and the industry in general it seems at a minimum from our perspective that the one bear case against diamondback would be minimized with the 15 minimum tax stipulation travis stice chairman and chief executive officer derrick the methane fee tax is one thing that we ve looked at and because of the dollars we ve spent over the last three years really reducing our methane emissions that doesn t appear as we understand it to be to be a needle mover for diamondback kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer yeah and then on the on the tax side we re pretty low on nol protection so if the strip holds we have about 1 000 000 000 of protection next year we would be above the 15 minimum that s being proposed so i think generally moving toward a full tax paying entity at diamondback mitigate the impact to us certainly if we were in a different commodity price environment it might be a different story but in this environment we re headed toward full cash taxes in 2024 derrick whitfield stifel financial corp analyst great update and thanks for your time travis stice chairman and chief executive officer thanks derrick operator thank you and one moment for our next question and our next question comes from jeanine wai from barclays your line is now open jeanine wai barclays analyst hi good morning everyone thanks for taking our questions travis stice chairman and chief executive officer good morning jeanine jeanine wai barclays analyst good morning travis thanks for the time today our first question is maybe hitting on the balance sheet a little bit saying had about 21 million of stand alone cash at the end of the quarter and that reflects really getting after paying off those notes early and at a very nice discount which is great what s the sequencing of further debt reduction that you mentioned and do you have an updated view on your target cash balance where essentially it s kind of back in the how much potential upside there could be to exceeding the 75 minimum return kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer yeah jeanine good question with the rattler deal expected to close at the end of august we ll have pay off that revolver at close it s about 200 million revolver that we ll expect to pay with down with cash we also want to take out the rattler notes 500 million notes next there are some reporting requirements with those notes if they continue to stay out there so i think those two items are certainly the priorities and we probably expect to be in a position to have those taken out by the next time we re on the phone here and then i think after that it goes back to being selective with the other outstanding notes you ll note that we did not touch the 30 year the two 30 year tranches that we have out there but we did take down some of our 29s and 31s opportunistically with a discount but generally the rattler notes and rattler revolver is coming up next and then we ll be in a more prudent with the rest jeanine wai barclays analyst ok great and then maybe a quick one on operations i think in the past you mentioned running three simul crews and then potentially utilizing a spot crew and then in your prepared remarks i think i heard you mentioned just running three frac crews so just wondering if i m remembering those two things correctly and have you been able to maybe drop that spot crews due to efficiencies thank you kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer so the three simul frac crews are going to run consistently throughout the whole year and those three have been going this year and they ll be the baseline for next year we did have a spot crew running the part of q2 spot crew again so probably the end of this year we try to string together enough pads to make that spot crew cost competitive and i don t know danny do you want to add anything on the spot crew danny wesson chief operating officer no i think the three simul frac crews will do about 80 to 90 of our planned well activity and then the remaining 10 to20 we have to we have to handle with an additional crew we usually try to block it up and get a dedicated line of work for our crew for a period of time and then let it go and bring it back for the next group of wells jeanine wai barclays analyst ok thank you travis stice chairman and chief executive officer thanks jeanine operator thank you and one moment for our next question and our next question comes from nicholas pope from seaport research your line is now open nicholas pope seaport global holdings analyst morning everyone kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer good morning travis stice chairman and chief executive officer good morning nick nicholas pope seaport global holdings analyst i had a quick question on kind of the updated capex guidance most the increase was all on the drilling side without much kind of change in kind of expected activity but no real change in the other components the midstream environmental infra infrastructure components so it s kind of curious are you what kind of inflation you re seeing on there are you expecting kind of the same amount of activity on those non drilling non completion components or is that just a little bit more fixed with project type work kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer yeah it s definitely a little more fixed with project type work there is some inflation in those budgets but that was already somewhat baked in on the midstream side in particular the big bulk item is buying a lot of pipe and we pre bought a lot of that so we knew where that was going to sit on the cost side on the infrastructure and environmental side it s not necessarily a change in plan as you mentioned it s just a few inflationary items around the edges but it s nothing to the extent of what we re seeing on the drilling inflation side when it comes to inflation nicholas pope seaport global holdings analyst got it appreciate that and as you kind of look at kind of progressing toward completion of the midstream the rattler kind of acquisition is there an anticipation of any real change in operations or i guess how much kind of third party is even a part of rattler at this point in terms of operations kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer yeah that s a great question that s a great question too nothing is going to change operationally we still we still like the midstream business we still like what it does for our consolidated margins we just felt that it didn t need to be a separate public entity and so we re able to buy that back in and still run a midstream business that we own 100 i will say the team has done a good job seeing seeking out third party opportunities i wouldn t say it s our core business but we ll have some real cash flow coming up coming in from third parties given the amount of assets we have on the ground on the midstream side nicholas pope seaport global holdings analyst got it i appreciate that color i ll let you guys go thanks a lot operator thank you and one moment for our next question and our next question comes from doug leggate from bank of america your line is now open doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks good morning everybody travis i hate to go back to ask a return question but you issued a bunch of shares i m just wondering how we should think about the split between the variable and the step up in the buyback program travis stice chairman and chief executive officer yeah doug you re a little mixed there i couldn t hear you too well but i think i got the gist of it i think generally we are going to be very aggressive on the buybacks here in q3 given where the stock is and where we continue to generate free cash flow above midcycle prices so we already spent 200 million quarter to date generally if you kind of take street numbers and keep our base dividend flat in q3 we could probably spend another 650 million on buybacks this quarter so if the stock stays where it is and the oil stays where it is we re going to be very very aggressive on that buyback which is why the board signified the confidence in increasing that authorization to 4 billion doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok so sorry to press on this point travis and i apologize for my line but is there a more formulaic way we can think about i mean are we still looking at a substantial variable in the second half of this year travis stice chairman and chief executive officer not in these prices doug if the stock price stays where it is today all that cash is going to go toward reducing the share count doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst great that s what i was looking for my follow up just a quick one and going to the emp very quickly can you clarify as your understanding is today do idcs and i guess nol is not such a big deal for you guys but an idc specifically do they qualify as an offset to the emp in your view any color you can offer and your during your interpretation of that kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer i think our interpretation is they still do unfortunately idcs have become such a small part of the cash flow stream that they re not impacting things much so that s our understanding today but you never know with politicians anything can happen doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst great well i appreciate the clarity on the cash tax guidance thanks so much travis stice chairman and chief executive officer yes thanks doug operator thank you and one moment for our next question and our next question comes from david deckelbaum from cowen your line is now open david deckelbaum cowen and company analyst thanks for letting me back in the room guys i wanted to ask just to follow up on some of the thoughts around return on capital travis you talked about conversations with the board how to make diamondback competitive relative to its peers you ve seen the evolution of what you guys had promised last year 50 of 2022 s free cash return to shareholders the rest retiring debt you increased that to 75 you just increased the buyback i guess when you talk to the board now about the return on capital programs are there explicit targets that you re thinking about when you re putting out an outline around the buyback and how did you come to this amount are you trying to intentionally show that diamondback can retire 10 of its market cap plus every year is that are those explicit goals now or are these more coincidental based on where the free cash is today travis stice chairman and chief executive officer yes those are we don t have specific goals that are articulated in the way you just ask that question we simply look at the value that we believe the inherent value of the stock versus where it s trading at and we want to demonstratively move into repurchases where we think there s a big location like we see in today s market and as we go forward in time maybe that changes but as it sits today as kaes just outlined with the previous caller we believe that there s still a lot of value in the stock david deckelbaum cowen and company analyst thank you guys that s all i had operator thank you one moment for our next question and our next question comes from vin lovaglio from mizuho group your line is now open vin lovaglio mizuho securities analyst yeah thanks for getting me on guys given the scale of free cash flow generation i m wondering how you guys are thinking about potential investment in future offtake particularly on the gas side and kind of connecting that gas molecule to the gulf coast and ultimately hopefully international markets kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer yeah vin good question i think just generally well we are a pretty significant gas producer now at this point we don t have a lot of control over the molecule diamondback has gone through acquisition over the years and with those acquisitions come dedications and most of those dedications don t come with taking time right so we re certainly doing as much as we possibly can to incentivize pipeline development getting molecules to the gulf coast we did commit to the whistler pipeline we ll have about a third of our gas on that but generally you have to have control that molecule to incentivize development and we don t have much more beyond that today vin lovaglio mizuho securities analyst got it and then i just want to go back to the e fleets they seem like kind of a no brainer at this point in time i m just wondering if there were any changes in planning or any hurdles that you guys kind of have to get through before broader e fleet adoption or is it really just kind of securing that line power kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer well it s really about the quality of the fleet and what you re signing up for i think what halliburton has put together is truly a unique product we re going to have some form of battery storage attached to that e fleet so that you re very efficient with the use of natural gas and electricity when that fleet is working so you do need a pretty big acreage block you need large pads like we have ahead of us and you need a long term commitment with a a business partner like halliburton so i think that we checked all those boxes and we feel very good about the e fleet that s coming on in september so good that we signed up for a second one so two thirds of our simul frac fleets will be e fleets with halliburton and like you said it s pretty obvious when the economic and environmental advantages sync up that s a no brainer for us and we re looking forward to getting our first one in the field here in a month vin lovaglio mizuho securities analyst thanks guys appreciate the time kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer thank you vin operator thank you and one moment for our next question and our next question comes from leo mariani from mkm partners your line is now open leo mariani mkm partners analyst i just wanted to clarify a couple of things that i heard on the call here so in terms of the buyback i just wanted to make sure i heard the numbers right did you guys say that you could do an additional 650 million in 3q alone on top of the 200 million you already announced kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer yeah i m taking leo i m taking street numbers and multiplying it by 75 taking out the 200 million we spent quarter to date and taking out the 0 75 a share based dividend and that s your max on buybacks for the quarter and that s something we look at every day i mean we have our team rerun the model on a weekly basis to figure out how much cash we re going to have in the quarter to buyback buyback shares when there s this much of a dislocation between oil in the public markets and oil in the ground leo mariani mkm partners analyst ok that s helpful and then just on the debt paydown obviously you talked about paying off some of the rattler debt here can you maybe just give us a little more color on the decision to kind of pay off some of the fang debt which wasn t kind of due to the end of the decade i guess some of the 29 30s or whatnot in the second quarter it looks like you kind of elected to do that versus kind of pay the higher variable dividend because obviously cash flows were up for the quarter any more color kind of around the thinking there kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer yeah it s a pretty unique opportunity where an emp has a ton of cash flow and oil is trading below par and we saw that opportunity our board saw it with us and decided that buying back some debt well below par was a good use of capital and also accelerates that deleveraging process to give us more confidence in the increased 75 of free cash flow going back to shareholders beginning in q3 leo mariani mkm partners analyst ok and just to clarify on the shareholder returns you guys do not count debt paydown as a shareholder return right travis stice chairman and chief executive officer that s correct leo mariani mkm partners analyst ok thanks travis stice chairman and chief executive officer thank you leo operator thank you and one moment for our next question and our next question comes from paul cheng from scotiabank your line is now open paul cheng scotiabank analyst thank you hi good morning travis two questions please can you just remind us what is your hedging policy your bet in official guidance in terms of what percentage that you want to hedge secondly that with the rising recession fear how that impact your foresight in the 2023 budget in terms of their capital return balance sheet management and all that thank you kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer yeah good questions paul i ll take the hedging policy and i ll let travis talk more macro about 2023 just generally we do buy puts for a rainy day so we ve gone to the balance sheet to strengthen we bought more and more puts around 50 to 55 brent in that situation if we do go below 55 brent we ll probably making capital decisions to slow down but the balance sheet doesn t blow out we can still pay our dividend and still generate free cash in that situation so really protecting for a rainy day trying to spend around a 1 50 to 2 a barrel to buy those puts and we want to be about 60 hedged going into a particular quarter so if you look at our hedge book about 60 hedged for q3 going down to about 0 by q2 q3 of 2023 and we ll just continue to keep rolling that for rainy day insurance travis stice chairman and chief executive officer and paul energy has typically been a pretty good hedge bet offset historically and as you look into 2023 regardless of how you define a recession it looks like there will be recessionary impacts across our economy but what s a little bit different this time is that the world today still appears to be chronically short physical barrels with not a lot of spare capacity to fill that gap and so while we don t necessarily plan on anything other than in the future than our mid cycle price deck it looks to me like the macros the macro looks pretty positive for energy prices over the next couple of years even in spite of what i know will be a recessionary impact and look if you do see some recessionary impacts it ll probably soften some of the inflationary pressures we re seeing today kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer yeah i think we want one more point that s the benefit of this new business model where we re not changing our plans for every 10 20 30 move in oil price there needs to be a 50 move in oil price lower before we discuss any change to our execution plan and i think this level loaded plan level loaded activity levels has allowed us to fight off the inflation bug a little better than most and again as travis mentioned there s there s no oil out there paul cheng scotiabank analyst i m just curious that you gentlemen want to keep more cash balance if that s the increasing recession fear kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer yeah i kind of throw cash we certainly want the cash balance the cash balance needs a lot right now when you re generating 1 000 000 000 of revenue a month the cash balance fluctuates wildly throughout each month i think generally having a strong balance sheet having some cash and having access to capital through a cycle is something obviously the board discuss on a monthly basis and i think that also ties to where your maturity profile fits right so if we not only have less debt but a longer duration maturity profile that gives us confidence in our access to capital and our ability to generate cash given that our cash flow breakeven is down in the mid 30s a barrel paul cheng scotiabank analyst perfect thank you kaes van t hof president and chief financial officer thanks paul operator and thank you and i am showing no further questions i would now like to turn the call back over to travis stice ceo for closing remarks travis stice chairman and chief executive officer thank

do you believe in fairy tales if so you could probably earn good money nowadays as a financial trader or gain power and prestige as a central banker while annual inflation in the united states the eurozone and the united kingdom has soared to 40 year highs and will probably hit double digits after the summer financial markets and central banks seem confident that the war against surging prices will be over by christmas and that interest rates will start falling by next spring if this happens the world economy will soon return to the financially perfect conditions of the goldilocks fairy tale that has entranced investors for the past decade neither too hot nor too cold and always just right for profits investors optimism can be seen in the trillions of dollars staked recently on three closely related market bets money markets are now predicting that us interest rates will peak at below 3 5 in january 2023 and then decline starting from next april to around 2 5 in early 2024 bond markets are priced for us inflation to collapse from 9 1 today to just 2 8 in december 2023 and equity markets assume that the economic slowdown that causes this unprecedented disinflation will be mild enough for us corporate profits to increase by 9 in 2023 from this year s record levels central bankers are more nervous than investors but they are reassured by their economic models which are still based on updated versions of the rational expectations hypothesis that failed so miserably in the 2008 global financial crisis these models assume that expectations of low inflation are the key to maintaining price stability central bankers therefore see well anchored inflation expectations as evidence that their policies are working when central bankers and markets follow each other both are likely to be led astray but this only partly explains financial markets willingness to bet against warnings by eminent commentators such as larry summers mohamed el erian jim o neill and nouriel roubini of a return to 1970s style stagflation i have just spent three months travelling around the world to discuss with hundreds of professional investors why i also have shifted to an unequivocally bearish outlook after a decade of panglossian optimism about financial markets prospects these discussions have convinced me that today s investor confidence rests on four fallacies or at least cognitive biases the first cognitive bias is to downplay and defy geopolitics a view summed up by nathan rothschild s legendary instruction in the napoleonic wars to buy on the sound of cannons professional investors take pride in trading against panicky retail investors who sell their assets because of wars this contrarian approach has often proved right though with one glaring exception the october 1973 war between israel and a coalition of arab states led by egypt and syria permanently transformed the world economy in ways that ruined a generation of overconfident investors they downplayed events that are eerily reminiscent of today an energy shock a surge in inflation after a long period of monetary and fiscal expansion and bewilderment among policymakers who simultaneously faced high inflation and rising unemployment squeezing russia one of the world s largest producers of energy and many other commodities out of global markets has triggered a supply shock that is at least as serious as the 1973 74 arab oil embargo and will last for years restoring price stability will therefore now require a long term demand constraint tough enough to match the commodity supply reduction that implies an increase in us interest rates to 5 6 or 7 instead of the 3 4 peak that investors and central banks now assume yet investors pavlovian reflex is to downplay this geopolitical upheaval and focus instead on small adjustments in us monetary policy this stance reflects a second cognitive bias summarised in the investment adage the trend is your friend which implies that changes in market moving economic indicators such as inflation unemployment or interest rates are more important than their levels many investors accordingly believe that monetary conditions have become very tight because central banks have raised interest rates in increments of 0 75 percentage points instead of the usual 0 25 percentage points despite the fact that rates are still much lower than in any previous tightening cycle similarly investors seem unperturbed by inflation rising above 9 because they expect it to fall to only 7 by december but businesses and workers in the real economy will still see prices rising at their fastest rate in decades which is bound to drive corporate pricing strategies and pay negotiations for 2023 such a conclusion seems obvious except to financial traders subject to a third cognitive bias don t fight the fed this favourite market saying asserts that once the us central bank gets serious about achieving an objective such as an inflation target investors should always assume that it will get its way this makes sense when the fed is genuinely prepared to do whatever it takes to meet its goals for example by clearly pursuing low inflation regardless of the effect on unemployment stock markets and debt servicing costs but today s fed is so focused on well anchored inflation expectations that it is quite relaxed about backward looking data that continue to show prices rising much faster than most businesses and workers have ever seen that leads to a final bias most people find it difficult to imagine events that have never happened in their lifetimes for many investors and policymakers stubbornly high inflation falls into this category market wisdom expresses this bias with the adage that there are no new eras but new eras do happen as the world learned painfully in 1973 and today s interaction of russia and covid 19 with monetary and fiscal expansion has created unprecedented conditions which guarantee that the period ahead will be very different from the past 40 years the question is whether the new era now dawning will be dominated for the first time in a generation by persistently rapid price growth or whether for the first time in history we will painlessly overcome an inflationary crisis with negative real interest rates and without the collateral damage of a major recession markets and central banks confidently expect a new carefree epoch if they are right we can all live happily ever after project syndicate anatole kaletsky chief economist and co chairman of gavekal

menafn accesswire littleton co accesswire august 2 2022 ur energy inc nyse american urg tsx ure the company or ur energy has filed the company s form 10 q for the quarter ended june 30 2022 with the u s securities and exchange commission at and with canadian securities authorities at ur energy ceo john cash said 2022 has been an exciting year for ur energy thus far with several recent notable developments we have maintained a strong cash position as we continue to build out header house 2 4 and its associated mine production unit which will ultimately accelerate our ability to ramp up to full production when market conditions warrant initial field testing of our patented well installation technology has been successful and will continue into august when we expect to seek final agency approval if testing is completed successfully finally i am happy to report that last week we responded to the department of energy s solicitation to purchase domestically produced uranium to establish a new u s uranium reserve we have held our uranium inventory with the expectation of selling it into the uranium reserve and we are optimistic that we will be selected as a successful bidder we expect to learn the results of the bid process by the end of september financial results as of june 30 2022 we had cash resources consisting of cash and cash equivalents of 43 3 million in addition to our cash position our finished ready to sell conversion facility inventory value is immediately realizable if necessary including to deliver it into the uranium reserve program lost creek operations lost creek continues to operate at reduced production levels which have allowed us to sustain operating cost reductions at lost creek while continuing to conduct preventative maintenance and optimize processes in preparation for ramp up to full production rates an advance development program at lost creek was implemented in late 2021 with the intent to significantly improve our ability to quickly return to production when ramp up occurs specifically we commenced a drilling and construction program to complete the development of the fourth header house in mu2 hh 2 4 the header house and its associated drilling and wellfield development is expected to be complete in 2022 and be ready for production we have ordered all necessary equipment to construct the fifth header house hh 2 5 and the long lead items for the sixth header house in mu2 we are nearly finished with a delineation drill program to assist with further wellfield design within mu2 this includes delineation drilling for hhs 2 4 through 2 9 together with our optimization of plant processes these wellfield programs will significantly advance our readiness and shorten the time frame to production when ramp up occurs the first two mine units at lost creek mu1 and mu2 have all appropriate permits necessary for a return to operations including new production resulting from the ongoing mu2 advance development program when ramp up occurs we have received wyoming uranium recovery program urp approval of the amendment to the lost creek source material license to include recovery from the lc east project hj and km horizons immediately adjacent to the lost creek project and additional hj horizons at the lost creek project currently we await only approval by the wyoming department of environmental quality land quality division lqd of the amendment to the lost creek permit to mine adding hj and km horizons at lc east and hj mine units at lost creek we anticipate the lqd review will be complete in 2022 research and development we are actively engaged in several research and development r d projects with the overall objective to introduce new methods of cost effective technology to our lost creek project and to shirley basin when it is constructed the technologic advances are at varying stages of development although if analyses continue to be successful we anticipate that one or more may be implemented in 2022 the development projects include a new material for injection wells and related well installation process for which a provisional patent has been filed with the u s patent office during 2022 q2 we received wdeq authorization to proceed with field testing the materials and engineering and testing has commenced although the technology will not be used for production wells it will be used for injection wells which generally represent approximately 65 of the wells throughout wellfields designed with traditional five spot recovery patterns in addition to its relatively low cost and availability of materials in the midst of current supply chain challenges the proposed method if proven out is expected to reduce drill rig time on injection wells by about 70 and reduce environmental impacts it is anticipated that the cost savings from reduced drill rig time will be partially offset by the need for additional in house labor casper operations headquarters work continues on the development and construction of our new operations headquarters in casper wyoming which will serve our ongoing and future wyoming operations as well as mineral exploration and development projects we are working with our contractor to advance the completed design work for a multipurpose building which will allow for centralized construction activities as well as housing our shared services chemistry laboratory construction is expected to commence summer 2022 and be complete in approximately seven to nine months the additional facility will allow us to construct header houses for lost creek and when built and operational shirley basin building wiring and automating header houses in casper as well as other construction activities will provide numerous safety environmental and financial advantages to our operations continuing 2022 guidance the surge in interest by investors policy and lawmakers and climate change advocates in all things nuclear continues in 2022 global recognition of nuclear energy s role in achieving net zero carbon emissions continues to be more widely accepted japan several member nations of the european union and the united

energy and the nuclear industry the doe uranium reserve has moved forward in june 2022 department of energy national nuclear security administration issued a solicitation for proposal to purchase qualified domestically produced uranium we have submitted a bid proposal although there can be no assurance that the company will be a successful bidder our existing inventory has been classified as current reflecting our intention to participate in the bidding process the sustained support for nuclear energy has prompted financial funds and uranium etfs to purchase uranium inventories thereby supporting the uranium spot price it has been a year since the sprott physical uranium trust sput began its purchases of uranium sput established the means in the equity markets to raise more than 3 billion for such purchases and now holds more than 57 million pounds u3o8 while others have established the vehicles by which to make substantial purchases of uranium sput remains the most prolific purchaser the rally in uranium spot prices which began in 2021 continues in 2022 with price per pound during the quarter remaining in the upper 40s and lower 50s moreover nuclear utilities and other purchasers are back in the market resulting in some strengthening of term pricing our cash position as of august 1 2022 is 42 2 million in addition to our strong cash position we have nearly 324 000 pounds of finished u s produced u3o8 inventory at the conversion facility worth approximately 15 7 million at recent spot prices our financial position provides us with adequate funds to maintain and enhance operational readiness at lost creek as well as having allowed us to preserve our existing inventory to sell into higher prices to heighten our readiness to return to production operations at lost creek we are advancing preparations in the fully permitted mu2 through a drilling and construction program which is being supplemented by purchases of mid and long lead time items for additional development in mu2 when the advance work is complete lost creek operations can increase to full production rates in as little as six months following a go decision we continue to diligently work to optimize processes and refine production plans supported by our experienced lost creek operational staff who stand ready to expand lost creek wellfield production to an annualized run rate of up to 1

mine units followed by the ten additional mining areas as defined in the lost creek technical report summary march 7 2022 the lost creek facility now has the constructed and licensed capacity to

by chris black reanimated corpse pelosi becomes highest ranked us official to visit taiwan just like with the ukraine russia situation taiwan is part of the chinese empire for hundreds of years its population is 99 ethnic chinese and most importantly the country is thousands of miles away from the us which makes logistics in case of china invades quasi impossible basically you cannot fight china on its own turf short of using nuclear weapons the chinese army in 2022 is not the chinese army in the nineties any military expert can tell you that the chinese military is incapable of being used offensively it is specifically designed to quickly repel a us attack on its soil or immediate surroundings so the us engaging china in the south china sea means attacking them where they are the strongest they will sink every aircraft carrier to the bottom of the ocean no the u s cannot defend taiwan end your delusions please pic twitter com ureekvduim jordan schachtel dossier substack com jordanschachtel august 2 2022 also what the media doesn t tell you is that a big chunk of the taiwanese population wants reunification with china the same thing is basically happening with ukraine with eastern ukraine being basically 90 ethnic russian and looking to reunify with russia these people are lying to you on purpose in the most absurd possible ways telling you that taiwan is somehow a separate country than china i m not really surprised that nancy didn t announce the taiwan visit and then went anyway or at least i shouldn t be surprised this is a joke government this administration and dems are worried about drag shows and pronouns with our military and then this drunk goes and screws around with china we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us we own this however as anyone who voted for this drunk is crazy we need term limits stop congress trading in stocks address post service lobbying stop family lobbying hunter etc committee positions in congress also need to be addressed sorry but nancy can t sit on that committee for 20 years and rino s and dems can t be allowed to own committee appointments like they do today none of this will really happen though we can t even get accurate fair elections the people who run the usa regime have enjoyed world hegemony since 1989 which means they consider every corner of the globe within their sphere of influence which is hypocritically a concept officially rejected by nato ukraine is to russia as mexico is to usa and puerto rico is to usa as taiwan is to china usa wouldn t like russian or chinese activity in puerto rico or mexico for the same reason russia china don t like usa right up in their shit the difference is the people who run the usa regime still think of themselves as global hegemon in a unipolar world russia calling nato s bluff is an indication the people who run usa are losing their world hegemonic status and we are transitioning to a multipolar world nancy pelosi is trying to assert that old unipolar energy and say not so fast bottom line if they really wanted to send nancy to invade they could have just announced it instead they refused to announce it then sent her jet on a bizarre course flying all the way around the philippines for no reason i ve never seen anything remotely similar to this situation these people just invent new confounding behavior patterns daily no good no good
autonomous trucking company tusimple used its second quarter earnings call to address an april crash during which one of the company s autonomous trucks suddenly veered across the i 10 highway in tuscon slamming into a concrete barricade the crash first came to light via a youtube video that showed footage of the crash along with a letter from the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa dated may 26 alerting tusimple to a safety compliance investigation the accident was later reported on by the wall street journal an error occurred when a test driver and safety engineer tried to reenter autonomous driving mode before the system computer was primed to do so and the truck swerved making contact with the highway barrier said xiaodi hou tusimple co founder and ceo during tuesday s earnings call no one was hurt and the only evidence of the accident are a few scrapes and some minor damages on our truck hou noted that in the past seven years tusimple had accumulated 8 1 million miles of road testing with precisely one incident when the incident happened on april 6 tusimple grounded the entire fleet and began an independent investigation said hou after determining the cause of the error the company then upgraded all of its systems with an overhaul of its human machine interface to make sure the same problem would never happen again the executive continued that internal report which was reviewed by wsj revealed that the truck abruptly swerved left due to an outdated command which was 2 5 minutes old and should have been erased from the system but wasn t researchers at carnegie mellon university told wsj that common safeguards had they been in place would have prevented the crash for example the truck shouldn t be responding to a command that s even a couple hundredths of a second old let alone more than two minutes old the system also shouldn t be able to turn so sharply while traveling at 65 miles per hour nor should a safety driver be able to engage a self driving system that s not properly functioning the national highway traffic safety administration has since joined the fmcsa s investigation into the tusimple highway crash hou said that the two agencies have yet to find any anomalies in their investigation or give tusimple any safety recommendations but the investigation is not yet complete during the earnings call tusimple repeated its plans to commercialize driver out operations in which no human safety operator is present in the vehicle the company first completed a driver out demonstration along an 80 mile stretch in arizona in december and has completed several more runs since tusimple said the crash wouldn t affect its plans to begin driver out operations for union pacific railroad but it s unclear if the company is even on schedule for that at present tusimple was meant to launch fully autonomous freight hauling for union pacific in the spring of this year and scale to commercial viability by the end of 2023 but hou said the company has encountered a complete road closure in front of the distribution center at its destination point which has delayed the run by a couple of weeks he also reiterated that the company s deadline for driver out in texas is set for 2023 but did not specify if those will be initial test runs or fully commercial operations tusimple did not respond in time for requests for clarification tusimple q2 financials tusimple s total revenue was 2 6 million in the second quarter which is up 73 year over year and 13 sequentially wall street analysts expected tusimple s revenues to come in at 4 06 million moreover they expected the company to beat those estimates the company attributed its growth such as it was to increased utilization of existing assets and year over year price increases tusimple s net loss came in at 108 6 million versus 116 5 million in the same quarter of last year the company appears to have slimmed down on total operating expenses which came in at 107 5 million this quarter versus 119 4 million last year however r d spending was up 13 year over year at 85 5 million tusimple said the largest portion of r d expense was 60 8 million related to hiring including a stock based compensation expense of 22 4 million that said sales general and administrative spend was significantly lower than last year to prepare for driver out operations and to expand its autonomous freight network tusimple invested a total of 3 8 million in purchases of property and equipment the company ended the quarter with 1 16 billion in cash updated full year guidance tusimple s updated guidance on 2022 revenue remained unchanged at 9 million to 11 million generally the company intends to spend less and therefore lose less money this year tusimple s adjusted ebitda loss for the year is now expected to be between 360 million and 380 million versus previous guidance of 400 million to 420 million in addition tusimple will spend less on stock based compensation attributable to a hiring slowdown as well as purchases of property and equipment the company is hoping to end the year with 950 million in cash versus previous guidance of 900 million executive shakeups hou touched on some key leadership changes that had been announced in june including chief financial officer patrick dillon leaving the company to be temporarily replaced by eric tapia tusimple s global controller and principal accounting officer in addition dr ersin yumer previously head of tusimple s autonomous freight network was promoted to evp of operations and dr lei wang was promoted to evp of technology both were promoted to support tusimple s driver out operations worth noting it s worth noting that tusimple would not address a question about the company s tentative plans to sell off its china operations something that was touched on during the first quarter earnings call at the time tusimple told techcrunch that the company s stock price today doesn t reflect the value of the china autonomous freight business so it would be a good idea to split off apac operations a perusal through the company s 10 q revealed tusimple is more likely looking to sell its china operations because it s too expensive to keep it going given the national security agreement the company agreed to as part of a review by the committee on foreign investment in the united states tapia tusimple s interim cfo also shared that the company is in the process of upgrading most of its older trucks to its newest av hardware technology a process which will continue through 2023 and will involve adding upgraded sensors to the vehicles while we plan to introduce some new trucks into the fleet our ability to add a significant number of trucks is difficult given the challenges in purchasing new or even slightly used trucks said tapia lastly we plan to continue to invest in adding terminals to the primarily around the texas triangle our intention is to do this in a capital light manner partnering when possible in 2020 tusimple partnered with navistar to build fully autonomous trucks and has previously set a deadline to begin manufacturing by 2024 and deliver to certain customers like dhl by 2025 hou and tapia dodged one analyst s repeated attempts to get clarity on this timeline
